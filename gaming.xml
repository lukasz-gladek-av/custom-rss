			<p>When Larian Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">announced Divinity</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, players couldn't be more excited for the studio that brought them Baldur's Gate 3 to return to the other fantasy RPG series under its belt, which is actually bigger than Baldur's Gate. Days later, Larian is embroiled in controversy after its chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, admitted that the studio uses generative AI technology in its development pipeline.</p>



<p>Vincke has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">responded to the first wave of backlash that has hit him and the studio with criticism</a> for using GenAI, though the blunt nature of his response has done anything but quell the backlash he and the studio have received. Amidst all of this, game writers and narrative designers have popped up online to speak out against Larian, not just for its GenAI use, but for what they find to be poor hiring practices.</p>



<p>It's common across several industries that when applying for a job, besides submitting a resume and being the subject of potentially multiple rounds of interviews, you'll be asked to perform a test to show your prospective employer your work on something they've assigned you. If you're a writer applying to a writing position at a game studio, you should probably expect a writing test at some point in the interview process.</p>



<p>But writing tests as a practice are themselves a point of controversy, because writers are sometimes asked to do these tests for free. Usually, if you're being asked to do a writing test for a studio, it's because you're one of the few finalists for a potential role, so it's common for studios to pay those few writers for their time to submit the test. Yes, these people are applying for a job, but no one likes to work for free. Larian, however, according to writers like Zoë Quinn, a game writer who most recently was the lead writer on <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-launch-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-release/">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>, does not offer to pay writers for writing tests.</p>







<p>Quinn spoke out about their experience being recruited by Larian, an avenue they ultimately turned down due to Larian Studios' disallowing remote work and asking for an unpaid writing test that Quinn would also have to make playable.</p>







<p>Bruno Dias, a game writer who has worked on titles like<a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-2-out-may-23rd-pc/"> Pathologic 2</a>, Neo Cab, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-mod-gets-new-rabbit-and-pork-dlc/">Fallout: London</a> chimed in to add "<em>Larian's horrible hiring process is an open secret int he industry - insane amounts of unpaid work in 'writing tests,' excessive numbers of interviews, months and months of back and forth, etc. Everyone in games narrative circles has heard the stories at this point, probably from multiple people</em>."</p>







<p>Julie Muncy, a writer on Interstate 35, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/julie.radiantarray.io/post/3ma4wbovt3s2p">added</a>, <em>"If you see narrative people being meaner about larian than it sounds like they deserve, trust me, we've been waiting for this one</em>," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/julie.radiantarray.io/post/3ma4xg5lazc2p">and</a> "<em>the thing about larian is that i think a lot of us were biting our tongues out of respect for the writers working there and the stuff they did make. but if larian doesn't respect those either, then, like, that incentive disappears</em>."</p>



<p>Cat Manning, a narrative designer at Firaxis, also through their voice to the fire, hinting at a "<em>throughline</em>" between Larian Studios use of generative AI and a misunderstanding of proper hiring practices when it comes to unpaid writing tests.</p>







<p>Other writers, like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/babelfishwars.bsky.social/post/3ma4s6kx3z227">Olivia Wood</a>, spoke up to say that the reason game writers and narrative designers haven't spoken out about these poor practices before is to try not to burn bridges among the narrative and game writer community, since jobs for everyone are scarce.</p>



<p>Wherever you may land on Larian Studios using generative AI, it's clear that the studio's use of the technology and its response to the backlash have only emboldened the studio's critics to be louder. That's not to take anything away from their valid complaints, just a point to say that Larian is not necessarily the industry darling we might've once believed it to be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fresh off its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>Game of the Year</span></a><span> win, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> has a new, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-free-dlc-patch-notes-photo-mode-2000653032"><span>free update</span></a><span> that adds additional levels, upgrades, and boss fights to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-rpgs-2025-clair-obscur-avowed-assassins-creed-2000654194"><span>the RPG</span></a><span>. If it’s been a while since you checked in with Verso, Maelle, and the rest of the expedition, maybe, I dunno, go practice your parrying before you head into the new content, because even the sickos who were already dodging the game’s most elaborate onslaughts are having trouble with these challenging fights.</span></p> <p><span>The “Thank You Update,” as Sandfall Interactive is calling it, includes an Endless Tower, which features revamped boss battles from the base game for an extra challenge. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s late-game boss fights and secret battles were already daunting tasks, and now the game has added a plethora of new fights that are exhausting just to watch. Look at how long this combo goes on in the new Duollistes fight:</span></p>

   <p><span>Some of the update’s challenges come from a seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks, but a lot of its fights are pretty standard </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>fare in that they </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-parry-sakapetate-chromatic-troubadour-1851781507"><span>trick you with multiple fakeout attacks</span></a><span>, baiting you into dodging and parrying before an enemy actually strikes, throwing off your rhythm and leaving you open to attack.</span></p>

   <p><span>Oh, and one boss will just straight up nuke your team. Good luck parrying that one.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> fans are no strangers to challenging boss fights, but some feel that the Thank You Update’s boss run is too much. This account from </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pnn1se/im_officially_done_with_this_update/"><span>Reddit user Maggot_6661</span></a><span> sums it up:</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love this game, truly,” they wrote. “This update is great, but these bosses are too much. Unless I spend a full 9 to 5 learning the reaction times only a robot can reach, I will never beat them. I already have to spend the day searching for a job and going disappointment after disappointment, I’m not mentally strong enough to suffer through these bosses afterwards, all it’s doing is making me not like the game… which is something I don’t want to happen.”</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes walking away from the biggest challenges a game has to offer is the right call. To this day, I’ve never played through some of the secret bosses in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy X</span></i><span>, and I have art from that game tattooed on my arm. I think I’d rather just enjoy the game I played than bang my head against a wall on some of its more challenging fights, so I won’t judge anyone who walks away from </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s Endless Tower. To those of you who do beat them, thank you for your service. “For those who come after.”</span></p>

                <p>For three decades, the Tekken series has brought players together as they control of some of the best fighters in the world. Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/" data-ref-id="5000-572026">Tekken 8</a> tournament.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/92-year-old-grandma-wins-tekken-8-tournament-trophy-in-japanese-senior-citizen-esports-league/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to "create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports." Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cj0XFWPkA8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5cj0XFWPkA8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character. The match between Sakai and Sugiyama can be found two hours and 25 minutes into the video above. Despite the advantage of Sugiyama's relative youth, Sakai appears to have a superior button-mashing technique and enough mastery of the game to execute an effective path to victory.</p><p>Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-is-leaving-bandai-namco-after-30-years-of-iron-fist-tournaments/1100-6536752/" data-ref-id="1100-6536752">recently announced his departure</a> from Bandai Namco after three decades with the company. Harada is not retiring from the video game industry, and his farewell message indicated that he has taken into consideration the "time I have left as a creator."</p><p>Earlier this year, Harada expressed his desire to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-director-is-trying-to-bring-the-game-to-waffle-house-but-to-no-avail/1100-6531496/" data-ref-id="1100-6531496">the Waffle House chain of restaurants into Tekken</a>. There have been several viral videos of fights in Waffle House restaurants that have given the chain a reputation that it probably wants to shy away from. That may be why Waffle House turned down Harada's request.</p>

<p>Oh look, zombies. And in full colou...ah, they're eating me!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Back in the middle of 1999 (a weird time for everyone, rest assured), British developer HotGen attempted something that was considered to be somewhat of an impossible task. Namely, porting the full glory of 32-bit <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> to the dinky little 8-bit Game Boy Color. In the end, not only did these maestros manage to do it, but they did it in a way that, judging by the gameplay vid above, makes for a more than decent stab at the "impossible".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the port was then cancelled and thought lost to time before popping up online in various states throughout the years - though none of these were anywhere near playable from start to finish. That is until now, thanks to <a href="https://x.com/fgasking">Games That Weren't</a> (thanks to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-98-complete-version-of-the-cancelled-game-boy-color-resident-evil-port-has-been-shared-online/?utm_source=onesignal&amp;utm_medium=push">VGC</a> for the heads-up).</p>
<p>Indeed, over on their official social media, the video game preservationists have made a very exciting post revealing a 98% complete version that seems to be fully playable and completable. Hooray!</p>

<p>The above post links to <a href="https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/2025/12/resident-evil/">an excellent article about the entire affair</a> surrounding the game's almost-completion and subsequent cancellation, so do make sure to give it a full read.</p>
<p>One little nugget of note in said article comes from assistant programmer Pete Frith, who recalls that the team were told their game would be cancelled because the creator of Resident Evil (they haven't disclosed exactly who they mean here) "didn’t feel the GBC was worthy of his creation, and that he had personally instructed the cancellation." That's gotta hurt!</p>
<p>Instead of this port, M4's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/resident_evil_gaiden">Resident Evil Gaiden</a>, a completely new game, was greenlit instead.</p>
<p>Frith is also noted as the source of this latest build, and he seems confident, with some added content now in there, that it <em>should</em> be fully completable.</p>


<hr>
<p><em>Who amongst us is brave enough to find out if this latest version of the cancelled Game Boy Color port is fully completable? You sir? Madam? Let us know in the comments!</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/turn-off-the-engine-and-retire-the-car-turn-10-signals-end-of-forza-motorsport-support/</link>
            <guid>1386289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Turn 10 has announced the end of active support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/forza-motorsport-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Motorsport</a>, two years after the game’s release, with no more plans to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or make regular bug fixes.</p>
<p>The game will go into a more basic support mode, so online servers will remain active, there will be special events and competitions in game, but the live service content beyond that will see Featured Tours and reward cars being recycled month-to-month. We’d expect them to tackle any critical issues with patches as well.</p>


<p>The team writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As our team shifts its focus toward delivering the best possible experience with Forza Horizon 6 in 2026, we do not plan to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes for Forza Motorsport. However, we will continue supporting the game by keeping online servers active, hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime.</p>
<p>We hope you continue racing with us on Forza Motorsport in 2026 – see you at the track!</p></blockquote>
<p>This announcement was somewhat inevitable after Microsoft chose to gut the studio earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">laying off roughly half the team</a> during a wave of layoffs across the gaming business and company as a whole. This was a result of a fairly underwhelming release for the latest Forza Motorsport, which had been years in the making and sought to bring the series up to the level of Gran Turismo and others as a longer-term racing game platform. Following the game’s release in 2023, they<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/09/heres-how-forza-motorsport-car-progression-is-changing-in-march/"> overhauled car progression</a>, added <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/forza-motorsport-update-adds-road-atlanta-circuit-and-multi-class-racing/">major new track and multi-class racing</a> and more, but it wasn’t enough to keep the studio secure.</p>

<p>It means that all that remains of what was a staple of the simcade racing genre will be the more arcade open world action of Forza Horizon, which is heading to Japan with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-is-heading-to-japan-in-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a> next year.</p>

            <p>We factory sim perverts have all known the joy of combing a mile of conveyor belt tagliatelle for that one empty hopper or unplugged furnace that’s stalled the entire production line. Now, imagine that the stalled production line is producing plasma swords for your army of murder droids.</p>
<p>You need your army of murder droids to fight another army of murder droids, but unfortunately, all of your murder droids are now swordless, and therefore murder droids no longer. They advance placidly into the firestorm, falling like mown dandelions, while you run your cursor desperately over the hexagonal smokestacks. There it is! A misfiring 3D printer, right in the centre. </p><!--more-->
<p>This is a hypothetical scenario, based on fervent perusal of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3396160/Warfactory/">Warfactory Steam page</a>. As you’ve hopefully guessed, it’s a mix of “lite” 4X, factory sim and real-time strategy game. You play an ancient AI, possibly a cousin of Destiny’s Warmind, who wakes up after humanity’s extinction and decides to conquer the galaxy, planet by planet.</p>

<p>“Your factory assembles every robot warrior part by part,” explain developers Terricon Games. “Hulls, weapons, and propulsion systems are fully interchangeable. Link different production hubs to create new unit types in seconds. </p>
<p>“Retool your factory on the fly,” it continues. “Need mobility on broken terrain? Swap legs for treads. Facing armor? Switch to armor-piercing loadouts. Your production line becomes your strategy.”</p>
<p>Please can I make just the one robot huge enough to sit on all the others, Terricon? It shouldn’t matter too much if there are some modules missing. I will dedicate entire planets to the fabrication of Dat Ass. Its name shall be Godzillass - a name that can only ever be whispered in dread or screamed in terror, as the enormous, sexy shadow descends.</p><p>Going by the trailer, those planetary maps consist of regions with their own fog of war, which seems like it’ll make the early game less frenetic and more incremental-feeling than it clearly could be. The visuals blend “sci-fi with Japanese and East Asian aesthetics”, and the Steam page is accordingly sprinkled with steely industrial haiku.</p>
<p>There’s a choice of hand-crafted story and open-ended roguelite modes featuring an upgradeable mothership. Multiplayer features should follow after launch in 2026. If that’s too long to wait, the developers are also hosting a playtest - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3396160/view/543376693580006978?l=english">find out how to sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>This is far from the only factory sim in which you have to maintain a military alongside your production lines – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dyson-sphere-program">Dyson Sphere Program</a> players will be perfectly at home, I’m sure – but I like the emphasis here on a single bottleneck breeding catastrophe. It’s also quite a grim project in context. Terricon are a new Ukrainian team, as are publishers Palaye, and naturally, I’m wondering how much the full mobilisation ethic of Warfactory reflects life in the country right now, as the Russian invasion continues.</p>

"Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout TV show, which is set after all the existing Fallout video games, has sparked much debate within the fandom. Questions on how it fits into the overarching Fallout timeline and whether it makes particular video game endings canon have dominated discussion in the run up to each season’s release. Indeed, Fallout Season 2 had left fans wondering about the fate of New Vegas following the events of the video game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-takes-the-fog-of-war-approach-to-avoid-making-any-new-vegas-ending-canon-creators-say">although the show’s creators have avoided making a clear call</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Howard is confirming here is that TV show characters such as Lucy, Maximus, and The Ghoul and the events of the show must now be factored into Fallout 5, although we don’t know when or where the game will be set. Could either actually appear in Fallout 5? It sounds like it’s possible, but we’ll have to see what happens in the show itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that we’re guaranteed Fallout Season 3, and the hope is there will be more seasons after that. There’s a long way to go before the show wraps up, and there’s a long way to go before Fallout 5 comes out. In the meantime, could Bethesda follow The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and release a remaster of Fallout 3 or New Vegas, or perhaps even a Fallout: New Vegas 2 as a stop gap? In a recent interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5">Howard remained coy on the possibility</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 1 Video Game Details - Characters and Factions</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on the Fallout TV show.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Superheroes, ronin, insect warriors, and postal service workers. Whatever your fantasy this year, PlayStation could deliver it. But which PS5 game was the best? We at IGN have voted and picked out what we think are the five most worthy of recognition from across 2025, naming one of them the very best PlayStation game of the year, as well as shouting out a few honourable mentions that were very close to making the cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an era where console exclusives are a dying breed, as Sony’s competitor, Microsoft, has shown us more than ever over the past few months, we’ve made the decision this year to branch out and open up the criteria for what can win our platform-specific awards. These aren’t the top five Sony exclusives, but the top five games that were released on PS5 in 2025, full stop. So, without further ado, let’s get on with it and crown the best PlayStation game of 2025 before we all die of old age.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best games from early in the year was Hazelight’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, the endlessly inventive co-op action platformer that just narrowly missed out on a top-five spot. Also just missing out are a pair of 2025’s breakout indie hits, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</a>. These two couldn’t be more different from each other, though, with the former brain-bending mansion full of puzzles a much calmer affair than the brick-breaking chaos of the latter. And then there’s two big shooters that came along at the end of the year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>’s multiplayer has seen it return to the glorious, huge-scale carnage that fans wanted, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has proven a massive success thanks to its “just one more extraction” nature. Rounding out on honourable mentions are a pair of games that like to do things a bit differently when it comes to narrative: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. Both create uneasy worlds in their own ways, and we admire them for their freeform and steadily revealing approaches to storytelling, respectively.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-hollow-knight-silksong-1765293248214.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It finally happened. 2025 was the year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> saw the light of day, and what a relief that we not only got to play it, but it was also extremely good. Team Cherry’s much-anticipated sequel may be a whole lot more punishing than the original, but it is still home to that same magic, which can be found all over its sprawling, bug-sized world full of secret nooks and crannies. The platforming pathways to get to those places are tight and challenging, with new lead, Hornet, showing off a fresh batch of skills stemming from her fundamentally game-changing diagonal dart. But it’s in combat where she really comes into her own, promoting a more aggressive style of play which lets you take the fight to Silksong’s bestiary of bosses. These tough creatures of all shapes and sizes with nasty tricks up their sleeves may have presented some of 2025’s biggest roadblocks, but persevere, and the glory waiting behind them leads to one of this year’s greatest games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Dispatch</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-dispatch-1765293264231.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superhero drama <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a> manages to recapture the magic of those Telltale-esque episodic visual novels that we all fell in love with a decade or so ago. Following the story of Robert Robertson, a hero who is nothing without his now-destroyed mech suit, it's a heartwarming tale of redemption that isn’t without its fair share of bite, too. Managing your many relationships, both personal and professional, as they intertangle at Robbie’s place of work, the Superhero Dispatch Network, is key, as is making sure your team of down-and-out supervillains successfully try their hand at crime-stopping. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This half of the game adds a real-time sim management wrinkle to each chapter, as you boost the skills of your squad and send them out on missions that match their skillset. From the hot-head Flambae, to the internet’s new favourite demon Mommy, Malevola, you’re in command of a vibrant and varied bunch that each offer a fun dynamic to each and every scene they’re in. But it's outside of the SDN office monitor that Dispatch really comes to life, as Robertson’s life crumbles around him, and your best attempts at rebuilding it are hidden behind dialogue choices. What comes of its cast of characters, headlined by Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul as Robbie, and with Laura Bailey’s Invisagal stealing most scenes, is up to you. One thing that is guaranteed, though, is a great time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-death-stranding-2-1765293281611.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> finally fulfilled the promise of its flawed predecessor. Creator Hideo Kojima’s second slice of post-apocalypse delivery adventures dialled up the action, echoing his past Metal Gear Solid successes, whilst still maintaining that singular, lonely vision of a disconnected world. Taking Sam Porter Bridges to Australia, On the Beach hands you a much expanded range of combat options, from silenced sniper rifles to homing missile mechanical dogs, and permits you to go about completing its many, many postal orders however you’d like. This freedom is not just a combat feature, but is reflected in how you go about navigating each of these treacherous delivery routes, too, with new ways to travel over stormy deserts and raging rivers, including huge, looming monorail systems and bonkers coffin hoverboards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the weirdness is just one aspect of Death Stranding — and there’s no shortage of it this time around, thanks to Troy Baker’s excellent return as villain Higgs — as its themes of love and loss ultimately dominate, no matter how large the spectacle on screen. Lea Seydoux is subtly brilliant as Fragile, and drives the story from start to finish as the connections between herself, Sam, and baby Lou are steadily revealed. It’s a fantastic example of a vision come to life, and easily one of the best PlayStation games to have come out in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Ghost of Yotei</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-ghost-of-yotei-1765293296489.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following up on 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima was always going to be a challenge, but developer Sucker Punch rose to it impressively well with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>. This sword-slashing epic borrows everything that we loved from its predecessor, but improves on almost all of it in a multitude of fun little ways. The pulsating combat opens up further, with new weapons and skills introduced to deepen its familiar dodge, block, parry, and swing system. Among those additions is the highly satisfying disarming mechanic that has your protagonist, Atsu, send her enemies' blades flying from their grasp. But it's this wandering ronin’s story that drives Yotei’s momentum, turning a simple tale of revenge into something much more beautiful as you explore each corner of its historical Japanese map and soak in both the audio and visual majesty on show</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765293315016.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has won another award. It really is that good, though, isn’t it? Sandfall Interactive’s ode to Final Fantasy of years gone by takes that age-old formula and thrusts it firmly into 2025 with lashings of style, soaring music, and a battle system that melds classic turn-based RPG mechanics with exciting real-time elements, making each and every encounter a thrill. All of that style would be nothing without substance, though, and while its combat excites from moment to moment, it’s Clair Obscur’s poignant story and layered cast of characters that make it live long in the memory. Jennifer English is pitch-perfect as Maelle at the heart of Expedition 33’s plot, with Ben Starr’s Verso a wonderful foil as its twisted themes of grief and what it is to love are untangled. All played out in front of a ticking backdrop of the Gommage — a yearly tolling doomsday clock for anyone of a certain age — it’s wonderfully cinematic, making it fit right in alongside many of Sony’s first-party blockbuster offerings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking inspiration from the original PlayStation’s library of Japanese RPGs and bringing those ideas into the future, thanks to an all-timer video game story supported by a combat system as satisfying as it is nuanced, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the clear winner of our award for Best PlayStation Game of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was your favourite PS5 game of 2025?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a term used to describe a huge amount of games released every year, but what does “action-adventure” even mean? It’s a good question. Here at IGN, we classify any game that fuses combat with a genuine sense of exploration as action-adventure. They often take place in open worlds, but that’s not a mandatory requirement (see the likes of Uncharted and God of War), and so this flexible format allows for a wide range of different projects to make the cut this year, from the tightly crafted co-op platforming action of Split Fiction and the vast, isolated, do-it-yourself atmosphere of Death Stranding 2, to the adventures of banana-hunting apes and revenge-seeking ronin. So let’s get on with it as swiftly as a Hornet and reveal the runners-up and ultimate winner of our award for the Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Split Fiction</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/the-best-action-adventure-game-2025-split-fiction-1765385818067.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following on from the wonderful It Takes Two, developer Hazelight took things to the next level when it comes to scale in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> and continued to hone its craft as the modern-day masters of the co-op game. Much of its story is spent platforming and puzzle-solving, but a healthy amount is also reserved for combat against its many varied sci-fi and fantasy-laced foes, as well as exploration of its larger-scale levels. It never once stands still, constantly evolving and switching up its mechanical ideas to match each world’s colourful set dressing. That sense of exciting propulsion along an ever-changing journey, balanced with areas designed for you to slow down a little and hunt for secrets and surprising side missions, is what makes Split Fiction one of our top five action-adventure games of the year. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Ghost of Yotei</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/the-best-action-adventure-game-2025-ghost-of-yotei-1765385836892.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most traditional “action-adventure” on our list, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> follows in a long line of PlayStation Studio exclusives that firmly fit that mold. Telling the story of revenge-seeking wandering Ronin, Atsu, Yotei takes everything that made people fall in love with its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, and tweaks it for the better. Where action is concerned, its slick sword, spear, and kusarigama combat is a real star of the show, with new-age weaponry such as firearms also brought into the mix to expand this ghost’s arsenal. In terms of adventure, 17th-century Hokkaido plays stage to as beautiful a looking and sounding world as you could step into in 2025, with no shortage of collectibles, side stories, and show-stopping duels to engage with. Sucker Punch’s latest is the Seattle studio’s most accomplished effort to date, and one of this year’s very best action-adventures. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/the-best-action-adventure-game-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-1765385856807.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> encourages you to explore its many sandbox levels, not through careful investigation, but by smashing every corner of them into tiny pieces to see what secrets lurk inside. Nintendo’s modern 3D reinvention of what its beloved ape could be in 2025 quickly became the Switch 2’s must-have game, and for good reason. Bananza is a feast for treasure hunters, with hundreds of glowing bananas begging to be uncovered through destruction courtesy of DK’s pounding fists and many special abilities. Those skills are at the heart of it all, with the titular Bananzas powering inventive new ways to adventure through each of its themed levels. From the rampaging Kong Bananza that allows you to unleash a monstrous fury capable of breaking the toughest of terrain, as well as any enemy’s soon-to-be dust skeleton, to the wing-flapping Ostrich Bananza that allows for new heights to be soared to. It’s far from conventional, even by Nintendo 3D platforming standards, but Donkey Kong Bananza is one of this year’s very best when it comes to action-adventure.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/the-best-action-adventure-game-2025-death-stranding-2-1765385884204.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of unconventional, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> certainly isn’t worried about obeying genre norms. An action-adventure that’s never afraid to show, tell, or have you engage with things you’ve never quite seen before, Kojima Productions’ latest is the fulfillment of a promise made in its predecessor. That’s not to say that there isn’t the familiar to be found here, with its increased focus on combat echoing memories of its creator’s Metal Gear Solid roots, thanks to an expanded range of options when it comes to approaching its stealth-action. It’s in its adventure, and the exploration of themes of grief and human connection at its centre, that make each of Sam Porter Bridges’ challenging steps through a post-apocalyptic Australia in Death Stranding 2 really sing, though, and one of this year’s very best action-adventures.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/the-best-action-adventure-game-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-1765385906347.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is it a huge relief that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally came out in 2025, but an even bigger one that it turned out to be so great. Placing an even greater emphasis on the action part of “action-adventure” than its predecessor, Team Cherry delivered a challenging, yet incredibly rewarding sequel via the tip of protagonist Hornet’s needle. That rapier-like blade will get plenty of use, too, with sprawling caverns laden with all manner of darting foes and patience-testing bosses possessing all manner of attack patterns, which once learned unlock the path to ultimate satisfaction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss battles are only half of the, well, battle, when it comes to Silksong, though, with exploration still providing the meat of this Metroidvania/Soulslike soup. Breakable walls hide valuable materials behind them, and side quests encourage careful investigation into each of its many biomes, whether on the hunt for precious bounties or searching for missing fleas that need to be reunited with their traveling caravan companions. It’s this balance of both action and adventure that has turned the Hollow Knight series into such a phenomenon, and, in turn, Silksong into the winner of our award for best action-adventure game of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Silksong your pick for the best action-adventure game of the year, or would you have chosen differently?

His fight for freedom against a literally iron-fisted despot represented a braver, weirder time for Ubisoft, and today Francisco looks back on a classic...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>For many of us, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> changed platforming forever by introducing the boundless possibilities of the third dimension. I wasn’t one of them. As a latecomer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> was my Mario 64, the game which opened my eyes to all the strangeness, spectacle, and drama the revamped 3D genre could offer.</p>
<p>It happened by pure chance. I couldn’t afford Mario 64 after becoming the proud owner of my baby blue Pikachu Nintendo 64 in 2000. However, my local game store had Rayman 2 on a special deal, sat on the shelf unloved since coming out in 1999. And the oppressive world, sinister tone, and unique brand of heroics I discovered have been seared into my memory ever since the first time I wandered into the fantasy dystopia of the Glade of Dreams.</p>
<p>The Glade is a fairytale land, whose whimsy gave way to perpetual gloom under the literally iron-fisted rule of Admiral Razorbeard and his clanking robo-pirate minions. Their slave count grows by the second. The Teensie Kings, their citizens, and the fairy-like Lums are all helplessly locked up. Rayman himself starts the game imprisoned in the brig, hopeless and alone. When his powers are smuggled in (thanks, Globox!) to finally allow a dramatic prison break, he becomes a freedom fighter unlike any platforming hero before him.</p>
<p>If Paul Thomas Anderson’s flick <strong>One Battle After Another</strong> was an N64 platformer where Leo could actually pull off a long jump, its cover art would likely be a lot like Rayman 2: a member of the resistance speeding away from a well-placed detonation.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9b4974fbec06b"><a title="Rayman 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b4974fbec06b/rayman-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit there are N64 platformers with more expansive level design, but Rayman had other goals. Rayman 2’s linear levels make the most of his polished moveset of “hairlicopter” gliding and lobbing energy projectiles, while giving his eight-hour adventure a breakneck sense of dramatic momentum.</p>
<p>He may look ‘armless, but he has the unruly toolkit to beat the most committed anarchist, even Donkey Kong! Rayman is shattering cages to free vulnerable Teensies and Lums. He’s raiding the robo-pirates' very own gunpowder kegs to blow up every barred door in his way. He’s taming walking rockets bronco-style for high-stakes pursuit, even commandeering their own ships to blast his way to Admiral Razorbeard.</p>
<p>A one-man counterattack from France’s favourite platforming hero draws a painfully obvious comparison to the spirit of the French Resistance; no coincidence when the game shares its name with the famous Steve McQueen film about Allied POWs in World War II. From the moody opening cinematic — which rivals the dramatic stakesetting of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> if you ask me — the game’s sky-high stakes represent Rayman’s darkest hour.</p>

<p>It’s a world away from the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a>, which was an accomplished but straightforward jaunt through platforms creatively constructed from sticky nougat before battling giant saxophones. Rayman 2 went so much darker. The series, always inspired by <strong>The Dark Crystal</strong>, came closest to Jim Henson and Frank Oz’s creepy cult classic with Rayman 2’s palette of ominous green shades and environments layered with deep shadows.</p>
<p>When you come to the unnerving Cave of Bad Dreams, you find a Tim Burton-esque nightmare. You’re running down giant skeletal spinal columns, leaping from skull to skull as they sink into forboding depths, then climbing up rows of ribcages like you’re bouldering in the Parisian catacombs. With other levels introducing putrid waterlogged bayous and frightening pirate-infested cave docks, the vibe’s often closer to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/shadow_man">Shadow Man</a> than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>’s pantomime nasties – despite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-banjo-tooie-is-pure-nightmare-fuel-and-i-wouldnt-have-it-any-other-way">Banjo Tooie’s imaginatively creepy efforts</a>.</p>
<p>With its dystopian setting and firm sense of justice, the similarities between Rayman 2 and director Michel Ancel’s next game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyond_good_and_evil_20th_anniversary_edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>, are impossible to ignore. Just swap out Rayman’s kidnapped Teensie Kings for Jade’s alien-abducted orphans, or Razorbeard’s Buccaneer flying ship for the Dom-Z’s space base. It’s a tragedy that this promisingly ambitious trajectory ended in 2003, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-rayman-legends-blew-my-mind-then-broke-my-heart">much as I love Rayman Legends’ giddy thrills</a>.</p>

<p>Today, both games represent a braver, weirder time for Ubisoft in the mid-2000s. A time before money-printing machines like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed</a> and <strong>Far Cry</strong> kicked into gear, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_plus_rabbids_kingdom_battle">Rabbids</a> condemned Rayman to a supporting role in his own series. This was when the Ubisoft I loved the most were at the peak of their powers, exploring the outer reaches of the 3D platforming genre.</p>
<p>Decades later, Rayman remains on his interminable hiatus, and the question of which version of Rayman 2 is best remains stubbornly unsolved. The PlayStation and PlayStation 2 versions spoil the game’s rich atmosphere with cloyingly over-enthusiastic English voice acting. Many claim the Dreamcast version is definitive, but no additions could convince me to pick up that Tamagotchi contraption it calls a controller.</p>
<p>For me, and I’ll admit this is a game where my nostalgia-tinged glasses are practically superglued on, the Nintendo 64 version is the best way to play Rayman 2. Its soundtrack is unique to the system; without the CD storage space other formats could use, it relies on catchy and effective MIDI melodies. Its pared-back approach is best seen in its opening cutscene (below), which adds none of the distractions of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln9xfh1dmyA">other versions</a>. And the N64’s anti-aliasing haze suited its shadowy vibe magnificently.</p>

<p>Now it’s on Switch Online, Rayman 2’s own Great Escape from its undeserved obscurity gives the N64 version an unbeatable claim to be the best of all: you can play it right now. And you absolutely should.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget Rayman 2. And that’s not just because I replayed its opening stage more times than I could ever count, having missed the fact that the N64 cart needed a memory card to save my game. It’s proven so memorable thanks to its rebellious heroism, oddball creativity, and unusual place in Ubisoft history. It taught me to fight for freedom or die trying. Even if the outcome was usually an explosive end after taking a wrong turn on my untamed rocket steed.</p>

		<p>Splitgate 2 is dead. Long live Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. This is the new iteration of Splitgate, the arena-based shooter with its trademark portals, and it’s launching today in full, leaving beta behind, arriving for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One in one fell swoop.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKUPFtZ4S00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded combines the best of the rewarding DNA of the original Splitgate with the innovations of Splitgate 2, delivering the ultimate Splitgate experience. The new era of Splitgate celebrates its roots, eliminating factions and abilities while re-emphasizing the kinetic arena gameplay of classic modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination and King of the Hill. SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded also evolves the impressive movement mechanics and immersive visual worlds that distinguished Splitgate 2, delivering momentum and polish in every match.</p>
<p>Here’s a detailed look at what’s going live:</p>
<h3>Five New Maps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hammerhead: The movement never stops as the combat unfolds in a giant rolling tank.</li>
<li>Terra 13: A large, circular map in the valley of a mountainous space colony.</li>
<li>Abyss: The subterranean Splitgate fan favorite returns.</li>
<li>Oasis: The sun, the sand, the verticality. A port of Splitgate’s desert palm-tree playground.</li>
<li>Karman Station: The very first Splitgate map, reimagined.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Arena Modes, Mode Select and Multi-Queue</h3>
<ul>

<p>Originally release in June, Splitgate 2 immediately split the Splitgate fanbase, with a host of microtransactions, some of which were eye-wateringly expensive, while adding a new Battle Royale mode despite the team having previously criticising Call of Duty et al.</p>

<p>The story of Splitgate 2 is one of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The first game was an unexpected indie shooter hit, entering the exceedingly competitive multiplayer shooter arena and staking its claim to a place on the battlefield. It’s heavily Halo-inspired gunplay found a legion of fans, and so it was expected that Splitgate 2 should have been a continuation of that success. The beta period was tough though, with a mixture of unpopular changes to the game’s formula and an odd public appearance from Ian Proulx in a “Make FPS Great Again” cap, that didn’t sit well with a portion of the community.</p>
<p>It looks as though the team have done a lot of work to counter all these issues though, and we hope that they find the success they deserve with the relaunch of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Techland has released a new update for Dying Light: The Beast with Update 1.5, which adds a new difficulty layer called the Nightmare Experience, new survival mechanics, and a new Alpha Volatile. This update quickly follows after <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-update-1-4-adds-ray-tracing-on-pc-new-game-legend-levels-and-many-improvements/">Update 1.4, which Techland said was the game's "<em>biggest update yet</em>,"</a> and rounds out <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-roadmap-ray-tracing-pc-new-game-plus/">the most recent roadmap</a> Techland released for the game.</p>



<p>Update 1.4 added elements like new game plus, support for ray tracing on PC, and over 400 improvements across graphical updates and bug fixes. Update 1.5 lets players experience all of that with even more new gameplay conditions, as elements like the new survival mechanics now mean players have to be worried about their food consumption and how hungry they get. The longer you go without food, the longer your stamina and health take to regenerate. Your flashlight will also drain over time, and as the battery gets low, the light will dim and flicker, so you'll have to find replacement batteries either out in the town or by crafting them. </p>



<p>The new Alpha Volatiles are now the most powerful infected in Castor Woods, not just for their strength but for their intelligence. They'll ignore the UV light, and unlike other Volatiles that may lose your scent if you run and hide fast enough, they'll be able to keep hunting you all across the map until you reach a safe zone.</p>



<p>The Nightmare Experience difficulty is the highest challenge available in Dying Light: The Beast, which, you won't be surprised to learn, Techland only recommends for the most seasoned Dying Light players.</p>



<p>"<em>It makes Human and Infected enemies stronger, smarter, more aggressive, reacting faster to players' actions using their heightened senses</em>," <a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/news/update-15">a blog post from the official website reads</a> on the new update. It goes on to say that when playing on the Nightmare Experience difficulty, some Dark Zones in the game will now feature Volatiles during the day. Also, on top of everything else, as you might expect, resources will be far more scarce on Nightmare compared to other difficulties, so keeping yourself alive is all the more challenging.</p>



<p>When Dying Light: The Beast launched earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">I reviewed it for Wccftech</a>, writing, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements. Beyond that, the mechanical and narrative pacing, inconsistent writing and narrative tone, and world design choices that feel antithetical to the series in the first place all bring it to a fairly uninteresting experience that is only worth it for however long you want to turn your brain off and enjoy watching digital infected brains go </em><em>splat.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[After a Successful Year, Marvel Rivals Has Big Plans, Teases MCU-Related Content]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/one-year-into-marvel-rivals-team-ups-tasteful-design-and-community-driven-1</link>
            <guid>1386229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a little over a year since NetEase released its hero shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>. Since then, the game has taken on a life of its own and become one of the most popular games of 2025. During <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">The Game Awards 2025</a>, TechRaptor sat down with the publishing and marketing lead of NetEase Games, Yachen Bian, and the executive producer of Marvel Games, Danny Koo, to talk about the game's journey and what they plan for the future--including a tease of potential content timed with <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>.</p><p>One of the things that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has been doing well is releasing content at a steady rate. Each season usually lasts about two months, and once a month, the team <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-5-gambit-rogue" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">releases a new character based on the season's theme</a>. As one might expect, the team already has an internal roadmap and plans out who they want in the game a year in advance. But it's also so much more than that. Koo explained that it also has to make sense narratively for them to join the game, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Team-ups are such a core part of the game. In short, they give players special abilities when two or specific characters are both on the field at the same time. Not only are these team-ups fun to watch, but they can also make or break games depending on how you use them. Koo explained the reason for adding this was because it only seemed natural to have them, and when you look at any comic, you can see all sorts of team-ups, such as Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, or any of the Avengers and X-Men.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though certain team-ups like Venom x Spider-Man seem like a slam dunk, they won't be in the game forever. This is because the team wanted to "encourage fresh new mechanics every season." The fear is that if they keep one team-up in the game for too long, it'll become "stale," so they want to "inject new excitement every season." Although Koo didn't go into much detail, he explained that the team plans to "expand this system" in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing worth mentioning is that earlier this year, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> announced that they would eventually be working on new original characters not from the comics, to join the game. Shortly after that, the <span>team&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1mtvffc/netease_given_green_light_by_marvel_to_create/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><span>received</span> pushback</a> from the community on this. When asked if the team has an idea of when they would be implementing new original characters, Koo reassured me that this would be a last resort item they use when they run out of established Marvel Comic characters.</p><p>"At Marvel games, I've worked on several original characters, and that's [only] when we need to do it. With so many characters in the Marvel Universe, we want to make sure each hero feels distinct from each other," Koo explained. "That's why you don't see five similar Spider-Men swinging around. We're going to continue to make sure that the existing batch of heroes [joining the game] will be serving the community. Who knows, in the future, when there is a particular need that existing thousands of other heroes can't serve, then we'll think of something original. But at this point, we are not ready for that."&nbsp;</p><p>It's no secret that the team at Marvel Rivals is known for drawing their characters in very specific ways that complement their bodies. You don't have to look too hard to find examples of this (I'm looking at you, Daredevil and Emma Frost). During our talk, I brought up the famous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1m8hhx8/the_cast_of_fantastic_four_first_steps_react_to/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Pedro Pascal video where he first saw the Invisible Woman Malice skin. </a>It's clear that the team adopted their own art style that appeals to both the male and female gaze. Koo explained that the idea was to always be tasteful yet realistic.</p><p>"Being a superhero [is very physical], they have a certain body archetype. So, of course, players will gravitate and be shocked by it. But if you look at the history of comics, it's always [shown off various body types]. You always see those physics, and the costumes highlight the physics," Koo explained. "Also, we're not afraid to show that off while not going too far, because this is still a T-rated game. We're not going into uncharted territory; we don't want [our game] to be adult stuff."&nbsp;</p><p>Koo also made it a point to address that some of the skins they have are a lot tamer than their original counterparts. He used Malice as an example and explained how the original costume was more revealing than the one people see in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so the team wanted to "modernize it." The new Malice look was so popular that Marvel Comics decided to bring it back in a new series that is launching this month.&nbsp;</p><p>As the team looks ahead to 2026, Koo explained that "2025 was a great year, but we have bigger plans for 2026." This includes a steady stream of heroes to join the roster as well as a new PVE (Players Versus Environment) mode.&nbsp;</p><p>"[Our] PVE mode, Marvel Zombies, jived well with players, so we're gonna expand upon that. We're also going to expand upon the hero power fantasy and the team-ups," Koo says. "So you're gonna see more efforts towards that area to fulfill a player's fantasy of playing superheroes in the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> universe. And, of course, next year, we have on the Marvel [Studio] side, two big movies coming out. We're also going to collab on that front in a huge way."&nbsp;</p><p>One thing the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> team has been very vocal about is how successful the PVE Marvel Zombies mode has been. During our interview, Koo alluded that this might be a mode players will see again this time next year, and we aim to look at it more deeply to further expand the gameplay. But the team is also looking to experiment with other non-traditional PVE modes, like what we saw with the Ultron chess mode.&nbsp;</p><p>The team declined to confirm whether an upcoming PVE mode would tie into the upcoming MCU film <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, but they assured me they have a release date in mind for the next mode. That said, they did also tease that when <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> comes out next year, certain story beats would be concluded in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's no secret that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> took a lot of inspiration from other games in the space, like <em>Overwatch 2</em>. It wouldn't be far-fetched to compare the two games because they look and play so similarly. Koo went on to say that the team is a massive fan of shooters in general and tends to gravitate toward games like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em>. Before <em>Marvel Rivals</em> was even greenlit, they often toyed with the idea of making a hero shooter.&nbsp;</p><p>"[NetEase] looked at all the available games out in the market and saw that there was really no superhero shooter. [So we thought] we're going to do it our own way, the Marvel way."&nbsp;</p><p>A large part of why the team has had great success is how it communicates with its fanbase. Whenever changes happen that the majority of players disagree with, they're quick to fix them, and on top of that, the team is super on the nose with the memes and jokes surrounding the game, even leaning into them. Koo attributed a large part of that to the game's Discord server, which is the largest in the world with almost 4.2 million members.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have an army of content creators and moderators who compile feedback and suggestions. It also helps that I'm on social media and I get pinged left and right with people saying, 'Hey, this is interesting.' Or complaints about game features and bugs. So we see all of that stuff, including the dev team," Koo said. "It's not like we're putting up a wall. We literally tore the wall down and said, 'Hey, say whatever you want. We're listening, and we're doing our best to find out what the issue or interest is.'"&nbsp;</p><p>This was something that Bian went on to echo, by explaining that the team doesn't necessarily have a department that surfs the web to see what people are saying. So whenever you see someone like Creative Director Guangyun Chen say something as silly as "Aura Walk" in a community update video, it's them being genuine about it. Koo admitted that sometimes they'll see something the community is asking about online and text Chen to see if it's something they can implement in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>It's clear that the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> team has many ideas in store for 2026. After our long conversation, I'm confident that the team can deliver on another successful year as they enter year two. If you haven't tried it yet, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is a free-to-play game available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">RAM shortage</a> (and subsequent and pricing explosion) is imposing a wider range of grim effects than even the Great GPU Famine of 2020. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">First came the death</a> of one of gaming hardware’s most reliable memory and SSD makers, and now... uh... <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Larian’s new Divinity game</a> is going to be more optimised for PC than it otherwise would have been?</p>
<p>That’s what Larian CEO Swen Vincke (clearly on a media tour – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">here’s him discussing Divinity with our Edwin</a>) told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/larian-divinity-development-changed-ram-prices/">TheGamer</a>, anyway. Vincke notes that because the lack of affordable RAM options is making it harder to predict the horsepower of future PCs, "we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time." That doesn’t sound especially horrible to me – higher performance on lower-end rigs ultimately means more players can join in – though nowhere in the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/larian-studios-swen-vincke-interview-divinity/">full interview</a> does Vincke acknowledge that the shortage is being directly caused and sustained by demand from data centres that power generative AI, a technology that Larian are using in Divinity’s production, and that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-boss-responds-to-criticism-of-generative-ai-use-its-something-we-are-constantly-discussing-internally?event_category=Login+success&amp;event_action=Email">Vincke himself is defending the use of</a>.</p>

<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be chugging potions out of six-fingered hands, or leading your party into the homely village of Ecwwhehw. Larian’s boss man is adamant that "We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI," with the company supposedly limiting their genAI application to things like placeholder text and references for concept artists.</p>
<p>Without wanting to prosecute yet another argument about it – not this late in the afternoon, at least – I still don’t think that approach addresses the problems with environmental damage, unauthorised scraping, or even really labour replacement that genAI continues to swirl around in. It’s also a fact that <em>any</em> usage of tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, or Adobe Firefly, however limited, adds demand to those data centres that are hogging all our RAM sticks.</p><p>This effects of this artificial memory shortage, again, extend far beyond how well Divinity will run on 16GB of DDR4. Soaring prices are <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/dont-wait-if-youre-planning-to-upgrade-your-ram-or-ssd-kingston-rep-warns-says-prices-will-continue-to-go-up-nand-costs-up-246-percent">expected to last well into 2026</a>, with production costs for laptops, pre-built PCs and possibly games consoles passed onto consumers, while Valve are rumoured to be reconsidering both their pricing and launch date plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">new Steam Machine</a>. Even hardware heavyweights Nvidia are <a href="https://overclock3d.net/news/gpu-displays/nvidia-plans-heavy-cuts-to-gpu-supply-in-early-2026/">reportedly</a> cutting GPU production plans, due to a lack of available GDDR7 memory, and their own supplying of graphics chips to the genAI industry has made them the richest company on Earth.</p>

Pretty much every game has RPG elements these days, so if you squint hard enough, you can make the case for a lot of games being RPGs, even if they don’t follow the same formulas and structures the genre historically has. Because the definition of what makes an RPG has gotten looser over the years, any list of the best ones in any given year is pretty much guaranteed to have a ton of variety, including everything from action-packed open-world sprawls to strategic retro throwbacks. Here are our picks for the best RPGs of 2025.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</i></b></h2>  <p><span>So many </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed </span></i><span>games are set in open worlds that aren’t worth exploring. Everything is marked on your map, and outside of those locations there’s little to find. But more recent entries, like </span><i><span>Valhalla</span></i><span>, have bucked this trend and started featuring maps that were not just vast, but stuffed with details to spot, people to meet, and activities to discover.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows,</span></i><span> which successfully moves the series to feudal Japan, is the next step in this evolution. The world is so satisfying to explore, and as you do so, you find new ways to alter both playable characters and their builds. And yeah, the presence of two playable characters who both feature their own quests and dialogue options as well as combat styles and skill trees means you basically get two different, but similar RPGs for the price of one. That’s an impressive accomplishment, and it means </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> isn’t just one of the best RPGs of 2025, but one of its biggest, too. -Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Avowed</i></b></h2>  <p><span>My favorite RPGs are the ones in which I can pick a direction and just start hiking, running into interesting encounters and monsters to fight as I go. </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, while not as big as some other open-world RPGs, let me do just that.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But even better, I got to do so in a unique fantasy setting filled with characters I’ll remember for years. It’s also an RPG that is so confident in its characters and writing that it essentially forces you to camp between quests and exploration. Standing around the campfire and chatting with my small crew of misfits could have been annoying in another RPG. But in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, these are some of the best moments in the game. Any RPG that makes chatting as fun as combat and questing is a winner in my book. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Much has been said about </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>as some kind of “savior” of the turn-based RPG genre, as if those games stopped coming out after </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>. I don’t want the nauseating way in which RPG detractors have wielded it to take away from just how good Sandfall Interactive’s debut game is. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s grief-driven tale of a group of expeditioners on a suicide mission, desperately hoping to end an annual culling of their friends and family (called a Gommage), is one of constant misdirection and pain, whether that be in its narrative twists or in the showy way its enemies swing at you to throw off your well-timed parry or dodge. It circumvents the bloat that weighs down the RPG genre in favor of something tight, focused, and reasonably paced, and it packs it with a dense, rewarding turn-based battle system. After the amount of acclaim it has received this year, hopefully other RPG devs learn from its relative restraint and calculated excess. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Deltarune</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Toby Fox’s episodic follow-up to </span><i><span>Undertale </span></i><span>is still ongoing, but four episodes in, </span><i><span>Deltarune </span></i><span>has already provided humor, atmosphere, character, and a banger soundtrack that stands tall next to its predecessor. With the closing chapters still at least a year away, we still have quite some time before we see the end of Kris’ journey, but what we’ve seen thus far has the potential to be just as impactful as </span><i><span>Undertale </span></i><span>was in 2015. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Demonschool&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><span>What if you took the first </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>game and made it like </span><i><span>Into the Breach</span></i><span>? You’d have </span><i><span>Demonschool</span></i><span>, a clever, charming RPG that takes turn-based battles and makes each round of combat into a mini-tactical puzzle. The pixel art is great. So is the soundtrack. The characters are endearing but interactions are brisk, keeping the calendar time-management sim aspect of the formula feeling breezy rather than tedious. The writing’s not for everyone but it worked for me. Think of the snappiest people in your group chat playing off their archetypes and trading zingers at breakneck speed. It can feel at times like a case of style over substance. For a game with this much retro swag, I say, “who cares?” — Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</i></b></h2>  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>series may have fallen into relative obscurity compared to other ‘90s monster-taming phenomena, but the series has absolutely not been resting on the laurels of its early popularity. </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games are experimental, darker than you remember the series being, and offer a degree of creativity and freedom in party building you won’t find elsewhere. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>pulls off all of the above with more polish and budget than most of the </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games have gotten before, and though its turn-based battles are a bit simple, its incredibly modular monster-training mechanics make it a lot more compelling than it appears on the surface. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><span>There might never be another strategy RPG this good, in these exact ways, ever again. Mentioning any quibbles I have—cutting bonus content, a new localization that makes Ramza too whiny sometimes—feels like complaining about micro-mistakes in the plating of a Michelin Star three-course banquet. Perfectly paced, beautifully crafted, and heart-stoppingly authentic, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is like a long-lost Shakespeare play turned into the best </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> session you’ve ever had. — Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Fretless</span></i><span>’ marriage of turn-based battles and rhythm mechanics brings clarity to the timing-based attacks of something like </span><i><span>Paper Mario </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> by tying every strike, swipe, and sidestep to the beat of its excellent soundtrack. Ritual Studios weaves sheet music into the RPG’s design, from its rhythm-based battles to its musical world, in which brushing up against a plant or stepping on the right stone can add a lovely melody to a world that’s already brimming with song. It is the kind of game that anyone with rhythm can enjoy, but it’s especially delightful if you have a background in music and can hear how sound is integrated into everything you do. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i></b></h2>  <p><span>It’s hard to believe that an old and clunky open-world RPG like Bethesda’s 2006 </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </span></i><span>could blow up in popularity in 2025. But that’s what happened thanks to the remaster, which mainly improves the game’s looks and adds a few quality-of-life changes. That’s it, though. At its core this is still the original </span><i><span>Oblivion</span></i><span>. And yet, there is something special about it. Walking around the forest in </span><i><span>Oblivion</span></i><span> and stumbling upon some odd ruins that lead to a dark dungeon is still as much fun in 2025 as it was back on the Xbox 360. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Octopath Traveler 0</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>is proof that Square Enix had no reason to make </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> a gacha game when it could have easily made it an exceptional RPG without all the gacha elements dragging it down. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>is a game saved from obscurity, as Square Enix has stripped </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent </span></i><span>of its live-service trappings and revived it as the proper turn-based RPG fans wanted in the first place. It is a beefy monster of a game that will take up nearly a hundred hours of your time, but that’s the consequence of adapting what was once meant to be a forever game into something that feels complete. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>feels like a prodigal son returning after being shut down due to Square Enix’s short-sighted hubris. And it sure is nice to have all the best parts of the game preserved when they were once thought lost. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2>  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>subseries has become </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> place to experiment, and </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> takes some of the boldest swings Game Freak’s ever taken. Its real-time battle system includes one of the most interesting spins the studio has ever put on the franchise’s decades-old combat formula, the single-city setting lets the devs stick with one of the most memorable casts in series history, and the plethora of new Mega Evolutions gives a lot of old favorites new life. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is almost nothing like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus,</span></i><span> beyond both games having you manually throw Poké Balls at wild creatures and dodge roll when a powerful attack comes your way. And that’s pretty exciting, because it means that maybe the next </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game can surprise us in a whole new way. After </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, I’m willing to just let Game Freak cook. I have no wish list. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Too Kyo Games’ magnum opus is the kind of game that is so ambitious and unwieldy it’s hard to recommend without caveats, but it’s also one of the best RPGs this year you probably haven’t heard of. The game is one part visual novel, another part tactical RPG, and another part absolute mindfuck of a branching narrative, with 100 different endings across over 20 routes, and your path through the story entirely defined by your narrative choices. Its puzzle-like tactical battles are more brain teaser than sweaty warzone, but their challenging, </span><i><span>Evangelion</span></i><span> Angel-style boss fights keep things interesting and unpredictable. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>might not have gotten the awards buzz it deserved, but make no mistake, few games from 2025 even come close to matching its ambition. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>The Outer Worlds 2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>It’s clear that we aren’t getting a new </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>game from Bethesda anytime soon. But I can wait, because Obsidian’s </span><i><span>Outer Worlds 2 </span></i><span>is a worthy spiritual successor that even exceeds the franchise that inspired it in some key ways. Every part of </span><i><span>Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> is bigger than the original, and it’s clear that the people at Obsidian (who also developed </span><i><span>Avowed </span></i><span>this year!) are experts at crafting RPGs that offer players plenty of freedom while still telling a tale that doesn’t feel like a series of random moments, lightly connected. Take note, </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>. This is how you combine space, sci-fi, and the Bethesda RPG formula correctly. The end result: One of the year’s best RPGs. — Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</span></i><span> is the type of remake fans dream about: a complete overhaul that nevertheless stays as true to the spirit of the original as possible. The world is reimagined and the coming-of-age story of peacekeeping warriors Estelle and Joshua retold with new cinematics and voice acting that bring it to life the way you always imagined it. Advances in hybrid real-time combat and menu navigation are deftly folded into the structure of a game that came out back in 2004 in a way that adds both depth and convenience. Finally, the starting point for the long-running </span><i><span>Trails</span></i><span> series has a version you can play that doesn’t just feel like JRPG homework. — Ethan Gach</span></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Review - Strong Map Design Makes Multiplayer A Blast</p>
      </div>
<p>It would be just the second time since 2018 that a Call of Duty game would be outsold in the US. The last time it happened was 2023, when Hogwarts Legacy beat Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Before that, Red Dead Redemption II came out on top in 2018, with Black Ops 4 at No. 2.</p><p>2024's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the year's best-selling game in the US, and it achieved that despite being the first Call of Duty game to launch into Game Pass. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">reportedly lost out on $300 million in revenue due to Game Pass</a>. Circana's lists are ranked by revenue, not unit sales.</p><p>Through November 29, Black Ops 7 is the No. 7 best-selling game of 2025 in the US, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">Battlefield 6 holding steady at No. 1</a>. In terms of unit sales, EA confirmed only that Battlefield 6 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">7 million copies out of the gate.</a> A subsequent report said the figure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">rose to 10 million.</a></p><p>Activision, meanwhile, has not disclosed any specific sales numbers for Black Ops 7. And even these figures were disclosed, it wouldn't tell the whole story due to Game Pass. Another element at play is that Battlefield 6 is only available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, while Black Ops 7 is on those platforms, along with two more: PS4 and Xbox One.</p><p>Prior to the launches of Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, analyst Rhys Elliott <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">said the new Call of Duty game would likely finish 2025 on top due in part to </a>"autopilot purchasing" trends, where people buy new Call of Duty games out of habit, even if they complain about a lack of new features or innovation.</p><p>Elliott is discussing global sales, while Circana's reports only cover North America. Circana will release its report for December 2025 and full-year 2025 North American game sales in January, and if Battlefield 6 comes out on top, that won't necessarily mean it beat Black Ops 7 globally.</p><p>Call of Duty provides more value to Microsoft and Xbox than full-game sales alone, as people may sign up for Game Pass to play the game, thus creating new revenue for Microsoft. With Game Pass recently going up $30/month, Microsoft would need someone to stay subscribed for less than 2.5 months to bring in the cost of Black Ops 7 at full price ($70), assuming people pay full price for the membership and the game.</p><p>In any event, Black Ops 7 is clearly not the sale success that Activision and Microsoft would have wanted based on full-game sales, something that's evident because the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-is-trying-really-hard-to-get-you-to-play-black-ops-7-right-now/1100-6537022/" data-ref-id="1100-6537022">already significantly marked down.</a> Additionally, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a> While Black Ops 7's sales may have been lower this year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call of Duty franchise remains the biggest franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>

            <p>A new 2D competitive platformer has just been announced, and it's coming from the same team behind an indie darling from back in 2016. Almost a decade later, the creators of SpeedRunners are back with another speedy release: Sprint City.</p>
<p>Instead of being split across several different levels like SpeedRunners was, Sprint City takes place in one single shared world that seamlessly connects nearby players. While in a party, you and your gaggle of friends will stay connected as you explore and track down challenges to take on.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if one of your friends owns Sprint City, you can join their game via your internet browser of choice and jump in to play for free. The game itself will be available on Steam in 2026, though no exact release date nor price has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Game designer and co-owner at Second Stage Studio Casper van Est has stated: "With Sprint City, we wanted to focus on what we love most in games and what we're best at, which is pure movement. It's a shared world multiplayer experience built around how good it can feel just to move around, so we worked really hard on a satisfying game feel and a visual style that never gets in the way of that."</p><p>The original SpeedRunners also took a consumer-friendly approach to onboarding,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedrunners-will-be-free-upon-its-final-release"> initially offering the game for free on Steam</a> and only charging a premium price for those who wanted to play the game online. It proved exceptionally popular on Steam Early Access a decade or so ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedrunners-has-sold-600k-copies-on-steam-early-access">selling 600k copies in short order</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8c0db7dfabaf5"><a title="Game-Key Card" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c0db7dfabaf5/game-key-card.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Game-Key Cards have been perhaps the hottest topic of the Switch 2's lifecycle so far. Outside of particularly large releases, the running theory is that many studios are turning to a Game-Key physical release because Nintendo has failed to offer small/cheap options for those who don't want to cough up for the big 64GB cartridges. But that might be about to change.</p>
<p>A rumour making the rounds online today states that Nintendo will soon introduce 16 and 32GB cartridge options, so smaller devs hoping to launch a physical release won't have to turn to Key Cards as the only financially viable way of making it happen.</p>
<p>That is according to both the game preservation community <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1">Does It Play</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SoWhatAboutGame">Physical Paradise</a> on Twitter, the latter of which claims to have been informed of the introduction by two separate sources.</p>


<p><a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal" tabindex="-1">@Nintendeal</a> also claimed to have heard the same information, though it pointed out that increasing material costs and chip shortages mean there's no guarantee that more cart size options will directly affect pricing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">Ubisoft employee Rob Bantin explained</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> had launched on Switch 2 as a GKC, not because of a cost issue, but because the S2 carts "simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for". To be clear, different cart <em>sizes</em> would do nothing to mend this issue, but they would provide an alternative for smaller games that are less reliant on speedy asset streaming.</p>
<p>Of course, it is nothing more than a rumour for the time being, so make sure to take things with a hefty pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Something that isn't rumoured, however, is the physical launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a>, which ININ Games has today announced will be arriving as a Game-Key Card since "switching entirely to cartridges would significantly raise manufacturing costs and increase the retail price by at least 15€".</p>
<p>"To avoid this, we chose to release the game on a key card while continuing to explore alternative solutions for the Special and Collector’s Edition," the publisher wrote in an explanation post on <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2001279550135644222">Twitter</a>. "There is still hope for a real cartridge, and we are trying everything."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether more cart sizes from Nintendo will actually impact the number of Game-Keys on the market, or whether studios will continue to stick firmly to the download option. We'll be keeping an eye out for more developments in this particular rumour, and will update you should we hear anything.</p>

            <p>As the second series of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> emerges from a hole in the ground with a cog-shaped door, Todd Howard has uttered the word Fallout and stuck a five after it. He's given a verbal thumbs up - or a reminder depending on how you look at it - to the idea of the events which play out in the TV show having an impact on the next mainline entry on the series, at least in terms of being a consideration in worldbuilding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">Beeb's Newsbeat</a> whether the show will have an impact on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, cleanliness is next to Toddliness replied: "In short, yes." "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening," he expanded. "We are taking that into account."</p>
<p>Based on the phrasing, I'd assume all he's likely talking about here is the need for the likes of terminal entries or other in-game lore whisperings which refer to places in the post-apocalyptic US that the show has touched to mirror what the adaptation says took place. For example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-still-sounds-like-it-wont-commit-to-a-new-vegas-ending-but-for-the-love-of-all-thats-housely-i-hope-it-will">everyone's brains getting very foggy</a> following the second battle of Hoover Dam. Or, well, all that bollocks around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesdas-todd-howard-clarifies-the-fate-of-shady-sands-in-the-fallout-tv-show-timeline">the NCR capital going boom</a>, which I honestly just thought was a rather unnecessary can of worms for the show to have opened.</p>
<p>Is any of that, or possible cheeky references to the likes of Lucy and The Ghoul, stuff I'm particularly bothered about the next single-player Fallout containing whenever it finally arrives? Not really, no. Then again, I've been clear in my view that I reckon the show'd likely benefit from its creators not having to dedicate so much time to debates involving the word canon. Is it nice to have all your things' worlds nicely slot together in a way that can serve the wider narrative by layering together a shared history - and also result in them being neatly corporately synergised? Yeah, it is, but at the same time, that wider lore building should ideally serve the key stories being told in the here and now of a game or show first and foremost, not the other way around.</p><p>With both the showrunners and the Todd having already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-3-will-be-filmed-next-summer-if-all-goes-plan-showrunners-as-its-showrunners-want-to-keep-their-big-iron-in-the-fire">kicked off chatter about a third series</a> prior to the latest one even going live, the Howard has also revealed - this time to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-season-3-scripts-fallout-76-game-tie-in-1236610167/">Variety</a> - that the two sides are already hard at work deciding how they can do Fallout game stuff to coincide with that next series.</p>
<p>"For us on the game and TV show side, we’re writing season three now," Fairly Todd Parents said. "We’re having those conversations now of, what are we doing in season three for the TV show and what elements can we bring into our games at that time when it comes out that don’t feel forced or fake." So, more crossover like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Gogginsy Burning Springs update</a> being lined up ahead of time, which to be fair is vastly superior to people having to shout en-masse 'Where be the new Fallouty bits now you've whetted my appetite?'</p>
<p>Fallout 5, as of writing, is still without a release date. One assumes that it'll drop around the year 453689386890290906789, a little bit after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">The Elder Scrolls 6 arrives in 303689386890290906789</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-dlc-mega-dimension-special-scan-2000654217</link>
            <guid>1386163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There were two things I wanted most out of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu</span></a><span> and the return of Latias to my party. The dragon/psychic monster has been a favorite of mine for over 20 years, and she’s been a mainstay of my team in every game she’s featured in. Latias is flying around the Hyperspace Lumiose City featured in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but I still haven’t caught her yet. Why? </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s maddening grind makes catching her and several other Legendary monsters a game of chance, harkening back to some of the more frustrating capture mechanics of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s past that the series</span> <span>has mostly gotten away from.</span></p> <p><span>Latias, along with several other Legendary Pokémon who aren’t tied to the main plot, is gated behind a mechanic called Special Scans. These allow you to find rare pockets of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s Hyperspace that include powerful trainers to battle, valuable loot, and, in some cases, Legendary monsters you won’t be able to find anywhere else. All of that is well and good, but the mere act of acquiring a Special Scan is already such a time sink that the randomization of what follows makes the whole process an almost insulting waste of your time.</span></p>

 <p><span>To get a Special Scan, you have to grind through </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s various mini-quests in Hyperspace. These are typically simple objectives like beating trainers in the Battle Zones, capturing a certain number of Pokémon, or finding loot in the mirrored city. Each of these gives you intel points to contribute to the scan, and it’ll take multiple runs through Hyperspace to reach the appropriate number.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The problem is that the results of Special Scans are randomized. You </span><i><span>might</span></i><span> find a Legendary Pokémon, but you may also find a battle zone full of powerful trainers that can’t give you anything beyond more intel points to do another Scan, or you could stumble into an area of Hyperspace filled with Pokémon you’ve already caught. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll find a repeat of one of the Rogue Mega Evolution boss fights, which remain one of the best parts of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but if you’re trying to find the monsters you need to fill the Pokédex, even those feel like a barrier you can’t get around.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654219"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654219">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There’s no way to game the system and manipulate these scans to lead you where you want to go, and even if they do take you to a Legendary Pokémon’s lair, there’s no guarantee that you’ll go back to Lumiose City with one in a Poké Ball. I’ve put more than 20 hours into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> and have only found two Legendary Pokémon through these methods, and neither of them was Latias. When I happened upon Virizion’s home after hours of grinding and acquiring one of these scans, I searched every square inch of the space for grass/fighting antelope, and couldn’t find it before the time limit ran out. These Special Scan portals close behind you after you leave, willingly or not, so I spent all that time grinding and battling through Special Scan areas with nothing of value in them to get to this point, all for nothing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Gating Legendary monsters behind chance is bad enough, but making it a lengthy grind to even roll the dice artificially inflates an already hefty expansion that relies on the grind to fill out the time between its better moments. If your sole value determination for a video game is how much time it takes up, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>offers that with reckless abandon. If you want to feel like you’re accomplishing something rather than wasting your time, Special Scans are one of the most annoying things </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has implemented in years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In some of the earlier generations, certain Legendary Pokémon were roaming encounters you had to essentially track and follow throughout a region, hoping that you’d stumble upon them in a random battle. This mechanic was notoriously derided, and the series has largely moved away from it, but Special Scans feel like that design philosophy magnified in a way that kills momentum so thoroughly that I’m not sure if I’ll ever actually complete the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>Pokédex. I guess I can live with that, but I’m pretty fucking sad that my girl Latias is waiting for me in Hyperspace, and we might not get to reunite until another game.</span></p>

              <p>The chances are you’ll know developers Butterscotch Shenanigans from their&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games—enormous open-world action games in which you fight, loot and craft your way to victory. However, if you’re an indie game developer, it’ll be their <em>Coffee with Butterscotch</em> podcast that’s most familiar, the long-running show dissecting everything indie for years. But today I draw your attention toward them for something far, far sillier:&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em> is a forthcoming…I’m not sure there’s a genre title for this…game that asks, how many dudes does it take to kill 30 toddlers and a duck-sized horse? So yes, I spoke to them to see what on Earth is going on.</p> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans was created by three brothers—Seth, Sam and Adam Coster—and was originally best known for fun, experimental and superbly animated mobile games, like <a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/flop-rocket"><em>Flop Rocket</em></a>&nbsp;and <em><a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/quadropus-rampage">Quadropus Rampage</a></em>. That is, until <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-game-i-make-before-i-die-fighting-cancer-by-m-1758326409">Sam Coster was diagnosed with stage 4b lymphoma</a>, and the three decided that was the moment to work on something bigger and more substantial. The result was <em>Crashlands</em>, and it proved successful enough, after creating platform game&nbsp;<em>and</em> engine&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/792710/Levelhead/"><em>Levelhead</em></a>, for the team to move on to <em>Crashlands 2</em>.</p>

 <p>With Sam in remission (and, I’m delighted to report, now officially cancer free!), that sequel was a four-and-a-half-year project, with another six months of updates and new content after launch, leaving the three siblings and their newer colleagues really ready to do something else. Something smaller. Something incredibly dumb. Thus <em>How Many Dudes</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654200">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game plays something like an auto-battler, in which you gather an ever-growing group of dudes who must fight teams of enemies of various bizarre natures. You begin the game with a single dude, tasked with fighting a group of 10 toddlers. Yup, right out of the gate. At this stage you’re essentially an observer, watching the battle play out before you, and you’ll either be relieved or horrified to learn you’ll definitely win. As a result you gain $100 to spend on items you can deploy during battles, and also get to select a new dude to add to your team. In that first choice you can pick between a Knight Dude or a Paladin Dude, and obviously each of the many, many dudes has their own stats and skills. From then on, it’s all about picking the right dudes, deploying the right skills at the correct moments, and trying to save enough money to buy revives for all who fall in battle.</p>

 <p>Having played an early build of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the demo being released today</a>, I chatted with Seth Coster about why I’d just spent so long punching crowds of toddlers to death.</p> <p>“First of all, those toddlers are gonna be fine,” Coster assured me. “I have it on good authority that they’re happily munching on hay in a farm upstate.” So that’s a relief. But I still wondered how they got here. What process brings a creative team to an idea like this? “In the past, when starting a new game, we would start by asking what we wanted to play, and then we would try to bring that into the world. It has always worked for us in terms of quality—we’ve found that we can make whatever game we set ourselves on, and we can make it at a high level of polish and fun.”</p>

  <p>Despite this, and despite routinely high review scores, Butterscotch Shenanigans has found it tough to get much attention. “It has always been very difficult to get players, press and streamers to notice our games and talk about them,” says Seth. “And I don’t blame them; there are a trillion games out there!” As a result, the team decided to try a new approach this time. “What can people not stop talking about?” they asked themselves, eventually landing on the internet debate about “how many dudes it would take to beat up a gorilla.”</p>

 <p>“We didn’t even have an idea of what the game would be,” notes Seth, “we just wanted to make it about that. From there we iterated fast with no real roadmap or plan—we prototyped the game during the Game Maker’s Toolkit Jam, so there wasn’t really time to overthink it.”</p>

 <p>Five days later they’d created something that felt to them like a mix between <em>Balatro</em> and&nbsp;<em>TABS</em>, a “roguelike thing,” and people’s response to the jam entry was really positive. “We thought we might’ve just struck gold. Or at least copper.”</p> <p>As bizarre as it all sounds, from what I’ve played this appears to be true. While the first couple of rounds where you have little role might seem strange, it ramps up quickly as your decisions have more effect on the results. Which types of dudes you choose to recruit strongly changes your experience in any run, along with the upgrades and bonuses you pick, and with each battle lasting less than 30 seconds, it’s a quick and bloody process.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000654202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654202"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654202">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So how do you go about deciding the rules here? Who does the research to identify the correct amount of power and skill necessary to win in a fight with 30 duck-sized horses? “An anchor point in the game is the Regular Dude,” explains Seth Coster. He’s the one you start with, the average dude. “Everything in the game is orientated around him—how hard he can hit, and how many hits he can take. So when we’re designing a new enemy, we just ask, ‘Do we think this thing hits twice as hard as a Regular Dude? Five times as hard? TEN? And how many hits can it take compared to a Regular Dude?'”</p>

 <p>So yes, a horse “can probably take lot of punches.” (I hope my mum doesn’t read this article.) A horse-sized duck is the game’s first boss fight, for instance. “Weight classes exist for a reason, and horses are HUGE,” observes Seth. “Plus you gotta get past its flailing legs. Our sophisticated calculations have shown that a horse has 35 times the HP of a Regular Dude, which equates to about 70 seconds worth of regular punches.” Uh-huh. “Trust me, the math is sound.”</p> <p>I wondered, given the nature of that bar discussion topic of how many people it might take to fight a hundred worm-sized tigers and so on, whether the game might also pitch the enemies against one another to decide other natural questions. Who would win in a fight between a horse-sized duck and 100 toddlers? “The game isn’t about the answer,” says Seth very wisely, “it’s about the question. Because the answer to the question can only be, ‘It depends.’ The reason there’s ever a debate about ‘who could win in a fight’ is that the debate is actually about assumptions. How much prep time do the various parties have? If we’re talking about mythical creatures (like lion-sized ants), what kids of liberties are we taking with their capabilities?”</p>

 <p>He’s not done. “If we’re talking about Dudes versus a gorilla, what kinds of Dudes are we talking about? Olympic gymnasts? MMA fighters? Accountants? Marines? And do the Dudes have prep time, or are they just all thrown into the ring with the gorilla without warning?”</p> <p>I’m regretting the question.</p> <p>“The fun of the debate isn’t in having an answer, it’s about exploring all the possibilities. So that’s really what the game has ended up being about! We have LOTS of different types of Dudes in this game, each with their own unique capabilities and limitations. And then we throw them into the ring with a whole bunch of weird opponents to see what happens.”</p> <p>So <em>will</em> the game let the enemies fight, too? No, I’m not asking again. Moving on, I wondered what motivated this return to a smaller, sillier idea, after the success of the <em>Crashlands</em> games. Was it something Butterscotch had missed?</p>

  <p>“Certainly!” says Seth. “When you work on one thing for longer than it takes to get a college degree, you go a little crazy. But also, that one thing tends to take on an outsized importance. When you’re committing that many resources to something, you start to get in your own head about how everything has to be perfect. Especially if you’re trying to make a game that has a big story and lots of world-building.”</p> <p>But in this case? “<span><em>How Many Dudes </em>exists for one reason only: to be fun and stupid. It’s not trying to say anything important. It’s not trying to be anything other than what it is: a goofy game. So whenever we think of something that makes us chuckle, we just throw it in there. We don’t have to ask about the story implications, or whether it ‘fits’ with the world, or how it’s going to integrate into some larger vision for the game.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000654199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654199"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654199">© Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></figure> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans has always been a very mobile-forward developer, but also one that charges a price for its games instead of littering them with ads and IAPs. Given just how dire things feel in mobile spaces for premium games, I wondered if this is still viable. “I’m not gonna lie…” says Coster. “It’s rough. Over the past nine years, our mobile revenue for new premium launches has declined by about 90 percent. I’m not sure whether others are experiencing the same thing, but that’s one data point for you. On the flipside, Google Play Pass and Apple Arcade do offer much clearer paths to success for a premium game—provided you can get into either of them.”</p> <p>This is why the company has shifted to cross-platform launches. “We plan to launch <em>How Many Dudes</em> on Steam, Google Play and the App Store,” says Seth, “and maybe Xbox if the Game Pass team reads this article and wants to give us a call…”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654203">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I highly recommend those&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games, by the way. They feel perfect on a tablet, playable in short bursts, and come with hours and hours of stuff to do. And their daunting scale certainly does suggest a daunting amount of work. Do those games put pressure on the studio to have to match them, or even go bigger, spend more, raise ambitions ever-higher? “There are always expectations and demands,” says the Coster brother, “but that comes with the territory. Players will never stop asking for more sequels and more features and more updates, but that’s just them expressing that they love a thing and want more of it. In a weird way, those player demands don’t create pressure; they just create guidance on possible next steps.”</p> <p>The real pressure, says Coster, comes from within the team. Previous games have been about proving something to themselves, proving they’re capable of making long-lasting “hobby games” (<em>Levelhead</em>) or big and intricate games (<em>Crashlands 2</em>). “But in both cases, those were pressures we put on ourselves.&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em>, on the other hand, feels pretty light by comparison. We’re not out to prove anything about our skills or capabilities. We’re just making something fun.”</p> <p><em>You can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the&nbsp;How Many Dudes demo right now from Steam</a>, and go slaughter ducks and toddlers to your heart’s content.</em></p>
