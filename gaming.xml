            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-concert-announced-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a new PlayStation concert tour that will bring the brand's "most iconic gaming soundtracks to life", with music from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>,&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and more featuring on the program.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/15/announcing-playstation-the-concert-world-tour-2025-2026/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the PlayStation Blog, Sony promises "thrilling music, cutting-edge visuals, and legendary video game titles" during the concert, as well as "innovative technology and world-class production" powering the show.</p>
<p>You'll be able to hear music that features a "stunning fusion of multi-layered visuals, immersive surround sound, and an all-star ensemble blending classical and modern instruments".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-concert-ghost-of-tsushima.jpg?itok=yCR2Mvfb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-concert-ghost-of-tsushima.jpg?itok=_-klURD_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Music from&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>,&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and more will be featured in the new PlayStation concert.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony says it'll be featuring music from franchises "that reflect our 30 years of making games".&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>all get a mention, but hopefully, that means you'll also hear some music from older franchises as well.&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bloodborne"><em>Bloodborne</em></a>, anyone?</p>
<p>The PlayStation concert tour will begin with a world premiere on April 15th, which will take place in Dublin in Ireland. From there, the concert will head to "more than 200 cities across Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, and beyond".</p>
<p>At the moment, only the European tour dates have been announced, and they'll take the concert to all kinds of places, including the Netherlands, France, Italy, Switzerland, and more.</p>

<p>According to Sony, more tour locations around the world will be revealed "very soon", so if you don't see your city in the PlayStation Blog announcement post, you might just want to hang on a while.</p>
<p>If you want to grab tickets, you'll get the opportunity to do so by heading to the event's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/www.playstation.com/theconcert" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> (which didn't seem to be operational at time of writing) and using the code PLAYCONCERT24, which Sony says "will be usable from 7am PT tomorrow" (that's 10am Eastern).</p>
<p>Naturally, Sony isn't revealing a full program for the concert yet, but we may well get a glimpse into more of the music that will be featured at the show in the coming months. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>If you've read any of my stuff by now, you'd know that I am a simple man who enjoys violence in his games. No story? Absolutely fine by me - cuts the faff. This is why I like the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cop-bastard">Cop Bastard</a> a lot. It's set in early 90s Japan, where you'll smoke fools with guns in straightforward homage to 90s action movies. And it has an updated demo - not officially part of the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> - out right now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are several things I like about Cop Bastard. The first is its look: slightly VCR, slightly N64 Golden Eye, with its blocky enemies. The environments you shoot people in also seem well-judged, in that they are believable yet expressly designed to complement your bullets. There's a nice mixture of little office spaces where sheathes of paper rocket into the air, or potted plants in corridors that'll splinter into an earthy mess as you shotgun a lad in the head. You might happen upon a room with a vintage Japanese poster for a movie with a young Keanu Reeves in.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Another thing I like is the punch. You've got a few weapons: a pistol, a shotgun, an uzi, and a magnum. All of which feel like they should and have adequate heft. Enemies aren't clever, per se, but they are a joy to blast. They ragdoll nicely in shafts of blood, occasionally calling you a "motherfucker", which I delight in.</p><p>Press H once you've built up a meter by killing dudes and you'll enter a slightly off-feeling slow-mo mode that makes aiming easier, I think? Really, I wanted a cool slide or a dive for the ultimate John Woo factor - but maybe those are coming in the full game.</p>
<p>You can give the demo a go over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2174740/COP_BASTARD_demo/">Steam</a> if you like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Something else to take note of with Nintendo Switch games sold through Woot is that they're marked as region-free, so you might not get a US version of what you buy. This isn't an issue as one of the major differences you're seeing is a change in rating logo boxes, but if you are considering purchasing DLC, you could run into a few regional hurdles. For example, if the game you get is a UK version, you'll need to purchase from the UK eShop to get the DLC. Most of the games listed here--and below--don't have DLC, so you're largely in the clear.

A compilation of 50 full games evoking the 8-bit era, styled as a library from a long-lost fictional studio, created by the real-world developers who have given the world projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spelunky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skorpulac</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catacomb</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Downwell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Without exaggeration, that sounds like a retro player (and pixel art enthusiast)'s dream come true.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While that sounds hyberbolic, the team appears to have truly pulled it off. The game launched on September 18 to plenty of acclaim (and currently, overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that I've played a bunch of the games in the collection (and watched dozens of hours of streams), I've been most taken by the marriage of design decisions that play with old-school and retro convention and the team's full commitment to striking 8-and-16-bit pixel art. I had the opportunity to send along a few questions to developers Derek Yu, Tyriq Plummer and Eirik Suhrke, focusing on the project's style holistically, the challenges of getting the 8-bit era's multitude of looks </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>just right</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the utter delight of the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/ufo-50">UFO 50</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/ufo-50"> color palette.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>First off, I know this was a huge collaboration (and undertaking!)—to create 50 games with a coherent visual language, style, and connective threads among them. While I am mostly going to ask about the visual aspects of the project, I want to start off with a basic production question. Did you produce the games individually as separate projects, or share assets/code across the spectrum while you were developing each title (and the meta elements?)</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyriq Plummer: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">From a technology standpoint, the games were all made as sort of sub-projects in a larger overarching project which provided some essential shared infrastructure, including handling textboxes and certain particle effects, collision code or movement engines and such. There are also just generally a decent number of shared assets across the games; you’ll notice if you play for instance: "Oh hey I remember that rock from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Velgress</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">" or “This enemy in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caramel Caramel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks really familiar" and stuff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it may have largely been a side-effect of just being efficient in terms of not wanting to make unnecessary work, it’s also pretty fun to be able to connect those dots and have a feeling sometimes that certain would-be-inconsequential enemies and tiles and such get to take on a certain "cameo" quality, sneaking in where you might not expect them and getting to go: "You again!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Derek Yu: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, the technical limitations of our resolution, palette, and color rules were probably the main unifying factors, since we worked separately a lot (in parallel is maybe more accurate). We did end up sharing quite a bit of tech, as Tyriq mentioned, but I always thought it was funny that the final collection has three different platform engines in it, for example. Some things you just want to be a certain way for your own comfort!</span></p><p>Via Mossmouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The further we got into development, the more everyone worked on everyone else’s games and the more sharing it felt like we did. And we were all looking for ways to connect the games together visually, thematically, narratively, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Regardless of the overall approach, how did you manage to work with a very consistent look and feel, even across genres/styles (and truly, the evolutionary epochs that were present in the comparatively short time of the 8-bit era)? Each game here (that I have played thus far) feels like a lost NES game, which I can only imagine was a huge undertaking.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Plummer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I can't speak to the early process since I joined once all of those restrictions and stuff were already kind of laid down, but I mostly took my cues from what was already extant in the games when I started working on them, and just kind of made judgment calls as to what seemed like a reasonable thing on a case-by-case basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think there were a couple times when someone (Eirik) pointed out that I should pull back on the particle effects or something because the number of sprites on screen drifted out-of-spec, but for the most part I think there’s great value in these sorts of aesthetic restrictions that can actually make things easier than not having them, because you don’t have such a paralyzingly vast possibility space. When you know where the bounds are and they’re clearly defined, you can immediately rule out a lot of dead ends and get closer to something workable much faster.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I think starting with a consistent set of limitations and then everyone being very open to following each other's lead is what led to the final collection feeling so unified. A game that one person started would eventually go through multiple passes by multiple different people, and you pick up a lot of cool things from each other that way. We all have our own distinct styles and it was important to keep that intact, but over eight years of working together this way I’m sure that we’re all a little more similar to one another than when we started</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There are a few cases of fairly direct homages—both in the spritework and in genre/mechanics—to existing NES games, and some cases where I can't find a direct predecessor. Did you mine trusty sources like MobyGames/VG Museum etc. for inspiration, or rely more on existing memory/other inspirations here in creating the various games? Were there any particularly weird or interesting inspirations in the bunch? Did anyone have a beloved obscure game from the era they got to highlight in the course of creating </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We have a Slack channel called "coolstuff" where we share inspirational screenshots, box art, flyers, playthroughs, etc., that we come across. I think Eirik and I both spend a lot of time following accounts that post those kinds of things. NES was certainly a big inspiration, but we were also influenced by arcade games, PC Engine, MSX, and PC-88… a lot of which we experienced only through the internet. Jon and I grew up digging through troves of freeware and shareware games on DOS and Windows, as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During development, I did look up NES title screens to get a sense for how they were put together and what the possibilities were there—title screens weren’t something I thought about deeply as a kid, particularly the details of the text and the transitions to and from. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vgmaps.com/">VGMaps</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was also a helpful resource and I remember looking at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ninja Gaiden II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in particular to try and understand how they made their levels feel so dynamic and three-dimensional given the limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of times the best inspiration comes from some fleeting encounter, though. For example, I’ve never played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Otocky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King’s Quest V</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the NES, but seeing a few screenshots here and there has really stuck with me over the years. Both games have a compelling style that’s out of my comfort zone—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Otocky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with its vibrant, geometric shading and King’s Quest at the opposite end with its muddy and messy texturing. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the perfect opportunity to learn from everything we could and experiment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eirik Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> One thing I would do while helping massage our palette into shape was to pull in screenshots of other exciting, cool or curious looking games from all kinds of different 8- and 16-bit systems to see what they would look like truncated down to our specific color set. This helped highlight some of the strengths we could lean into as well as illuminate some of the shortcomings we might want to iterate on still. I think a lot of 80s and 90s pixel art and tiling idioms also could have rubbed off on me as I was scrutinizing it like this as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>On that note, were there cases where specific visual design elements impacted gameplay or mechanics? Did something ever just look so cool/fun/weird that you felt the need to make a game out of it or go a particular direction with a mechanic/feature?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Campanella 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a rail shooter of sorts, definitely grew out of a fascination with 2D-based pseudo-3D in general and a question of what that could look and feel like within our framework. For example, we chose not to allow sprite scaling which meant here every enemy had to be manually rendered out for every applicable distance. Once the art and the depth perspective code was in and feeling cool it was just a matter of designing a game that was fun to play around that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Plummer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I think when I first played an early version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valbrace</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> my immediate thought was "this is rad and also these enemies super need to be able to jump into the background." The strong perspective of the classic first-person dungeon crawler necessarily leads to a kind of visual depth, and that depth carrying over during fights immediately made me want to make that extra visual space be mechanically relevant in combat as well.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bushido Ball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the presence of the referee also made me want him to have a more active role than just as a background character, so I made him give penalties for things like letting the ball rest for too long or hitting your opponent directly with your sword and stuff. I think that really made the game feel more alive and characterful, in addition to all the actual gameplay implications. Like—now you can imagine that this is a sport with a governing body that actually makes these rules, and suddenly there’s a small bit of a torn edge to the page instead of a clean cut, where you can fill in for yourself what lies beyond. I love that kind of stuff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What went into creating the UFO 50 palette (which is a fun one to play with!)—did you have original NES constraints in mind, or were you instead going after a sense of "how you might remember" these colors looking?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> My initial goal was to create a pretty broad palette of colors that included "useful" colors like greens for vegetation, blues for water and sky, etc., but also splashed some "fun" colors like pink and turquoise. I read up on how other people theorycrafted palettes and studied some of the more striking-looking NES games… at one point I believe Eirik posted some beautiful screenshots of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kickmaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Low G Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a reference for what he liked. But we also examined the palettes of other consoles, too.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually I passed the palette over to Eirik and he adjusted it quite a bit to turn it into what we have today.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I believe some of the pink/peach tones as well as the slime green were definitely influenced by the NES palette directly, whereas our sour yellow was more inspired by the MSX palette.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, at a certain point it became more about tweaking it to serve the specific needs we were seeing as we were developing the games. Specifically, we were happy with our mid tones but needed more dark colors for backgrounds and bright colors for highlights so we started nudging some around until the right compromise was made.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and NIS America have announced the&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG set to arrive in the West in February.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>launches on Valentine's Day in the West. It'll have some stiff competition, with the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day">Date Everything!</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>&nbsp;</em>vying for your attention on that date as well.</p>
<p>As you'd expect,&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>picks up where the original&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>left off. It once again follows the adventures of Van Arkride, a spriggan (think bounty hunter crossed with detective) who must investigate a series of murders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date-fishing.jpg?itok=DuCcs5GS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date-fishing.jpg?itok=LdxTfC-E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Van Arkride might have some murders to investigate, but that doesn't mean he can't stop for a spot of fishing.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, although&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2</em>&nbsp;takes the form of a murder investigation in terms of its plot and setup, it's still offering exactly the kind of classic action-RPG combat you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Daybreak&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>Two new systems, Cross Charge and EX Chains, have been introduced. Cross Charge lets you bring in a party member to deal damage if you manage to successfully pull off a perfect dodge, while EX Chains deal huge damage to stunned enemies once certain battle conditions have been met.</p>
<p>Each act of&nbsp;<em>Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>will contain multiple chapters, and some of those chapters may focus on Van's friends rather than him, as the party will frequently split up to deal with multiple issues in different locations.</p>
<p>Some chapters will even require the special skills of certain party members, like Swin's tailing skills or Mare's orbal hacking capabilities.</p>

<p>Given that the original&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>only <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date">launched in the West this past July</a>, it's nice that you won't have to wait too long to check out the sequel.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668430/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_through_Daybreak_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004596" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Nintendo Switch on February 14th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft has announced the Xbox Game Pass Wave 2 October 2024 lineup.</p><p>The headline here is of course the October 25 release of Black Ops 6, the first Call of Duty game to launch day-one on Game Pass. It comes a year after Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which has also seen the likes of Diablo 4 and Modern Warfare 3 arrive on Game Pass, and will, in November, see StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection hit the subscription service.</p><p>Black Ops 6’s launch straight into Game Pass is a big gamble for Microsoft. It hopes the power of Call of Duty will boost subscriber numbers and revenue (itself bolstered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">the recent Game Pass price rise and restructure</a>), but it comes with the risk of losing sales of the full-price game. While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed. "Well, there's a different person making the decisions," Spencer laughed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>In the shorter term, tomorrow, October 16, South Park: The Fractured but Whole (Cloud, Console, and PC) hits Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. A day later, on October 17, Donut County (Cloud, Console, and PC) returns to the Game Pass library via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard, and MechWarrior 5: Clans (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) hits Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass as a day-one release.</p><p>Then it’s the big one: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Cloud, Console, and PC) on October 25 via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass only.

There are a few miscellaneous and collectible trophies thrown in too, as well as the party member-specific trophies — although, curiously, not for completing a romance storyline.</p><p>BioWare games traditionally do include achievements for romancing characters, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> appears to be taking a different, perhaps more Platinum-friendly approach.</p><p>The names of the achievements tied to those story beats suggest various plot developments, locations, and even the final boss, so it’s worth a PSA for the perhaps inevitable ramping up of Dragon Age: The Veilguard spoilers on the internet as we near the release date.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-settles-gamers-antitrust-lawsuit-over-69-billion-activision-blizzard-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft has settled the antitrust lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of gamers who objected to the company’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-lawsuit-gamers-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, details of the settlement were undisclosed, but we do know the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, which means it cannot be filed again. Lawyers agreed that "each party shall bear their own costs and fees."</p><p>The lawsuit was filed back in 2022 in California by a group of gamers from across multiple states who expressed concern about the potential negative impact of a Microsoft monopoly in the video game space sparked by absorbing the makers of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, among many other games. It came soon after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began its work to block the deal from closing, work that ultimately failed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>The lawsuit had claimed that if Microsoft were to acquire Activision Blizzard, it could lead to the company prioritizing Xbox versions of multiplatform games, prices going up, or the cancelation of certain games. There was specific concern about the potential impact on Game Pass subscribers should the buyout go through.</p><p>Since Microsoft successfully acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, Game Pass has changed significantly. It’s slowly added Activision Blizzard games to the subscription service (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-with-xbox-game-pass">with Black Ops 6 set to be the first mainline Call of Duty game to launch in Game Pass day-one later this month</a>), but it’s also restructured Game Pass itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-standard-tier-doesnt-include-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-starfield-diablo-4-and-more">Day-one releases are now not a part of Game Pass’ revised basic tier</a>, and big-ticket games such as Diablo 4, Starfield, and Call of Duty are reserved for the more expensive Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass subscriptions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">Microsoft has also raised the price of Game Pass</a>, most recently in July when Xbox Game Pass Ultimate increased from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">The price increase was described as inevitable</a> by analysts speaking with IGN, with some predicting that Game Pass will eventually see the introduction of ads. The changes are said to be part of a push by Xbox to recoup some of its $69 billion investment in Activision Blizzard.</p><p>In response, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftc-blasts-xbox-game-pass-price-increase-and-new-tiers-as-product-degradation">the FTC called out Microsoft's Game Pass price rises</a> and labeled the new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier a "degraded product." The FTC claimed Microsoft was "exercising market power post-merger" of Activision Blizzard with its controversial changes to Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft responded to the FTC's filing about Xbox Game Pass price increases, calling the FTC’s complaint a "misleading, extra-record account of the facts." It insisted the FTC was wrong to call Game Pass Standard a “degraded” version because it includes multiplayer.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Microsoft has also cut an eye-watering 2,550 staff from its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard</a>, with multiple studios falling by the wayside. In February, the FTC claimed Microsoft contradicted its intentions during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">when it laid off 1,900 employees from its games division in January</a>.</p><p>FTC lawyer Imad Abyad argued that Microsoft said it wanted Activision to "operate as a limited-integration studio." But because Activision staff were among those affected by the layoffs, Abyad claimed this contradicted Microsoft’s prior claim. Microsoft responded to insist Activision Blizzard had already planned mass layoffs regardless of whether the acquisition was completed.</p><p>“As time passes, Microsoft continues to increase its market power, prices have increased, games continue to be canceled, development capacities continue to diminish, and Game Pass continues to trend towards a monopoly,” attorney Joseph Saveri said in a court filing.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising-announced-by-netease.1009869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase and Bungie have announced&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em>, a mobile spinoff of the hugely popular MMORPG-FPS hybrid&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>, and it's getting a closed alpha playtest next month.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20240930/41118_1181986.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, NetEase describes&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>as a "new epic free-to-play mobile sci-fi RPG shooter" with a variety of playable heroes, a "shared world", and several game modes. It'll offer both first-person and third-person shooter gameplay.</p>
<p>The game will take place "within the rich tapestry of the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe" and will be both developed and published by NetEase itself, although naturally, the game is officially licensed by Bungie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-rising-mobile-spinoff-shooting.jpg?itok=iWUcjBA6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-rising-mobile-spinoff-shooting.jpg?itok=DGCVFYiA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>will take place within the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe, but perhaps not quite as you know it.</figcaption></figure><p>NetEase says that&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>will be set "in an alternate&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>timeline" and will explore a story "in the post-Dark Age era", likely to avoid any chance of tangling up the series' canon ahead of Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-new-release-cadence">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>efforts</a>.</p>
<p>The game will feature single-player, co-op, and competitive gameplay, just like&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>itself, and will also feature both "game modes familiar to&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>players" and "all-new modes that introduce new ways" to experience the core gameplay.</p>
<p>NetEase senior VP Ethan Wang says the aim with&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>is to "deliver a&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>-caliber experience to mobile devices", promising an "action-packed RPG shooter set within the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em>, which shows off the world of the game and just a little hint of gameplay towards the end, right here.</p>

<p>In addition to releasing this trailer, NetEase has also released a developer preview in which NetEase and Bungie staffers talk about exactly what&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>is and how they're building it. You can check that video out here.</p>

<p><em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can sign up to get a chance to be part of the game's first closed alpha test in November by <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">visiting its official website</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-bog-witch-update-ptr</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-brings-new-trader-new-mechanic-and-more-to-ptr.1009866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-bog-witch-update-ptr<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iron Gate and Coffee Stain have released a new&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>update on the game's public test realm, and it brings a new trader, a major new game mechanic, and more. Be aware that we'll be spoiling some of what's included in this update, so read on at your peril!</p>
<p>The update is currently available to try out in&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>'s beta, and its first major addition is the titular Bog Witch, a new trader who has new goods for you to buy. She can be found in the Swamps, and she'll sell you ingredients and materials for brewing potions.</p>
<p>She's also got things that will be useful for the update's new Feast mechanic, which lets you cook large meals you can share amongst several players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-food.jpg?itok=f3UazCDN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-food.jpg?itok=N2-vrynr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>The Bog Witch update brings a new mechanic for you to check out and lots more.</figcaption></figure><p>Three new skills are being introduced in this update: Cooking, Farming, and Crafting.</p>
<p>Cooking reduces food crafting time and gives you the chance to gain another food while crafting. Farming reduces Cultivator stamina cost and increases farming item durability, while Crafting reduces item crafting time and boosts crafting item durability. It's all pretty simple stuff.</p>
<p>You'll also find lots of new crafting materials and potions to try out, as well as some new emotes to help you communicate with your friends and much more besides.</p>

<p>You can read this update's patch notes, which also contain a ton of bug fixes and minor gameplay improvements, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/7514910232818862414" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a> if you wish.</p>
<p>Unlike previous major&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>updates along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-ashlands-update-ptr-launch">Ashlands</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-mistlands-update-available-public-test-branch">Mistlands</a>, this update doesn't add any new biomes or creatures for you to fight, but it's still a pretty substantial addition to the world of&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>nonetheless.</p>
<p>If you want to join the beta branch and check out this game, you can do so by heading to the game's Properties menu in your Steam library. From there, select Betas and enter the code "yesimadebackups", which will grant you access to the PTR.</p>
<p>Xbox players, meanwhile, should use the Xbox Insider Hub app to find&nbsp;the "<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>Public Test" option within the Previews menu.</p>
<p><em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/valheim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

Here is a breakdown of every set and how we’ve been able to earn them.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Shenron)</strong> - The most iconic set from the franchise, one that resides on planet Earth and summons Shenron. Finishing some of Whis’s missions can earn you a full set. They otherwise seem to have a small chance of dropping during offline or online battles. Those who bought the Season Pass will also receive one free wish to use.</li><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Porunga)</strong> - The second set introduced, residing on Planet Namek, and summoning Porunga. These seem to have an even smaller chance of dropping during battles.</li><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Super Shenron)</strong> - The most powerful set that summons Super Shenron. One set can be earned from completing Goku’s Episode Battles, while another can be earned from Trunks’ Episode Battles. It seems likely that these could drop from offline and online battles as well, but if they do, they must have the lowest chances of all. Those who purchased the Ultimate Edition get one free wish to use.</li></ul><p>Given that we can confirm at least two of them will drop from Battles, you’ll want to complete as many as possible. <strong>The most effective method I’ve found for farming Dragon Balls is to play a Battle against a CPU on the World Tournament Stage, with Out-of-Bounds rules on.</strong> All you need to do to win is knock them off the stage and onto the ground. I acquired Dragon Balls more often when playing on higher difficulties, although you might enjoy the pacing of fighting against a weaker CPU.</p><p>Equipping some ability items to raise your Ki is a fantastic strategy if you can combo into a Beam or Blast Super. Starting a match with Gogeta Blue’s Stardust Blaster against Hercule or a larger opponent is practically guaranteed to send them out of bounds. Another option is to go in as Great Ape Vegeta and try to throw the opponent out of the ring, which can feel pretty cathartic after fighting the big monster. No matter who you use, your goal should be to finish a match within 30 seconds.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-great-ape-vegeta-guide-1851669880&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-great-ape-vegeta-guide-1851669880">Struggling With <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Great Ape Vegeta? We’ve Got You</a></span></p><p>I do want to share a word of caution though: <strong>you cannot collect more Dragon Balls once you have a full set</strong>. A message will pop up to say that you can’t accept another one of the same type because you have too many. I held onto mine in hopes that it would make it more likely for the other types to pop up, but I ended up with more messages if anything. You should aim to use the Dragon Ball sets as soon as possible.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-recommend-id="image://62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-recommend-id="image://62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Summoning Shenron gives you access to a single wish. I’d argue he’s middle of the pack in what he offers, but that depends entirely on what you want to unlock. Here are your choices with this dragon:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>I want more Zeni</strong> - Grants 300,000 Zeni</li><li><strong>I want you to raise my Player Level</strong> - One of the first things I did after the tutorial was summon Shenron and choose this wish. I was pretty happy with the result, as it increased my Player Level to 8 and expanded the Shop quite a bit.</li><li><strong>I want more Titles</strong> - These are titles for your Player Card.</li><li><strong>I want New Outfits </strong>- These are cosmetic options for specific characters.

But one day, a shocking series of murders involving a mysterious <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son beast sets the wheels of fate in motion once again. Various factions spring into <a title="Genres > Action [2,243 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> – both those who abide by the law to uncover the truth and those looking to capitalize on any new developments wherever possible, no matter how sinister.</p><p>With chaos once again looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor, prompting his own investigation. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? The sands of time bring old and new faces together for this thrilling second installment in the <em><a title="Series > Trails [62 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/trails">Trails</a> through Daybreak</em> saga.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Year 1209 of the Septian Calendar.</p><p>The threat posed by Almata has passed. Peace has finally returned to Calvard. And, for a time, that peace goes uninterrupted—until a CID special forces unit is slaughtered by an unknown assailant.</p><p>With authorities working to contain the situation, criminal forces take the chance to make their own moves.</p><p>Meanwhile, a spriggan by the name of Van Arkride begins his own investigation—after prompting from an unexpected visitor.</p><p>Who could be responsible for this massacre? What was their objective? And how does it all relate to Agnes’ search for the eighth Genesis?</p><p>A crimson beast’s roar. A chance meeting with a boy and girl, both embroiled in a mysterious search. These are the circumstances that lure Arkride Solutions down the trail of an inescapable fate.</p><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Battle System</strong> – The game builds on the seamless transition between field battles and command battles introduced in the previous game with new mechanics that can be used in both: Cross Charge &amp; EX Chains! Mastering the use of these two combo mechanics can provide you with overwhelming firepower to use against your opponents.</li><li><strong>Cross Charge</strong> – If you manage to Perfect Dodge an enemy’s attack during a field battle, the Cross Charge icon will appear! Pushing the correct button while the icon is on-screen will swap in another party member, who will simultaneously execute a charge attack on your foe! As a bonus, the party member that you swap in will have enhanced attack power for a period of time.</li><li><strong>EX Chains</strong> – EX Chains can be activated by fulfilling specific conditions during command battles. Once these conditions have been met, using a craft or normal attack against a stunned enemy will automatically activate an EX Chain! This allows party members with SCLM activated to launch a simultaneous attack that will also impact nearby enemies, dealing massive damage.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Chapters</strong> – Van and his collaborators will not always travel together during the events of Trails through Daybreak II. At times, some of the group may split off in order to take care of tasks in different areas of Calvard concurrently. Because of this, each act contains multiple chapters you can play in any order. Progress the story in the order you choose! Each chapter features a different cast of characters as we see their side of the act’s story play out. Once you’ve completed your chosen chapter, the next one will start up automatically.</li><li><strong>Unique Missions</strong> – Certain chapters will feature missions that utilize the unique skillsets of the characters in that chapter’s party. For example, directly controlling the holo core AI, <a title="Games > Mare" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a>, to hack the orbal network, or using Swin to silently tail a suspicious individual.</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Van Arkride</strong> – The man at the head of Arkride Solutions. A lover of sweets, saunas, and orbal cars. Due to his job as a spriggan, Van has a tendency to take on legally-questionable jobs. However, the fact that he occasionally walks on the edge of the law does not preclude him from doing good by others—as is evidenced by his numerous personal contacts. While tracking down the Oct-Geneses at Agnes’ request, Van developed the ability to transform into an armored form known as the Grendel with the help of Mare, the holo core installed within his combat orbment. It was with this new ability that he was able to fend off the mafia group known as Almata. Having once terrorized the entirety of the Republic, Almata was eventually brought to its knees by the Arkride Solutions team during the fight for the Oct-Geneses. Upon the quelling of this threat, however, they decided to temporarily go their separate ways. Now left to himself in a less-than- lively office, Van is free to return to his lone-wolf lifestyle once more.</li><li><strong>Agnes Claudel</strong> – A first-year at the prestigious Aramis Academy who currently serves on its Student Council. Despite her polite manner of speaking and at times meek demeanor, Agnes has shown great strength and determination while employed at Arkride Solutions—especially when facing off against the seedy underbelly of society. Agnes first met Van while searching for eight prototype orbments known as the Oct-Geneses, which she inherited from her great-grandfather. As thanks for taking on her request, she began working as one of Arkride Solution’s part-time assistants. At present, Agnes has recovered seven of the eight Geneses. Unfortunately, while continuing her search for the last remaining Genesis, she’s had no choice but to also divide her time between preparing for the Aramis Academy Festival and periodically helping out around Arkride Solutions. Regarding her relationship with Van, she both respects and admires him as her employer. However, she seems to be harboring some more amorous feelings for him as well…</li><li><strong>Elaine Auclair</strong> – An A-rank bracer affiliated with the Calvard branch of the Bracer Guild. She is occasionally referred to by the moniker “Beauty’s Blade.” Due to her dignified beauty and masterful skill with a sword, Elaine tends to catch the eye of the media more often than not. Unfortunately, this also leads to talent agencies offering her contracts for modeling and acting—she always declines. Outside of being the poster girl for the Bracer Guild, Elaine has no present interest in joining the world of entertainment. During her high school years, she enjoyed a brief and fleeting romance with Van before he suddenly vanished without so much as a word. It was only recently, after seven years, that the two were able to reunite. Although their lingering feelings for each other have left their current relationship a bit tense, their time fighting Almata together was able to strengthen their bond once more. Some time after the events involving Almata and the Oct-Geneses, Elaine received word that the Central Intelligence Department’s elite Gamma Squad had been brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, and that a ‘crimson’ monster was spotted at the scene of the crime…</li></ul><p><strong>World</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Republic of Calvard</strong> – A large country located in the central region of the Zemurian continent. Its current leader is President Roy Gramheart. Due to the unfortunate circumstances created by the desertification of eastern Zemuria, Calvard has a substantial history of receiving both immigrants and refugees. The resulting mixture of cultures and ethnicities has made the country into something of a melting pot. One hundred years ago, Calvard was under the heel of its monarchal rulers. It was only after Sheena Dirke and her compatriots brought about a democratic revolution that the nation was transformed into a democratic republic. Though in constant conflict with Erebonia over the control of bordering regions, Calvard has recently been on the receiving end of reparations from the empire following the Battle of Jormungandr. These reparations enabled Calvard to enter a period of rapid growth and development, leading to its eventual overtake of Erebonia as the most powerful nation on the continent. Regarding the region’s recreational interests, recent technological advancements in orbal vehicles and filmmaking have caused a boom in both the motorsports and orbal cinema industries.</li><li><strong>Messeldam</strong> – A moderate-sized city located in the north of Calvard. Due to its long-standing role as one of the Northern Sea’s major trading ports, Messeldam was often tasked during the days of monarchal rule with the delivery of imports to the capital of Oracion—along with fresh seafood, of course. Although the port remains active to this day, developments in airship technology have greatly diminished its significance. The city itself, however, remains an important gateway to Remiferia and its surrounding nations. Unlike Langport, Messeldam possesses very few tourist destinations. That being said, the townscape’s architecture tends to be quite popular with visitors, as its design has seen little change in the past century. The city’s Eastern and Central Eastern populations are fairly meager due to its geographical location. As such, it lacks a community that values cultural traditionalism. This has, fortunately, been a boon for Messeldam, as new art movements and customs are accepted with relative ease. It was this very attitude that led to the city serving as the venue for the Orbal Film Festival for a number of years, until its relocation to Tharbad in 1208.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Western Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Trails through Daybreak II -  Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPowp3vGuz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bandai Namco is reportedly cutting its Japanese workforce and cancelling a number of projects due to lacklustre demand.</p>
<p>The news comes as the company reports huge sales of its latest anime game release Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! Zero.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> has reported, staff are not being directly laid off. Instead, since April around 200 of the roughly 1300 staff at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bandai-namco-studios">Bandai Namco Studios</a> in Japan have been sent to rooms with nothing to do, putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily. Almost 100 people have resigned in this manner, according to Bloomberg sources.</p>

<p>These rooms are known as oidashi beya and are utilised due to strict labour laws in Japan. Many employees use these rooms to job hunt before leaving voluntarily.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, Bandai Namco denied the use of these rooms.</p>
<p>"Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge," said a representative from Bandai Namco. "There is no organisation like an 'oidashi beya' at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily."</p>
<p>Bandai Namco has overhauled its game lineup, resulting in 21 billion yen in writedowns (£107m) in the three quarters leading to December.</p>
<p>The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Japan-only MMORPG Blue Protocol was cancelled in August</a>, ahead of its Amazon Games published worldwide release. Mobile game Tales of the Rays was also shut down in July in Japan.</p>
<p>Reportedly, several other projects have been cancelled or paused, including based on popular anime Naruto and One Piece, and a project commissioned by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The news follows the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> last week, also based on a popular anime, which sold more than 3m units in its first 24 hours on sale. On <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/">Steam</a> it's already reached a peak concurrent player count of over 122k players, with plenty more players across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It’s party time in party plaza with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and what promises to be the biggest Mario Party game ever. Following the ups and downs of their last few attempts, before the fan-pleasing throwback of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/28/mario-party-superstars-review/">Mario Party Superstars</a>, Nintendo Cube is sticking to the tried and true. That doesn’t mean there isn’t space for new ideas, and modes that answer some niche requests from the community, though.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Party Jamboree – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKR6sdcO4ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The basics of Mario Party are here.&nbsp;Dice roll up to 10, Stars cost 20 coins, and some of the boards –&nbsp;there’s five new and two remakes –&nbsp;can initially boggle the mind with complex routes and events that completely upend all your plans.</p>


<p>Wiggler’s Tree Party is a nice and simple beginners board, leading pleasantly into the twinned routes and karting theme of Roll ’em Raceway. It gets much trickier for Goomba Lagoon, with high and low tides that can trap you in a corner of the map going in the loop –&nbsp;this is a really frustrating point on this map, to be honest –&nbsp;and the shopping mall themed Rainbow Galleria is a maze of multiple levels with a half-price shopping event, stamps to collect and more. That’s my favourite.</p>
<p>Western Land and Mario’s Rainbow Castle have been remade as unlockables, and then there’s a seventh map to make this the biggest Mario Party since the first one!</p>


<p>All of the fundamental Mario Party gameplay tropes are here, with a familiar core set of items. But there’s also a bunch of new and returning items, such as the Bowser Phone and Cellular Shopper from Mario Party 3, a cheaper regular pipe with random movement, payday dice that give you coins to match your move, and trap items that can steal from your opponents. I feel there’s a good balance here that gives more options to quickly get somewhere else, though without always having control over where you go.</p>
<p>New for this game are the Jamboree Buddies, adapting the Ally system from Super Mario Party. These characters will randomly appear on the map and will give a major boost to any character that gets them for three turns, always double whatever your landing space offers (good or bad) as well as a character-specific perk. Mario as a buddy adds extra movement, Peach makes stars costs less, Waluigi can steal coins from opponents you run past, and so on.</p>

<p>You have to get to them within a few turns though, and that triggers a bespoke Showdown minigame with the player to initiate the challenge having a starting bonus to earn them, so it’s more about skill than dice rolls. One strange decision is that another player can steal a buddy if they pass you on the board, which can rip that advantage away from you if everyone’s in a similar spot. It can too easily nullify having earnt a buddy –&nbsp;especially Waluigi and Yoshi where you have to pass an opponent to trigger their ability – and maybe a quick rock-paper-scissors game might make this feel more fair.</p>
<p>One of the defining characteristics of a Mario Party session is the randomised nonsense that bonus stars, invisible blocks and more spin out. If that’s something that grates with you, then the new Pro Rules will help to lift a good chunk of the most egregious randomisation, paring back some (but not all) of the possibilities to make for a more predictable and consistent competitive game. You know what the bonus star is for ahead of time, special spaces now have defined outcomes, shops have limited and specific items, and potential star spaces are marked out so you can plan ahead with a Chomp Call in your back pocket. It’s good to have, but I gravitated back towards the shenanigans of the regular Mario Party.</p>

		
		

<p>Of course, so much of Mario Party is about the minigames, and Jamboree has a very broad set of games to play – it promises the largest selection of minigames ever, though a bunch of those are specific to certain modes, and it won’t take long before you’re seeing them repeat. As in the last few games, you can practice before you play, to help even the playing field for newcomers, and there’s a good mix of games that generally play with familiar ideas and themes. There’s a bit of social deduction and fake outs, a bit of luck, a bit of skill, a smattering of motion games amongst the predominantly button games (so you can play without motion and not feel short changed).</p>
<p>If you just want minigames and not a 90+ minute board game, Minigame Bay has a bunch of ways to dip in for a few quick games. Whether playing solo, taking on daily challenges, or with a full set of players, it’s a good quick alternative to dip into. Outside of the main Mario Party and minigame modes, Super Mario Party Jamboree throws a bunch of other ideas up at the wall to see what sticks.</p>
<p>Paratrooper Flight School has you extending your arms out and flapping and tilting the Joy-Con to fly around a few sky islands. There’s a two player battle mode, a co-op mode and a free flight mode, all of which will make your puny arms feel like they’re about to fall off. Toad’s Item Factory is then a quirky little puzzle game where you move world items to get a ball through a stage, and Rhythm Kitchen is a co-op rhythm mode with vegetable digging, chopping and more. They’re all kind of just fine, playable with real people or AI. Little diversions from the endless tirade of board games and minigames elsewhere.</p>

		</div>

<p>A bit more successful is the Party Planner Trek. This mode sends you off to the various game boards to help set things up, freely meandering around the map and chatting to Toads, Goombas and a bunch of player characters, who might then ask you to find an item they’ve lost or take on a minigame challenge. You’re collecting Mini Stars through this, which builds up to a big event once you have enough, before you can visit the next stage. It’s a nice, fairly chilled out way to get the lay of the land, and learn some of the minigames. By its nature, that makes it much better suited to younger players, while old hands probably want to get their minigame time in with the main modes.</p>
<p>In addition to full online Mario Party and minigame modes, there’s also a pair of standalone online modes that are all about larger multiplayer groups. Koopathlon is a big minigame race where up to 20 players rush to collect coins as quickly as possible in individual games, each coin moving you around a track one space, with every fourth game being a 20-player Bowser survival minigame, where you can end up losing places.</p>

<p>Then there’s the eight player Bowser Kaboom Squad, with a Kaiju-sized Bowser stomping around a map as you all race to collect bombs, bring them to a cannon and fire them at Bowser. Every once in a while you get a co-op minigame, rewarding you with items to help build up to the final damage phase to win.</p>
<p>We only got to try these online modes at an in-person preview event, but they’re a good bit of fun if you want a larger mode to dip into. Bowser Kaboom Squad has some clunky controls with a single Joy-Con in hand, trying to navigate 3D space without real camera controls.</p>

<p>Oh, and since I complained that it had disappeared with Mario Party Superstars, I’m happy to confirm that the little jingle that your Joy-Con plays with HD Rumble has returned for Jamboree.</p>

			<p>Three PC games launching soon have been confirmed to feature NVIDIA DLSS 3 support. The first and arguably most anticipated is MechWarrior 5: Clans from Piranha Games. Due to launch on Thursday, October 17, MechWarrior 5: Clans is powered by Unreal Engine 5. In our interview from GDC 2024, Piranha Games CEO Russ Bullock <a href="https://wccftech.com/mechwarrior-5-clans-takes-full-advantage-of-unreal-engine-5-finally-ships-with-great-controller-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>In every way we possibly can. Thankfully, we really leveraged almost all the new toys in there. There's a full MetaHuman base with heavy customization of the models to our needs, a full motion capture of cinematics, and then you've got the world itself.</em></p>
<p><em>We've gone with full Nanite and Lumen, all the destructible are based on Chaos. We use World Partition. We've pretty much activated and used all the fancy new stuff at this point. It definitely makes the game look a lot better. Even in the last month, as we brought more and more of these things online, it's just gotten better and better. We're really happy we made the upgrade from UE4 to 5.</em></p>
<p>On the same day, PC gamers will be able to check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-launches-17-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Quiet Place: Road Ahead</a> with NVIDIA DLSS 3 and DLAA support. Developed by Stormind Games, the Italian studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remothered-broken-porcelain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/batora-lost-haven-bathing-in-shadows-to-reach-dim-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batora: Lost Haven</a>, A Quiet Place: Road Ahead is a single player horror adventure game set in the world created by Jon Krasinski for the acclaimed movies. In this spin-off, players will go through the journey of a young woman as she navigates the alien apocalypse amidst interpersonal family conflict, all while coming to terms with her own inner fears.</p>
<p>Lastly, the cel-shaded single player action first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272250/Forgive_Me_Father_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgive Me Father 2</a> will exit early access on Thursday, October 24, and get NVIDIA DLSS 3, DLAA, and AMD FSR 3 support. In a world inspired by Lovecraft, the player must fight through hordes of nightmares to restore their sanity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bandai-namco-begins-laying-off-employees-after-cancellation-of-several-titles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Japanese publisher Bandai Namco recently started reducing its workforce following the cancellation of several titles due to low demand, and it is doing so using a very Japanese method.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a>, the company is attempting to reduce staff by sending workers to rooms where they are given nothing to do so as to put pressure on them and make them leave voluntarily. Since April, 200 employees have been moved to such rooms, and 100 have already resigned, with more expecting to leave the publisher in the coming months, according to people familiar with the matter who wished not to be named.</p>
<p>A Bandai Namco representative commented on the report, saying that their <em>" decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge. There is no organization like an 'oidashi beya' at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily"</em></p>
<p>In other news, Bandai Namco is enjoying great success with the release of Dragon Ball SPARKING! Zero, which sold<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-has-sold-3-million-units-in-one-day/"> 3 million units in just a single day</a>. This is hardly surprising, considering how popular Dragon Ball continues to be and the game's high quality. The game is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
