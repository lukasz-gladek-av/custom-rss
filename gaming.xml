<p>How did the GameChat companion perform?</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80a6a2352b266/nintendo-switch-2-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've just heard how around "1 in 3" Switch 2 owners <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/around-1-in-3-switch-2-owners-bought-new-pro-controller-despite-high-price-point-us">bought a new Pro Controller</a>, but how did other accessories like the official camera perform?</p>
<p>Game File has now been able to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">provide some additional information</a>. Speaking to Circana's gaming analyst Mat Piscatella, it was noted how Nintendo's camera had a "mid-single digit percentage" attach rate with Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2’s $55 official camera had a “mid-single digit percentage” attach rate with the Switch 2, Circana gaming analyst Mat Piscatella told Game File."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This was apparently "in line" with Piscatella expectations, but we don't know yet if it's matched Nintendo's forecast. As mentioned, though, third-party cameras are also compatible with the Switch 2 – so the official one isn't necessarily an essential purchase if you want to play games with this functionality, or participate in GameChat.</p>
<p>Nintendo launches <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> next week, which adds new minigames utilising features such as the camera as well as mouse mode. If we get an update about the sales figures of Nintendo's camera accessory in this region or elsewhere, or find out more about its performance in general, we'll let you know.</p>

"I'm leaning toward the former--this is a game filled with bold, confident, deliberate design decisions on the part of Rogue Factor, and it'll be interesting to see how players react when it releases September 4."</p><p>Several other games are available to preorder now, so if exploring a dystopian landscape while fighting for your life doesn't appeal to you, you can instead grab upcoming titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle/1100-6533331/" data-ref-id="1100-6533331">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-an-adorable-bluey-plush-with-this-amazon-exclusive-video-game-bundle/1100-6533134/" data-ref-id="1100-6533134">Bluey: The Video Game</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-billy-madison-4k-blu-ray-editions-preorder-amazon/1100-6531820/">Happy Gilmore And Billy Madison 4K Blu-Ray Preorders Steeply Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-new-50-iphone-controller-is-officially-licensed-by-xbox/1100-6533127/">8BitDo's New $50 iPhone Controller Is Officially Licensed By Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-2025-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-preorder-amazon/1100-6533111/">Superman 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Elgato makes some of the most popular streaming equipment on the market, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-HD60-External-Capture-Card/dp/B09V1KJ3J4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Capture HD60 X</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Game-Capture-Neo-Passthrough/dp/B0CVYKQNFH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Capture Neo</a>--and not the company has announced a new entry to its capture card lineup, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elgato 4K S</a>, which is positioned as the company's new entry-level option. The new capture card supports PC and all major consoles--including PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch 2--and is capable of capturing gameplay in up to 4K resolution at 60fps. If you're considering upgrading your streaming or gameplay capture setup, the Elgato 4K S is available now for $160 at Amazon.</p><div title="6533379 - Elgato 4K S" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3951" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533379 - Elgato 4K S" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero\/dp\/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Elgato 4K S</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero\/dp\/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$160</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>As stated above, this new capture card records gameplay at up to 4K 60fps. For comparison, the company's previous HD60 X could only record at 60fps in 1080p, dropping to 30fps for 4K footage--that should make for an appreciable upgrade for those upgrading to this new capture card. The Elgato 4K S features a USB-C port (5Gbps) and two HDMI 2.0 ports. Setup is just as easy as Elgato's other gadgets, requiring little more a USB-C and two HDMI cables to connect the card to your display, gameplay output source, and PC or recording device.</p>                      </div><p>Early reviews of the Elgato 4K S are overwhelmingly positive, with users noting its portable form factor, minimal input lag, and capture quality. So if you're a creator looking to make the jump to 4K content without breaking the bank, the Elgato 4K S certainly seems like it's worth a closer look.</p><p>While this is a leap over the HD60 X, the Elgato 4K S is not a replacement for the premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-Ultra-Low-Streaming-Recording/dp/B0CPFWXMBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elgato 4K X</a> ($245), which is capable of capturing 4K footage at up to 144fps. The 4K X also offers a few additional bonuses, such as added HDR support, HDMI 2.1 ports, and 10Gbps USB-C ports. While most streamers will be just fine sticking with the 4K S's 4K 60fps capture quality, those who demand the highest quality will still find the 4K X the better option.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-billy-madison-4k-blu-ray-editions-preorder-amazon/1100-6531820/">Happy Gilmore And Billy Madison 4K Blu-Ray Preorders Steeply Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-new-50-iphone-controller-is-officially-licensed-by-xbox/1100-6533127/">8BitDo's New $50 iPhone Controller Is Officially Licensed By Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-2025-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-preorder-amazon/1100-6533111/">Superman 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>The latest Pokémon Presents broadcast earlier this week gave trainers all-new details about the upcoming Switch and Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>This included the news about a new Switch 2 bundle and details about pre-order bonuses. Now, retailers in the US have shared some bonuses you can get if you decide to pre-order the physical copy ahead of the full release this October.</p>
<p>If you place a pre-order at Walmart, you can get an exclusive mystery pin pre-order bonus. As mentioned in the fine print, this offer begins this week and is available "while supplies last" and is limited to "one gift per purchase". The Switch 2 version here will set you back $69.00 and the Switch version is available for $59.88.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22ftvknoi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Apart from this offer, Best Buy is offering a "free gamer mat" with Pokémon Legends: Z–A pre-orders. According to the description, this mat can be used for playing the Pokémon Trading Card game or as a mouse pad.</p>
<p>This item will also be available in "limited quantities" and is available while supplies last. And if you've already pre-ordered, you'll also receive the gamer mat. The Switch 2 version here is $69.99 and the Switch version is priced at $59.99.</p>

<p>As already revealed by The Pokémon Company, trainers across the globe can also get an "early-purchase bonus" in the form of a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite stone as a gift. Additionally, the digital version early-purchase bonus includes "a gift of 100 Poké Balls" (both of these gifts are available to claim until <strong>February 28th, 2026</strong>).</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the new Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Bundle have also gone live and will arrive on the same date as the new game on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>.</p>

It was the fastest-selling expansion in Magic: The Gathering history, per Hasbro. Its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair">Secret Lair collaboration drops sold out in record time</a>, and while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">stocks of the boosters, starter kits, and decks have improved</a>, there was a period there where it was difficult to get your hands on anything Magic x Final Fantasy-related. The set's popularity even pushed a bunch of non-Final Fantasy cards to higher prices, just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-cards-spike-thanks-to-new-final-fantasy-synergies">because of their excellent synergy with the set</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And on top of all that, it apparently earned $200 million in a single day - the same amount that Magic's Lord of the Rings set earned in <em>six months.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Hasbro in its Q2 earnings call</a>, which revealed the figure alongside a report that Magic: The Gathering revenue grew 23% year-over-year in large part thanks to the Final Fantasy release.  Per CEO Chris Cox, it brought in more new players in stores over two weeks than any other set has in 12 weeks. And in the investor Q&amp;A during the earnings call, Cox answered a question about how Final Fantasy's demand correlated to the company's expectations with the following quote (<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-hasbro-beats-q2-2025-estimates-but-stock-dips-93CH-4148568" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtesy of Investing.com's transcript</a>):</p><blockquote>In terms of Final Fantasy and how it met expectations, I’ll give you a comparison between two of our biggest universe at the onsets. Lord of the Rings took six months to deliver $200,000,000 of revenue.</blockquote><blockquote>Final Fantasy took one day. And we left demand on the table. So we couldn’t produce enough. I think we increased production runs on it four times pre release. It was substantially, by many, many very high double digit percentages, ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done.</blockquote><blockquote>And we left the market wanting more. And our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling Lord of the Rings product today. So, even though we hit $200,000,000 in December ’2 for Lord of the Rings, We sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following. We expect Final Fantasy to be no different.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior. So, I think that’s a little bit on what our bullishness is on Final Fantasy. What drove success for it? I think it’s a couple of things. I think first and foremost, it’s finding the right IPs that are great adjacencies to what Magic fans might appeal to or what Magic might appeal to another fan base.</blockquote><blockquote>Lord of the Rings was fantastic because it’s kind of the granddaddy of fantasy. It invented the genre, major books, major movies, major animation and games. Final Fantasy, I think, is almost as strong as Lord of the Rings in terms of IP strength, if not stronger in some regions. I think it has stronger cross regional appeal, and it has probably more of a sweet spot in gaming than Lord of the Rings has, because it was kind of born from gaming. So, I think potentially the overlap of fan bases was stronger than you might have even seen for something like Lord of the Rings.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up question, Cox also noted that he feels "pretty good" about future collaborations and first-party sets coming next year "in terms of being Final Fantasy like in terms of the types of players, the size of community, and the adjacencies we have." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last remark bodes well for fans of the Final Fantasy set. We just saw a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-magic-the-gathering-crossover-spoilers-secret-lair">Sonic: The Hedgehog Secret Lair crossover</a> debut, and already know about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">Spider-Man</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-aang-magic-the-gathering-cards-reveal-early-look-at-upcoming-the-last-airbender-set">Avatar: The Last Airbender themed sets in September</a> and November, respectively, so with success like this, more crossovers are likely to make sense to the folks at Hasbro. In the meantime, at least this means Hasbro will keep the Final Fantasy cards stocked for a good while, for those who haven't been able to get their hands on them yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

But it has now received a massive 1.0 update, left early access, and made its way to consoles, too. And on top of all that, this very good survival game is now available on Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, complete with crossplay.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196848" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Roguelite Is Giving Hades Meets Dead Cells" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="68" data-playlist="196848,196307,196163" data-current="196848"><div><p>This Roguelite Is Giving Hades Meets Dead Cells</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196848/196848_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196848/196848_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196848/196848_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196848/196848_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22408.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-deep-field-games-indie-survival-fps-1849644843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-deep-field-games-indie-survival-fps-1849644843">First announced in 2022, <em>Abiotic Factor</em></a></span> looks a lot like Valve’s classic ‘90s FPS <em>Half-Life.</em> And it is even set in a similar location: a secret underground research facility filled with nasty interdimensional aliens and deadly military goons. But unlike <em>Half-Life, Abiotic Factor</em> is a survival game like <em>Minecraft </em>or <em>Rust</em>. Here, though, instead of harvesting trees and rocks, you scrounge for pencils and paper, breaking open closets and desks for resources. It’s a very interesting spin on survival, forcing you to build armor out of plastic binders and garbage cans and set up camp in offices and bathrooms. And as you get deeper into the game, you discover alternative dimensions filled with new loot, resources, and dangerous, creepy monsters.</p><p>Here’s the game’s official description courtesy of the Xbox store: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.

In fact, the silicon that seems likely to power such a future device could put it on par with PS6 performance, or whatever the next Xbox is called (I’m hoping for NeXbox, personally).</p><p>The chip at the heart of all this speculation is the AMD “Magnus” APU, itself only rumored to exist for now.

The rumored Magnus chip might not arrive for another year or two, so we’ll still have to bide our time with the Steam Deck OLED as Valve’s “flagship” handheld for a while. But when we do get that upgrade, it sure sounds like it’s aiming to wow our eyeballs out of our skulls.</p><h2 id="h766965"><a id=""></a>Should the Steam Deck be bigger, better, faster, soon?</h2><p>Please don’t burn me at the stake for being the somewhat luddite-adjacent witch that I am, but I’m content with what the Steam Deck delivers presently. I do not think we “need” a Steam Deck 2, even if <em>Avowed</em> looks like this:<br></p><figure id="" data-id="583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-recommend-id="image://583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-recommend-id="image://583b45b78b4c0a979ebff58ca527745f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs race toward an enemy in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Personally, I’ve always rather enjoyed the Steam Deck as a pocket PS4 of sorts. It’s a machine I can use on the go to jump into some titles from the past that aren’t so old as to be something I’d fire up in RetroArch, but aren’t so new that I’m going to be left with 30 minutes worth of battery life after a single play session, either.</p><p>In other words, for now I’m okay with some experiences—<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and the like—not being at their absolute best on the handheld. I think it’s fine for there to be experiences that are better had on a PC or console that doesn’t need to offer a compromised version of the game in order to not devour all its battery life in minutes. Valve, I’ll wait for 2030 for a new Deck. My library is big enough and I’m patient.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2-amd-magnus-apu-ps6-xbox-1851786832]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Julian LeFay, the man often credited as "the father of The Elder Scrolls," has died at the age of 59, his creative partners announced this week.</p>
<p>"It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we inform our community of the passing of Julian LeFay, our beloved Technical Director and co-founder of Once Lost Games," his colleagues <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oncelostgames.bsky.social/post/3lum4pyp3cs2e">wrote in a Bluesky post</a>.</p>
<p>LeFay spent most of the 1990s at Bethesda Softworks, culminating in his work on The Elder Scrolls series into the late '90s.</p>
<p>His career didn't start with The Elder Scrolls, though. Beginning in 1988, LeFay made music for the Amiga hack-and-slash game <em>Sword of Sodan</em> as well as the NES game <em>Where's Waldo</em>, and he did design and programming work on titles like&nbsp;<em>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</em>, the DOS version of <em>Dragon's Lair</em>, and two DOS games based on the Terminator movie franchise.</p>
<p>In the early '90s, he joined fellow Bethesda developers Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman on an Ultima Underworld-inspired RPG that would come to be called <em>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</em>. Though famed creative director Todd Howard has helmed the franchise since its third entry, <em>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em> were chiefly spearheaded by LeFay. One of the gods of The Elder Scrolls universe was named after LeFay, and the setting was inspired by the literature and tabletop role-playing games LeFay and Peterson enjoyed.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fbfc6e72db97/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We know the Switch 2 has sold incredibly well worldwide, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">the console shifting 1.6 million units in June 2025 in the US alone</a>. Now we have an idea of just how well the pricey, but excellent, new Pro Controller has done, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> has shared Circana's estimated Switch 2 Pro Controller sales, and it's around 512,000 in the United States — that means around one in three people picking up a Switch 2 have also grabbed a shiny new controller to go with. That's around <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37t7z552k">a 32% attach rate</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a Nintendo fan, you'll know that the Pro Controller is one of the pricier controllers on the market right now, and is actually one of the accessories that went up in price in response to the Trump Administration's tariffs (or, as Nintendo put it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-us-pre-orders-start-24th-april-system-and-launch-game-pricing-unchanged">"changes in market conditions"</a>) — from $80 to $85.</p>

<p>The original Switch 1 Pro Controller is also compatible with the console, and that, coupled with the price of the new controller, has put some people off rushing to grab one , as good as it is.</p>
<p>We're also still in the very early days of the console's life, so those sales are likely going to dip over the coming months. Still, 32% is an impressive number, and we'll be interested to see how other accessories — such as the Camera — have sold.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-announces-new-ps5-beta-update-for-pairing-dualsense-controllers-to-multiple-devices-and-upcoming-power-saving-update-to-reduce-power-consumption.1251534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">announced</a> a new update coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro users who have opted into the PS5 Beta program, meant to make pairing your DualSense controller to multiple devices at a time a "<em>seamless</em>" process. The update, which is being pushed tomorrow for users in the beta program, will let you switch from using your DualSense controller wirelessly on one device to another, without having to re-pair it every time.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Blog post describes a process through which after you've initially paired your DualSense or DualSense Edge controller with your PS5, PC, and mobile device, through a combination of pressing the PS button and one of the face buttons, you can switch between devices.</p>



<p>"<em>With this update, you can now register up to four devices simultaneously, and easily switch between them directly from your controller,</em>" writes Shuzo Kikuchi, vice president of product management at Sony. "<em>For example, you can take your controller which you use with your PS5, then seamlessly switch connection to a PC to play PC games, or connect it to a smartphone to enjoy Remote Play from your PS5. With this enhanced flexibility, you can enjoy gaming more freely across multiple devices</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>Once you've properly paired your controller to a device the first time, going through the prescribed button presses in the example chart below should let you switch from one device to another, without skipping a beat. </p>



<p>Note that this chart doesn't mean you'll need to set up device switching in this exact way, it is just an example of how you can have up to four devices paired to one controller and switch between them.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Slot Number</strong></td><td><strong>Button Used</strong></td><td><strong>Player Indicator Lights</strong></td><td><strong>Connected Device</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Slot 1</td><td>PS button and Triangle button</td><td>One light on</td><td>PS5</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 2</td><td>PS button and Circle button</td><td>Two lights on</td><td>PS5 Pro</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 3</td><td>PS button and Cross button</td><td>Three lights on</td><td>Windows PC</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 4</td><td>PS button and Square button</td><td>Four lights on</td><td>iPhone</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The other key element of the blog post announcing this update is a feature that won't be in tomorrow's update but will be in a future one. A power-saving mode is coming down the pipeline, which will reduce the amount of power your console is pulling while playing games that support the feature. </p>



<p>Meaning that if you're playing, say, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and it supports this power saving feature, then with the feature enabled, your PS5/PS5 Pro device will draw less power to run the game. This will result in performance being scaled back, and it also disables features like VR support for games that have a VR mode. The intent of the mode is to reduce the environmental footprint caused by running your PS5/PS5 Pro at full power whenever you're using it.</p>



<p>If you're a player who cares about having a smooth framerate and/or being able to play with graphical features like ray-tracing, then it's doubtful you'll ever use a mode like this. But for games that don't require that much power to run them at a smooth framerate, and ones that don't even have higher-fidelity options in terms of graphics, like most pixel-art games, it's a solid option to reduce the environmental impact, and perhaps even your own electricity bill. </p>



<p>For now though, we're still waiting to see how many games will even support the feature, and the specifics around how it'll work. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-made-200m-in-one-day.1251531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy </em>was already known to be the best selling set of all time, but new statements from Hasbro in their financial reporting reveal the staggering degree of which this is the case.</p>

<p>During the earning call Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks opened up saying that&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;was up 23% year over year, and up 32% year to date, foreshadowing the crazy numbers yet to come. When answering a question, Cocks revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>(and its hoard of legendary creatures)</a> had sold as much in one day, as previous best selling set&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings - Tales of Middle-Earth</em>&nbsp;did in 6 months.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In terms of Final Fantasy, and how it met expectations, I'll give you a comparison between two of our biggest Universes Beyond sets. Lord of the Rings took 6 months to deliver $200 million of revenue, Final Fantasy took 1 day, and we left demand on the table. So we couldn't produce enough. I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we've ever done, and we left the market wanting more." (Transcript from <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803536-hasbro-inc-has-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite that huge sales, and increasing production of <em>Magic: The Gathering -&nbsp;</em><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>4 separate times, they still were unable to meet the demand that brought over $200m in sales on day 1. That $200m in revenue was a large part of the Wizards and Digital gaming revenue segment which was $522m.</p>

<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Isn't the Only Set Doing Big Numbers</h2>

<p>Of course, if the only strong numbers were related to&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;it would be somewhat concerning. That isn't the case, as in his prepared comments Cocks revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/tarkir-dragonstorm-commander-deck-reviews" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Tarkir: Dragonstorm Commander Deck Reviews - Roaring Fun!"><em>Tarkir - Dragonstorm</em>&nbsp;</a>is on pace to become the best selling in-universe premiere&nbsp;set (aka standard legal, and not a&nbsp;<em>Modern Horizons</em>&nbsp;type set) of all time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Player count in organized play was also up substantially, with a 40% increase in unique players taking part in events as Universes Beyond manages to attract both new and old players to the game. This was also buoyed by&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>as it "set a record for new player growth, delivering more new players in its first 2 weeks than any prior set posted over an entire season," <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/005be71f-0c3f-4e8a-800e-06ecd698c19c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hasbro Investor Prepared Remarks">according to Cocks</a>.</p>

<p>Older cards are selling too. Despite half the year left to go,&nbsp;<em>Magic</em>'s backlist of sets has already set an all-time annual record of sales as of the end of June. This is partially powered by sets like&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings - Tales of Middle-Earth</em>, but also by sets like&nbsp;<em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, and&nbsp;other in-universe sets that continue to sell even more to more players. As for Secret Lair, the controversial decision to go back to limited print runs has not harmed sales at all as it has just delivered its strongest sales quarter in its history, possibly powered by the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-three-secret-lair-x-final-fantasy-drops-this-summer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Wizards of the Coast Releasing Three Secret Lair x Final Fantasy Drops This Summer"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>Secret Lairs</a>.</p>

<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>'s finances are booming right now, and it's good to be Hasbro, who is able to lean on Wizards of the Coast while various toys experience more difficulties with tariffs due to components coming from regions that are heavily tariffed often.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ozzy-osbourne-death-blizzcon-2009-world-of-warcraft</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ozzy-osbourne-played-a-video-game-convention-in-2009-and-it-ruled.1251519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2009, I had been a journalist for, charitably, one year. I was in college, and most of the publications I’d written for paid in exposure rather than cash. Somehow, for reasons that have since been lost to time, I wound up with a press pass to BlizzCon, Blizzard’s official though still-nascent annual gathering in Anaheim, California. What I did not fully grasp the significance of back then – so starry-eyed was I at the prospect of interviewing people who’d worked on <em>StarCraft </em>– was that this meant I had also been handed a front-row ticket to an Ozzy Osbourne show.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a different era for games journalism – already removed from the glitz, glamor, and lavish review/preview trips of <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ‘90s and early 2000s</a>, but nowhere near as far as we are today. Ozzy’s appearance wasn’t a walled-off press perk, though; this was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP3c736bzYU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a show for everyone in attendance</a>, a flex of a tradition that would in subsequent years lead to closing ceremonies headlined by acts including Tenacious D, Foo Fighters, Blink 182, Metallica, Linkin Park, and Muse. At the time, though, only one rock band, The Offspring, had previously heralded BlizzCon’s conclusion, and no offense to The Offspring, but they weren’t Ozzy Osbourne.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost two decades later, I remember the 2009 show in bits and pieces. At the time, I marveled at how, despite gaining a reputation for unintelligible speech and half-lucidly shouting “Sharon,” Ozzy’s singing voice was still crystal clear – and strong as all hell. I also recall that even though I was only a burgeoning concert goer at that point in my life, I’d already learned to recognize what a dead crowd looked like. Ozzy repeatedly implored BlizzCon attendees to jump, clap, and move, but many of them were seated, and only during the biggest hits did it really <em>feel </em>like a metal show ought to. (This would continue to be an issue for BlizzConcerts; tired nerds at the end of a convention weekend do not a great crowd make, but that never stopped artists from trying.)&nbsp;</p><p>Ozzy did his best, though, and apparently he had a good time.</p><p>“I was thinking they'd all be wearing spectacles the size of f****** Coca-Cola bottles, like curly white hair and f****** rimmed glasses, you know, the scientist types,” Ozzy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ozzy-osbourne-rides-crazy-train-into-blizzcon-2009/1100-6216112/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told GameSpot</a> of the BlizzCon audience in an interview after the show (censorship theirs, not ours). “But they were f****** great, man. The vibe was there. The kids had a great time. That's the best part of my job: giving them the best time.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ozzy Osbourne World of Warcraft AS AIRED then ACTUAL STORYBOARDS version Commercial TV ad WoW" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6LpGBS-BUo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There are a few pieces of cultural ephemera worth excavating here. Foremost, Ozzy’s presence at BlizzCon feels weirdly incongruous until you consider that he was fresh off a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6LpGBS-BUo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular 2008 commercial</a> for <em>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</em> in which he competed against the aforementioned in-game monarch to determine who was the real “Prince Of Darkness” and lost. Never mind that one was a prince and the other was a king, rendering the entire premise nonsensical; I remember enjoying this ad a lot when I first saw it – and then a little less each of the following one thousand times.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/23/blizzcon-09-ozzy-osbourne-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with IGN</a> after the BlizzCon show, Ozzy – who also voiced The Guardian Of Metal in Double Fine’s 2009 cult classic <em>Brütal Legend</em> – explained his relationship to video games.</p><p>"To be honest with you, I don't [play <em>World of Warcraft</em>],” Ozzy told IGN. “I'm very computer dumb. My son goes, 'Dad, check this out.' He plays those war games, my son, and I'm a World War II buff. But he sits up there in his room for f****** four days playing this thing going, 'Shhh! Don't get me going!' I'm very slow with the computers; I'm one of the old timers. But it's the future, you know. My kids now – when I was a kid, the big thing with my dad was learning how to work the remote, and I learned that, so I thought, 'I'll always know what's going on.' But now my kids are talking in f****** computer language – megabytes and gigabytes, whatever the f*** that means."</p><p>His perspective on <em>Brütal Legend</em> revealed a similarly begrudging open-mindedness that, as someone now being overtaken by the world in the great race we call life, I cannot help but respect.&nbsp;</p><p>“You know what, a lot of guys have been doing the things I do for a long time, but they don't get involved with [games],” he said to IGN. “It's the wave of the future – it's sink or swim. I'm very honored to be in the video game. Someone was telling me that the one I did for the rock thing: a billion kids, a billion kids played it! That's f****** unbelievable! That's a f****** tenth of the population of the world! If only that many bought the f****** album.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>It's the wave of the future – it's sink or swim.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Someone lied to Ozzy about <em>Brütal Legend</em>’s sales so boldly and shamelessly that they probably succumbed to spontaneous human combustion immediately afterward, but that’s not the point. What matters is, this is a man who did his best to keep up with what was going on around him because fuck it, whatever, I guess I have to in order to remain an interesting person, and we can all learn from that.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite goth-ed up appearances and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ozzy-osbourne-bites-head-off-bat-anniversary-1287867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eternally mistold tales of bat biting</a>, Ozzy’s biggest songs were about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lD5bfqzr6E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning how to love, forgetting how to hate</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUT730G-xvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolting against a world obsessed with war</a>. You don’t write lyrics like that unless you believe in people and the idea that, with sufficient time and collaboration, they’ll become better than they are now. It’s easy to recede into the comforting arms of irrelevance as the world regresses into division and strife. It’s much harder to stay present, grounded, and accept that you’ll never stop going through changes.&nbsp;</p><p>How exactly Ozzy squared all of this with latter-day claims that he preferred to "stay away from politics" and his wife's increasingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/sharon-osbourne-calls-for-kneecap-rappers-us-visas-to-be-revoked-after-israel-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fascist-friendly</a> <a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/dead-76-ozzy-osbourne-mourned-fierce-israel-ally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support of Israel</a> – which led Ozzy to play shows there in 2010 and 2018 – is a question to which we will never get a direct answer. There is no excusing even tacit approval of such a stance, one that could be chalked up to an admirable distaste for antisemitism – as evidenced by <a href="https://x.com/OzzyOsbourne/status/1756100047056564602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ozzy's rejection of Ye's request to sample his music in 2024</a> – but which via his actions, if not his words, went further. Heroes and legends can still be hypocrites, and even as we laud their achievements, we must also grapple with their failings. This is a big one, a stain on Ozzy's legacy that should not be forgotten.</p><p>Open-mindedness, selective though it evidently was, ultimately led Ozzy to a reality TV career and, eventually, collaborations with modern artists – like the irritating but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJZmO5mByVY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">undeniably skilled</a> Yungblud – in his final days. He never stopped trying shit. This proclivity was on full display during the 2009 BlizzCon show, with Ozzy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEnwWp70mJ8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing a then-nine-year-old guitarist named Yuto Miyazawa on stage</a> during “Crazy Train,” going so far as to heft Miyazawa on his shoulder midsong.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Crazy Train - Ozzy Osbourne with Yuto Miyazawa - Blizzcon 2009." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEnwWp70mJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Miyazawa was about as familiar with Blizzard's games as Ozzy, but up on stage, none of that mattered to him.</p><p>"I always admired [Ozzy's] first guitarist Randy Rhoads," Miyazawa, now 25, told Aftermath. "When I played on his shoulder, I felt like I [was] Randy Rhoads for a moment. It was and is still my best moment of my life."</p><p>Miyazawa also noted that Ozzy went on to send him a Christmas card that year and invite him to Ozzfest 2010. </p><p>Back in 2009, Ozzy had no idea why he was at BlizzCon: “You know what? I have not the f****** faintest,” he replied when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ozzy-osbourne-rides-crazy-train-into-blizzcon-2009/1100-6216112/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameSpot asked</a> him how he wound up playing a convention center full of <em>WoW</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, and <em>StarCraft </em>fans.</p><p>But he still went up there and sang his heart out, grinning like a child even younger than Miyazawa when the crowd belted the chorus to “Crazy Train.” He made the same face <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NAemzzu9DI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the same moment of his final show</a> just a couple weeks ago, weary but possessed by one final purpose – with a voice that, even after 76 years on this Earth, still kicked hard enough to wake the Devil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>RIP to the real Prince Of Darkness.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ridge-racer-4-zine-magazine"><h3>Riiiiidddgggeeee Raaaaccceerrrr Ziiiinnnneeeee</h3></a><p>'A tribute to Namco's Ridge Racer Type 4, the vibiest racing game of all time'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/coming-of-age-anime-call-of-the-night-vampires"><h3>Call Of The Night Is The Sensual Coming Of Age Anime I Craved As A Teen</h3></a><p>When you’re a teenager, falling in love is about as risky as becoming a vampire</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-the-creator-dont-tap-the-glass-hip-hop-rap-kendrick"><h3>We Should All Outgrow Our Heroes Like Tyler, The Creator</h3></a><p>Turns out all it takes to shake hip-hop’s foundations was “Don’t Tap The Glass” daring its rap listeners to put the keyboard down and dance

Reportedly, <em>BF6 </em>will arrive on October 10. The game will be available in two versions: A standard edition and a “Phantom Edition.” This Phantom Edition will be digital only and will include additional in-game content, likely cosmetics. Neither version will provide early access. Pre-orders will go live on July 31. </p><p><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s prices were also leaked, but they are in Euros, and it’s not clear yet how that will translate to the United States and other regions. At the very least, it appears the Phantom Edition will cost $30 more than the standard release. </p><p>Billbil-kun also reports that there will likely be an open beta for<em> Battlefield 6</em> available in August. This follows months and months of closed alpha testing. </p><p>We won’t have to wait long to find out how much of this report and its data-mined information is accurate. Tomorrow, on July 24, EA and its team of studios working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> will unveil the first trailer for the game, and we’ll likely be told its official release date and more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824]]></content:encoded>

A report from reputable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/battlefield-6-date-de-sortie-editions-prix-precommande-on-vous-devoile-toutes-nos-infos-inedites-60267" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> claims Battlefield 6 will launch on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p>An October release date for Battlefield 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">previously reported</a>, so it's not a total shock. The latest rumor is that Activision's <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1945861417485099010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will release on November 14</a>. If both dates are legitimate, that would put about a month of time between both releases.</p><p>It's been four years since there were new entries in the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises releasing the same year, going back to 2021 with Call of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042.</p><p>Officially, EA has only confirmed that Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">released by the end of March 2026. </a></p><p>The Dealabs report also mentioned that Battlefield 6 will be available in Standard and Phantom editions, the latter of which is said to be digital-only and will include extra in-game content. The report also claimed that EA will not offer early access to the game, but it will instead debut on October 10 for everyone.</p><p>The standard edition is rumored to be priced at €80 ($94 USD) for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S and €70 ($82 USD) on PC, with the Phantom edition selling for €110.00 ($130 USD) on console and €100 ($117) on PC. The Dealabs report had no mention of pricing for Battlefield 6 in USD; the figures above are only conversions based on the European source. Finally, the report said preorders will open on July 31.</p><p>The first trailer for Battlefield 6 will be releases on July 24.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) is entering its second lawsuit against the Trump Administration. The lawsuit involves the new wave of emergency tariffs being imposed by the US President, which would pose an existential crisis to the entire tabletop industry.</p>



<p>In a report by Board Game Wire, GAMA is joining the cookware manufacturer Firedisc and timber supplier Ryan Wholesale for a new lawsuit against the Trump Administration in response to its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/07/economy/trump-letters-tariffs" rel="nofollow">recent sweeping emergency tariffs</a>. These new tariffs are imposing a price increase of anywhere between 10-20% on goods coming from multiple countries around the world, including Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and others.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gama-john-stacy-profile-photo.jpg?itok=aSnvWSwy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gama-john-stacy-profile-photo.jpg?itok=Uf2z7j_Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In many ways, this lawsuit may invoke a sense of deja vu on the part of GAMA. When the Trump Administration provoked a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on import costs, it was a devastating blow to the entire tabletop industry. One GAMA spent months of hard work trying to overturn.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was a decision that came with its share of industry casualties. CMON has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ceased development</a> and has had to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some of its IPs</a> to keep the lights on. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a> shut their doors.</p>

<p>The difference between the previous lawsuit and the new lawsuit is in scale. The first lawsuit pertained to Chinese imports only, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">still devastating</a> to the industry as a whole. These new tariffs by comparison, are a lot broader and far more devastating across multiple businesses and industries.</p>

<p>GAMA has stated that this lawsuit is about more than just the long-term health of the tabletop industry. Much like the first string of tariffs, these are being imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which allows the President to impose trade tariffs without approval of Congress while in states of emergency.</p>

<p>Since a state of emergency hasn't been declared, or the rationale to impose such a state is dubious at best, this would mean the President has unilaterally imposed these devastating tariffs without any Congressional approval or oversight.</p>

<p>This is the key argument of GAMA's second anti-tariff lawsuit. It invokes the US Supreme Court's Major Questions Doctrine, emphasizing that major policy changes require Congressional approval and that IEEPA does not provide such unilateral action. It is not just about economic fairness, but about restoring constitutional order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“GAMA strongly supports this lawsuit as a critical effort to restore constitutional oversight of trade and tariffs.</p>

<p>“These emergency tariff orders are economically damaging and threatens tens of thousands of jobs in our industry that relies on international manufacturing and cooperation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new lawsuit was officially filed on July 21 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas</p>

He revealed in a new interview that the studio cut roughly 30% of the game to hit the game's release date in February 2015.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ready-at-dawn-co-founder-says-vr" rel="nofollow ">The Game Business</a>, Weerasuriya discussed how "we really hoped to make a sequel" to The Order: 1886 and ruminated on what happened with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-review-roundup/1100-6425390/">the game's lackluster critical reception</a>. "The game length [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-order-1886-review/1900-6416033/">GameSpot's reviewer</a> said it took 6 hours to finish] ... that's something that a lot of people talked about at the time," Weerasuriya said. "We cut ... I want to say 30% of the game a few months before it was released. We decided it had to come out in the time allotted. Were we to do it again, I would've probably tried to figure out a way to extend the development."</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the week leading up to the game's launch on February 20, 2015,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-leaks-to-youtube-in-full-playthroug/1100-6425327/"> a leaked playthrough of The Order: 1886 appeared on YouTube</a> and showed a person beating the game in five hours. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-dev-denies-five-hour-claim/1100-6425343/">This led to Ready at Dawn denying that claim</a> days later, arguing the game's length was roughly eight to 10 hours long.</p><p dir="ltr">Weerasuriya also touched on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-exclusive-the-order-1886-won-t-have-multiplayer-will-run-at-1080p-30fps/1100-6417564/" data-ref-id="1100-6417564">the lack of multiplayer for The Order: 1886</a>. "We did do a multiplayer in the first year of development, but we didn't have the budget and time to finish it and, together with Sony, we decided to kill it in year two, and hopefully bring it back in a sequel," he said. "We had a functioning multiplayer. It was fun."</p><p dir="ltr">The sequel obviously never happened, even though Weerasuriya mentioned having "the story for the second and third one." <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-exclusive-the-order-1886-delayed-to-2015/1100-6419882/">Sony did delay The Order: 1886</a> in May 2014, pushing the game back to 2015.</p><p dir="ltr">The other Ready at Dawn co-founder, Andrea Pessino, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-passed-on-the-order-1886-sequel-dev-claims/1100-6529368/" data-ref-id="1100-6529368">reflected on The Order: 1886 sequel</a> earlier this year, too. Like Weerasuriya, he mentioned the pressure to ship the game led to cut content. Facebook acquired Ready at Dawn in 2020, but then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-and-lone-echo-developer-shuts-down/1100-6525619/">shut down the studio last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Plenty of people are busy revisiting two of the Switch 1's greatest games — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> — on Switch 2. The frame a resolution boost are pretty remarkable in our eyes, and it seems like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-zelda-upgraded-on-switch-2-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-tested">Digital Foundry agrees</a> with our assessment, calling the upgrades "transformative", especially for the 2023 sequel.</p>
<p>While the upgrades do cost a few pennies to pick up (though they are included in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription), Digital Foundry thinks it's "worth it" to see just how remarkable these upgraded titles look on the new console.</p>
<p>First up is dynamic resolution, which is available on Switch 1, but the Switch 2's version has a higher range in both games to support 4K displays.</p>
<figure><a title="DF Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12249eada6850/df-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdaeX_fGHI&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where dynamic resolution targeted 1600x900 on Switch 1 while docked, the Switch 2 release boosts that to a maximum of 2560x1440. There are dips in extreme cases, but these are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry did spot a few moments where the frames dipped randomly during cutscenes for no obvious reasons, but quickly corrected itself. And while the resolution boost and improved textures are fantastic across the board, there's a distinct lack (or lack of effectiveness) of anti-aliasing in both games.</p>

<p>Improved load times (some of which are more than halved) and shadow quality are two other highlights the outlet was keen to point out, but we want to focus on the frame rate and performance.</p>
<p>Focusing on Tears of the Kingdom first, Digital Foundry confirms what we all know — the game is running at 60fps for the most part, and stays pretty consistently up in those figures whether you're in battle or using Ultrahand. Testing only the first 6 hours of the game, DF noticed one tiny blip when building vehicles. A huge improvement from our experiences on Switch 1.</p>
<figure><a title="DF Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93a8df22abe6f/df-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdaeX_fGHI&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Breath of the Wild is even more consistent, with busier areas like Kakariko and Zora's Domain put under the test with exploding barrels. These stay at a rock solid 60fps now.</p>
<p>So, it's an impressive rundown, with a few little caveats. While "rough points" do remain in both games, these two upgrades come with an easy recommendation from the tech specialists.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-corps-of-discovery-board-game-is-a-challenging-trek-through-the-american-wilderness.1251453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here be monsters,” says the legend on so many antique maps, firing the imagination with thoughts of kraken, chimeras, or worse. But what if it were true? What if Lewis and Clarke, setting out on their expedition across the American interior, encountered buffalo-headed minotaurs and man-eating plants. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the premise of the Corps of Discovery comic and now of this board game adaptation. The game comes from the same designers as the superb <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mind-mgmt-board-game-review"><u>Mind MGMT</u></a>, although, save for the comic book connection, this is a very different kind of game.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a6a6c32d-c46f-44a3-834e-97a927e776f1" id="225555"><div id="225555" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Corps of Discovery</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most box-openings start with a board, and Corps of Discovery is no exception, but the nature of the board itself is rather surprising. Instead of the usual fold-out affair, you get a cardboard sandwich: two layers of card stuck together, with room in between to slip in a sheet of paper. The top layer is punctuated by a regular grid of circular holes, and the box contains an equally unusual supply of thick cardboard sun tokens with wide “pegs” that fit loosely into the grid's holes.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250628-145130883-1753125741072.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two folders of paper maps that slide into the sandwich, one for each of the two scenarios included in the game. There’s also a second board which is used for tracking the current game state, with spaces for three challenge cards, backpack items and water: this doubles as a handy reminder of the flow of each game day. There are tokens for the various resources that go in your backpack and for your water supply. There are also several card decks, not only the challenge cards that’ll outline the obstacles you must overcome each day, but also characters to play, items for them to use and so on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a scenario-based game, there are also additional cards and tokens applicable to particular scenarios. One thing to note is that, as a game based on a comic book series, all the components are furnished with excellent art from the original comics. While it might not be to everyone’s tastes, it does a fantastic job of bringing the game’s dangerous world to life, especially if you’re familiar with the source material.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191631962-mp-1753126200486.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Understanding how the game is set up is, unusually, an integral part of understanding how it plays. First, your group chooses one of the two scenarios to play (plus a training mission), and one of the 10 map sheets included for that scenario, covering it with a blank sheet so you can’t see what’s on it. You slip this, cover and all, into the cardboard-sandwich board then cover all the holes with the sun tokens. Then you slip out the blank sheet. The result is a game map that you know nothing about, ripe for exploration and discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games"><u>cooperative game</u></a> where you’re working together to map the wilderness and survive. On your individual turn, you simply remove a sun token, revealing an icon underneath, and take a matching resource to add to your collective backpack. There’s no piece to mark where you are on the map. Instead, movement is abstracted away under the presumption that it’s easy to move through already explored territory. The next player just removes a sun token next to any already-revealed space, although there are some mountainous areas on each map that you can’t traverse.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191556654-1753126158243.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration, however, is far from a random walk in the park. Each scenario has a set of rules about where and how the various different icons are laid out. In the Fauna scenario, for example, there’s always one wood icon per row and column, and there will always be a water icon orthogonally adjacent to each wood. Each mud icon will be next to a water and a stone, while forts always form an L-shape series with a water and a skull. There are more rules – and icons – but you get the idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This allows you to make predictions and deductions about what you’re going to encounter on the map. Sometimes you can figure it out with complete certainty, but more often it’s a bit of a gamble, where you can narrow down the odds without being sure. Exploration is thus both a fun puzzle where you can aim for specific resources, and an exercise loaded with tension. The rules are complex enough to make it a good group discussion, ensuring there’s a dynamic sense of cooperation, and something you can master with practice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The rules are complex enough to make it a good group discussion, ensuring there’s a dynamic sense of cooperation, and something you can master with practice.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each time you remove a sun token from the board you place it on one of three challenge cards dealt at the start of the game day. These cards have a resource requirement that you must spend in order to pass the challenge and a consequence for passing or failing, the latter of which usually means losing even more, different resources. You have to face these consequences once the card accumulates a certain number of suns, often only two or three. Considering many challenges require more than two or three resources to pass, this immediately puts your game under massive pressure to find the right icons on every turn.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-190121214-1753125922112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you run out of water tokens, you die. If you end the day – timing out the three challenge cards for that die – without any food tokens, you die. Monsters generally don’t kill you outright but sap these precious, precious resource tokens until you die. Even when you’re on top of the resource-mapping system, most games will go down to the wire of you gaining your objective with a few measly drops of water left in your canteen. The last few turns ramp up the tension to crushing levels, until it almost feels like you’re struggling through a real wilderness, desperately following signs of water in the hope of surviving just one more day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As if this wasn’t enough, on top of surviving you also have a goal to complete. This depends on the scenario. In Fauna, for instance, you’ll meet those buffalo-headed minotaurs who’ll make it harder to traverse rows and columns until you find a fort, learn a recipe for killing one, and sacrifice the necessary resources, all of which you were probably hoping to save to pass a challenge card. These kinds of trade-offs are part of the game’s strategy: identifying times when failing a daily challenge can be a useful step in the wider goal of passing the winning objectives.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250628-145141636-1753125839302.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other aspects of your decision-making come down to the characters in play and the gear you choose at the outset, all of which offer you special abilities to piece together and increase your chance of survival. You can plan ahead with these since you pick them yourself, look for combos, and build a strategy around them. But there are also destiny cards, random helpful bonuses that you can sometimes replenish by achieving in-game goals, and for these you’ll have to roll with whatever fate gives you, adjusting your tactics accordingly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With practice and luck you will, eventually, manage to beat Fauna and, in time, the game’s second scenario, Flora, which involves a giant carnivorous plant. Corps of Discovery goes out of its way to make these scenarios replayable by offering such a huge range of map sheets – you can also download and print out more – that memorising the layouts is essentially impossible. Variety, however, cannot fully undermine human psychology: there’s an innate tendency to treat a mission as “done” once it’s been won. This is exacerbated by the game’s high difficulty level and lack of narrative detail. Although it does a great job of conjuring up the spectre of starving in the wilderness, the challenge cards feel pretty mechanical, so repeated tries at a scenario can feel a little same-y.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191508329-1753126054718.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t quite the limiting factor it may sound like as it’ll take you repeated attempts to win both the scenarios, and there are expansions available which further the story and build considerably on the core mechanics – all four are included in the deluxe edition, which we used for the photos accompanying this review. But it still would have felt like a more complete experience if more of these elements had been included in the base game. As it stands, the game’s high toughness is the major motivation for a replay, and it’s almost enough by itself: winning against the odds, in a land where almost everything you encounter is out to kill you, is a hugely satisfying moment.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgxA8?object_uuid=efb277a0-a370-437f-878b-a449b5653b6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8e8O?object_uuid=efb277a0-a370-437f-878b-a449b5653b6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 23, 2025 5:36 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Corps of Discovery’s core concept of exploring and surviving in unknown, hostile terrain is a strong one, and it’s well executed with some novel mechanical ideas. Each play feels like a gruelling crawl across the wilderness, just as it should, and it feels very rewarding when you manage to eke out a win. As strong as this central pillar is, however, the core of the game lacks much in the way of support from narrative, player interaction, or variety, particularly given the sparse supply of different scenarios to play, so it might not return to your table as often as it should.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-corps-of-discovery-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

It costs 7 to Station and is a 5/5 in its own right (with Flying).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Esika’s Chariot</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225657"><div id="225657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Esika’s Chariot</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One for the cat lovers, <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxlZ4?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Esika’s Chariot</u></a> is a four-cost 4/4 that requires 4 to Crew, but can create tokens when it arrives, and then copy additional tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tie it in with Doubling Season and your go-wide strategy can be, uh, wider than ever, creating four tokens when it enters, and then duplicating more when it attacks. More kitties, more chaos.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Entropic Battlecruiser</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225658"><div id="225658" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Entropic Battlecruiser</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh boy, where to start?

Potentially, but we reckon it’s worth it for those people who love to mess with their opponents’ hands.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Exploration Broodship</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225659"><div id="225659" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Exploration Broodship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been looking for a fresh Landfall Commander, this could be it.

It’s found in the World Shaper Commander Deck, if you’re picking that one up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">RMS Titanic</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225660"><div id="225660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering RMS Titanic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As soon as the rules change was announced, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAKZj?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>RMS Titanic</u></a> from the Doctor Who set saw a lot of love, and it’s understandable for what could be a pretty fun (if not entirely functional) Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 7/1 with a relatively low crew cost, and only costs four mana to bring into play. It’ll also act as a Treasure token engine, has flying and trample. We’d imagine the play here will be buffing it as much as possible to then make a whole host of tokens, which you can then use to bring it back into play with the Commander tax.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Last Ride</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225661"><div id="225661" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering The Last Ride</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another one that could be great fun as a literal last-hurrah, this one-mana black Legendary Vehicle from Aetherdrift (that set feels a while ago, right?) could have meme potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OvwD?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Last Ride</u></a> is strongest the closer you are to death, and being able to roll it out from your Command zone to hit an opponent for big numbers is the kind of chaos we’re here for.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Indomitable</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225662"><div id="225662" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering The Indomitable</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy building a Pirate deck?

Doing so lets you dodge that Commander tax and bring in those card draw opportunities.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jackdaw</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225663"><div id="225663" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Jackdaw</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More pirates?

A 5/5 with flying that costs two colorless is nifty in itself, but it also draws when cards die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t ‘Crew’ in the traditional sense, but if you’re throwing a few tokens at a foe you could power it up (and draw/scry) pretty swiftly.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Lumen-Class Frigate</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225665"><div id="225665" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Lumen-Class Frigate</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Edge of Eternities option, the<a href="https://zdcs.link/z62kLj?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Lumen-Class Frigate</u></a> has a pair of Station abilities. The first lets you power up your creatures, making it easier to hit the second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be particularly fun with the Tidus deck from the Final Fantasy set as you swap your counters around to get a flying, lifelink spaceship powered up in various ways.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What to Consider When Picking Your Commander</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As with any Commander, picking a Legendary Vehicle that works into your desired playstyle is important, but many of the vehicles available are colorless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since you can only pick cards within your Commander’s color identity for your deck, that means you’d be limited to colorless cards if you opted for one of those. That may suit you just fine, but it’s worth mentioning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering’s Spacecraft explained</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Spacecraft make their debut in Edge of Eternities as a new Artifact Subtype. The idea is that your ship uses its ‘Station’ ability to pick up crew. Once you reach the required number of charge counters (calculated from the power of the cards you use to ‘Station’), your ship becomes an Artifact Creature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wurmwall Sweeper, for example, needs to be crewed by four or more, so using ‘Station’ to put a couple of 2/2s in there would work nicely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizards puts it best in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/edge-of-eternities-mechanics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its mechanics blog</u></a>: “If Wurmwall Sweeper has three charge counters on it, it's not a creature and it doesn't have flying. Once it gets its fourth charge counter, it becomes a 2/2 artifact creature with flying.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Magic: The Gathering's Edge of Eternities Set</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready to head to a whole new galaxy?
