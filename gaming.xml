<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/01/xbox-game-pass-october-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> the first wave of Game Pass titles for October 2024, and it features MLB The Show 24, Open Roads, Sifu, Mad Streets and Inscryption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MLB The Show 24 will be available for console through Game Pass Standard on October 2, allowing players to become legends in the baseball simulation title. Open Roads, an adventure/exploration game in which a mother and daughter travel to abandoned family properties while on a road trip, will also be available for the standard subscription service on October 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard players can also play Sifu on cloud, console, and PC on October 2. Sifu is an action/beat ’em up game in which players indulge in realistic, third-person Kung Fu brawls. The game also features an interesting mechanic where players age every time they die, adding more difficulty to the experience.</p>

        </ul>

    
    <p><span>Currently working on multiple projects.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Devolver Digital [378 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> has announced the launch of <a title="Companies > Big Fan Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital/big-fan-games">Big Fan Games</a>, a new video games publishing label dedicated to adaptations of entertainment brands. <span id="more-918944"></span></p><p>Through the label, Big Fan Games will give developers the chance to create original game adaptations using the worlds and characters of iconic film, television, and comic properties.</p><p>Big Fan Games is currently working on projects from “rad media properties” developed by independent developers.</p><p>Here is the full message from the label on its launch:</p><blockquote><p>Like you, we’re really into games. But when it comes to “licensed games,” we think there’s room for a new approach. One where indie developers get to make the call. To take some risks and explore unique ideas that aren’t dictated by spreadsheets. So we formed Big Fan to help make that dream a reality. From a team that carries a deep bench of experience working with games and entertainment properties like <em>Dune</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>, The <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>Hellboy</em>, <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>John Wick</em>, <em>Blair Witch</em>, <em>Power Rangers</em>, and more.</p><p>We believe (and have seen firsthand) that great games that propel existing franchises can offer a connection with a fan that only an interactive experience can offer. Independent games created in these universes can explore them in new and unexpected ways, and it’s our goal to raise the bar of what fans can expect.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Drawing inspiration from beloved franchises, we strive to bring these worlds closer to fans—both old and new—through the lens of creative teams driven by their passion for the material. We support developers by providing our industry expertise and the resources they need to bring their ideas to life. Our goal at Big Fan is to nurture fun and inventive games that stand on their own, rather than serving as marketing tie-ins for other media launches.</p><p>It’s easy for us to make grand statements in a press release, but we like to think we can back them up. Collectively, we’ve published a lot of different games on a lot of different platforms, some of which you might have even heard of. Our work includes collaborations with like-minded teams at Disney, Dark Horse Comics, Rebellion, Lionsgate, and more. We are actively working with these partners right now, with more on the way.</p><p>Have a favorite game you’ve always dreamed of rebooting or a cult classic film or book you’d love to see adapted into a game? We’d love to hear from you.</p></blockquote><p>Visit the Big Fan Games official website <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The book is full of tales and secrets from the history of the game studio, including insights into cancelled games, conflicts between key leaders, and the impact of Bobby Kotick's drive to control the studio's output through Activision Blizzard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Readers most concerned with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-settles-california-discrimination-suit-for-54-million">recently-settled lawsuit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> filed by the State of California over an alleged culture of sexual harassment, toxicity, and abuse won't find many new revelations here—the book doesn't quite answer the question "who knew what, and when?" that has lingered over allegations against the company. But it does explore how that culture came to be, and what factors kept the company from improving it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first warning sign appears on page 14, when describing design meetings at Silicon &amp; Synapse, the company first founded by Mike Morhaime and Frank Pearce in 1991 that would later take on the Blizzard moniker. "All of Silicon &amp; Synapse's employees were men, and these design meetings, fueled by caffeine and testosterone, could get rowdy. Sometimes there was screaming; sometimes there were fistfights," writes Schreier.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/q-a-with-blizzard-leadership-on-return-to-office-bonuses-leaves-devs-fuming" target="_self">Q&amp;A with Blizzard leadership on return-to-office, bonuses leaves devs fuming</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was called "management by chaos," and over time, with the added pressures of alcohol, the difficulty of game development, and the explosive success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it became a fire that couldn't be put out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Chaotic work environments aren't caused by any one person">Chaotic work environments aren't caused by any one person</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It seems that creative leaders that delivered success on one game by the seat of their pants were trusted to recreate the magic on follow-up titles—but that trust created excess pressure and created leeway for inappropriate behavior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Anecdotes about veteran developers Chris Metzen, David Brevik, and Rob Pardo across the company's history include a drunken brawl that led to a door being torn down, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sessions that slowed down work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and meetings that devolved into shouting matches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One developer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starcraft II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> told Schreier that developers would "just sit there for a full hour and watch Metzen and Pardo argue."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Metzen would say it should be pink. Pardo would instantly say it should be blue, and only an idiot would make it pink," they said. "It was painful to watch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This style of leadership finally crashed into a wall during the development of the cancelled MMORPG and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overwatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> predecessor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Titan</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Metzen and Pardo apparently weren't as vocal in their disagreements during this project, but their conflicting ideas left developers spinning in circles, unsure of which boss they were answering to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This overvalued trust in talented individuals led to the company allegedly looking the other way when warned about the behavior of employees like former </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Alexander Afrasiabi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another key issue in Blizzard's history is pay. Among the allegations against the studio were that the company underpaid female employees compared to their male counterparts. The company's settlements with the State of California and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-pledges-18m-to-settle-eeoc-harassment-and-discrimination-lawsuit">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> admitted no wrongdoing, but still created funds for current and former employees to access as compensation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, Schreier's book documents fights over pay that go back to the studio's early days. The first instance of employees not feeling fairly compensated for their hard work apparently happened after the company was sold to Davidson &amp; Associates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Former employee Pat Wyatt explained to Schreier that he and other employees were furious at being denied equity in Silicon &amp; Synapse before the sale, and though the transaction provided better compensation for workers, he was so angry he threatened to quit (the stock he was offered tanked in value after a later parent company, Cendant, was investigated by the SEC for fraudulent accounting practices).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Blizzard would later become well-known for its profit-sharing scheme for employees (a major point of contention between Morhaime and Kotick), but the path to that plan was full of speedbumps for underpaid developers. In 1998, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers were told they wouldn't receive their expected bonuses because the game shipped late. In 2005, developers received bonus checks as low as $2,000 after launching </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and some left to form Carbine Studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This incident led Blizzard leadership to convince then-parent company Vivendi to let it implement the more well-known profit-sharing process.</span></p><p>Photo by Bryant Francis.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In theory, this scheme compensated employees who take relatively lower salaries at Blizzard, since the company's success will drive paychecks at the end of the year. But in 2024, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/q-a-with-blizzard-leadership-on-return-to-office-bonuses-leaves-devs-fuming">Blizzard revamped the system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> again to prioritize employees on top-earning games, at the expense of their coworkers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the company couldn't square salaries that fairly compensated all employees, it's unsurprising it might find itself unfairly compensating women among its ranks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The glue that bound many of these problems together was the intense crunch, as long work hours were a constant at the company from day one. Blizzard employees coped with the long hours by bonding over alcohol and turning the office into a second home, creating the foundations of an in-group that could be hostile to outsiders.

            <p>Tango Gameworks had a six-month old build of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> sequel when the studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">acquired by Krafton back in August</a>.</p>
<p>The studio would also like to bring the game to more platforms and plans for the sequel to have a more open and dynamic environment.</p>
<p>Krafton acquired Tango Gameworks after the studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">closed by Microsoft earlier this year</a>. Not all staff have transferred over as some had already found new jobs, but Krafton estimates Tango will be back up to around 90 to 100 staff by the end of the year.</p>

</figure>
<p>The success of Hi-Fi Rush was a major factor in Krafton's decision to acquire the studio.</p>
<p>"I think that gave us confidence because the studio is not relying on the creativity of just Shinji Mikami," Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-dont-want-to-just-replicate-successful-games-behind-kraftons-acquisition-of-tango-gameworks">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "New creatives are coming from younger developers and they were very successful in delivering something so unique.</p>
<p>"We could tell that this is a studio capable of creating the full spectrum of different experiences. They have a couple of new projects in production, we looked at them, [and] they were very different from the previous titles."</p>
<p>As for bringing Hi-Fi Rush to further platforms, such as Nintendo Switch, that's "what the team really wants," said Park. "I think [they] want to work on Hi-Fi Rush DLC [too] because they are dedicated to ensuring that Hi-Fi Rush 2 upholds high standards of quality. They don't want to rush the sequel but take the necessary time to refine the game and come up with a different experience."</p>
<p>When Krafton first met with Tango Gameworks to discuss an acquisition, the build for the sequel was about six months old, though development has been on hold as the IP acquisition from Microsoft to Krafton is still underway.</p>
<p>"Yes, the team was working on Hi-Fi Rush 2 when we first met them," said Park. "They want to make sure [it] surpasses the expectations of the existing fans. For instance, some of the feedback about Hi-Fi Rush was that some people felt it was [just] going through factories, so now they want to give a more open world type of experience. I don't think it's going to be completely open world, but a more dynamic environment [that] you play in. Also, having more advanced technology applied to the rhythm action so that it feels more synchronised."</p>
<p>Park also confirmed Tango's other IP - Ghostwire: Tokyo and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a> - will stay with Microsoft and are not part of Krafton's acquisition.</p>
<p>In a previous interview, Krafton boss Changhan 'CH' Kim stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">aim of the acquisition was to "maintain their legacy"</a> and admitted he doesn't expect Hi-Fi Rush 2 to "make us money".</p>
<p>"The big hit shouldn't be your goal," said Kim. "If you think about it that way, Hi-Fi Rush might have brought in a little bit of a minus in terms of the financials, but it's a team that should be encouraged to create something new and continue their journey. We want to have more teams like that under our umbrella."</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush received critical acclaim, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's review</a> describing it as "vibrant and self-assured".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-new-details/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-2-is-coming-in-2026-new-details-revealed.997308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-new-details/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, the highly anticipated sequel to the game released in 2023, is set to arrive in 2026. The team at Hexworks aims to create a sequel incorporating more commercial elements, particularly in visual design, to attract a broader audience of players.</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://cigames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CI-Games-Strategy-Update-and-Product-Roadmap-2025-2028.pdf">strategy report from CI Games</a>, the game’s publisher, <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong> is being developed using Unreal Engine 5, with an official reveal planned for 2025 alongside a “strong marketing campaign”. However, it’s important to note that these timelines are internal goals and may change as development progresses.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One of the key objectives outlined in the report is to enhance the game’s accessibility, thereby drawing in a larger fan base for the game. Hexworks plans to achieve this by introducing additional game modes and implementing various gameplay improvements. One of the features it will include is a full ‘shared progression’ while playing in co-op alongside a core single-player campaign.</p>



<p>Another major detail revealed is regarding an exclusivity deal with Epic Games. <strong>The game will be an Epic Store exclusive</strong> on PC. </p>



<p>Having played both the original and the reboot of <strong>Lords of the Fallen</strong>, I believe the franchise holds significant potential. It could effectively fill the gap left by the absence of the <strong>Dark Souls</strong> series. In my opinion, the main challenge of the reboot was its excessive complexity, stemming from the existence of two separate “worlds.”</p>



<p>The studio could have revitalized the IP by taking a more direct approach, leaving the dual-world concept for a sequel when they had a bigger team and budget. Another aspect worth noting is that the sequel is expected to operate with a larger budget, as the report indicates.</p>



<p>Considering all the information provided, it seems promising that <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong> is on track to exceed the sales of the first game, which recorded 1.3 million units sold according to the CI Games document.</p>



<h2 id="h-beyond-lords-of-the-fallen-2-the-future-of-ci-games"><strong>Beyond Lords of the Fallen 2: The Future of CI Games</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, the publisher has apointed two other primary projects: <strong>Project SGW</strong>, a new installment in the <strong>Sniper Ghost Warrior</strong> series developed using Unreal Engine 5, and <strong>Project H</strong>, an exciting new fantasy RPG.</p>



<p>CI Games has also outlined three secondary paths for the company:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>United Label</strong>: The “indie” label plans to release between two to three games annually. Recently, they launched&nbsp;<strong>Beyond Galaxyland</strong> and are gearing up for the highly anticipated&nbsp;<strong>Tails of Iron 2</strong>, scheduled for release in February 2025. Furthermore, the label has confirmed a contract for&nbsp;<strong>Tails of Iron 3</strong>.</li>



<li>Project Scorpio: New tactical shooter IP with PvE focus made in Unreal Engine 5</li>



<li>Project Survive: New survival IP made in Unreal Engine 5</li>
</ol>



<p>As CI Games expands its portfolio, it looks to capitalize on a diverse array of genres, promising an exciting future for fans of the company’s games.</p>

Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was very supportive of Krafton's bid to save Tango and acquire the Hi-Fi Rush franchise, which should ensure that the sequel will come to fruition. During the interview, Krafton also said that there are more than the previously reported 50 employees of Tango who came back to the revived studio.</p><p>"When we started talking, there were about 90; among them, a few had already found new jobs," recalled Park. "There's going to be around 70 to 80 joining us. We're also going to backfill some of the positions that are immediately in need.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/dying-light-the-beast-captures-techland-s-passion-for-games-players-will-finish<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Techland's Dying Light games are pretty dang big. Step into the parkour-driven, zombie-riddled open worlds of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and you'll be hit by a flood of sidequests and extra challenges that add heft to a pair of already-lengthy campaigns. With over 30 million copies of both games sold, you'd be forgiven for thinking the completion rate for the pair is somewhat low.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it's not. In 2019 franchise director Tymon Smektala </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/building-interesting-emergence-in-i-dying-light-2-i-">told Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that about 50 percent of players had completed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, though that number apparently dipped with the sequel. In a conversation with Game developer at Gamescom 2024, he told us that the completion rate for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was about 10 percent smaller. He said both numbers are "higher than the industry average."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those are all respectable numbers, especially when the completion rates for single player games (and especially open-world ones) can run as low as 20 percent. Still, Smektala seemed perturbed by the dip, especially with the team now working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light: The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a smaller standalone game spun off from an abandoned downloadable expansion that was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc">leaked to the public</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Imagine that you work on the grand finale for your game and only half your players see it," he said. "It's especially important for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where we cap a lot of threads from the history of the series."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/deep-dive-harnessing-the-power-of-player-feedback-with-dying-light-2" target="_self">Deep Dive: Harnessing the power of player feedback with Dying Light 2</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As he and art director Katarzyna Tarnacka told Game Developer, the team want to push that number back up with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a goal that spotlights the challenge of making smaller, faster games with triple-A tech and timelines.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dying Light: The Beast"><span>Dying Light: The Beast</span> is on track to ship in under 3 years</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an era where ballooning development timelines are cranking up budgets and demanding a need for higher and higher sales, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> acts as an interesting experiment. It's a smaller—but still hefty—game built on its predecessor's tech, with some minor advancements that take advantage of a new console generation (it'll also ship on last-gen consoles to honor previous promises of making all </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> DLC available to all players), a minor technical miracle in itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But can a smaller game still hit the sales goals that justify its production? Smektala thinks so—though the game's length will be critical to determining that. "We have to definitely hit a sweet spot between this thing being too short—something you might avoid—and something that's so big you don't have time to finish it," he said. "We want this game to be finished by everyone that plays it because it really answers a lot of questions, and we really believe in the narrative that we have there."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That narrative is built around </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> protagonist "Kyle," played by Roger Craig Smith, who's returning to the role after 10 years away from Techland. Smith and Kyle are apparently a huge draw for Dying Light fans, as the actor told us he was watching reactions on social media and in live chats during the Gamescom opening night awards, and was blown away by the enthusiasm for his return.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kyle's return moves the series out of the walled cities and into a wooded environment, where players will spend more time surrounded by nature than run-down buildings. Players gain the ability to unleash "The Beast" and transform into a beefy zombie that can rampage through foes (though another Beastlike creature apparently stalks the woods...)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bringing the setting to a Twin Peaks-inspired forest (Smektala's words) gave the art and design teams more freedom than they had under the previously planned DLC. Tarnacka explained that she and her colleagues had been holding back "a lot of great ideas" due to the constraints of the smaller project. "When the decision was made, we could just unleash all the ideas and get this project to the state we knew it could be."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She said the smaller map means high-quality art assets aren't as big a drain on older consoles, and since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was already a cross-gen title, having to go backwards didn't dent the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Smektala joked that Techland's producers lost some of their power with this move. "The producer's job isn't to [make] the best game, it's to deliver that part of the game on time," he said. Techland producers had the power before to gently shoot down the art team's ideas with the phrase "leave it for the next game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, they weren't able to say that," he said (before praising them for supporting the team and finding time for them to execute their harebrained plans).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s fast turnaround raises the specter of generative AI tools, often pitched as helping developers work faster. Techland hasn't adopted any at this point, Smektala said (beyond "simple stuff," like taking notes in meetings).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Smith, a SAG-AFTRA member </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/sag-aftra-authorizes-video-game-actor-strike-over-ai">currently on strike</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over studios' refusal to agree to protective terms over the use of AI voices (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not a struck production), seemed amused at the idea of AI having the capability to replace him. He said he's interested in tools that help developers and actors work more efficiently, but there's a "spark" that he thinks makes characters like Kyle stick with players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AI isn't the only thing that can threaten that spark—Smith said returning to work with Techland to voice the same character 10 years later is a rare experience. He's an actor known for many recurring roles, but sometimes he's returned to the studio to find a different creative team waiting for him.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've had situations like that happen, where you go back and they say 'we got a different crew, we've got a different writer, we've got different everything,' and it just doesn't have that same sort of spark," he said. It's another endorsement of an idea many developers are hammering home these days in the wake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/tarn-adams-decries-industry-layoffs-mandated-by-horrible-greedy-people-">mass layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—that studios that keep talent around can use their learned experience to work better together.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can more games follow in Techland's footsteps?">Can more games follow in Techland's footsteps?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The practice of releasing expansive DLC for big-budget games is common, since they add value to the initial game and drive retention needed for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a different kind of project, one that recycles tools and tech for a larger game to get something smaller and more efficient out to the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If it's a success, it'd be an argument for companies the size of Techland (or bigger) to build processes that get more individual games out the door faster, alternating between large titles that push their tech forward, and smaller games that let them make the most of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Smektala seems personally invested in that completion rate (he brought it up unprompted to us in 2019, and hammered home its importance in this conversation). Boosting that number would definitely be a boon for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and a great tactic for propelling interest in the next numbered game as well.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

Headlining this month's first crop of additions is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, the kung fu combat action game that we dubbed as "elegant" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">Eurogamer's Sifu review</a>.
</p>
<p>
The full list of Xbox Game Pass titles for October 2024 is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MLB The Show 24 (console) - 2nd October</li>
<li>Open Roads (console) - 2nd October</li>
<li>Sifu (cloud, console and PC) - 2nd October</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-nvidia-geforce-driver-out-now-optimized-for-throne-liberty-mechwarrior-5-clans-and-starship-troopers-extermination.997275/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-nvidia-geforce-driver-out-now-optimized-for-throne-liberty-mechwarrior-5-clans-and-starship-troopers-extermination/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 565.90 WHQL) today, delivering optimizations for three PC games: NCSoft's free-to-play MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-pre-launch-qa-new-weapons-and-pvp-modes-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> (out today after a five-day early access reserved to owners of the Founder's Packs), Offworld's coop FPS <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-1-0-launches-on-october-11-adding-single-player-mode-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starship Troopers: Extermination</a> (out on October 11, when it will leave early access), and Piranha's narrative-driven shooter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mechwarrior-5-clans-is-out-on-october-3-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MechWarrior 5: Clans</a> (out on October 17).</p>
<p>All three games support NVIDIA DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation), providing optimal performance for owners of GeForce RTX graphics cards. According to NVIDIA, for example, Throne and Liberty runs 2.6x faster on average at 4K resolution with maxed settings and DLSS 3 enabled, with the RTX 4090 reaching over 180 frames per second. There's a big difference with the RTX 4080 SUPER, which averages 'only' 138.5 frames per second, while the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER registers 117.7 frames per second, the RTX 4070 SUPER stops just shy of 100 frames per second, and the RTX 4070 is at 87 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Beyond this trio of games, NVIDIA DLSS 3 is also being <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-specs-released-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-and-ray-tracing-are-supported/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> to Until Dawn, the remake of the 2015 horror-themed interactive horror game made by Supermassive. This remake, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and handled by Ballistic Moon, also features ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion to enhance visuals.</p>
<p>Another game due to launch later this month with DLSS 3 support is the indie heavy metal horror title Axis Unseen. Crafted by one-man developer Nate Purkeypile, a Bethesda veteran who worked on games like Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Starfield before going independent, Axis Unseen launches on October 22, but you can already download a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The GeForce Game Ready driver synergizes with an update to the NVIDIA app beta that adds highly requested features like G-SYNC controls, driver rollback, RTX HDR multi-monitor support, and more. Finally, there's a couple of fixed bugs listed in the driver <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/565.90/565.90-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changelog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Final Fantasy XV]. Turning on Turf Effects causes texture flickering with drivers newer<br>
than 546.65.</li>
<li>[Dying Light 2 Stay Human] Game launch shows frozen white screen then crashes to<br>
desktop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada and game designer Michael Murray recently revealed how they tried to bring KFC’s Colonel Sanders as a fighter but were ultimately rejected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, Katsuhiro Harada revealed that he had an idea to include KFC’s iconic mascot, Colonel Sanders, in the Tekken roster. To pitch this character, he visited the head office in Japan. However, Harada’s proposal was met with disapproval, as he received a “bad look”, and the idea was ultimately rejected.</p>



<p>Murray provided more context, stating that the people at KFC’s headquarters “weren’t very open to the idea” when Harada attempted to include Colonel Sanders in the Tekken roster. However, Colonel Sanders appeared in other games after that discussion, leading Murray to believe that “maybe it was just him fighting against someone” was the problem. He concluded, “It just goes to show how difficult these types of discussions are.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-2-was-in-development-when-krafton-saved-tango-gameworks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hi-fi-rush-2-was-in-development-when-krafton-saved-tango-gameworks.997269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-2-was-in-development-when-krafton-saved-tango-gameworks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was earth-shattering news when Microsoft unexpectedly decided to close down Tango Gameworks—the studio behind the shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush, which quickly rose in popularity. But an unlikely savior stepped forward during the announcement. Krafton, the Korean publisher known for PUBG and The Callisto Protocol, flew to Japan to acquire Tango Gameworks and, in the moment, gained Hi-Fi Rush. However, according to the head of corporate development, Maria Park, the studio was already working hard on a new game. It appears Hi-Fi Rush 2 was in development at Tango during its closure and eventual purchase by Krafton.</p>



<p>While speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-dont-want-to-just-replicate-successful-games-behind-kraftons-acquisition-of-tango-gameworks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Maria Park discussed why she believes it’s essential to salvage creative teams and studios, saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When we look at Tango, all the games they’ve released were unique in their own way. Their philosophy and craftsmanship have aligned with what we pursue. We had big fans of Hi-Fi Rush and other titles, and I knew they were working on Hi-Fi Rush 2 when we started talking. We thought we could carry on that legacy and offer more creative ways to keep the game updated.</p>



<p>Also, the opportunity to take over the IP from Microsoft. It’s very unusual for them to sell the IP even in case of a studio shutdown. We spoke with Phil Spencer directly and we have their direct support. He has been incredibly accommodating to the needs of the Tango team. So securing the rights to this IP, we should be able to continue this successful series but also explore potential expansions and new creative directions.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Tango Gameworks</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the interview, it appears Krafton intends to continue expanding and investing in the Japanese game development market. It currently has 13 studios under its belt, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PUBG Studios</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bluehole Studio</strong></li>



<li><strong>RisingWings</strong></li>



<li><strong>Striking Distance Studios</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dreamotion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Unknown Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>5minlab</strong></li>



<li><strong>Neon Giant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Krafton Montreal Studio</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vector North</strong></li>



<li><strong>Relu Games</strong></li>



<li><strong>Flyway Games</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tango Gameworks</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While it’s fantastic to see Krafton supporting the gaming industry in such a way, rescuing a shuttering studio on the brink, it’s curious to hear more about its business plans. They don’t want to chase trends or “replicate successful games,” as many other publishers and game developers opt for these days. They want unique titles from creative teams, and that’s beyond exciting to us!</p>



<p>What do you think of Krafton buying Tango Gameworks? More importantly, what do you think of Hi-Fi Rush 2 in development at Tango? Let us know in the comments below, or visit our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a> for more!</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has said he wants to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> on Xbox at some point. 
</p>
<p>
But when will Xbox fans finally see the game arrive? On that, Yoshida was less forthcoming.
</p>
<p>
"Of course we did announce the PC version of the game, so looking towards the Xbox version, we do want to release it on Xbox," Yoshida told Sports Illustrated's <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/final-fantasy-14-naoki-yoshida-interview">Video Games</a> site.
</p>
<p>
"But when it comes to the specifics such as when the game would be available and such, we are not in a position to be able to share anything. But of course, I want to say that it's not as if there's zero hope, and we very much do want to achieve that. So players should not give up in terms of their hopes."
</p>
<p>
Back in January, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-is-coming-to-xbox-leaker-suggests">report pegged Final Fantasy 16</a> - then a PlayStation timed-exclusive - as coming to Xbox at some point, though not any time soon, and certainly not before the game's timed-exclusivity period ran out this past summer. 
</p>
<p>
We've since seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-16-is-highly-demanding-on-pc-and-these-are-the-best-settings">Final Fantasy 16 arrive on PC</a>, of course, and there's been an incentive for Square Enix to release the game wider still as it has admitted both Final Fantasy 16 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> "did not meet our expectations" in terms of sales. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Square Enix said it was "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy, including "Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs" to try and turn its financials around. It all sounds like an Xbox launch will happen sooner rather than later - and potentially also a version for Nintendo <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, too. 
</p>
<p>
Edwin Evans-Thirlwell described the game as "a smart combat system straining under the weight of a characterful but ponderous pseudo-medieval soap opera, with some of the grandest bosses and dullest sidequests in FF history," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-review-16-easy-to-like-hard-to-adore">Eurogamer's Final Fantasy 16 review</a>.

		<p>You pretty much know what you’re going to get with a Mario Party game these days, now that the series’ most experimental phase is seemingly behind it. There’s the board games, the minigames and then a healthy helping of arbitrary shenanigans that makes Mario Kart’s blue shells look tame by comparison. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> adds a bunch of new ways to mix up the main Mario Party game mode, but also comes with an antidote that cuts out a lot of the randomisation. Enter the Pro Rules.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Party Jamboree – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKR6sdcO4ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pro Rules is the version of Mario Party you need to play if you’re tired of having victory snatched away from you at the last moment, whether it’s someone paying a Boo to steal a star off you, the new Buddy system giving another player a massive advantage by doubling up all their opportunities for a few rounds, or a bad spin when landing on a Bowser space ripping a star off you. And that’s before we think about the end game bonus stars, which can hand out stars for purely luck-based things like landing on event spaces, or finding invisible boxes.</p>


<p>As I write things down, I’m reminded just how many of these randomised elements are found in these games!</p>
<p>Pro Rules strip out a bunch of this randomisation, making Mario Party much more of a competitive sport with clarity from the first turn to the last.</p>


<p>It starts with the core set up, with Pro Rules setting a game to a fixed 12 turns run, and announcing which one of three bonus stars will be in effect –&nbsp;furthest travelled, least travelled and most even spaces.</p>
<p>The boards themselves have also been modified and what special spaces offer now set in stone, so there’s no chance time spaces, lucky spaces only give you coins or a double dice, and Bowser spaces will always remove 1 star. Even the potential locations of stars are indicated, making them much more predictable and allowing a bit more forward thinking and planning from players.</p>

<p>Players also get to pick one of a small selection of items to start the game with, and as you pass a shop, you’ll see that there’s two of each item stocked, with no fresh shipments to top them up.</p>
<p>This is still Mario Party at it’s core, though. You’re still trying to rush across a quirkily themed board&nbsp;–&nbsp;I quite like the new karting themed one, Roll ’em Raceway–&nbsp;get to and buy stars, and get one over your rival players where possible. To that end, there’s still some of the shenanigans featured, with the Boo space still letting you steal coins or pay for a stolen star, trap that you can lay to steal from hapless players that land on them, and the aforementioned Bowser space stealing a star from you. It’s just that little bit more predictable in a way that could be more palatable to those who dislike too much randomisation in their games, and allow for more specific strategies.</p>

<p>Between turns, you also still have the minigames –&nbsp;now randomly chosen from player votes and removing more luck-based games – and these are really still the heart of Super Mario Party Jamboree. I know some people who’ve never even played the main Mario Party game in favour of the quick bite-sized minigame modes that have them going back-to-back-to-back.</p>
<p>While a great addition for those that want it, I imagine that the main Mario Party mode will still be the more popular one. For one thing, games can be much longer for a full evening’s entertainment, but also some of the more excessive random elements can be a great leveller for someone that had a rotten string of luck and poor dice rolls to start a game. Either way, it’s still Mario Party, and Super Mario Party Jamboree promises to be the biggest game in the series to date.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-fortnite-parental-controls</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-fortnite-parental-controls-let-parents-set-time-limits-and-more.997227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-fortnite-parental-controls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced new parental controls for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;that allow parents to control the amount of time their kids spend playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, as well as using the game's creative editor UEFN.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/introducing-time-limit-controls-and-time-reports-for-fortnite-and-uefn?sessionInvalidated=true" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on its official website</a>, Epic reveals two new parental control initiatives: Time Limit Controls and Time Reports. They do pretty much exactly what you'd imagine based on the names.</p>
<p>Time Limit Controls allow parents to limit the time their child spends playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>or using UEFN each day, as well as allocating specific windows of time for play. Kids can then request more time, which parents can allow or deny as they see fit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-parental-controls-cybertruck.jpg?itok=NZRsgH1t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-parental-controls-cybertruck.jpg?itok=tqB3Ce3C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now limit the amount of time your kid spends driving the Cybertruck in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, so, uh, win-win?</figcaption></figure><p>If a parent sets up time controls in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>or UEFN, then their kid will get a notification when they've got 30 minutes until the time window expires. They can ask for more time if they head to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s menu, then View Time Limits.</p>
<p>These controls are, as you might imagine, account-wide, so it doesn't matter what device a kid is using; time limits are in effect for both&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and UEFN across consoles, PC, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Time limits are paused while&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and UEFN are inactive, which means when&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>enters <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/c1/a000091883" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sleep mode</a> or UEFN goes into <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/c1/a000091865" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">idle mode</a>. It doesn't mean while menus are open, though.</p>
<p>As for Time Reports, they let parents see a daily breakdown of how much time their kid is spending in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>or UEFN, and they also show when parents have granted extra time for their kids to play more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-parental-controls-time-limits.jpg?itok=vp_10Nyf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-parental-controls-time-limits.jpg?itok=USSwjrl0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is what you'll see if&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new time limit controls are active, and they work across all&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>experiences, too.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2019, three Canadian parents <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-addiction-lawsuit-likens-games-effect-to-cocaine">brought a class-action lawsuit</a> against Epic over fears their children had become addicted to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63911176" rel="noopener" target="_blank">approved by a judge in 2022</a>, and while these kinds of lawsuits against Epic aren't exactly common, these new parental controls could go a long way towards minimizing their frequency further.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s&nbsp;new parental controls come shortly after Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-samsung-lawsuit-mobile-blocker">launched a brand new lawsuit</a>, this time against Google and Samsung over the latter's practice of enabling a protocol on its mobile devices that makes downloading third-party apps harder.</p>
<p>Whether or not the new parental controls make a material difference remains to be seen. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-EA developers and staffers have banded together to create a brand new studio by the name of Three Thousands, and its first game is due to arrive sometime next year.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-vets-open-new-studio-the-three-thousands-in-melbourne" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Three Thousands is based in Melbourne and is headed up by former EA Australia general manager Joseph Donoghue. He'll serve as the new studio's CEO.</p>
<p>Donoghue is joined by ex-EA Melbourne racing general manager Nikhil Kurian, who'll take the position of the CPO at the new company, as well as EA Melbourne creative director Benjamin Dawe, who'll serve as Three Thousands' CCO.</p>

<p>Three Thousands' first game is scheduled for 2025, and it sounds like it'll be a racing game, which makes sense given the founders' pedigree.</p>
<p>The studio says it's looking to create something beyond the gaming world, though; it wants to make a "digital ecosystem that connects racing enthusiasts and gamers through interactive entertainment".</p>
<p>Donoghue says the goal with Three Thousands is to "become the ultimate digital automative brand" and to blend the worlds of "racing, culture, and entertainment in a way no-one has done before". Clearly, this isn't a studio with small dreams.</p>

<p>He says that because of this, the studio is "positioned to build world-class products on efficient budgets", pledging to "push the boundaries of world-class innovation" with Three Thousands' games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are big promises, but we'll have to wait and see whether the studio is capable of realizing them. Stay tuned for more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

<p>Pokemon UNITE’s developers have decided to end service in Belgium and the Netherlands on November 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon UNITE’s website has a <a href="https://unite.pokemon.com/en-gb/news/notice-of-termination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new announcement</a> stating that service will stop for Belgium and the Netherlands next year. Players cannot download the game on mobile devices (iOS and Android) or the Nintendo Switch after November 30, 2025. Moreover, they can’t purchase in-game items like Aeos Games and Subscriptions after October 31, 2024. Players must “use all in-game items” before the end date.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-why-is-pokemon-unite-ending-service-in-belgium-and-the-netherlands">Why is Pokemon UNITE Ending Service in Belgium and the Netherlands</h2>



<p>The Pokemon UNITE announcement does not tell players why they are shutting services in these countries. It is speculated that laws regarding loot boxes in Belgium and the Netherlands could be why. Belgium has already banned loot boxes, whereas the Netherlands is pursuing a ban, according to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2023-a-global-update-on-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-unite-fans-express-disappointment-nbsp">Pokemon UNITE Fans Express Disappointment&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Pokemon UNITE fans are expressing disappointment about the decision in the comments section of the game’s latest social media posts. Days after the announcement, posts about the ‘<a href="https://x.com/PokemonUnite/status/1840391080170119548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">September Rayquaza Cup</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://x.com/PokemonUnite/status/1840801291641266208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tournament Premium Pass</a>‘ on X (formerly Twitter) were flooded with comments from players asking the developers to “<a href="https://x.com/HeyLookItsFNaFb/status/1840906999933923521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remove loot boxes</a>” and reverse their decision to end their service in Belgium and the Netherlands. However, the developers have yet to respond.&nbsp;</p>
