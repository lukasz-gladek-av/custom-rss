		<p>Taking a break from all the real world war machines and historical battling, Wargaming’s next foray is a full-on sci-fi mech battler. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a> is launching into Early Access on 2nd April, with Wargaming aiming to push ahead for a full 1.0 launch in relatively short order. We’ve been hands on with the game ahead of time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters Early Access Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fEr0Sd4iNSE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Steel Hunters is a pretty fun time. Sure, my opinion might be coloured by going completely undefeated while visiting Wargaming’s team, DPS Games in Guildford, and that fact would have been skewed by largely playing against bots while being paired up with very experienced play testers, but I can only imagine that it would still be fun even if I’d lost a few times?</p>


<p>A huge part of that enjoyment is found in the Hunters themselves. There’s a broad variety of designs, from fairly standard bipedal soldier-y types, to lithe snipers and hovering drone-summoning support, but the stars of the show are the animalistic designs, with spiders, bears and dogs all represented in the initial line up of styles. They feel like legally distinct Zoids, since the narrative is that these towering robots have been implanted with human consciousness, rather than having pilots or being AI. Not that it really matters once you start to smash them together like robot action figures – actually a rather apt comparison, when seeing how the models have been constructed out of dozens, if not hundreds of individual parts.</p>
<p>There’s good, strong contrast between each character and their roles. Razorside is one of two basic all-rounders with a standard assault rifle, while Heartbreaker is the sniper, with stealth abilities to improve their escapability. It really is the animal designs that shine, though. Ursus is the bear-like bot, with a close range shotgun and tough ice armour ability to reward you with getting in close, while Fenris is speedier, comes with energy abilities to quickly close range and drop a ball of damaging energy –&nbsp;this quickly became my favourite character for chasing down fleeing opponents after knocking their shields, and then finishing them at close range.</p>


<p>Each Hunter has both a fairly lengthy skill tree of unlocks to boost power a few percentage points and tweak their abilities, as well as a suite of Mods and Gear to unlock and choose between. Razorside can mod his Assault Rifle, for example, to switch between a fully automatic and burst firing modes.</p>
<p>Taking them into battle, DPS Games has struck a fine balance between size, heft and speed. Coming in at around 8 meters tall, you’re the size of a mature tree, big enough to smash through buildings with ease – literally just walk at them fast enough and they’ll get out the way – and the three maps in the game so far do a great job of selling that sense of scale. There’s a real feel of being a big and heavy machine with the default walking speeds, but you’re much more mobile than that, really. There’s perfect responsiveness to quick looking around with mouse &amp; keyboard, and sprinting just tips the pace from the “realistically stompy” end of the scale to the “fast, but more fun” side. That contrasts strongly with the slow rate of weapon reloading, which forces you to play tactically, even at full speed.</p>
<p>Steel Hunters will launch into Early Access with one game mode called Last Stand, a light riff on ideas from the battle royale and extraction shooter genres. You drop in at the start of the match with six pairs of Hunters spaced evenly around the map, with the early goal being to quickly find and harvest resources from fairly mindless drones nearby. Given the initial spacing and nearby points of interest, it’s pretty likely that you’ll run into one of the neighbouring duos quite quickly, giving that early game combat to help whittle down the field.</p>
<p>You’re fairly underpowered at this point with just the base abilities of your character and without having ramped up your stats with the ultra-simplistic looting. In addition to ammo and repair kits, Drones and caches will drop triangular, diamond and circular stat boosts to increase your structural health, shields and damage output. They come in the standard looting colours – white, green, blue and purple –&nbsp;and I appreciate just how straightforward grabbing them is. You can have two of each type, and you can see what your partner has equipped in the UI, making the judgement calls on what to grab or what to share as simple as glancing at the bottom corner of the screen.</p>

<p>After the first few minutes, a simple objective pops up, typically heading to a zone where high value and more aggressive drones are about to spawn in. The potential rewards are increased here, but so too is the chance of bumping into other teams as the objective draws players together. Eventually, it’s all brought to a head by a timed extraction, tasking you with reaching the point on the map and capturing and holding out for two minutes. It’s that last ditch chance for any surviving teams to butt heads, leading either to a successful extraction or a team winning by being the last ones standing.</p>
<p>It’s short, it’s pithy, it’s effective. Last Stand matches doesn’t last all that long –&nbsp;maybe 20 minutes or so –&nbsp;and the pace is kept up by the straightforward goals of quickly levelling, grabbing power boosts and then facing off in that final stage. DPS is working on further game modes that will layer in further ideas on this format –&nbsp;Starfall Harvest is a mode that was originally meant for launch, but needs a little more time to be refined –&nbsp;and down the line there could easily be modes that mix up team sizes, objectives and everything else.</p>

<p>Looking to hit the ground and get stomping, Steel Hunters will start off with no monetisation in Early Access. Only once Wargaming and DPS are happy with the game’s progress and potential will they start to introduce monetisation and push for a 1.0 launch, but there’s already a planned rollout of content through the first couple of months. April will be Season 0 with Season 1 coming in May and bringing new hunters to the table. There’s also plans to adjust the UI, HUD, the overarching Hunter progression and more in tandem with early player feedback.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that the core of the game already feels solid, and that there’s some great Hunter designs with really strong contrasts in their gameplay and tactical combat potential. Now, the only question is, do I risk my 100% record when the game is opened to the masses?</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler has made some nice progress lately, so much so that it now reportedly always delivers better image quality than TAA, temporal anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa-rtgi-shader-compilation-taa-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> regarding the revamped version of the Anvil Engine that powers Assassin's Creed Shadows, Engine Technical architects Nicolas Lopez and Pierre Fortin and Project Lead Programmer Rendering Sébastien Daigneault commented on why the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game currently doesn't support the PSSR upscaler, saying that, at the time of shipping the game, they found better results with TAA.</p>
<p>However, after an in-depth collaboration with Sony over the past few months, many issues have been addressed, especially regarding moving vegetation and water, issues that have been found in other games as well. As such, PSSR now always delivers better image quality than TAA, and support will be added in the future. Alongside PSSR support, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will also get ray-traced reflections in Balanced Mode, providing better visuals at a higher framerate than Quality Mode.</p>
<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly looks great on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game's visuals truly shine on PC, especially on system configurations that can handle all the ray tracing features the game has to offer. Even without all the bells and whistles, the latest entry in the series is definitely worth playing for fans of the franchise's open-world RPG approach, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>Game development can be stressful, I'm sure you've heard. The director of fighting game series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken">Tekken</a> yesterday shared an anecdote about how wild that stress can get. Speaking about the release of Tekken 4 in 2001, director Katsuhiro Harada remembered it didn't perform as well as previous games. And the game's relatively weak reception (alongside a lack of support at Bandai Namco) sent his body into a spiral of ill-health from anxiety. </p>
<p>"I was under so much stress at the time that I developed a mysterious condition where all the hair on the right side of my body fell out - just the right side," said the director in <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1904208862754038011">a post on Xitter</a>. "Even the hair on my arms, eyebrows, and eyelashes disappeared."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If it sounds unusual that hair loss might affect only one side of the body, it's not actually that uncommon for balding to occur on one side before the other. Conditions like <a href="https://www.bad.org.uk/pils/alopecia-areata/">alopecia areata</a> can be activated from stress and cause hair loss from eyebrows, eyelashes, and facial hair. It's basically an immune system response - your body feels under threat and goes into overdrive, attacking and inflaming even its own hair follicles. Of course, I don't know if this is what was going on with Harada's body at the time - I was in school, ignoring the maths teacher. But the developer is convinced that work pressures definitely caused the problem.</p>
<p>"Actually, there was a period - just for about a year before development on Tekken 5 began - when I left Namco due to the stress and shock. It’s not a widely known fact, though," continued Harada in the post, as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tekken-producer-katsuhiro-harada-opens-up-about-the-severe-side-effects-of-stress-he-experienced-while-developing-tekken-4/">Automaton</a>.</p>
<p>The developer made the comments after a random follower praised Tekken 4 for being "the most authentic and adult Tekken ever released". Praise which Harada notes is only offered with hindsight.</p>
<p>"But back then, I was absolutely bombarded with criticism," he said. "I didn’t have a single ally. Not one. That’s a well-known story inside the company.</p>
<p>"Now, in the present day, the critics have all forgotten their complaints, and only those who want to praise the game remain. That’s the only reason it's being treated like a masterpiece. For me, whether good or bad, this title remains a constant reminder and lesson to myself."</p>
<p>Years later, we're now sitting pretty on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and Harada remains the director of the series. Did you know he once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-tekken-director-failed-to-get-kfcs-colonel-sanders-in-the-fighting-game-but-here-are-10-other-corporate-mascots-he-could-try">tried to convince KFC to let him put Colonel Sanders in the fighting game</a>? Anyway, the latest entry is pretty swell according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>, although I'm still waiting for my favourite characters to join the party. Most recently we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annoying-little-sister-anna-williams-is-coming-to-tekken-8-in-second-season-of-dlc">seen Anna Williams appear</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-fighter-is-clive-actually">guest character Clive</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>. Every time Lei Wulong is left on the bench, I weep a single tear. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite’s early access FPS game mode, Ballistic, is finally getting a new map, Hammer Fall, three months after it launched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Ballistic game mode was released in early access on December 11, 2024, and since that day, players have been messing about in just one map, Skyline 10. However, Fortnite has just announced v.34.20, which will introduce Ballistic’s first new map since launch, along with balancing changes, economy adjustments and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-hammer-fall-gets-added-to-fortnite-ballistic">Hammer Fall Gets Added to Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Hammer Fall is the latest castle-themed map introduced for Fortnite Ballistic, adding a medieval theme to the game mode. The “castle’s verticality” will differentiate this map from Skyline 10, providing “comfortable cover, angles to hold, and corners to play.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hammer Fall will first be released as a shell map, meaning it will arrive without any environmental art. This will allow the devs to quickly change the map’s layout if there’s any feedback. The final art and finishing touches will be added to Hammer Fall once Fortnite Ballistic players thoroughly test it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-ballistic-balancing-and-economy-changes">Fortnite Ballistic Balancing and Economy Changes</h2>



<p>The new Fortnite Ballistic v34.20 update will add buffs to weapons like Hammer Pump Shotgun, Frenzy Auto Shotgun, Thunder Burst SMG and Striker AR. Some weapon prices have been adjusted, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-weapon-buffs">Weapon Buffs</h3>



<ul>
<li>Hammer Pump Shotgun’s fire rate has slightly increased, and its point-blank damage has increased significantly.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Frenzy Auto Shotgun’s point-blank and mid-range damage have increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Thunder Burst SMG’s damage and fire rate have slightly increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The range at which damage falloff begins has been reduced for the Striker AR.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-economy-adjustments">Economy Adjustments</h3>



<ul>
<li>Reaper Sniper Rife: Price decreased from 4700 to 4500 Credits.</li>



<li>Striker AR: Prince increased from 2500 to 2700 Credits.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Nemesis AR: Price increased from 2500 to 2700 Credits.</li>



<li>Drum Gun: Price decreased from 3500 to 3200 Credits.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-changes-to-fortnite-ballistic-nbsp">Upcoming Changes to Fortnite Ballistic&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/ballistic-34-20-balance-changes-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for the Fortnite Ballistic v34.20 update, the developers addressed all the feedback they have received so far. Players want new maps, weapons, gadgets, additional starter pistols, better ways to deal with AFK players, new additions to the HUD, and efficient inventory management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have stated that adding new weapons and gadgets to Ballistic is one of their main priorities, and they will arrive soon. New pistol options will also come. They are currently figuring out how to deal with AFK players. However, they have confirmed that an “option to surrender” is in development and will likely arrive in summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The devs have discussed new crosshair options and ways to improve inventory management regarding HUD additions. However, they don’t have concrete plans to share right now. They are working on a change to show which player on your team has the Rift Point device better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, their other major priority is “dialing in the first-person feel and improving the core of how the game handles first-person weapons.” These are being worked on and will be revealed in the “improvements and fixes” sections of upcoming blog posts.&nbsp;</p>

Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed"><u>high-profile flops</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices"><u>layoffs</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>studio closures</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once"><u>game cancellations</u></a> in the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips"><u>reportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investors</u></a> on a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-2-million-players-2-days-after-release-ubisoft-says-its-now-surpassed-origins-and-odyssey-launches">Assassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch</a>, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there. BioWare’s single-player RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a> saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventuring across feudal Japan?

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/canabalt">Canabalt</a> developer and Tunic publisher Adam “Atomic” Saltsman has released a free “mash-up” of Wolfenstein and the original Prince Of Persia.

Unlike in the original Prince Of Persia, each screen shows you the full level with a fog of war effect. This pleases me, because the act of moving between screens in OG POP used to fill me with terror, at least till I memorised the map. Remember the first time you felt the ground give way and fell on some spikes in Prince Of Persia? At least when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> ran out of air you got a countdown. Eesh.
</p>
<p>
You can find Prince Of Prussia – not bad as puns go, but I feel like there's an absolute banger here waiting to be discovered - on <a href="https://adamatomic.itch.io/prince">Itch.io</a>. There are at least 60 Nazis to slaughter. Both the PICO-8 action buttons are used for jumping. Rather than engaging in a clash of scimitars, you kill the Nazis simply by walking into them from behind once you’ve found yourself a knife. 
</p>
<p>
Saltsman has <a href="https://adamatomic.itch.io/">made a few things for Itch</a>, ranging from free tilesets to moderately leftfield sokobans and “bandit accountancy” games. All good stuff, but nothing rivals leaping through that window in Canabalt.

            <p>
A Japanese shrine famous to video game fans has announced a ban on visits by tourists, following an "unforgivable act of disrespect".
</p>
<p>
In 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-fans-crowdfund-repairs-to-typhoon-hit-island">Ghost of Tsushima players helped the Tsushima Watatzumi Shrine shrine raise 27m yen (£192k)</a> to repair its Torii gate, after it was destroyed in a typhoon. The crowdfunding campaign ultimately raised 500 per cent of its original target.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, the Watazumi Shrine has announced a total ban on tourist visits, after an incident occured earlier this week on 23rd March described only as "a grave and unforgivable act of disrespect committed by foreigner(s)".

<p>
Further details of the incident have not been released, though a message on the Watazumi Shrine's social media accounts states that, going forward, only worshippers will be allowed entrance.
</p>
<p>
Unacceptable behaviour by tourists at the Watazumi Shrine is nothing new, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-shrine-once-repaired-thanks-to-ghost-of-tsushima-fans-bans-all-tourists-after-unforgivable-act-of-disrespect/">Automaton reports</a>, and a previous, controversial ban had seen South Korean visitors barred, after incidents of vandalism and abuse directed towards staff.
</p>
<p>
Now, all tourists - domestic and foreign - are banned.
</p>
<p>
"Inbound tourism's destruction of places, things, and people cherished by the Japanese is nothing less than the destruction of Japanese culture," the shrine's message states. 
</p>
<p>
"Those who consider this place a theme park or simply a photogenic location are not worshippers."
</p>
<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-detailed-includes-destructible-shrine-changes-after-concern-over-copycats">Assassin's Creed Shadows quietly released an update that reduced the amount of destruction possible by players in the game's version of shrines</a>, after pre-release footage of a player causing damage sparked concern.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-3-may-be-getting-close-to-release-as-the-game-is-reportedly-in-the-optimization-phase-%E2%80%93-rumor.1143921/</guid>

			<p>The development of Half-Life 3 may be close to completion, as the unannounced game suspected to be the third main entry in the series has entered the optimization phase.</p>
<p>The latest news of the game known by its HLX codename, which was discovered in recent updates for other Valve games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, have been shared in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gabe.follower">Gabe Follower</a>, who detailed plenty of other recent discoveries, such as groups named hlx, hlxaudio and hlxartists having been found in Valve's internal systems, the introduction to the code of console commands related to optimization and NPC behavior adjustments, dynamic navigation mesh, deformable props, improved dynamic hair systems and more. All of this suggests not only how this HLX game is nearing completion but also how it is going to be a complex game, which is making people believe it could indeed be the long-anticipated conclusion to Gordon Freeman's story.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Half-Life 3 is Almost Ready? - HLX News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTzIwXj0170?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Valve stated multiple times in the past it is not working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-steam-deck-software/">Half-Life 3</a>, this HLX game may not be Half-Life 3, so we shouldn't get our hopes up too much. For all we know, it could be another spin-off in the vein of Half-Life Alyx, which was released back in 2020 and took some time to become playable even without a VR headset with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-8k-ultra-settings-rtx-4080/">mods</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the silence from Valve regarding Half-Life 3, fans of the series still got something new to try out this week with the release of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a>. You can learn more about how ray tracing changes the classic game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/">piece.</a></p>

            <p>If there's one thing I know about you sickos it's that you love a good city builder. No, don't try to deny it. I have the site traffic data right here and the numbers do not lie (unless they make me look bad to people who outrank me). You people are never happier than when you're wallowing in a bathtub full of upgradeable cottages, taxation sliders and pop satisfaction metrics. It's a disgraceful habit, but I'm not here to judge - not when there's a Steam City Builder &amp; Colony Sim Fest underway.</p><!--more-->

Town-builders? But of course there are town-builders. Pyramid-builders? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101280/The_Pyraplex/">Sure, why not</a>. Mushroom-builders? OK, I can see you've been working too hard... wait! There <em>is</em> a mushroom-builder. It's called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521550/Shroomchitect/">Shroomchitect</a> and it's currently roundabouts the price of two, maybe three high street sausage rolls. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>In terms of discounts on well-received games, you can get Klei's banging asteroid colony builder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oxygen-not-included">Oxygen Not Included</a>, coal-fired dystopia-me-do <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and cutaway 2D skyscraper management sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-highrise">Project Highrise</a> for less than a tenner each.

<p>Let me know if you spot any gems going for the price of two, possibly three high street sausage rolls. I confess, I like building cities myself, though it's a genre I seldom find time for because my attention span has been smashed to pieces by daily newswriting. If you know of any building sims that are especially easy to resume playing after long absences, I'd appreciate a recommendation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you are hoping to see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> move over to Nintendo's consoles on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>'s release, well developer Pocketpair would absolutely consider it. That's even despite the studio's legal dispute with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough">IGN</a> at GDC, Pocketpair's communications director John 'Bucky' Buckley revealed the team would have happily seen its monster-catching survival game on the OG Switch as well, but due to how "beefy" Palworld is, it wasn't able to find a home on Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>This may change for Switch 2, though, providing the next generation of Nintendo's consoles has the ability to handle the chonky game.</p>

<p>When asked about Palworld releasing on Switch 2, Bucky said the developer doesn't know the hardware specs yet. "Like everyone else, we're waiting. I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them," Bucky said.</p>
<p>He added that should the specs be "beefy enough" for Palworld, then "it's 100 percent worth considering" a Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>"We did a lot of optimisation for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with," Pocketpair's communications director continued. "Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned! As for when we may hear more about those mysterious Switch 2 specs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo has a dedicated showcase for its upcoming console scheduled for next week</a>.</p>

<p>Ever since Palworld was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a>. In fact, Palworld was dubbed  'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release last year, and soon after its debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a>.</p>
<p>In September, Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a>, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, Pocketpair has released a game on Nintendo Switch. In January of this year, the <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/">developer's real-time roguelike deck builder Overdungeon arrived on the Switch store in Japan</a>, having previously been available via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-thanks-fans-for-heartwarming-response-as-game-launches-to-very-positive-steam-rating">warmly-received by fans of the series</a> - and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">off to a good start sales-wise, too</a> - but players still have a long list of suggestions for what they'd like to see Ubisoft add to the game next.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ji48nm/which_new_featuresimprovements_would_you_like_to/">lengthy thread on the Assassin's Creed reddit</a> has dozens of feature ideas - including a particularly prominent handful of concepts from other <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> that didn't return in Shadows that fans want to see added back.
</p>
<p>
The ability to meditate and move the game's clock forward - changing day to night, or vice versa - is a big request. I can see why this didn't initially make the cut in Shadows, as stealth is such a big deal and I'd always change the clock to night for an easier ride (Naoe specifically has skills which boost her stealth after dark). But also, waiting for the night is no fun.

<p>
Numerous fans have asked for your mount's "follow path" option to return. Present in several recent Assassin's Creed games, this essentially put your horse on autopilot, allowing you to go check your phone for a bit. I actually appreciate that this isn't included in Shadows, with road traversal instead spiced up with random encounters - both friend and foe.
</p>
<p>
Smaller requests include hair and beard customisation (as seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>), fishing (again, as in Valhalla), faster selling/dismantling of gear, the ability to show headgear in cutscenes, an option to remove yellow paint, and the addition of poses for photo mode. 
</p>
<p>
The majority of fan requests are relatively minor - which is a good thing! There are surprisingly (to me) few requests for the return of the arrival drone, which I liked using but doesn't fit with Shadows' more detailed exploration mechanics. </p>
<p>A good number of fans have simply asked for the ability to sit down wherever in the game and watch the world go by.
</p>
<p>
"Let me pinch Junjiro's cheeks on demand," Soapy_Grapes wrote. Sure.
</p>
<p>
Will any of these suggestions make the cut? Ubisoft has already committed to evolving Shadows further over the coming weeks and months. 
</p>
<p>
"Thank you for being part of this journey with us," the Assassin's Creed Shadows development team at Ubisoft Quebec wrote in a message to fans this past weekend. "This is just the beginning for Shadows, and we're thrilled to see the game evolve with you by our side."
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.

			<p>Today, in addition to announcing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-app-update-enable-full-dlss-override-options-custom-super-resolution-scaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new NVIDIA app override features</a> and the debut of an experimental version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-project-g-assist-makes-ai-useful-to-gamers-assists-in-game-tuning-performance-diagnostics-pc-customization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project G-Assist System Assistant</a>, the GeForce maker also shared several updates on new games that support its DLSS technology.</p>
<p>As we reported in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our article</a>, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is available in the Half-Life 2 RTX demo that debuted last week, alongside other NVIDIA technologies: RTX Direct Illumination, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Volumetrics, and RTX Skin.</p>
<p>Last week also saw the debut of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation in the MMOFPS Enlisted, developed by Darkflow Software and published by Gaijin. The game already supported <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaijin-talks-enlisted-rt-cores-nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-huge-step-forward-and-dx12-ultimate-support-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS Super Resolution</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaijin-on-nvidia-rtx-vulkan-enlisted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ray traced global illumination</a>, as we previously discussed in our interviews with the developers. Now, with Multi Frame Generation, owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards can benefit from up to a 4.3x frame rate boost when playing at 4K and max settings with Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>

<p>Netmarble's N2 also launched the Unreal Engine 5-powered MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/rf-online-next-sci-fi-mmo-looks-gorgeous-in-new-g-star-trailers-pc-mobile-launch-set-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RF Online Next</a> in South Korea a few days ago. The game includes day-one support for DLSS Super Resolution.</p>
<p>Today, Swedish developer Fatshark has released a new update called 'Nightmares and Visions' for its game Warhammer 40K Darktide. The cooperative first-person action game already supported Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but it has now been updated (as NVIDIA had <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-driver-confirms-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-and-darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> last week) to the DLSS 4 transformer model with Multi Frame Generation support, improving both quality and performance.</p>
<p>NEXON's The First Berserker Khazan also supports DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, though you'll have to use the NVIDIA app override to get the transformer model. NVIDIA measured the performance uplift to be around 3.5x on average at 4K resolution, max settings, and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode. The game is out now for those who purchased the Deluxe Edition, though the release date is technically on Thursday, March 27. Meanwhile, read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review</a> on why it's an excellent action game.</p>
<p>Thursday will also see the debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/karma-the-dark-world-to-launch-next-month-on-ps5-and-pc-will-support-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARMA: The Dark World</a>, an intriguing indie first-person cinematic psychological thriller. The game has built-in support for DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA Reflex, with DLSS 4 transformer model and Multi Frame Generation that can be enabled through the NVIDIA app.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, FBC: Firebreak is due this Summer with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the whole slate of path tracing features we've previously seen in Alan Wake 2.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pacific-drive%E2%80%99s-next-major-update-adds-the-most-asked-for-feature.1143840/</guid>

<p>Pacific Drive, which was released last year, hit <strong>one million sales </strong>last month. Now, the team at Ironwood Studios is preparing to release the next major update for the game, dubbed Endless Expeditions. In a reveal trailer posted a short while ago, the new features coming with the Endless Expeditions update were revealed, and they’ve been very well received.</p>



<p>Nestled in amongst the changes and tweaks sits the ability to suspend a run, which is a mechanic that <strong>many </strong>of the game’s fans have been asking for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-endless-entertainment">Endless Entertainment</h2>



<p>In the one-minute trailer posted by Ironwood Studios, the Endless Expeditions update was revealed in full.</p>



<p>Coming next month are several overhauls and additions to Pacific Drive, the post-apocalyptic indie title that sees players assume control of a ‘relic’ in the form of an old car. It’s up to them to explore an ever-changing world, solve quests, uncover mysteries, and upgrade their vehicle to no end to better survive the troubled wastes around them.</p>



<p>The trailer (which you can see below) revealed that the following elements are coming with Endless Expeditions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cluster spawning (no idea what that is)</li>



<li>Suspend run (save, exit, and resume)</li>



<li>Improved tools: Thermal Vacuum, Plasma Scrapper</li>



<li>IDA’s Exchange (new discoverable Zone trader)</li>



<li>Over one hour of new radio music</li>



<li>New cosmetic rewards for the garage</li>



<li>Even more lore to discover</li>



<li>And of course, <strong>Endless Expeditions</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Players can embark on journeys that never end with the Endless Expeditions feature. Ironwood Studios has described the new mechanic in the description under the trailer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set off from the garage on new continuous drives – Expeditions. Dangerous and filled with their own unique rewards, these challenging trips will test even the most seasoned breacher.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Ironwood noted that this is the ‘biggest update yet’ in Pacific Drive.</p>



<p>Endless Expeditions will be released in Pacific Drive on April 3rd on all applicable platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[InZOI Is Now The Number One Most Wanted Game on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inzoi-is-now-the-number-one-most-wanted-game-on-steam.1143816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>InZOI will be released in just a few days, and it has blown past all comers to secure the number-one most-wanted spot on Steam. In the last week, it was creeping up the chart, and now it has beaten the likes of Hollow Knight: Silksong, Deadlock, and Elden Ring: Nightreign. In a 7-day window, it has found its way to 50,000 new followers on Valve’s PC platform.</p>



<p>Many people are curious whether inZOI will be the top-tier Sims competitor it’s shaping up to be. It certainly has the visual effects to go the distance, but is there enough meat on the bones to satisfy the average gamer for as long as a Sims game can?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-coming-soon">Coming Soon</h2>



<p>InZOI will be released worldwide on March 28, which is partly why it has jumped up the Steam wishlist chart to <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/?sort=id_asc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">occupy the number-one spot</a>. It has beaten some of the most widely-anticipated games in recent days, including Mecha BREAK, Borderlands 4, and Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>At first blush, inZOI looks nothing short of impressive, giving gamers an entire city to play around with and offering remarkable depth when it comes to things like character creation. On March 28, the game will enter an early access period, where it’ll adopt a semi-premium price tag. </p>



<p>It’s set to arrive exclusively on PC as the early access period plays out, but it’ll eventually land on console platforms in the future – we just don’t know when. It all depends on how long it’s in that early access ‘testing’ period.</p>



<p>Last year, gamers were able to get hands-on with inZOI’s character creation menu, which is intensely detailed and deep, offering ways to customise your character that we’ve never seen before in a game like this. That’s one of inZOI’s unique selling points – it goes beyond the cosmetic and into the obsessive in some ways.</p>



<p>Do you plan to pick up inZOI when it’s released on March 28? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nemesis-system-why-created-monolith-wb-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nemesis system introduced in 2014’s Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor was a phenomenal thing. It gave players a living, breathing force to fight, one that would learn how you played and keep coming back for more, adapting to your tactics and providing a deeper challenge time after time.</p>



<p>It was last seen in 2017’s Shadow of War, and following the closure of Monolith last month, it seems unlikely we’ll see it again for a <strong>very long time</strong>. In a recent video, a former VP of WB Games explained exactly why the Nemesis system was created in the first place, but the real reason reveals a gaping flaw in the plan all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-didn-t-work">That Didn’t Work</h2>



<p>Laura Fryer, formerly a VP at WB Games who oversaw studios including Monolith, recently went on record talking about her time at the company. She oversaw Monolith’s operations since 2008, which means she was around for the inception of the Nemesis system.</p>



<p>The reason it was created is a little convoluted but it all comes down to money.</p>



<p>WB Games identified a financial flaw in the industry in the form of second-hand game sales. Players would buy a game once and then sell it back to a store as a ‘trade-in’, with it then changing hands again and again, most likely. WB Games was concerned with seeing no value on those successive sales and ‘only getting paid for the first copy sold’.</p>



<p>The solution? Make people play for longer and have more fun so they didn’t sell their game at all.</p>



<p>That’s how Fryer put it in her recent video (thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-warner-bros-exec-reveals-the-real-reason-shadow-of-mordors-much-loved-nemesis-system-was-created" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> for the spot).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Shadow (of Mordor), we faced the same problem.</p>



<p>How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever? We knew Monolith’s game engine wasn’t yet capable of having a fully open world like a GTA, and this team wasn’t interested in going the multiplayer route. But we still had to solve for the constraint. </p>



<p>And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5f65WksXqA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fryer stressed</a> that second-hand game sales were ‘a disaster’ for developers who were missing out on the ‘millions of dollars’ generated by that particular market. The Nemesis system made players want to hold on to their game for a little longer because it was so unpredictable and it evolved with the gamer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="My Time with Monolith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5f65WksXqA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Sadly, the Nemesis system didn’t pan out as intended. It was due to appear in the Wonder Woman game that Monolith was working on before being shuttered by WB Games in February 2025. It’s now under lock and key at WB Games for another decade, so unless it’s used in a Batman game or something, it’s unlikely you’ll ever see it again.</p>



<p>Fortunately for WB Games, the industry has changed and drastically fewer people buy second-hand software anymore.</p>
