            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/newegg-nintendo-eshop-gift-card-mentions-new-3d-mario-and-zelda-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Newegg, a reputable online retailer for electronics, gaming peripherals, and even games themselves, has <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed the description</a> of their Nintendo eShop Gift Card. In the description, it now mentions games that haven't been announced yet, such as a "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster." At the moment, this information is still on their website and has caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>It is most likely just speculation on Newegg's side, as there have been hints at a new Mario Kart already, thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 first look trailer, with a lot of the information surrounding it being analyzed by Nintendo fans. There are also titles mentioned, such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-2025-original-switch/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was first announced at E3 in 2017 and has now been confirmed by Nintendo to be released in 2025, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMAgmdR8jwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated trailer</a> released <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">seven months ago</a>. Pokemon Legends: Z-A is also set to release this year. It's uncertain whether these titles will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 or whether they'll also be released on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As we said above, it is most likely that this description from Newegg is just speculation based on Nintendo's release patterns, as well as what the fans are hoping for. Nintendo fans have been wanting specific Zelda remakes for a long time, with a lot of the audience begging for a remake or remaster of Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Many other Zelda games could also be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2, such as A Link to the Past or Phantom Hourglass. However, those seem less likely.</p>
<p>It's pretty much a given that Nintendo will come up with a new Mario game to release for the Nintendo Switch 2, as Mario is Nintendo's mascot, and they always find ways to create new games surrounding Mario and his troupe. Whether that comes in the form of a new Mario Kart game, a Mario Party game, or even a Mario Sports game, there are plenty of options laid on the table for Nintendo.</p>
<p>With such a description hinting at the release of Nintendo's games that haven't even been announced yet, there is a likelihood that they will be contacted and asked to amend the description in the event that they are on the right track. Nintendo is very protective of their IPs, and has no issue in sending a cease and desist to someone or a company, regardless of how small they are.</p>

His family loses it and an inane argument about the iconic film ensues, eventually leading Peter to utter the enigmatic and now memed-to-death line, “It insists upon itself.” Nearly two decades later, the show’s creator, Seth McFarlane, finally explains what it means. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Since this has been trending, here’s a fun fact: ‘It insists upon itself’ was a criticism my college film history professor used to explain why he didn’t think ‘The Sound of Music’ was a great film,” McFarlane <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X this week</a></span>. “First-rate teacher, but I never quite followed that one.” The joke isn’t that Peter is all of a sudden being an erudite critic as the family prepares to drown from his latest idiotic stunt. It’s just a funny-sounding bunch of words that sounds like it should mean something but actually doesn’t. </p><p><em>Family Guy </em>superfans have been trying to decipher a deeper meaning for years, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions perennially sprouting up</a></span> on forums, subreddits, and social media. Sometimes the phrase just starts trending as users riff while passing idle moments gazing at their phones. Even now, people still maintain that Peter was on to something and they know exactly what he meant. </p><p>“This is why I did not like Jackson’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em>,” one person responded. “It slaps you in the face and shouts ‘This is an epic masterpiece! Appreciate it!’ I did not. He learned and toned it down a bit for the sequels.” What? </p><p>“My interpretation of ‘it insists upon itself’ is, when you’re watching it, you get the feeling that one of the intents behind the film was, ‘This is SUPPOSED to be good,’” wrote another. “There are many ways that you can try to be good without trying to be good, namely bucking trends. Insisting upon itself means it hit all the notes a ‘good’ movie “should.’”</p><p>The episode 77 gag ends with Peter revealing he hasn’t even finished <em>The Godfather</em> and prefers 1986's <em>The Money Pit </em>starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long instead. The punchline is that movie sucks, too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/president-of-spider-man-ratchet-and-clank-dev-insomniac-announces-retirement-from-playstation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ted Price, the founder and president of Marvel's Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, and Resistance developer Insomniac Games, has announced his retirement from PlayStation after 30 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price made the announcement on Sony's <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, while a follow-up <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> post delved into his replacements. Ryan Schneider, Jen Huang, and Chad Dezern will take over as co-studio heads of Insomniac.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-wolverine-insomniac-mature-full-size">which is currently working on Marvel's Wolverine</a>, is currently "in one of the strongest positions" it's been in for years, Price said. "Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price said he made the decision last year because he felt "it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way" after more than 30 years leading Insomniac.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We’re going to keep making the games you love, while taking care of the people who make them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schneider began at Insomniac during the PlayStation 2 era and later became the studio's first community director. He then joined the senior leadership team and served as head of franchise strategy and studio relations, and then head of brand and leadership strategy, before moving to co-studio head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Huang joined Insomniac as chief financial officer and head of finance eight years ago and has so far shipped 12 games with Insomniac. Finally, Dezern has been part of Insomniac since 1998 and has worked as an environment artist, art director, Durham studio director, and most recently as head of creative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re going to keep making the games you love, while taking care of the people who make them," the three said in a joint statement. "This aligns with our studio vision of making a positive and lasting impact on people’s lives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ted has also laid the foundation for Insomniac as one of the industry’s all-time most successful studio leaders. Now, it’s up to us to help Insomniac thrive long into the future. Thanks to Ted’s guidance and leadership, we are ready."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/gettyimages-644833678-1737564572665.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ted Price has retired from PlayStation after 30 years. Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Price alluded to this too. "There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights," he said. "Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He concluded: "I want to thank every Insomniac for having a positive and lasting impact on my life. Working side by side with Insomniacs for so many years has been a gift that I’ll cherish for the rest of my days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I also want to thank our fans who, for three decades, have shared their enthusiasm, their encouragement and their support — inspiring us to take every game farther than the last. We do what we do for you. And I can assure you that we won’t be slowing down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac certainly appears to be plenty busy, though so far has only announced Wolverine. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">The studio was the victim of a data breach in 2023</a>, however, which revealed a long list of upcoming projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">In our 8/10 review of its latest release</a>, IGN said: "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, is a reliably fun superhero power trip."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

There aren't any customizations to be had, but one feature it does include that seems likely to return when Blizzard introduces player housing proper is a way for players to set their Hearthstone to their new home.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time WoW players have received more personal living space. During the Warlords of Draenor expansion players had an entire Garrison to call their own, while Class Order Halls offered class-specific spaces for players of the same class to hang out in. This is, however, the first instance of players being able to acquire an apartment to call home.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a couple potential clues to how WoW might implement player housing to be gleaned here. For starters, the apartment simply exists in the game world, and players when visiting are treated to their own private "instance" of it. That seems to imply player housing won't be an entirely separate zone or a specific neighborhood where players can build custom houses, but rather the homes up for grabs will be added to existing locations in the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431922" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431922"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW's first player-owned apartment (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given how players are granted this apartment as a quest, it also seems likely that players will be given some form of player housing for free come Midnight, though there is certainly still room to have players be able to purchase other, more desirable properties. Players will ultimately have to wait for more information directly from Blizzard about what player housing will look like.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas in an interview with GameSpot last year said Blizzard was announcing player housing far in advance of Midnight's release in order to "begin a conversation" and "double-check" that Blizzard's plans for player housing matched the expectations of players. Announcing the feature so far ahead of the expansion itself also gives the team time to pivot if changes need to be made, he said. More information about player housing and Midnight it slated to come this summer, according to WoW's 2025 roadmap.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when players can unlock their apartment, the goblin-filled Undermine(d) update doesn't have a release date just yet, but is expected to release in the next month or two.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> creator Don't Nod is delaying the second half of its upcoming narrative adventure Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage by a month, with Tape 2 now set to release on 15th April.
</p>
<p>
Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage marks the first time since 2020's Twin Mirror that Don't Nod has revisited the narrative adventure genre that put it on the map, and it follows the story of four high-school friends across two timelines. One half recounts the group's hazily nostalgic "magical summer" of 1995, while the second timeline picks up 27 years later, when the friends reunite to "confront the long-buried secret that made them promise to never speak again."
</p>
<p>
It's a tale that'll also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">split across two releases</a>, with Tape 1 ("Bloom") launching for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 18th February. Part 2 ("Rage") was previously scheduled to launch a month later on 18th March, but Don't Nod has now announced it's pushing Tape 2's release back an additional four weeks, to 15th April.

<p>
In a statement detailing the delay, the studio said it had made the decision in order to "allow for additional optimisation and to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience for players and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey."
</p><p>
Both parts of Lost Records were originally due to launch last year, but Don't Nod announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-life-is-strange-team-delays-new-game-to-avoid-new-lis-launch-date">shifting their release into 2025</a>, ostensibly to avoid <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built," Don't Nod boss Oskar Guilbert said at the time.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, both halves of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - which Don't Nod says should provide a total of around 10-12 hours playtime - will be available through a single purchase. The game's usual price is £35.89/39,99€/$39.99 USD, but the studio has also now confirmed a limited-time launch discount of 10 percent.

			<p>It's been announced today by Virtuos, a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading video game developer</a>, that they have strategically acquired three studios across the globe. Virtuos has helped co-develop games like Crash: Mind over Mutant, The Outer Worlds, Dead Island 2, and Hogwarts Legacy, for example. They have now announced that they have acquired Pipeworks (USA), Abstraction (Netherlands), and Umanaia (Canada). They have all worked on some very significant games, which will be detailed down below so you can get an idea of the kind of developers they are.</p>
<p>In the acquisition, they will each have their own role to play in the bigger picture, with Virtuos wanting to become a globalized powerhouse for "sustainable, flexible game development solutions." By acquiring these studios, it now allows Virtuos to offer a broader range of services across game development and live operations across the globe, with studios in Europe, Asia and North America. Thus far, Virtuos' has a network of studios across 26 locations worldwide, with their specializations being at the forefront of the big picture.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.pipeworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pipeworks</a> will now be Virtuos' lead game development studio in North America, as they have a 25-year strong legacy, with experience working on titles such as Terraria and Call of Duty. The team is extensive, with nearly 200 employees working at the company to help co-develop titles for console, PC, and mobile. They currently have multiple AAA titles in development with studios such as Xbox Game Studios, PlayStation Studios, and Warner Bros. Games.</p>
<p><a href="https://abstraction.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstraction</a> has a significant co-development expertise, as their portfolio consists of major titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Dune: Awakening, with the company elevating Virtuo Labs' engineering capabilities. Their team consists of over 90 industry veterans, with their mission being focused on founding new technology and game prototypes to benefit and enhance the game development process.</p>
<p>Finally, there is <a href="https://www.umanaia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umanaia</a>, who has a focus on original IPs and uses its experience in creating major titles such as Assassin's Creed and For Honor, and will be helping to bolster the ongoing process of creating Virtuos Originals. Their team is the newest, as it was founded in 2021. For the most part, they will be utilizing their expertise in Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) as well as their successful post-launch strategies. Alongside this, they will be refreshing beloved IPs and creating new experiences with the gamer in mind. Umanaia is also the smallest team, with over 40 senior developers, and will be working hard in the Virtuos Originals initiative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you are looking to get a brand new Nvidia RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 at launch, it may be tougher than you expected. According to multiple rumors circulating, the release of the next-generation of graphics cards from Nvidia is gearing up to be the “worst when it comes to availability” in the company’s history.</p>



<p>One board partner, Zotac, confirmed supply issues in an <a href="https://tagtag.co.kr/article/notice/1/18681/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message online</a>. The AIC says that their card won’t be available on January 30 as expected, instead it will be coming in early February. Still, Zotac says that “due to external factors” there’s the chance the card may not come until mid-February.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://benchlife.info/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-launch-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, they state that “communication issues” between Nvidia and its various AIC partners have resulted into limited supply for consumers.</p>



<p>Said gaming PC builder <a href="https://x.com/PowerGPU/status/1881758554836877675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerGPU</a>, “Warning you all now. The launch of the RTX 5090 will be the worst when it comes to availability. Already being told to expect it to be that way for the first 3 months.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on these claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-announces-geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were revealed during CES</a> in early January. In addition to the two high-end graphics cards, Nvidia is set to release the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 sometime in February. An exact date, however, has yet to be announced by the company.</p>



<p>What do you think of the claims that launch availability for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 will be the worst in the company’s history? &nbsp;Let us know in down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games-armchair-generals-shouldn%E2%80%99t-miss.1089006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/5-highly-recommended-strategy-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the ongoing Steam festival focusing on real-time strategy games, now’s the perfect opportunity to score a few titles you could potentially spend hundreds of hours playing. There’s a fair number of discounted RTS games I have personally spent up to 1,000 hours playing, and some are just too good of deals to pass up. Here’s a look at five highly recommended games on Steam’s Real-Time Strategy Fest!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-worth-buying-on-steam-s-rts-fest">Best Games Worth Buying on Steam’s RTS Fest</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of the strategy genre, you’re in luck because there are countless releases annually, many of which shine. Despite the new releases and innovative indie studios taking a chance at refreshing the genre, a few old standbys tend to keep most players’ attention. With the current Steam Fest, now’s a good time to jump in for yourself!</p>



<h3 id="h-hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron IV</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you ever watched a documentary or read a history book about WW2 and thought, “I could do it differently?” If so, then <strong>Hearts of Iron IV</strong> is your game, as it allows you to take economic, political, and military command of an entire nation, prepare for the upcoming war by building weapons and cementing alliances, and then fight in a global conflict. It’s challenging, rewarding, and expansive!</p>



<h3 id="h-stellaris">Stellaris</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like Hearts of Iron IV, but in space, with more operatic moments and interesting setpieces. I mean, look at the screenshot above as a science vessel scans a planet with a red sun in the background. <strong>Stellaris </strong>is beautiful and one of the most straightforward Paradox titles for new players. It allows you to tell a grand story of a space-faring empire, which speaks to many!</p>



<h3 id="h-warno">Warno</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If taking command of an entire nation or galactic empire isn’t quite your speed, <strong>Warno</strong> offers a more grounded approach to real-time strategy by placing you in charge of a fighting force full of tanks, armored vehicles, infantry, helicopters, and even fighter jets. You’ll conquer territory on the map, fighting small-unit skirmishes and endure large-scale bombardments alike, for a bombastic and entertaining RTS experience!</p>







<h3 id="h-they-are-billions">They Are Billions</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>They Are Billions</strong> proves to be a highly challenging yet rewarding strategy game that took me by surprise. I didn’t think I’d spend hundreds of hours trying to survive the zombie apocalypse in a city-building survival and real-time strategy game, but this one kept me playing. You are the last bastion of humanity, surviving seemingly endless waves of the undead as they attempt to wipe humanity from the planet.</p>



<h3 id="h-total-war-rome-2">Total War: Rome 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>While there are certainly newer entries in the long-running Total War franchise, I will always retain a soft spot for <strong>Rome 2</strong> as one of my favorite historical strategy games in the series. It’s expansive, grand, and memorable, allowing players to restore the glory of Rome by conquering the Gauls to the north or moving into Greece to the east. The world is your oyster, so long as you have the coin and men to take it yourself!</p>



<p>Do you have a favorite strategy game everyone should check out? Let us know in the comments below, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the Insider Gaming forums</a> to talk strategy!</p>

<p>Prepare yourself, strategy gaming fans! <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7 has gone gold ahead of release</a>, and it’s almost upon us!</p>

        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Design and Build a Towering Ocean City</strong> – The world is dying, overtaken by the endless ocean. You are the leader of a small group of survivors stranded on a rusty boat. You find a small land area, solid enough to serve as a building foundation. And now, step by step, you build a city. This city will go up to the sky, weather many storms, and become a home for the last remnants of humanity. For your people.</li><li><strong>Master Physics-Based 3D Construction System</strong> – The game’s physics-based building mechanic challenges you to consider real-world construction aspects when building your intricate multi-level city in all three dimensions. While easy to grasp, this unique system introduces deeper simulation aspects and more creative freedom to the city-building sandbox, allowing you to bring numerous vertical city design ideas to life.</li><li><strong>Every Building Can Collapse</strong> – While building, you’re essentially playing Jenga with human lives at stake. Each structure can crumble, so you must provide enough support and find creative ways of using different building materials. There is a high-risk, high-reward aspect to it, though. For example, you can find various ways to reach much-needed resource nodes by building elaborate bridges or ladders. Or—save some space for more production by stacking the housing quarters on top of each other. If you fail, the state of the building can be reverted to before the collapse, so you can fix the mistakes and avoid tragic consequences – at least on lower difficulties!</li><li><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge a Bustling Colony of Survivors</strong> – Besides building and maintaining the city, you will also manage a colony of survivors. As their leader, navigate the wants and needs of several factions—Engineers, Sailors, and Workers—each with its own unique traits. For example, only Engineers can operate cranes, while Sailors have access to boat navigation, making resource gathering and logistics easier.</li><li><strong>Make Difficult Yet Necessary Decisions</strong> – Sometimes, you will have to make difficult yet necessary decisions to lead your people to prosperity. Try to feed every mouth generously, or be strict with food rationing. Establish martial law during the unrest, or show mercy and let people voice their frustrations. Go down in history as a benevolent shepherd or strong-hand tyrant—as long as the city prevails.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> New Challenges Every Time</strong> – Each colony you build will deal with unique challenges, foundation layouts, circumstances and random events—like storms, mysterious structures emerging from the ocean, political coups, unexpected newcomers, food shortages, and more. Learn from your mistakes, unlock new locations on the global map, and embark on the next dangerous <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,004 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> once the inevitable calamity comes to destroy the city.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

So, like I said, I feel like they really did a great job of balancing, and could they keep adding more and more characters? For sure, there’s definitely enough characters to go around.

<p>Some new footage of DOOM: The Dark Ages has leaked online ahead of the Xbox Developer Direct on January 23.</p>



<p>The footage was uploaded by YouTube Gougaru, who seemingly has recorded some footage of DOOM: The Dark Ages at a behind-the-scenes presentation. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MORE NEW DOOM:THE DARK AGES FOOTAGE HAS BEEN LEAKED!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NogvFk4gmI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><br>The gameplay footage gives a brief walkthrough of some of the locations in the game. Still, while the footage leaked before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox developer direct</a>, it’s understood that the gameplay originates from a tech demo of some kind, likely showcasing the latest series of graphics cards.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who have seen a preview of DOOM at the Xbox Developer Direct, the in-depth look will show more gameplay instead of map overviews.</p>



<p>Yesterday, DOOM: The Dark Ages <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked to be released on May 15, 2025</a> for the Xbox Series S|X, PC, and PlayStation 5. DOOM: The Dark Ages marks the game as one of Microsoft’s first “exclusives” to release day and date on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for what else to expect during the Xbox Developer Direct, Xbox has announced that South of Midnight and Expedition 33 will also be having in-depth showcases, while a fourth “unknown” game will also be revealed.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>The game is narratively set as a prequel to the 2016 DOOM title, which sold 2 million copies by July 2017 (before Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda, where the game released multiplatform). </p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Season 7, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, has arrived, bringing Diablo 3 Witch Doctor powers to the dungeon crawler. The new seasonal content features Headrotten enemies, which you will need to work with The Coven to defeat, increasing your standing with the faction. This means you'll need to partake in the revamped Tree of Whispers activities tied to the seasonal content. Completing these objectives will grant you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/diablo-4-battle-pass-season-7-rewards-all-cosmetics-titles-and-emotes/2900-6147/">battle pass</a> XP and loot for each chapter completed. The final chapter includes Dorian, a pet raven.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Your progress on objectives in chapters you haven't reached does track, but your progress in each chapter won't be reflected until that chapter has been reached.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4431857" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4431857"></a><figcaption>Each chapter has two more objectives than are required to complete the chapter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">A Witch's Debt: Increase standing with The Coven to Rank 1 by completing Whispers.</li><li dir="ltr">Trinket's from the Nest: Obtain 1 Cache from the Raven during a Headhunt by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Veteran of Ashes: Acquire 666 Aberrant Cinders during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Spoils of Hell: Open 1 Tortured Gifts during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Trouble in the Wilds: Complete 5 World Events</li><li dir="ltr">Forager: Collect 100 Bundled Herbs from Harvest Nodes, Cellars, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Tanner's Apprentice: Collect 50 Rawhide from salvaging Armor, defeating Monsters, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Prospector: Collect 100 Iron Chunks from various sources</li><li dir="ltr">Deafening Whispers: Complete 10 Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Just a Sip: Upgrade your Potion to Tiny at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">In the Back Pocket: Discover the Armory to save and access builds</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These challenges are all fairly simple and should be completed without much effort, especially if you are skipping the campaigns with your new season character. The Armory might be one you need to go out of your way since it's a new feature, but shouldn't take much effort to complete. <strong>The Coven ranks appear throughout the Season Journey chapters and can be leveled by completing Tree of Whisper tasks, do not ignore these if you want to complete the Season Journey.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor (battle pass XP)</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Cache: Contains Consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Crafting Cache: Contains Crafting Materials, such as Herbs and Gem Fragments</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">In Service to the Tree: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 3</li><li dir="ltr">Taste of Power: Collect 5 Witch Powers from any Altar of Witchcraft found near the Tree of Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Twilight Dream: Acquire 1 Nightmare Dungeon Sigil</li><li dir="ltr">Pilgrimage of Nightmares: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Test of Mettle: Defeat 5 elite monsters</li><li dir="ltr">Prelude of Doom: Defeat 5 Harbingers during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Notarized Nuisance: Increase your Threat Level to Max by defeating monsters during the Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Risk and Reward: Buy 3 pieces of equipment from the Purveyor of Curiosities</li><li dir="ltr">A Master at Work: Complete 1 World Event with Mastery</li><li dir="ltr">Ruins Reclaimed: Clear 1 Stronghold</li><li dir="ltr">Capable Craftsmen: Learn 1 recipe of Rare or higher rarity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Another set of relatively easy goals here. The most likely ones to ignore are the Strongholds, just because you don't have to do those unless you really care about potential world activities there. The rest of these are fairly simple, if luck based, like the recipe of rare rarity, or are tied together, like multiple Helltide activities and Nightmare Dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, wish as Herbs and Veiled Crystals</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Sacrificial Blade: INcrease your standing with The Coven to Rank 5</li><li dir="ltr">Rot Cleanser: Complete 5 Rootholds</li><li dir="ltr">Cave out the Necrosis: Defeat 5 Thrall of Rot, which can be found during Headhunts or in Rootholds</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Ancients: Unlock 10 aspects in the Code or Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Miracles of Alchemy: Craft 5 Elixirs at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Confront the Creature: Defeat the Blood Maiden summoned during Helltide with Baneful Hearts</li><li dir="ltr">Champion of the Lost: Clear 3 Strongholds</li><li dir="ltr">Basic Needs: Temper 5 Affixes onto gear at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Forsaken Offerings: Obtain 5 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Hard Fought Victory: Complete 1 Legion Event</li><li dir="ltr">Band of Killers: Defeat a World Boss while in a party</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 is where the tasks start to get a bit more involved, but the majority here are all tied to the seasonal content of The Coven and the related activities. The Blood Maiden is easier to defeat during a Helltide than you might expect, just because there are almost always other players grinding out kills as it's a good source of loot. An easy one to skip here is Band of Killers, as it requires you to have friends online at the same time as a World Boss is active, although you can try inviting nearby players while waiting for it to spawn.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge the Blood Maiden during Helltides</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">In the Eyes of The Coven: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 8</li><li dir="ltr">Power Primordial: Upgrade 5 Witchcraft powers to Rank 10 through the Seasonal Powers Panel</li><li dir="ltr">Damnation's Downfall: Defeat 1 Helltide Commander during Helltides, summoned after completing Helltide Events</li><li dir="ltr">Third Eye Open: Consume 5 Draught of Whispers to increase the likelihood of encountering Forgotten Altars and Fugitive Heads</li><li dir="ltr">Penitential Path: Defeat 666 Monsters in Penitent or Higher</li><li dir="ltr">Endless Nightmares: Complete 10 Nightmare Dungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Tree: Obtain 10 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Form and Function: Upgrade 5 gear by adding Sockets at the Jewler</li><li dir="ltr">Forged in Blood: Craft 5 Blacksmith Cache at the Blacksmith after reaching Level 60</li><li dir="ltr">Ceremonial Smoke: Craft 1 Incense at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Strength in Numbers: Complete 1 Legion Event while in a party</li><li dir="ltr">Born in Torment: Defeat 10 Hellborne spawned by reaching Max Threat Level during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This set of objectives should take you up through level 60. If you haven't swapped over to Penitent difficulty at this point, you should, as the added bonus loot and XP is a big bonus and your equipment is likely powerful enough. You need to prepare for Torment 1, which is required for one task here. You could ignore it, but you will need to move to Torment 1 for the next chapter anyway. The Legion Event in a party is also skippable, but these occur more often than World Bosses, so it isn't entirely difficult.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Wound and Woe Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li><li dir="ltr">Otherworldly Player Title</li><li dir="ltr">Raven Player Title</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Slayer__Chapter_5_">Slayer (Chapter 5)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 12 of 14 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Slayer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Rite Keeper: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 15</li><li dir="ltr">A Tortured Gamble: Open 1 Tortured Gift of Mystery during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Shards of the Fiends: Collect 5 Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">The Hordes Falter: Defeat the Fell Council 1 time in the Infernal Hordes on Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Finder of Secrets: Find 1 Forgotten Altar</li><li dir="ltr">Headhunter: Collect 8 Fugitive Heads during Headhunts</li><li dir="ltr">Cultivate Fear: Collect 100 Obducite from such sources as Nightmare Dungeons or Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Lucid Nightmare: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">No Mere Mortal: Unlock a Legendary Paragon node after reaching level 60 using Paragon points</li><li dir="ltr">Precious Shards: Salvage 100 Ancestral Legendary items</li><li dir="ltr">Transfer of Power: Imprint 8 Aspects onto Gear at the Occultist</li><li dir="ltr">Preamble: Complete Artificer's Tier 20 or higher in the Pit of the Artificer located in Cerrigar</li><li dir="ltr">Guilt: Defeat Tormented Echo of Varshan 1 time</li><li dir="ltr">Shock and Awe: Defeat Tormented Echo of Grigoire</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This chapter basically requires you to be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-difficulty-options-explained-for-season-6-and-vessel-of-hatred/1100-6527180/">Torment 1</a> and max level. There is a large variety of activities here, but most only require you to run them a few times. The Obducite can be obtained from only a couple of Nightmare Dungeon runs and you need to do five anyway. The only ones you may want to hold off on are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-how-to-summon-endgame-bosses/1100-6518613/">two bosses Varshan and Grigoire</a>, just because you may need to do the other activities to get your gear good enough to win those fights, but you will eventually want to do them for the loot regardless.</p><p dir="ltr">Slayer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Champion__Chapter_6_">Champion (Chapter 6)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 11 of 13 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Champion objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Unholy Coffers: Open 1 Greater Spoils of Hell chest after defeating the Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Warden of the Swamp: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 20</li><li dir="ltr">Warbringer's Wealth: Craft 10 Occult Gems learned from Grimoires</li><li dir="ltr">Drink Deep from the Chalice: Upgrade 10 Witchcraft powers to Rank 20 through the Seasonal Powers Panel</li><li dir="ltr">Glyph Expert: Improve 5 Paragon Glyphs to Rank 15 by completing The Pit</li><li dir="ltr">Echoes of the Ancients: Unlock 50 Aspects in the Codex of Power</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Challenge: Defeat 666 Monsters on Torment 2 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Forgiveness: Defeat Tormented Echo of Lord Zir</li><li dir="ltr">Harbinger of Ice: Defeat Tormented Echo of The Beast in the Ice</li><li dir="ltr">Horadric Smith: Masterwork 5 pieces of gear to Rank 5 at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Preeminence: Reach Paragon Level 100</li><li dir="ltr">Thorn in Hell: Defeat 666 monsters while at Max Threat Level during Helltide on Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Coordinated Kill: While in a Party, defeat 25 Lair Bosses</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Depending on if you play Diablo 4 with friends or solo, the 25 Lair Bosses in a party is an easy skip. That does mean you will need to take on the two bosses listed here, but you should be in pretty good shape in terms of gear at this point, and you can leave them for last if you haven't. The most time-consuming task here is likely the 5 Paragon Glyphs at Rank 15, just because it will require quite a few runs of The Pit, even at high tiers, but that will help you get enough XP to reach Paragon level 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Champion rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Cache: Contains Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destroyer__Chapter_7_">Destroyer (Chapter 7)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 out of 10 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Silencer: Complete 5 Whispers within 15 minutes during Headhunts in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Roots Ablaze: Open 15 Exposed Roots within 15 minutes during Headhunts in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Root Pulverizer: Activate 2 Legendary Ceremony Shrines within a single Roothold in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Waking Horrors: Defeat 50 Elite Monsters while in Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 4 without dying</li><li dir="ltr">Triumph of the Tormented: Defeat 666 Monsters in Torment 4 without dying</li><li dir="ltr">Bloodstained Hoard: Collect 750 Aether in a single run of the Infernal Hordes in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">With Sand to Spare: Complete Artificer's tier 75 or higher in The Pit, with more than five minutes remaining</li><li dir="ltr">Assassin's List: Defeat 5 Lair Bosses within 5 minutes in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Hell's Fury: Defeat 250 monsters before the Hellborne's arrival after increasing your Threat Level to Max in Torment 4</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This list is pretty tough across the board, fitting for the final chapter. As for which ones to ignore and which ones to do, there are too many tough ones here to really make that call. Most of these require Torment 4, and you not only need to complete tasks, but do so quickly and without dying. This will require your build to be near complete, Paragon boards finished, and a strong understanding of your ability rotations.</p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Dorian pet Raven</li><li dir="ltr">The Raven Familiar Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Cache: Contains a Resplendent Spark and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge Bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual.</li></ul>

                <p>Obsidian Entertainment has started a new series of animated YouTube videos to give Avowed players a refresher on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pillars-of-eternity/" data-ref-id="5000-156288">Pillars of Eternity</a> franchise lore. After watching Lore of Eora - Species, you will be familiar with every kind of Kith you'll encounter during your time with Avowed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedO6SJURK0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jedO6SJURK0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That’s because the first entry of this five-part series provides an overview of the human, aumauan, orlan, dwarven, and elven species that populate Avowed’s world. Lore of Eora - Species begins by explaining that Kith is the term used to refer to Eora’s people. While humans, dwarves, and elves are species of Kith fantasy fans should be familiar with, the aumaua and orlan species are unique to Eora.</p><p>The aumaua are the sea-faring species of Kith with “unparalleled strength and imposing size” and blue or green skin. Meanwhile, orlans are small, furry people with large ears and incredible mental prowess. No matter what species of Kith someone is, there is a chance they can be born as a godlike. Godlikes have “unusual physical characteristics and mystical powers” based on one of Eora’s gods, with the one featured in this video sporting antlers on her head. The player-created character in Avowed is a godlike, considered a rare sight in Living Lands of Eora where Avowed takes place.</p><p>This series of Lore of Eora videos is helpful because Avowed takes place in the same universe as the isometric RPG series Pillars of Eternity. While playing Pillars of Eternity and Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is not required to understand or enjoy Avowed, Lore of Eora helps color in the details of this universe established in previous games. Obsidian Entertainment lays out video series' goal in the description of this first video: It wants to make the franchise’s dense lore “accessible for all.”</p><p>Avowed launches for PC and Xbox Series X|S on February 18 and will be part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog from day one. You can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-steelbook-premium-edition-is-up-for-preorder-comes-with-five-day-early-access/1100-6527801/" data-ref-id="1100-6527801">Avowed preorder guide</a> to learn more about its various editions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-set-to-launch-on-steam-despite-playstation-pulling-it-from-store<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Grand Taking Ages, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> "parody" that uses AI artwork and voice acting, has done enough to convince Valve it should launch on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
That's despite Sony recently stepping in to remove a PS5 version of the project set to launch on the PlayStation Store.
</p>
<p>
Originally titled Grand Taking Ages 6, the now re-named game has a July 2025 release date on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/">Steam</a>, and there's fresh detail on what the game actually is. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam">IGN</a>, developer Violarte said Grand Taking Ages would be a management simulator, where players attempt to run a game developer. (Presumably you are not rewarded for getting booted off the store of a major console manufacturer.)
</p>
<p>
Adjustments have been made in order to convince Steam owner Valve that Grand Taking Ages is actually a legitimate project, with changes to the game's logo and presentation "to clearly differentiate the game" from Rockstar's own GTA 6.

According to Violarte, its project was taken down by Sony despite the defence that it was clearly a parody. Indeed, the developer suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">the recent Grand Theft Hamlet project</a> - a film in which a production of Shakespeare's classic play is performed within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> - proved just this.
</p><p>
"We genuinely believe that, with the recent updates, Grand Taking Ages is now ready to be relisted on the PlayStation Store," Violarte concluded, saying it had requested Sony now reinstate the game's store page. "We strongly believe that there will be no issues with Sony this time, given the adjustments we've implemented."

Eurogamer has contacted Sony for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unlike what has been rumored for a while, Jill Valentine won't play a major role in Resident Evil 9, according to a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, Dusk Golem commented on the rumors that have been circulating online on the yet-to-be-announced new entry in the survival-horror series, saying that Jill will not play a major role in the game, and the current hospital rumor that's circulating online is completely false, as are <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vast majority of rumors</a> circulating on the game. The information provided by the leaker is also fresh, as they have been updated on things more recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wait for actual RE9 news, nearly every RE9 rumor that's been floated around has been bullshit.</p>
<p>What's not bullshit is Silent Hill f did get rated in Korea today, and that's exciting.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1882066902023086459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides working on Resident Evil 9, CAPCOM is also continuing work on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil Zero Remake</a>, which, much like the ninth main entry in the series, has also yet to be officially confirmed. The development of this remake saw a big change in the people involved, but development is still proceeding, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-new-resident-evil-9-details-surface.1027635/post-134699286">according to the insider, </a>so there's plenty for fans of the series to look forward to.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Resident Evil series is the Resident Evil 4 remake, which was launched in 2023. The remake is extremely faithful to the original, if not a little too much, as Nathan highlighted in his review. The game is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 4 was the ultimate test of CAPCOM remake skills, and unfortunately, they buckled a bit under the pressure. The game suffers from minor mechanical issues and doesn’t reinvent or elevate the original material as boldly as some might have hoped it would. That said, CAPCOM hasn’t broken anything either as this is still a fun, inventive thrill ride that has been brought up to modern technical standards in striking fashion. The new Resident Evil 4 is well worth it for fans of the series, just keep your hopes slightly in check and you won’t be spin-kicked by inflated expectations.</em></p>

			<p>The multiplayer games lists are always different since they necessarily intermingle with other genres. Looking at what's coming from the releases scheduled for the calendar year 2025, we have a mix of action, RPG, Soulslike, shooter, and more. Here's the five titles that stand out the most before their respective releases.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Monster-Hunter-Wilds.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Most of the early multiplayer games action this year will likely kick off with CAPCOM's Monster Hunter Wilds. Like Borderlands 4, it's a game that you can absolutely complete solo, but it's just that much more fun when played with friends. Like in the massively successful Monster Hunter World, players may launch a flare to ask for help from other players in the middle of a monster hunt. The much larger zones and dynamically shifting weather should make multiplayer sessions even more exciting in the new title. Lobbies will also get a significant increase in the maximum player count, supporting <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lobbies-100-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 100 players at once</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dune-awakening-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Dune Awakening (Q1 2025 PC, Consoles Later)</h2>
<p>Long before the two Dune movies were released in theaters, Funcom secured the license to develop games based on the franchise. They have since published the real-time strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-spice-wars-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Spice Wars</a> (developed by Shiro Games), but the project they've really focused on is Dune Awakening. The studio is trying to funnel all its prior expertise in the MMORPG (Anarchy Online, Age of Conan, The Secret World) and survival (Conan Exiles) genres into a hybrid game that brings out the best of both in the context of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Yes, players will have to survive the hazards of the desert planet, but there's also plenty of social play, where clans can be created and then affiliated with one of the major houses (Atreides or Harkonnen, to begin with). The key to everything will, of course, be the spice. Harvesting it will bring great rewards, as it can be traded or even consumed to gain powers (at the risk of addiction), but players will have to contend with other clans to secure the harvest - all the while trying not to rouse the dreaded sandworm. Dune Awakening is undoubtedly one of the most promising multiplayer games on this list, and it's also the closest to release. Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to launch it in the first quarter on PC</a>, with console versions to follow. For more info, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom Q&amp;A with the developers</a>, and stay tuned for further coverage in the coming weeks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BL4-The-Game-Awards.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Borderlands 4 (TBA 2025 PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Let's face it - Borderlands fans may have fun with the single player, but the reason the franchise became popular in the first place was the chaotic cooperative multiplayer action. After all, any loot-based game gets instantly more addictive when you're playing with friends with whom to boast about the latest legendary drop you got after a crazy boss fight.</p>
<p>Gearbox hasn't shared specific multiplayer info for this new installment, but the confirmed presence of new tools like the grappling hook and the seamless zones will certainly bolster the cooperative portion of the game even further.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring Nightreign (TBA 2025 PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>FromSoftware caught everyone by surprise with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of Elden Ring Nightreign</a> at The Game Awards 2024. Most people were betting on an immediate sequel to the massively successful Elden Ring, but the Japanese studio is first working on this intriguing spin-off. Based on what they've shared, it seems like they will be mixing elements from various genres, including survival and even Battle Royale (the shrinking map, specifically), to create an entirely new multiplayer experience. Players will have to survive for three in-game days before facing a final boss to end the session.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PromoNewN1.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>PIONER (TBA 2025 on PC, Consoles Later)</h2>
<p>The upcoming MMOFPS by GFA Games was already featured in last year's most anticipated multiplayer games list. Now, though, it seems we are closer than ever to the release of PIONER, following the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise</a> to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a> at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>The premise of a STALKER-like online shared world where players can cooperate to create clans, fight in PvE raids, and even compete in PvP areas, remains incredibly enticing. We'll have to evaluate the quality of the execution, of course. Hopefully, it won't be long until we get to play it.</p>

<p>Ted Price, founder and president of Insomniac Games, is retiring from the company he started in 1994. The news comes via an <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on Sony’s website.</p>



<p>Price is set to leave his position in March after 31 years.</p>



<p>“I actually made this decision last year,” he said. “For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades.”</p>



<p>With Price leaving the company, Insomniac Games will be lead by three new Co-Studio heads: Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang.</p>



<p>“I believe strongly that for us to continue our success, we need leaders at the top who are intimately familiar with how we do things, leaders who have helped build our culture and our processes, and who have earned people’s trust,” Price said.</p>



<p>“There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.”</p>



<p>In a statement on the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, Dezern, Schneider, and Huang expressed gratitude for the opportunity to head the studio moving forward.</p>



<p>“Our shared intention is to preserve what has made Insomniac special for 30-plus years while exploring how we can strategically evolve to succeed for decades to come,” they said. “We’ll continue prioritizing our studio culture, built around transparency and collaboration. We strive for a workplace where employees can do the best work of their careers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>First started in 1994 as Xtreme Software, Insomniac Games is known for franchises such as Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and, more recently, the Marvel Spider-Man games. The studio is currently working on a number of projects, including Marvel’s Wolverine. Insomniac was acquired by Sony in 2019.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has been nominated at this year's GLAAD award for trans representation in last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario-2-thousand-year-door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> remake on Switch.</p>
<p>GLAAD is a non-profit organisation focused on LGBT+ advocacy. It runs annual awards to celebrate LGBT+ representation in media, with video games included since 2019.</p>
<p>This year's nominees include Nintendo for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> ghost companion Vivian, whose trans identity was restored in the remake.</p>

<p>In the Japanese GameCube original release, Vivian is trans but is deliberately misgendered by her sisters. However, some territories removed this in their translations, including the English and German versions.</p>
<p>For the remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paper-mario-remake-confirms-companion-is-trans-after-references-removed-from-original-translation">Nintendo restored the original dialogue</a> - and therefore Vivian's trans identity. The change was widely celebrated by the LGBT+ community.</p>
<p>Other nominees include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which features LGBT+ relationships and a non-binary companion character, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which features a bisexual protagonist.</p>

<p>It's notable that the majority of these games are from indie developers, as major studios lag behind in terms of LGBT+ representation.</p>
<p>As per a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nearly-1-in-5-gamers-are-lgbt-says-new-glaad-study">GLAAD study last year</a>, nearly one in five gamers are members of the LGBT+ community, yet LGBT+ storylines and characters account for less than two percent of all games.</p>
<p>The report focused on the importance of diverse representation: 72 percent of LGBT+ players said seeing characters matching their gender identity or sexual orientation well-represented made them feel better about themselves, while 68 percent wished there were more prominent LGBT+ storylines.</p>
<p>Last year's winner for Outstanding Video Game at the GLAAD awards was, perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-mediterranea-inferno-to-baldurs-gate-3-the-queer-ecstasy-of-monster-loving">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
