            <p>I greatly enjoyed tooting with my mouse in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a> on a flat monitor, but in retrospect it's the perfect candidate for conversion to virtual reality. It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.
</p>
<p>So it is in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ-unflattened">Trombone Champ: Unflattened</a>, a VR spin-off that's out now.

<p>Made by Flat2VR Studios, a company that specialises in, as their name suggests, bringing games from flat screens to VR, Unflattened seems like more than a straight re-formatting. The menus are all new, the notes whizz towards you <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a>-style, there are cosmetic unlocks for the trombone, and you can unlock and trade cards of famous musicians from throughout history.
</p>
<p>The fundamental tooting remains the same, mind you. Trombone Champ: Unflattened is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151670/Trombone_Champ_Unflattened/">available from Steam</a> and will work with more VR headsets than just the Meta Quest featured in the trailer above. It costs £12.79/€14.79/$15.
</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Unflattened will retain the best thing about the original: the community that surrounds it. Trombone Champ players have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trombone-champ-championships-are-a-wellspring-of-community-creativity-whether-or-not-you-bone-the-trom">organised championship competitions</a>, made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-final-fantasy-7-trombone-champ-mod-is-pitch-perfect">custom tracks</a>, and turned those custom tracks into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">excellent YouTube videos</a> to enjoy whether or not you play the game yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's almost the end of November, which means it is technically but not spiritually still autumn. It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone's flashlight to look for my dog's poos in the long grass. Yet it's not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Steam autumn sale</a>. 
</p>
<p>Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I think I'm right in saying that Steam sales are, at the very least, not <em>as</em> exciting as they once were, if only because we've grown used to them. It no longer seems like a miraculous surprise to have so many games deeply discounted all at once. Doubly and triply so once you factor in all the other digital storefronts, all of which also have their own big seasonal sales.

<p>Maybe it's also just become harder to find the truly spectacular deals because there's now so many of them. Sure, it's great that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> is £1.59, but it's forever slashed to cheap, so it's hard to get pumped about it. Instead it just feels like it's obscuring the handful of games where its discount is actually news. 
</p><p>It feels like a bigger deal that Hitman: World Of Assassination is a mere £2.49, a full 90% off for some of the best stealth gaming ever made. 25% off a game as new as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is significant, although it's still £45. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> at £30 feels like a good entry point for players uncertain about a slightly off-kilter fantasy RPG.
</p>
<p>Maybe we just all permanently have more games than we can ever play now. Between bundles and freebies, who needs spend money, discounted or otherwise, just to throw another game on the backlog?
</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm simply out of touch. There are definitely going to be some people saving their pennies and waiting for each new Steam sale to arrive, and more power to you. I'm not pooh-poohing Steam sales, so please put away your phone flashlights. I am genuinely curious how the RPS commenter is split, however: do you share my malaise, or are you currently posting Gaben memes in the group chat? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s launch server issues have been resolved, Asobo Studio has stated, with server capacity now increased to meet demand and reliability at over 99.999%. Patches are due next week on 2nd and 9th December aiming to make further client-side improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-november-27-update/">update to the community</a> follows on from launch woes that saw players shoved into unending queues and the servers unable to cope with demand. <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now/">Hotfix 1</a> was released last Friday on 22nd November to address key snags that people were facing, though there is one outstanding issue with outdated marketplace content from MSFS 2020 clashing with the new install of MSFS 2024 on PC.</p>


<p>As noted last week, “outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behavior.” The advice was basically to remove that content.</p>
<p>Along these lines, most MSFS 2020 content has now been ported across to MSFS 2024, though with community reports and analytics showing that some 3rd party add-ons are still problematic, Asobo is currently blocking all MSFS 2020 non-aircraft content from use with MSFS 2024.</p>
<p>The patch on 9th December will add a feature for users to disable and enable content themselves, and a safe boot option that can deactivate all 3rd party content at once if you’re struggling to launch the game.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://flightsimulator.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16882910197148-Known-issues-for-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-2024">an FAQ for outstanding issues</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the circles you fly in, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has maybe flown under the radar – heh – compared to its predecessor. The 2020 game was a marvel of conception and execution, able to approximate the entire world for players to fly in, and then with Asobo releasing a long-running stream of content updates to add more human-created touches of reality. MSFS 2024 sounds like it would be more iterative – and purchased content does carry forward – but has made some major changes to allow you to land and hop out of your aircraft, to bring a more meaningful career mode to the game with new mission types, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pearl-jam-sydney-2024-tour<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>We do not celebrate Thanksgiving here in Australia. But today I thought I'd write a little something about being thankful anyway.</em></p><p>I saw Pearl Jam on the weekend and I think it kinda changed my life? Or at least the way I remember my life.</p><p>I am a man comfortably in my mid-40s, and over that time have been to countless live shows. That's not a boast, I'm just old, stuff like this racks up as you go. I once saw Japanese hardcore legends<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67g_1EWMaos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Numb</a> play in front of 20 people in a sweaty basement.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMyHSB-TU9U&amp;t=1132s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I was on a boat for an Electric Wizard set that was incredibly called the Boat Of Doom</a>. Me and three buddies<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTKYj_8k7gw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> once went and saw desert rock legends Ten East at a pub in Annandale</a> and we were the only four people there. I lined up early to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_3uH4r4siM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> get Latyrx tickets</a> when they played in Canberra and ended up being the only person lining up early to get tickets.</p><p>The thing all those shows had in common, along with nearly every other show I've ever been to regardless of genre, is that they were current shows. Like, when I saw them, the bands or artists playing were relevant, in their prime, doing their best work in the moment. That's why they were touring, and that's why I was seeing them!</p><p>I can count the number of throwback shows--older bands playing the hits for their older fans--I've seen on one hand. I saw Faith No More 20 years after they broke up, and it was fun, I guess! I saw The Police play in 2008, which was also fun! I even saw<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mkidP2OUCk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Icehouse, my favourite band from when I was like six</a> (in 1986) in 2019 (when I was 39) and they ruled. For the most part though, I tend to pass on these kinds of tours, because seeing 60 year-old guys hobbling around trying to play the hits from when they were 26 more often than not ends up being a bit sad.</p><p>So when Pearl Jam announced they were touring Australia for the first time in over a decade, I wasn't feeling it. I'd once been a big fan, sure, but that band hadn't been relevant to me in decades, and tickets were selling in the region of $250 each. We're in the middle of a cost of living crisis! My wife kept bugging me about it though, saying stuff like "it'll be fun" and "you used to love Pearl Jam", so eventually I said fuck it, whatever, let's go. We hadn't been to a show together in years, it'll be a nice weekend away.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pearl Jam 1995-03-14 Canberra, Australia" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgLpRXrWAHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Some surprisingly high-quality surviving footage of Pearl Jam's lone Canberra show, in 1995</figcaption></figure></div><p>You need to know that beyond going to <em>this </em>show, there was some personal closure to be had here. When I was a kid,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLpRXrWAHM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Peal Jam played a single show in my home town of Canberra</a>, right when I was very much a huge Pearl Jam fan. <em>Ten </em>was the first CD I ever bought,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llOpE85bmW0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and I will champion their MTV Unplugged set until the day I die</a>. I wanted to go <em>so bad</em>, but being a kid at the time, and with fairly conservative parents, I hadn't been allowed to. This was a bummer, but wasn't a <em>huge deal</em> either, because I sagely figured that being only 15 at the time I'd have plenty of time to go see them later as I got older. Nope!</p><p>They toured Australia again in 1998, but I was living in the UK at the time, and as I found myself growing out of my teenage years and my tastes began to broaden once I got to university (and using the internet), I started getting into music that was newer, heavier, more political, or faster. As an insecure and impressionable young man in his early 20s, it was very cool to be into Refused and Mastodon and The Bronx and High on Fire and Converge. The grungy stadium rock bands with their flannel shirts and the mopey songs from the 90s were disappearing into my (and music's) rear view mirror. It was old shit. I was living for the new shit.</p><p>It's not like I <em>privately </em>disowned them. There have always been Pearl Jam tracks in my favourite playlists, and I’ve kept all my old albums in my garage, but there's not a chance in hell you'd have ever caught me wearing a Pearl Jam shirt or blasting Pearl Jam at a party in the 21st century. I had grown into someone who was simply too cool for that. I was going to cool shows for cool bands in cool basements and cool pubs.</p><p>What a <em>stupid </em>fucking thing to care about! I lived so many of my best years treating band shirts like RPG armour, as though their obscurity or heaviness would bestow me with status upgrades, and by the late 2000's it would have taken a waterboarding for me to publicly admit I knew all the lyrics to every song on <em>Vitalogy</em>. You do a lot of dumb shit when you're young and trying to find your way, but few of my own transgressions are as regrettable as pinning so much of my identity on the music I was into and other people's expression of their love for theirs.</p><p>When I got to the show on Saturday night, I did so with an open mind. I'd loved this band 30 years ago, and now I was finally seeing them; this should be fun in the same way all those other throwback shows were! When the set started with “Garden” and “Why Go”, I was into it. By the time they were hitting “Even Flow” and “Tremor Christ” 30 minutes in I was singing along. Then they played a double of “Immortality” and “Rearviewmirror”, two of my favourite Pearl Jam songs, and I just...lost it. I was standing there, a grown-ass man, shouting the words (which I probably hadn't done aloud for decades, but which could be instantly retrieved from deep storage) but also tearing up. I didn't cry throughout, this was a rock show, not a sad movie, but yeah, there were moments during the two-hour set where I genuinely lost my shit.</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/11/PXL_20241123_103850253.mp4"></video><figcaption>I don't normally like to be the "phone out" guy at a show, but they went so hard at the end of Rearviewmirror I had to get some of it</figcaption></figure><p>Turns out there are lines, riffs and entire Pearl Jam songs that had been filed deep in my memory banks because they existed alongside key points from my childhood, and seeing them live dredged them all up--the songs and the moments--in quick succession. It was like my life was flashing before my eyes, but only the parts of it when I was an awkward teenager who listened to too much grunge. I'd turned up to this show expecting a throwback, but dear reader, it was I who had been thrown back, back into my teenage years and waist-deep into moments I hadn't thought about in <em>decades</em>.</p><p>I'd met my first girlfriend to “Better Man” as the final song at a school dance. We broke up a few months later, only days after I'd bought her a copy of<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB2W3vuzVGk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Merkinball</em></a> for her birthday (which I kept and still have, it's great). I'd been to basketball practice where we played these songs. I played “Porch” one day after I came home so stressed from exams I was crying in the shower. The best karaoke I've ever done was an acoustic rendition of “Indifference” in the dying light of a graduation party. I moved out of home and to England to work as a sports coach at a boarding school when I was only 17, <em>way </em>too young to be doing that, and proved it by only thinking to take one cassette for my Walkman: Pearl Jam's MTV Unplugged set, which I played so often I wore the tape out.</p><p>At seemingly every pivotal, formative and often embarrassing moment of my youth, moments my slightly older self had clearly tried to protect myself from (probably out of sheer embarrassment), this band had been there. And me being the stupid young asshole I was, I'd tried to bury it all, the moments and the music. Now, as a middle-aged man, here they were, in person, right in front of me. Playing those same songs live, in my face, sent all those memories crashing right back to the forefront of my consciousness whether I wanted them or not.</p><p>And what's more, Pearl Jam <em>killed </em>it. The show wasn't just nostalgic, it was <em>incredible</em>. Their age was utterly irrelevant. Eddie Vedder's soaring vocals could still climb into the heavens, Mike McReady shredded everything he touched and Matt Cameron casually spent the night reminding us all he's still one of the best drummers on the planet. This show took place in 2024 but aside from the haircuts and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raSMqE-CoYo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> lack of scaffolding-climbing</a> you could squint--and I was pretty far back, so this wasn't hard--and pretend it was 2004. What a privilege it was now to be able to feel this, all of this, to get this kind of reconciliation.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pearl Jam - Hunger Strike, 23rd Nov 2024, Sydney" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2dmEncBN66c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>For the first time in over a decade, the band played <em>Hunger Strike</em>, the Temple of the Dog track on which Vedder was a guest vocalist alongside friend Chris Cornell. Getting to see it live was something I'll remember for the rest of my life. </figcaption></figure></div><p>I've spent the week since the show not just endlessly listening to live Pearl Jam recordings (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/album/4VCFCNy4B35Mx0qzG6JLoF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a <em>fantastic </em>1994 set just landed on Spotify</a>), but also swimming in all the memories this show dragged up and what they meant to me now that I was decades later in my life. It shouldn't have been legal for me to move overseas and do that job at that age, it messed me up! My first girlfriend had been filed away as a "sad" memory, but that wasn't right; she broke up with me over the phone, while I was in a phone booth, and I'd had to walk home for ten minutes in the rain<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oabcM9SOF-E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like an extended <em>Arrested Development</em> bit</a>. That was sad when I was 15, but it's fucking hilarious now.</p><p>It's no great revelation to say that music has these powers. We've all experienced something like this, waves of nostalgia and glimpses of our lost youths through the songs of those times, but this was something else. I'd never been hit with feelings as hard or as revelatory as I had on Saturday night. I went to a rock show and ended up revisiting the entire 1990s, and even parts of the decade to follow. In that time I'd been an idiot, an asshole, a child and a young man, and it was wild revisiting the rawness of those years, having them thrust upon me by a band I thought I'd moved on from, but clearly never had.</p><p>Hopefully we--Pearl Jam, my memories, my regrets and my indiscretions--are all cool now, and we can all get along for the rest of my life without so much pointless baggage and drama.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With the end of the year looming, Hello Games' exploratory space sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is - in an occurrence that's rapidly becoming a bit of a tradition - revisiting all its limited-time Expedition events from 2024 over the next ten weeks. That means you've got another chance to whizz through and earn their various rewards if you missed them the first time around.
</p>
<p>
And I do mean whizz. While Expeditions ordinarily last around six weeks, No Man's Sky's latest Redux event is racing through this year's offerings at a pace of one a fortnight. Furthermore, things are already underway with Omega - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-as-new-omega-update-lands">kicked off 2024's Expeditions</a> back in February - now live and running until 11th December.
</p>
<p>
Omega (as is the case for all future Expeditions) can be accessed via the terminal in No Man's Sky's communal Space Anomaly, and - among its many rewards - gives players the opportunity to earn the rather flashy Starborn starship. Before we cover the highlights of each Expedition, though, here's the upcoming Redux schedule in full:

<ul>
<li>Omega: 27th November - 11th December</li>
<li>Adrift: 11th December - 25th December</li>
<li>Liquidators: 25th December - 8th January</li>
<li>Aquarius: 8th January - 22nd January</li>
<li>The Cursed: 22nd January - 5th February</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rewards for Adrift, which sees players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-latest-update-lets-players-explore-a-lonely-abandoned-universe-devoid-of-life">stranded alone in an empty universe</a>, include a haunted frigate known as the Ship of the Damned. Liquidators, meanwhile, features organic chitlin armour to earn as players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">embark on a Starship Troopers-style bug hunt</a> across the stars. 
</p><p>
As for Aquarius, it's a fairly leisurely Expedition primarily concerned with introducing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">No Man's Sky's new fishing system</a>, and rewards here include the Lost Angler's fishing equipment and a octopus-inspired bobblhead for your starship's dashboard. As finally, there's The Cursed - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">horror-themed Expedition</a> set in a collapsing reality populated by spectral entities. Rewards here are pretty nifty, including the Cthulhu-esque Horror Exosuit customisation, bioluminescent pets, and the UFO-like Boundary Herald starship.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games' Expedition Redux event is now underway on all platforms, and it follows yesterday's news that No Man's Sky has finally - eight years after its rocky launch - managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eight-years-after-its-rocky-launch-no-mans-sky-finally-hits-very-positive-reviews-on-steam">hit the "Very Positive" reviews threshold</a> on Steam. Reaching the coveted "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking will be a bit of a challenge given the way Steam ratings are calculated, but who knows - Hello Games has <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/holiday-2024-expeditions/">confirmed</a> it still has "much more in store" for No Man's Sky.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-exclusives-arriving-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rumors continue to swirl about a new PlayStation event, but with no official confirmation in sight, what PS5 exclusives might arrive in 2025?</p>



<p>Luckily, unlike the quieter 2024—which focused on new IPs and games from partners—next year seemingly looks packed with first-party AAAs!</p>



<p>Before we dive in, though, let me clarify that we’ll soon have a similar article focusing on Xbox, and this is nothing more than speculation on what we believe could be released in 2025.</p>



<p>Last but not least, this list focuses on console exclusives, meaning the games mentioned are confirmed only for PS5 and PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-ps5-exclusives-for-2025">PS5 exclusives for 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei </h3>



<p>Details about the sequel to Ghost of Tsushima are still a bit scarce, but the game was announced with an exciting trailer earlier this year. more importantly, it’s one of the only first-party games for PlayStation with a launch window of 2025. Since PlayStation has a tendency to repeat its dates too, so it seems plausible that this second installment of the “Ghost of” series will drop sometime in June.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7z7kqwuf0a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In this new adventure, we won’t be controlling Jin Sakai; instead, we’ll play as a woman named Atsu. Set in 1603, 329 years after the first game’s events, the time skip might allow for more varied gameplay.</p>



<p>During this period, European countries heavily influenced Japan, leading to a “technological exchange.” For instance, Japanese soldiers began using firearms for the first time, which could add more variety to Atsu’s adventures. </p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach </h3>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach came out swinging with its first trailer, and in pure Kojima fashion, no one quite understood what exactly was happening. Its various trailers since have continued to keep people on their toes and guessing what’s next in the Death Stranding universe. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Death Stranding 2 On The Beach - State of Play Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wbLstJHlC4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unlike Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2 at least seems to be a direct continuation of the first game, but the big question is how Kojima will manage to surprise us again and what new gameplay he has in store.</p>



<p>Since the first game launched in November 2019, the safest bet for this sequel’s release is sometime in the second half of 2025, especially if Ghost of Yotei takes up the first half.</p>



<h3 id="h-horizon-online">Horizon Online </h3>



<p>According to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent job</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/">listing</a>, Horizon Online is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to arrive sometime next year</a>.</p>



<p>Many hope it will have gameplay similar to the Monster Hunter series, but is that the direction in which Guerrilla Games is going? Will it be an open world, or are we looking at a hub-based system? Will there be PvP? How will progression work? Unfortunately, we only have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12-minute video from the game’s alpha</a> to go on, and with so much potentially changing since the leak, it’s challenging to know what exactly is in store.</p>



<p>With Monster Hunter Wilds launching at the end of February, I imagine PlayStation is tentatively looking to put Horizon Online in the second half of the year.</p>



<h3 id="h-lost-soul-aside">Lost Soul Aside </h3>



<p>Fans of Lost Soul Aside definitely deserve an award for their patience! The game was first announced back in 2017 and still doesn’t have a release date in sight.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="LOST SOUL ASIDE Boss Fight 9 Minutes Gameplay - ChinaJoy 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeEUb7_am4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, there’s a good reason for the delay. The project was initially led by a single developer, Yang Bing, but it caught the attention of PlayStation, who decided to back the game.</p>



<p>They were so impressed that they took on the role of publisher. The game showcased a solid video at ChinaJoy 2024, indicating that things could be coming together for a 2025 release.</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you think about the PS5 exclusives set to arrive in 2025? It’s worth noting that more titles will likely launch throughout the year, but these probably will be smaller-scale projects. One example is AI-Limit, which is a game that’s a part of the PlayStation China Hero Project. But who knows, maybe PlayStation is hiding some surprises up its sleeve?</p>



<p>There are rumors that Marathon might show up next year, too, but given the project’s current state, I think that’s highly unlikely, especially considering the failed launch of Concord.  I strongly suspect that PlayStation has some real concerns about its live-service slate of games and is reevaluating its strategy. Unless, of course, Bungie is in a rush to get the game out the door, which has its own problems.</p>



<p>Other announced games, like the temporary exclusive KOTOR Remake, the<span> </span>highly anticipated&nbsp;Phantom Blade 0,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marvel’s Wolverine, will probably not appear until sometime in 2026.</p>

Crown Clash, for example, is a game mode that can be voted for every five rounds and sees players trying to survive while carrying a crown for as long as possible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Some may not remember it well now, but No Man's Sky had an utterly disastrous launch back in August 2016. After much hype, the released game proved quite disappointing to critics and fans alike. The Metascore average for the PC version is still <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/no-mans-sky/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sitting at just 61/100</a> (which is labeled as 'Mixed or Average' on Metacritic), and fans were also quite critical in their user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>One month after the game's debut, No Man's Sky was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/mans-sky-investigation-uks-advertising-standards-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigated</a> by the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority after many complaints from British customers. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-steam-page-not-mislead-consumers-asa-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared</a> of any wrongdoings on that count a few months later, but the mixed reception lingered.</p>
<p>Still, independent developer Hello Games embarked on a journey to deliver their true vision for the game. Year after year, they delivered dozens of major free updates, adding new features, content, and improvements in all areas, slowly winning back the respect and even admiration of gamers worldwide. In September 2021, five years after that fateful launch, No Man's Sky's overall user review score <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-has-finally-reached-mostly-positive-70-overall-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned</a> from 'Mixed' to 'Mostly Positive'.</p>
<p>Now, the game has reached another milestone, having finally moved from 'Mostly Positive' to 'Very Positive'. Game director Sean Murray, who also manages the official social media channels, <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1861859832187211963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X:</p>
<p><em>Holy shit you guys - it happened 🥳</em></p>
<p><em>ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive 😍</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you Thank you Thank you❤️</em></p>
<p><em>You have no idea what this means to us 🙏</em></p>
<p>It must feel good to have come this far after that debut. There is little doubt that it's one of the most epic comebacks in the history of gaming, arguably alongside Square Enix's Final Fantasy XIV and CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>The most important thing, though, is that Hello Games has earned back the love of its fans, who continue to play No Man's Sky in ever greater numbers after every new update. The last one <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> the long-awaited cross-save progression feature and also brought back Mass Effect's Normandy to celebrate N7 Day. The studio's engineers also impressed once again with their PS5 Pro implementation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> a stable 8K resolution mode at 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>While No Man's Sky continues to be updated at an impressive pace, following the incredible recovery of the game, fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-handily-tops-youtube-views-for-tga-2023-trailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also very eager</a> to discover more about the studio's next title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire</a>. This fantasy-themed game promises to be every bit as ambitious as the previous game, given the studio's goal to deliver a true planet-sized multiplayer sandbox roleplaying game.</p>

That’s right, Thanksgaming! It’s the day of the year when everyone in America—and all around the world—gets together to celebrate unknown indie games.</p><p>As has become an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-pc-indie-indiegeddon-platformer-puzzle-shooter-1849820599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-pc-indie-indiegeddon-platformer-puzzle-shooter-1849820599">annual</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-pc-games-indie-wishlist-thanksgaming-1851044770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-pc-games-indie-wishlist-thanksgaming-1851044770">tradition</a></span> on <em>Kotaku</em>, we put out a call to indie developers to let us know about their upcoming or recently released games that have gone under the radar, so we can highlight them here on this big platform while the gaming news is taking a day off to stuff its face with turkey.</p><p>As ever, our including these games here is not a comment on their quality, as unless otherwise stated, we haven’t played them. Instead, these are randomly* selected from the <em>hundreds</em> of emails we received (over 400, in fact, to give you an idea of how many games are out there), to highlight just what extraordinary variety and possibility that exists withing the broad world of independent gaming.</p><p>If you want to support these developers and their projects, there’s a bunch of stuff you can do. <strong>Adding them to your Wishlist</strong> makes a real difference, helping developers get both algorithmic <em>and</em> financial attention, let alone that it reminds you to buy it when it’s out. Telling others is huge too! Nag your favorite YouTuber to check it out. Force your grandparents to play the demo. Etch the game’s URL into your nearest mountainside.</p><p>OK, ready? And yes, this is a slideshow, get some cope. It’s how I can get away with doing these articles, so we all just accept it. Also, if you narrow your browser to portrait, or read on your phone, it removes the slides.</p><p>*I apply the smallest amount of curation to what’s featured, but it’s minimal.</p></div></div><div><p>There’s a very wonderful current trend for old-school FPS games made in the style of <em>Heretic </em>and <em>Duke Nukem</em>, with those chunky 2.5 pixels, and I love it. But it also leaves me craving the same but shinier. <em>HELLBREAK </em>looks like it’ll offer me that—absolutely madcap first-person shooting, combined with violent spells, all with a sort of <em>Diablo</em>-infused bunch of health bars and upgrades.</p><p>It’s set rather nebulously between the two world wars, with a soldier in hell fighting to save his soul, and weapons that are demonic versions of the arsenals of the era, and will include a score system based on combos. It’s due to enter Early Access at the start of next year.</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Double Barrel Games<br><strong>Release date: </strong>Q1 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043760/HELLBREAK/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043760/HELLBREAK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>I used to think I didn’t like sokoban puzzles, until I realized I was writing the phrase, “despite being a sokoban game” in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2024/05/isles-of-sea-sky/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/05/isles-of-sea-sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2023/08/seek-etyliv/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2023/08/seek-etyliv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2023/05/stuffo-the-puzzle-bot/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2023/05/stuffo-the-puzzle-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">articles</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2021/05/altered/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2021/05/altered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that</a></span> I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2019/12/enigmash/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2019/12/enigmash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had</a></span> to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2019/11/unitied/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2019/11/unitied/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">face</a></span> up to the fact that...I just like them.

It’s a city-builder combined with a railway manager, but presented in 2D pixel graphics that reminds me of a particular childhood era of gaming. Of course, it then carries over the more modern sentiments of the genre, with greater complexity of systems and resource management.

Not just the art so pretty I want to cuddle it, but an adventure game based around gathering magical stickers! There have been a few sticker-themed games of late, but most have felt too reliant on the gimmick, without the depth underneath. This, from the footage and descriptions, looks like a fundamentally strong adventure game, with the sticker element as a bonus.

The indigenous-owned Albuquerque developer, Subliminal, seems to be all about the adorable cuteness, and if they can match that with a solid sports game combined with a sweet between-game narrative, I think this could do well.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Subliminal<br><strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417530/Button_City_Soccer_Days/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417530/Button_City_Soccer_Days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>Woah, this has some serious <em>The Lion King</em> on Sega Genesis vibes! Or is it <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>? Ooh, and a hefty dose of <em>Crash Bandicoot. </em>Oh, just pick your own classic  platformer. It looks utterly gorgeous, and its recent console release last month saw a bunch of very positive reviews, albeit from lower-profile gaming sites. So you can grab it right now on Xbox, PS5 and Switch.

That’s slowed down enough this year to let novel additions stand out a bit better, and <em>Sultan’s Game </em>certainly looks novel. It’s an RPG, but played using cards, and it’s all about exploring one’s less innocent urges.</p><p>You’re constantly required to make “dreadful choices,” which might be murdering an innocent, lavish spending, dangerous adventures, or extravagant carnal pursuits. Presumably much like your Thanksgiving plans. Of course, you can choose to disobey the Sultan and risk a regicidal route. And, apparently, even slay dragons. The art looks fantastic, and the whole thing is intriguing.

I mean, it apparently offers the chance to set unicycle-riding octopuses on fire, or annoy a group of bat-people who cosplay as the Pope, and I never miss any game with those features.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Z.

Is that tautology? I think <em>10 Dead Doves</em> says you can. This fixed-perspective horror about exploring an urban legend called the Ant Farm, while trying to find the cause of dead birds in Appalachia looks all sorts of crazy.</p><p>There’s a demo, and the full game is out in just a couple of weeks. This is a comedy horror, which is a tough genre, but if it can pull it off, this could be fascinating.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Duonix Studios<br><strong>Release date:</strong> Dec 13<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1564540/10_Dead_Doves/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1564540/10_Dead_Doves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>One day historians will pinpoint the exact moment when inventory tetris went from a gripe to a feature. In <em>Deadly Days: Roadtrip</em>, it’s a core component of the game, boasting, “A well-organized inventory is your best life insurance.”</p><p>This is a frenzied zombie survival game, combining <em>Vampire Survivors</em> with exploration, and indeed managing your inventory in such a way as to best synergize your selection of weapons and tools. Which sounds ace. There’s an open playtest due in the middle of December, with the release planned for next year.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>PixelSplit<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3026450/Deadly_Days_Roadtrip/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3026450/Deadly_Days_Roadtrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>I love a game where looking at a screenshot makes me feel completely overwhelmed. <em>Journey to Incrementalia</em> achieves this splendidly, and even more-so in the video above. Stuff’s definitely going on!</p><p>This is an “active incremental auto-battler,” it says, and it’s all about casting spells to break down 99 walls to reach the lost city of Incrementalia. And you know what? I <em>love</em> growing to “insane heights of power,” so perhaps this is very much the game for me. I’m absolutely fascinated—and can play it right now, given it was released last month, and is just $4 in the Steam sale.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Adam Travers<br><strong>Release date:</strong> Out now<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3147430/Journey_to_Incrementalia/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3147430/Journey_to_Incrementalia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>As someone not especially musically able, rhythm games are not my forte. Until they’re <em>weird</em>, and then I’m in. Playing <em>Thumper</em> on a VR headset at a gaming show before it was released, so I had no idea what was about to happen to me, was a particular highlight. <em>Hyperbeat</em>, while obviously not the same vibe, seems to meet the right criteria.</p><p>The game’s page describes it as featuring “each note flying at you indicating whether you slash, ride, or dodge your way through an endless dream.” This is the work of childhood friends Alice Bottino and Chancellor Wallin, with a demo out, and a full release next year.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Alice Bottino, Chancellor Wallin<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2263360/HYPERBEAT/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2263360/HYPERBEAT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p><hr><p>What an extraordinary selection, and I’ve barely made a dent in the pile of emails.

			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends as a beginner, you'll see that there are <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five roles</a> to choose from. This includes ADC, Support, Jungler, Top and Mid. This guide will be walking you through some of the easiest Mid laners that you can play in League of Legends as a beginner. Being a Mid laner can be pretty daunting, as you are the most vulnerable lane out of the three. You have the possibility to be attacked from either side, whether it be laners or the jungler.</p>
<p>Check out our other League of Legends guides here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">Best ADCS for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/">Best Supports for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Junglers for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-top-laners-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Top laners for beginners&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Mid Laners for Beginners in League of Legends</h2>
<p><span><strong>Veigar</strong> is, of course, on the list. As long as you stack his Q against minions or even against champions, you'll get stacks and more damage very quickly. He also has great crowd control, as he has the potential to stun enemies with his E. Depending on how well you farm, Veigar has the potential to snowball and be a real threat, allowing him to one-shot enemies with his Ultimate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lux</strong> is another great mage to play and is one of the easiest champions to learn how to play. She is quite versatile and can also be played as a support. Compared to other champions, Lux has a relatively low cooldown on her Ultimate, making her a nightmare for the enemy team. However, she can be a bit difficult as both her Q and her Ultimate are skill shots that have the potential to miss.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Malzahar</strong> is a ton of fun, and once you get the farming technique down pat using his DoT, you have a lot of potential to earn plenty of gold and get the advantage over your opponent. His voidlings are great distractions, and he has some great crowd control. Once his damage has ramped up, his Ultimate can be a real threat, as it stuns the enemy and saps their health.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Annie</strong> is a great mid laner to learn if you're just getting started in League of Legends. Her abilities are easy to use, and her damage is simple and efficient. As long as you make sure to stack your shield properly so that your ability stuns, you have the potential to wipe out many opponents, especially if you use your stun-infused ability to summon Tibbers on top of the enemy.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the easiest Mid laners you can learn to play, and they are a ton of fun to play, too. They have a lot of potential to make you the team carry as long as you learn their kits.</p>
<p>Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>

            <p>
Thursday is upon us, meaning the Epic Games Store's latest freebie is now live - and to coincide with its arrival, Epic has revealed the next two games it'll be making free in seven days time.
</p>
<p>
First up for those wanting immediate amusement is developer Blowfish's Brotato, which is free to download right now until next Thursday, 5th December. It's a top-down arena shooter roguelite in which players, in the role of the titular potato, fend off alien hordes using up to six weapons at a time. Regrettably, I can't give you Eurogamer's verdict on it seeing as we haven't revewied it, but I <em>can</em> tell you it's currently rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam.
</p>
<p>
As for next week's Epic freebies - which take over from Brotato in seven days time - you'll be getting public transportation shenanigans in Stillalive Studios' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bus-simulator-21">Bus Simulator 21</a>, plus some family friendly sci-fi action-adventure in TT Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Brotato - Full Release Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfceZHR7Yq0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
The latter, if you're unfamiliar, is a Lego-ised retelling of all three Star Wars movie trilogies, combined with some exploration and collectible gathering across a large selection of open-world planets. Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips called The Skywalker Saga "humourous if simple fun" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-a-complete-but-cluttered-collection">2022 review</a>, noting, however, that its open-world elements "held less pull."
</p>
<p>
Still, if it's freebies you want, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/brotato-ed4097">Brotato is your current Epic Games Store treat</a>, with Bus Simulator 21 and The Skywalker Saga taking its place starting next Thursday, 5th December.

In Ndemic Creations' mobile <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Plague Inc, you nurture a disease and attempt to spread it across the world. Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic's advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/after-inc-revival">After Inc: Revival</a>, a blend of city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To be more specific, the game is set in "a beautiful post-apocalyptic United Kingdom". You'll found and develop an expanse of cosy blue rooftops, sleepy windmills and golden cornfields in the shadow of canted, overgrown city blocks. Mind the zombies, though. There are still a few of them lurking in the undergrowth, threatening to spoil the neo-rustic bonhomie. Find a rundown of key features below, air-lifted from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/">the Steam page</a>. The mention of "democracy or authoritarianism" makes this sound like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>'s rosy-cheeked stepchild.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Exploit the ruins of the past to scavenge / harvest resources.
</p>
<p>
- Expand your Settlement with housing, farms, lumberyards and much more.
</p>
<p>
- Shape your society and provide services to keep your people happy.
</p>
<p>
- Make difficult decisions - Are children an unaffordable luxury? Are dogs pets or a food source? Democracy or Authoritarianism?
</p>
<p>
- Exterminate zombie infestations and defend humanity.
</p>
<p>
- Explore a beautiful post-apocalyptic United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
- Build multiple settlements in a persistent campaign and level up abilities.
</p>
<p>
- Ultra-realistic modelling of Zombie behaviour based on real-life studies... :P
</p>
<p>
- Sophisticated narrative algorithms shaped by your decisions.
</p>
<p>
- 10 unique leaders with radically different abilities.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The game's out in early access in 2025, though you can install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ndemiccreations.afterinc&amp;hl=en">a free-to-play mobile version</a> right now. The early access period will bring new settlement leaders, "more levels", "expanded campaigns", new character traits and crises, expanded localisation, and clues about the origins and workings of the Necroa virus responsible for the undead outbreak.
</p><p>
I like After Inc's art and choice of perspective, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a>. I'm also interested in, and a little worried by, the game's portrayal of aftermath, which I imagine can't help but be a commentary on feelings about the coronavirus pandemic, for all its B-movie fantasy framing (the developers play up the connection in press materials, joking a little tactlessly that "After Inc: Revival is not based on any real-world situation" and there's "no need to start worrying about a real-life zombie apocalypse yet"). I'd like to know whether After Inc echoes or challenges the benign rhetoric of a "return to normal", which disregards the fact that Covid is still very much with us and a source of <a href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/respiratory-viruses/covid-19">considerable death and disability</a>.

At first, I feared I had been ensnared by sorcery, but now I have access to something far more wondrous: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday shopping</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is this curious holiday where people queue in droves to trade their coin for treasures I could scarcely dream of? As I learned of these deals and contraptions, I vowed to document my findings. For if you, too, were a time traveler, these are the marvels you'd surely wish to bring home – these marvels (the best Black Friday deals to shop on Thanksgiving, by the way) would astonish any soul, no matter the century.</p><p id="gaming-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gaming Deals">Gaming Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would keep up the whole 17th century pilgrim theme but I'm short on time and lacking in creativity after writing about Black Friday deals for a month! Anyway, here are the absolute doorbusting deals you should come to expect from a Black Friday sale, including some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-games-black-friday-deals">major discounts on top games</a> like Star Wars Outlaws, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Persona 3 Reload, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not satisfied?

This is the best price we've seen ever since it was launched back in 2022, and I am pretty certain it won't drop again for Black Friday.</p><p id="tech-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tech Deals">Tech Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, there's a few more excellent gaming deals rolled into one here, but you can't deny how excellent some of these offers are.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolfire-and-dark-catt%E2%80%99s-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status.1047639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The legal dispute between Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios against Valve first started in 2021 and has since been granted class-action status. This was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-granted-class-action-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, where they stated that they saw a court document that shows the motion for class certification to be granted. United States District Judge Jamal N. Whitehead granted the motion. By doing this, it means that the antitrust lawsuit that was started by Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios now has the potential to become a significantly larger dispute.</p>
<p>Wolfire first <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-founder-gabe-newell-ordered-to-ensure-in-court-presence-amid-steam-anti-trust-lawsuit/">filed the lawsuit in April 2021</a>, claiming that Valve's commission is "an extraordinarily high cut," constituting anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit also argues that Valve uses its dominance to "exploit publishers and consumers." However, this claim was actually dismissed in November 2021. Once that happened, the developer decided to reevaluate, update, and adapt their arguments in May 2022. As this happened, VR game developer Dark Catt Studios also filed its own antitrust lawsuit in June 2021. Some of the claims they made were dismissed, but they were allowed to continue the lawsuit based on some of their claims that were found to have validity.</p>
<p>Since the lawsuits were so similar, a court order was then issued in July 2022 to confirm that both cases would be consolidated into one.</p>
<p>The document says that the class action will apply to any developers, publishers, or individuals who paid a commission to Valve in connection with a game sale. The class action refers to the 30% cut the firm takes from each purchase. The class action will be referring to the people on or after January 28, 2017.</p>
<p>Valve is not the only one who has been involved in a lawsuit for similar problems as of late. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-and-sony-sued-for-establishing-digital-monopolies-with-their-stores/">Sony is also involved in a class action lawsuit</a>, as they removed the ability for retailers like Amazon, GameStop, or Best Buy to directly sell digital codes for PlayStation games. This led to a feeling that Sony was monopolizing the titles, and causing consumers to have to pay higher prices than they could have at an alternative retailer.</p>
<p>In the order, the judge has made the decision to deny Valve's request to exclude the testimony of an expert. This expert is Dr. Steven Schwartz, who has called both studios to argue their case for them. In this case, Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt will both be the class representatives for the action.</p>
<p>At the moment, there's no telling how long this class action will take, as the class action for Sony isn't due to appear in court for a couple of years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-top-laners-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends, you'll find that there are <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five roles</a> to choose from in the game, all of which have different priorities. Top lane may be a little bit daunting, as you are the sole person in the lane and are responsible for everything that happens up there. However, there is a lot of fun to be had and a ton of potential to snowball and end up being the team carry. For those wanting to experiment with the top lane, here are some of the best top laners for beginners.</p>
<p>Check out our other League of Legends guides:</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/">Best Supports</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">Best ADCS</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Junglers</a></p>
<h2>Best Top Laners for Beginners in League of Legends</h2>
<p>There are a ton of top laners out there, with more being added all the time. However, some are significantly easier than others to play and can help you get to grips with the functionality of the lane.</p>
<p>One of the easiest top laners to try out is&nbsp;<strong>Nasus.</strong> He's been a mainstay in the game since its release and has one of the easiest kits to use. You just have to make sure that you are executing minions with your Q, and your damage will start to ramp up very fast. You also have the ability to slow your opponents significantly, making a chase much easier, especially if your jungler is ganking you. On top of that, if you are the one being chased, using your slow can also make it much easier for you to get away in sticky situations. Your Ultimate is excellent, as it makes you much bigger with a bigger health bar and makes it much harder to kill you. This is great if you're in a sticky situation or if you find yourself in a large team fight.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Darius</strong> is another typical top laner that you'll see in lane. He can be a massive pain to deal with, which makes it a great idea to learn him early on. Darius' abilities center around bleed damage, which can allow you to get some great early-game kills on opponents, especially if they are relatively squishy. It can be a bit tricky learning the rotation of his moveset, but once you've gotten the hang of it, Darius can make the opponent's life a misery.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Garen</strong> is another mainstay in League of Legends, and was one of the first champions to be released when the game came out. His moveset is very simple and is one of the easiest top laners to learn in League of Legends if you're a beginner. If you manage to get kills early on, you can snowball quickly and become a carry for the team, especially in team fights.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While&nbsp;<strong>Maokai</strong> isn't typically a top laner, he is currently very viable in the top lane thanks to the current meta. He's very versatile and works in both the mid lane and bot lane as a support. Roaming with Maokai is always a great decision and is a great damage sponge. As a result, he makes a great frontline if you're in a team fight, as he can protect the squishier champions, as well as root enemies using his Ultimate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are many other great top laners out there in League of Legends, all ranging in difficulty. Have fun experimenting, and good luck in the Summoner's Rift.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/28/24308248/8bitdo-keyboard-retro-87-mechanical-xbox-edition-rgb-lighting-r8-mouse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>8BitDo has announced a new version of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813761/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-nintendo-famicom">mechanical keyboard</a> with a design inspired by the&nbsp;transparent green edition of Microsoft’s original Xbox console. The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-87-mechanical-keyboard-xbox/">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard - Xbox Edition</a> features a transparent green shell and matching keycaps similar to the console. But unlike previous iterations of the keyboard, this is the first from 8BitDo to incorporate RGB backlighting.</p><p>The Xbox Edition mechanical keyboard is now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMTLLSBN?tag=theverge02-20">available for preorder through Amazon</a> for $119.99 with shipping expected to start on January 16th, 2025. 8BitDo also announced the matching 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse alongside the keyboard, which is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMVLD2HC?tag=theverge02-20">also listed on Amazon</a>, but not available for preorder yet.</p><div><figcaption><em>The keyboard includes 8BitDo’s programmable Dual Super Buttons.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>The keyboard features a tenkeyless layout with 87 keys that include a full function row, a Windows key, and the addition of an Xbox logo button in the upper right corner that serves as a shortcut to the Windows Game Bar. It pairs double-layered ABS keycaps featuring a matte UV coating for durability with Kailh Jellyfish X switches, and the keyboard is compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2 allowing its mapping to be customized and macros to be created.</p><p>As with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24113566/8bitdo-commodore-64-retro-mechanical-keyboard-specs-release-date-price-features">other mechanical keyboards</a>, 8BitDo includes a pair of large Super Buttons that can be programmed to trigger macros or other functions.</p><p>The RGB backlighting offers eight different modes including animated waves of rainbow colors or individual keys illuminating. 8BitDo says the keyboard’s built-in 2,000mAh battery can keep it running for up to 200 hours, but doesn’t specify if that’s with the backlighting turned on, or if that’s while connecting to a device over Bluetooth or using its included 2.4GHz dongle. With a dead battery, the keyboard can still connect to devices with a USB-C cable.</p><div><figcaption><em>8BitDo’s Retro R8 Mouse - Xbox Edition matches the keyboard and features four customizable buttons, two on each side.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-r8-mouse-xbox/">8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse - Xbox Edition</a> has a similar transparent green shell as the keyboard, along with four programmable side buttons (two on each side) matching the colors of the action buttons on the original Xbox controllers. It uses a PAW 3395 optical sensor with six selectable sensitivity levels ranging from 50 DPI to 26,000 DPI. The Retro R8 Mouse’s polling rate can also be adjusted using 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software from 125Hz to 8,000Hz. The mouse’s primary buttons use Kailh Sword GM X Micro Switches which 8BitDo says have been “engineered for up to 100 million clicks.”</p><p>The mouse’s 450mAh rechargeable battery can power the mouse for up to 100 hours when using a Bluetooth connection but with a low-latency 2.4GHz connection battery life ranges between 26 to 105 hours depending on the polling rate. To streamline charging the Retro R8 Mouse includes a matching charging dock that also includes a “signal-extending feature” that 8BitDo says “ensures robust and uninterrupted connectivity.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
