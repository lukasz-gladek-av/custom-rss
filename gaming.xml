            <p>Bravely he stood, alone on his hill, unwavering in the face of backlash: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> should have just let Frog be a talking frog instead of being a knight turned into a frog. So, trash game. Fortunately, I can finally experience what it’s like to actually enjoy Chrono Trigger - Canadian Studio Riyo Games are making what they describe as a "spiritual successor". It’s called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/threads-of-time">Threads Of Time</a>, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful. Hop on over to the trailer below.</p>

<p>News of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has actually been floating around for a while now, with Riyo sharing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/130m08j/my_dream_of_20_years_is_coming_true_im_making_a/">a little snippet</a> on Reddit a year or so ago. Even in such a small clip, you can see how lovely it looks. Here’s some words from the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Threads of Time features gorgeous 2.5D pixel art powered by Unreal Engine 5 that instantly transports you across breathtaking locales through the ages. Explore different eras, assemble your party and restore the ancient order of the Time Knights. From the majestic age of dinosaurs to the distant future teeming with mechanical marvels, every era is packed with adventure and secrets waiting to be unearthed. As you navigate this vast tapestry of history, uncover a sinister plot threatening to unravel the very fabric of time as told through striking anime cutscenes.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Steam page is supposed to be up today, but it isn’t showing up right now. Maybe it was only a frog pretending to be a Steam page. Who knows! Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Time-Traveling Adventure: From an age where dinosaurs roam to the far-flung future and alternate realms in between - travel across fantastic and distinctive time periods, and discover the threads that bind the ages. Uncover an epic tale of interwoven fates, and secrets that shaped civilizations…and follow the threads of a sinister plot that traverses the tapestry of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Timeless Turn-Based Combat: Weave together powerful attacks in visually dynamic, strategic turn-based battles. Bend time to your will, unravel enemies’ defenses, and unleash your party’s full potential through devastating team combos.</p></li>
<li><p>Heroes From Across Ages: Assemble a party of charismatic and unique characters recruited from different eras. Restore the ancient Order of the Time Knights and unite heroes from across epochs to defend the timeline from impending chaos and corruption.</p></li>
<li><p>Retro Charm Meets Modern Visuals: Step into vibrant worlds powered by Unreal Engine 5, meet lovingly hand-crafted 2D characters and experience the timeless charm of pixel art as you explore through the ages. Threads of Time captures the essence of your favorite retro RPGs, wrapped in a new and immersive adventure.</p></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>“I'm distracted by them using "AD" and "BC" though. Christ exists in this fiction? So did God invent magic, then? Was Jesus a wizard? Tell me more plz,” mused Graham in Slack. It’s been a while since I’ve played Chrono Trigger (which I enjoyed, before you go feral on me in the comments), but some searching tells me the ‘B.C’ in that stood for ‘Before Cedric’. Will Threads Of Time also feature a Cedric? What if it's Jesus transformed into a Cedric? I await these answers longingly.</p></div>

<p>Merge Games has announced that it will be closing down after 15 years of publishing games.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today on <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839264412579831900">X</a> (formerly Twitter), which read,</p>



<p>“Hello! After 15 years, Merge Games is closing down.</p>



<p>Starting from  tiny, cramped attic and growing to a tight, multi-disciplined 22 person team, we’ve brought hundreds of indie gems to storefronts around the world and loved every moment of it!</p>



<p>We couldn’t have done it without people passionate about indie games, from all of our developers all the way to you folks, the players!</p>



<p>If you see someone from Merge, just know that they’re an incredible person that worked their hardest.</p>



<p>Thank you for many years of gaming!”</p>



<p>Since its inception, Merge Games has published various games, including Dead Cells, Small and Survive the Wilds, Bramble: The Mountain King, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, and more. However, its parent company, Maximum Entertainment, will now manage any upcoming releases that were under Merge Games before its closure.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Funko Fusion Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/funko-fusion-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-fusion-review.992946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/funko-fusion-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Funko’s remain an ubiquitous part of the shopping landscape, row after row of plastic figures styled after every popular franchise in the world languishing on shelves in every supermarket, toy shop and place of geekdom. Collectable, displayable, and kind of cute in their own way, they also don’t <em>do</em>&nbsp;very much, and their pervasive presence and plastic build mean that they’re edging ever closer to being throwaway tat. Funko Fusion is the company’s attempt to ‘do a Lego’, taking their real-world products and popping them into a video game. These Funkos definitely do something, but whether it’s enough to change people’s mind about them remains to be seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Funko Fusion - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2ATcFLgSMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biggest question that arises from playing Funko Fusion is a simple one: who is this really for? It draws together a disparate batch of franchises – Jurassic World, He-Man, Scott Pilgrim, The Umbrella Academy, Battlestar Galactica, The Thing and Hot Fuzz are your starting points – and tasks you with saving this plasticky multiverse from the forces of evil who are set on destroying it. You do that by mostly beating, bashing and shooting your way past a host of enemies, while solving the occasional puzzle, and if the team were hoping to emulate the Lego games, they’ve mostly got it right.</p>


<p>It’s probably little surprise to find this vein of child-friendly action games running through Funko Fusion, as 10:10 Games was founded by former Traveller’s Tales team members Arthur Parsons and Jon Burton. The biggest issue here is that barring Jurassic World, the majority of franchises here are aimed at people in their 30s and 40s, running the gamut of old-school names through to a worrying vein of horror titles like Child’s Play. Hell, it’s not even the most recent Battlestar Galactica (which is already 20 years old), it’s the original 1970s one, which came out before I was born. And I’m old.</p>


<p>All this means that, bizarrely, Funko Fusion is rated 16. It is not for children. But, the only people who have been really excited to play it have been my children – aged 8 and 13 – and predominantly because it has dinosaurs in it. We started with Jurassic World, but the moment I moved onto He-Man – the only other clearly child-friendly franchise here – their interest swiftly waned.</p>
<p>That was probably the right thing to happen, as the scary, slightly vicious streak that also runs through Funko Fusion from the outset had me questioning my parenting choices. The vinyl is melted right off the bones of a cute fox character early on, and that underlying darkness is only enhanced by the arrival of Chucky, M3GAN and characters from The Walking Dead as you head deeper into the plastic depths of Fusion’s worlds.</p>

<p>Again though, Funko Fusion <em>looks</em> like a kids game, and it’s an excellent-looking one at that. The plasticky stars look very much like their real-world counterparts, and each franchise-specific location manages to capture the look, feel and nostalgia of those original titles. The strains of recognisable themes helps as well, but having taken the original Lego route of forgoing dialogue, and relying on slapstick humour – oh look, their head’s come off and now they’re covered in poo! – means that again, this feels like a kids game that’s not for kids.</p>
<p>“But games can just be fun!” a corner of the internet will cry. Yes, they can be fun, and Funko Fusion broadly is. I like a good spot of nostalgia as much as the next guy, and seeing the DeLorean from Back to the Future appear or Masters of the Universe’s Snake Mountain in 3D, made a ton of feelings bubble up to the surface – not least wondering whatever happened to my original Castle Greyskull. It’s light, and fairly inconsequential, but enjoyable nonetheless.</p>

<p>The combat here is straightforward, but when I started out with my review it was actually surprisingly tough. So much so that 10:10 Games has already patched it to make it easier, raising further questions about who they’re targeting. For kids raised on Fortnite and Lego games, there’s little here that will surprise them, but it’s solid and engaging enough as you wonder what the next little Easter Egg will be.</p>
<p>The most criminal exclusion at launch though, is the lack of cooperative multiplayer. <a href="https://x.com/FunkoFusionGame/status/1831347215928807428">It’s coming in updates</a> through October and November for various world, just in time for Christmas, but if ever a game screamed out for playing with friends it’s this one, particularly if they share the same sense of nostalgia for these franchises.</p>

		<p>One of the few notable announcements from the Xbox Tokyo Game Show stream was the reveal of Threads of Time, a time-travelling JRPG that is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Threads of Time | Announce Trailer EN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRMgzkwumfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A time-skipping adventure, Threads of Time will take players from the prehistoric land of dinosaurs (where humans and dinos coexist like it’s The Flintstones) through to the far future. The Watcher of Time guides you through these disparate ages, as you look to assemble a team to restore the Order of the Time Knights, hoping to foil a plot that threatens the fabric of time itself.</p>

<p>Threads of Time takes liberal inspiration from classics of the JRPG genre –&nbsp;most specifically Chrono Trigger – in particular with the visual stylings that feature a 2.5D pixel art style not too far removed from Square Enix’s HD-2D games, though arguably with even more cinematic flair. It’s leaning on Unreal Engine 5 to achieve this.</p>

<p>The turn-based combat has a focus on building up combos, forcing you to think a bit more strategically as you face off against such enemies as Fenrir, the wolf of legends, and Ruin, a massive robotic behemoth in the far future.</p>
<p>It looks really interesting and is a game we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on. Threads of Time is in development at Riyo Games, with Humble Games set to publish.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-has-no-trouble-pushing-120-fps-gameplay-even-without-optimization-and-pssr-%E2%80%93-rumor.992940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-120-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will apparently have little trouble running games at 120 FPS, according to a new report.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, host Tom confirmed to have been sent footage of a game running on PlayStation 5 Pro from an unnamed developer. This game ran with dynamic resolution averaging 1440p resolution, going as high as 1600p and as low as 1300p, at around 50 FPS, but unlocking the framerate brought the average framerate up to 100 FPS and above, without any sort of PS5 Pro optimization. With more work and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, the developer felt confident they would have the game running at 1440p, 1600p resolution, and locked 120 FPS, which is definitely impressive for a console. The developer is also gearing to test out 4K@60 FPS resolution, which they feel confident they can achieve.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro 120Hz Leak, Intel Lunar Lake Review, Nintendo Switch 2, AMD Zen 5 Strix | Broken Silicon 276" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZu-Nz3mmgo?start=3031&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the PlayStation 5 Pro reveal, Sony allowed several outlets to check out the system. Among them was Digital Foundry, who outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-digital-foundry-hands-on-delivers-first-impression-on-pssr-ray-tracing-improvements-and-more/">yesterday</a> the improvements for many different titles, highlighting how, in many ways, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> is the poster child for the console, mostly due to the poor image quality the game sports on the base model in Performance Mode.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th, 2024, worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-street-fighter-crossover-announced.992937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fatal-fury-city-of-wolves-street-fighter-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SNK has announced that two&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters are making their way into the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>, which is currently due to launch in spring.</p>
<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/SNKPofficial/status/1839263065369620722" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em>'s iconic characters Ken and Chun-Li will make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>City of the Wolves</em>. I guess this is SNK returning the favor to Capcom after <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1839077427617661290" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Terry Bogard was featured</a> in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is still some way from being released, SNK doesn't give much away about exactly how Ken and Chun-Li will play in the game, but I'm guessing they'll be pretty similar to the way they appear in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-street-fighter-crossover-combat.jpg?itok=n3b7ksGc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-street-fighter-crossover-combat.jpg?itok=HXd5loBW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is getting two&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether this is the full extent of the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>crossover, or whether more&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters will arrive via DLC, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>We also don't know whether&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>will make reference to the conclusion of Terry Bogard's story in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, whereupon he battles Ken as his final opponent. The two have an ongoing rivalry in crossover series&nbsp;<em>Capcom vs. SNK</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>crossover right here. It doesn't give a whole lot away, though.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is, it's the first new mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>series of fighting games since 1999's&nbsp;<em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em>.</p>
<p>Although it constitutes a revival of the franchise, characters from&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>have made appearances in other games, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, as well as spinoff series&nbsp;<em>The King of Fighters</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-king-of-fighters-xv-dlc-hinako-shijo">still going strong</a>.</p>
<p><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is currently scheduled for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2492040/FATAL_FURY_City_of_the_Wolves/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009499" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves/9p9m35wvgck9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 24th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How do you follow up on some of the most critically acclaimed games of the past decade? Many thought that Nintendo couldn’t surpass the sheer open-world wonder and physics toy-box creativity that made <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild such a revelation</em>. However, Nintendo seemed to do just that with <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, introducing a host of new ways for players to interact with the world and expanding the already vast realm of Hyrule both into the skies above and into the depths below, arguably improving so much on its extraordinary predecessor as to make it obsolete.</p><p>In between those two games, we also got <em>Link’s Awakening,</em> a 2019 remake of a classic Game Boy adventure that replaced the original’s pixel art with toy-like and dioramic visuals, trying to recreate the retro feel for a modern age. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> takes that same charming art direction and applies it to a completely original story featuring our beloved Hyrule princess, Zelda. It also attempts to combine the player-driven creativity and problem-solving from both <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>with classic top-down <em>Zelda</em> gameplay, and it works! Mostly.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s story finds Hyrule threatened by dark rifts engulfing the land, trapping its inhabitants, including our usual green-tunic-wearing hero Link, in a frozen time-space continuum. Zelda, with her fairy-like companion Tri, set out to dispel these rifts and set those trapped free. With Link himself imprisoned in one of these rifts, it falls to Zelda, in a first for a mainline game in the franchise, to rescue the land herself.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-recommend-id="image://42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-recommend-id="image://42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The main difference between playing as Zelda and stepping back into Link’s boots is that she doesn’t fight enemies directly with your typical sword and shield, at least most of the time. With Tri’s magic, Zelda is able to create “echoes,” which are clones of items and monsters she’s encountered throughout Hyrule. She can summon things like beds, tables, and chairs, but also creatures like electric-force-field-inducing blobs and goblins with spears (or moblins, in the Hyrule parlance). This is where <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s freeform creativity comes into play.<br></p><p>When traversing the game’s dungeons and puzzles, my go-to strategy was always to stack beds on top of each other, forming a makeshift bridge to cross wide gaps. It was similar to a strategy I used in <em>Tears of the Kingdom,</em> where I would just stick logs together to make a bridge. While this frequently helped me in the early game, I eventually had to think more creatively in later dungeons. For example, when gaps were too wide for my bed bridge, I stood at the edge of my incomplete creation and also used an echo that, when picked up, blew a windstream opposite of Zelda’s direction that propelled her far enough to reach the other side. When your solutions actually end up working, there’s a huge sense of accomplishment, and <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> provides those feelings in spades, making you feel satisfied and confident throughout.<br></p><p>When <em>Echoes </em>begins, Tri’s magic is limited so there’s a hard cap on how many echoes you can have out at a time. But the game’s progression system feels quite natural; as Tri becomes more capable, she and Zelda clear more rifts throughout the story and the cap increases, allowing Zelda to summon more echoes at once.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> feels something like a puzzle game, reminiscent of those older series entries that had intricately constructed dungeons you had to not just fight your way through but to solve, and in this game, you can progress through them with her echoes, which almost act as the key, traversal-aiding items that you’d otherwise obtain in games past.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-recommend-id="image://9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-recommend-id="image://9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To further maintain that classic <em>Zelda</em> feel, our intrepid heroine has limited access to Link’s iconic swordfighter repertoire. For a limited time, she can enter a “swordsman mode” that lets her swing a sword, shoot arrows, and throw bombs, all of the things Link could do when he was the protagonist. At times, this felt like a concession to longtime Zelda players who just want to return to Link’s gameplay. In the context of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s mechanics, it feels quite overpowered, even if it’s only active until Zelda’s energy meter runs out. Part of Zelda’s fighting style involves using the echoes to do the dirty work for her. That means risking your bomb-making fish echo being destroyed by an enemy before it can go off. The swordfighter mode essentially becomes like a “press to win” button because Zelda can just spam bombs. Additionally, Zelda can continually down smoothies that she can make with various ingredients throughout Hyrule to recharge her energy meter. This method effectively lets her enter and stay in swordfighter mode more frequently and for longer. As a result, this unfortunately ends up trivializing most of Zelda’s arsenal of echoes, as swordfighter mode makes quick work of even bosses.<br></p><p>Combat is at its best when you rely on echoes, and finding new echoes is half the fun of actually using them. Every time I defeated a new enemy, I was excited to scan them and create echoes of them. It felt like I was playing <em>Pokémon</em>, trying to collect as many as I could. However, that leads me into <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s most prominent issue: echo management.<br></p><p>There are dozens upon dozens of these echoes, and it’s a total pain in the butt to cycle through your entire list of all of them while looking for the particular one you need for your particular situation. There are some helpful sorting tools, such as being able to organize by your most recently used or the latest one you acquired, but I wish the game allowed you to manually organize your collection of echoes.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-recommend-id="image://0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-recommend-id="image://0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Exploration also plays a huge role in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. The map looks a lot like that of <em>A Link to the Past</em>, feeling like a sort of homage to the franchise’s past. The game is surprisingly long as well, taking about 25-30 hours to just complete the main story. It’s filled with dozens of side quests and optional dungeons. Some of these side quests are quick and easy, like finding and killing a monster that has the ability to summon rain and showing it to a local townsperson, or searching for missing chickens scattered throughout a town and putting them back into a farm. Others, meanwhile, are quite elaborate, including a multi-step one in which you’re eventually rewarded with the powerful ability to build robots that have humongous AOE attacks. They’re a huge boon, especially in boss fights.<br></p><p>I felt like the rewards you get for completing side quests are much more worthwhile than in most role-playing games. While you’ll probably just earn more rupees to spend at shops, you’re also likely to encounter a new echo along the way that could prove helpful later on. In fact, some of the most useful echoes are stowed away in optional dungeons, which makes exploration even more rewarding. Early on, I came across a giant plant that could propel itself into monsters, constantly dealing damage with its appendages. It was an incredibly powerful echo at that point in the game, and let me steamroll many of the early game bosses.<br></p><p>While exploration is fun and rewarding, I do wish Zelda’s running speed was faster. She runs abysmally slow and it’s incredibly frustrating. She has a little spin move that doesn’t do any damage, but when combined with running, actually makes her move much more quickly than her usual sprint. So I was constantly mashing the right bumper button while moving to break into a makeshift spin-dash whenever I was running out in the wild.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> successfully combines the feel of earlier <em>Zelda</em> games with the new creative direction that the modern entries have been going in. By fusing the classic key item progression of older Zelda games with the more modern, player-driven problem-solving of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> creates something both familiar, yet distinct from every other game in the series so far. Also, our long-suffering Hyrulian princess finally gets some time in the spotlight, and that is a welcome change of pace.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-workers-encouraged-to-strike-over-return-to-office-mandate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Employees at Ubisoft’s French offices are being urged to strike over the company’s recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-mandating-3-days-in-office-for-all-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global return to office mandate</a>.</p>



<p>STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo) made calls for a strike over a <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three-day period in October</a>. According to the union, the decision to mandate a return to office policy without “any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers’ representatives.”</p>



<p>“After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions,” the union’s statement reads. “Our employer knows this perfectly well.&nbsp;The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues’ jobs, the disorganization of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain.”</p>



<p>As far as what they are looking for, STJV says its demands are clear. They want a “formal agreement on remote work” as well as an increase in all salaries to “compensate for the drop in our living standards in recent years”. Lastly, they say they want to company to implement true “social dialogue” instead of a system where “management seems indeed to confuse monologue with dialogue”.</p>



<p>STJV is asking for all France-based employees to strike from October 15-17.</p>



<p>The calls for a strike come while Ubisoft is facing its most tumultuous time in recent history. The company announced on Wednesday that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> until February while also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealing an investigation and review</a> of the company was set to take place. On top of that, its stock prices have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fallen to 11-year lows</a> due to changes in financial targets for the year.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you make of Ubisoft employees being encouraged to strike in October? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/505/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <p>Threads of Time is a newly revealed retro style RPG described as a spiritual successor to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p>
<p>The game was shown today by Xbox at the Tokyo Game Show, and is being developed by Canadian studio Riyo Games.</p>
<p>This is the studio's first game, though its developers have experience from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, and Tomb Raider. What's more, development has been aided by "legendary developers and composers" from the Xenoblade Chronicles and Mana series.</p>

<p>As you can see from the above trailer, it features a gorgeous 2.5D style that blends pixel characters with 3D effects, classic turn-based battles, and is heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger with its time travelling plot.</p>
<p>It begins in prehistory with battles against dinosaurs, but also includes a dystopian cyberpunk city, an apocalyptic future, and a fantastical past of airships and magical creatures.</p>
<p>If all this sounds familiar, it certainly has shades of Sea of Stars from developer Sabotage Studios - also based in Canada. That game was similarly a love letter to Chrono Trigger and had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/composing-nostalgia-how-sea-of-stars-revisits-the-past-through-music">music from that game's original composer Yasunori Mitsuda</a>.</p>
<p>The release date for Threads of Time is yet to be revealed, but it's set to launch on Steam and consoles (including Xbox), and is available to wishlist now.</p>
<p>Until then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-free-carnival-themed-dlc-throes-of-the-watchmaker-revealed">Sea of Stars will receive free carnival-themed DLC</a> Throes of the Watchmaker in Spring next year.</p>
<p>What's more, Xbox also announced a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Square Enix games are now available Xbox consoles</a>, including the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Square Enix has brought eight of its remade and remastered Mana series and Final Fantasy classics to Xbox, strengthening their ties with Microsoft and their commitment to future cross-platform game launches. All eight games are available today, with some also on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The eight games are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy I – VI Pixel Remaster</li>
<li>Trials of Mana (2020 3D remake)</li>
<li>Legend of Mana (2021 remaster)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trials of Mana and Legend of Mana are both being added to Xbox Game Pass today, as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster | TGS Xbox Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rgISfgAxEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Available as a bundle or individually, the Final Fantasy I – VI Pixel Remaster series was first released through 2021 and 2022 for PC and mobile, retaining the graphics of the original releases but bringing some solid enhancements and quality of life improvements along the way – though it’s also fair to say that not everything was perfected, such as <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11522-how-to-fix-that-awful-font-in-the-final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-games-on-pc">an odd font choice</a>. They then arrived for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch in 2023, and it’s great to have them on Xbox in 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legend of Mana | Xbox Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8CKJYTD-XY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The same can be said of having more of the Mana series on Xbox, as well. Legend of Mana is another pixel graphics remaster that brings the 1999 game to modern platforms, while Trials of Mana was giving a full 3D remake treatment in 2020.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Trials of Mana | Xbox Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/noste-L_SoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/22/trials-of-mana-remake-review/">Trials of Mana remake review</a>, Miguel said, “Trials of Mana is an exciting new step for the Mana series, breathing new, fully 3D life into a SNES classic that was left inaccessible to English fans for decades. The inventive and memorable story of the original game blends perfectly with the flashy new real-time combat system, and while muddy textures and a lack of co-op prove to somewhat sour the experience, this is still a stellar action RPG remake that anyone can get a kick out of.”</p>
<p>Well worth checking out, in other words.</p>

			<p>As per the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-rumors-intensify-ahead-of-tgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a>, Square Enix has indeed announced some new Xbox ports during the Tokyo Game Show 2024 broadcast. However, they're all for old games. Anyway, nearly all of them are available today on Xbox, and some are included with the Game Pass subscription.</p>
<p>To start with, Square Enix has ported the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-series-sales-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters</a>, which include all mainline games from the first installment to the sixth. Here's an overview of some of the improvements in these remasters:</p>
<p><em>New pixel art optimized for HD displays, rearranged soundtracks, and several quality-of-life features, including multiple font options, the ability to switch back to the old soundtracks, the ability to boost experience gains for faster leveling, turn off random enemy encounters, and even auto-battle.</em></p>
<p>Trials of Mana and Legend of Mana are also out today on Xbox and included with Game Pass. Trials of Mana launched nearly four and a half years ago, with the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/trials-of-mana-from-snes-to-switch-this-sword-still-shines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning an 8.5/10 score on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Even if you already know the story beats by heart and can recite the optimal path to beat all eight Benevodons by heart, Trials of Mana still feels refreshing enough to be considered a brand new game. If you've already paid off your Nook loans and are itching for a new single player RPG to enjoy at home, Trials of Mana is a modern classic worth considering.</em></p>
<p>Legend of Mana is a remaster of the 1999 game that originally launched on the first PlayStation console. Lastly, Square Enix confirmed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gamescom-hands-on-pixel-excellence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D REMAKE</a> will launch on Xbox Series S|X on November 14 in addition to the previously announced platforms.</p>
<p>However, it's hard not to be disappointed with today's news. Not only did Square Enix not announce Final Fantasy XVI, they didn't even port the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visions-of-mana-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Mana</a> game. Of course, these ports could still be announced at a later date, but for now, Xbox fans will probably still feel like second-class users.</p>

                <p>Xbox's presentation for Tokyo Game Show included a number of Game Pass announcements, headlined by the news that StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2 will be coming to the subscription service later this year. Four games were also newly added to Game Pass today, and more are in line for day one Game Pass releases. Here's everything new for Game Pass from TGS 2024.</p><p>Xbox's biggest Game Pass announcement for 2024 was that StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2 will be added to PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate on November 5 this year. The announcement was delivered by Xbox CEO Phil Spencer himself, who wore a StarCraft t-shirt to deliver the news.</p>

<p>The StarCraft games are iconic for their impact on the RTS genre - the series began in 1998 and has become hugely successful.</p>
<p>As explained in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/26/starcraft-game-pass/">Xbox Wire post</a> for the news, StarCraft was instrumental in the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, for example.</p>
<p>"When the beta was finally released, a lot of people started streaming it on Justin.tv and I got hooked watching," one of the co-founders of Twitch told Xbox. "Since we were trying to figure out what the next move for Justin.tv was, I began wondering if it would be possible to just focus on gaming content. That’s how StarCraft II was the first impetus for Twitch."</p>
<p>The news was announced by Xbox at this year's Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>Later in the presentation, president of Xbox Sarah Bond announced a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Square Enix games are now available on Xbox</a>, including the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-and-unforgotten-echoes-story-dlc-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-and-unforgotten-echoes-story-dlc-hands-on-preview.992847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-and-unforgotten-echoes-story-dlc-hands-on-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Somehow, Heihachi Mishima has returned. No veteran to throwing members of the Mishima family into volcanoes, Bandai Namco and Katsuhiro Harada have made a big show about Heihachi having finally died after being thrown into one himself following a staggering loss to his son Kazuya. Much like the stock price of NVIDIA this week, he just can’t stay down for long. We recently got a sneak peek at the fighter’s new story chapters and got to take the Mishima family head for our spin ourselves with a recent hands-on with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/">Tekken 8</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a candid chat with Michael Murray between rounds, he confirmed that Heihachi will not receive a Character Episode, as the Unforgotten Echoes story content serves the purpose of giving Heihachi a narrative all his own. Those who may have wanted a more light-hearted take on the Tekken Zaibatsu’s former head will sadly have to make do with a bit of creative dress-up and some fun in the sun with Tekken Ball.</span></p>
<p><span>Bandai Namco permitted us to see through the entire narrative of Unforgotten Echoes but limited what we could showcase and talk about to the first five chapters of the narrative. The narrative largely jumps around between a few key players of the Tekken Force, namely Jin Kazama and the current Prime Minister of Poland in the Tekken universe, Lidia Sobieska. Suppose you didn’t have the opportunity to purchase the additional character DLC that added Eddy Gordo and Lidia to the roster already, this will allow players to try these characters out for free as part of the story DLC. At only a couple of hours' run time, it's more of a brief appetizer to bringing Tekken's big bad into the center stage again while leaving Yoshimitsu on the sidelines once more.</span></p>
<p><span>After a series of mandatory battles and reuniting some of the cast together, Tekken 8 Unforgotten Echoes rapidly brings players back face to face with Heihachi Mishima, a man who’s a mere shell of his former self. As Lidia, Yoshimitsu, and Eddy are brought together, they’re introduced to a sect of Tekken Monks secretly training in the forest for reasons best left for the player to discover. Among these monks, the most powerful of which are named after the four guardian spirits that protect Kyoto. If you’ve experienced some sort of Japanese mythology, chances are you’re at least remotely familiar with Genbu, Seiryu, et cetera. Heihachi Mishima has passively aligned himself with these monks as a much more meek version of himself, perhaps attributed to a bout of amnesia or perhaps regret towards seeing his sons routinely chucked into an active volcano time and time again. Heihachi has really let his hair down this time around and I couldn’t help but take note that he seemed to be taking a liking to Hulk Hogan’s hairstyle in his later years.</span></p>
<p><span>The ole Iron Hand wielder himself comes with a few new tricks up his sleeve when it comes to bringing him out in versus combat. He’ll also come out swinging with a new stage, Genmaji Temple, based on the secluded training grounds of the Tekken Monks, which features a nighttime variant with complementary mood lighting. As part of Heihachi’s new suite of abilities, the time spent training with the Tekken Monks has also unlocked some spicy tech to add to his already intimidating bag of tricks.</span></p>
<p><span>New for the godfather of Tekken are a complimentary pair of stances: Wind God and Thunder God. Each can be linked into as part of certain combos and augment his already impressive moveset with some additional tools. Heihachi has also been granted a unique powered-up state known as the Warrior Instinct that increases the amount of damage he can deal to gray damage, or Recoverable Damage along with changing up the properties on select moves. This comes with a trade-off with only being able to be activated after going into Heat mode three times in a match, so this may be the trump card players might need to come back like a level-3 X-Factor. If reliably pulling off an Electric Wind God Fist is something that’s still outside of your muscle memory, hitting it in Warrior Instinct might even eliminate the need for frame-perfect execution.</span></p>

<p><span>I’m still on the fence about Heihachi Mishima’s return to the Tekken 8 roster, as I thought it was a bold move to finally kill off one of the series’ most infamous antagonists after so long, but I have to respect the way that Tekken 8: Unforgotten Echoes was able to bring the figurehead back in a way to feels deliberate as part of the greater story and giving him a side that’s more than just pure chaos. On the other hand, I’m not looking forward to eating another axe kick to the face after taking so many of them over the decades.</span></p>
<p><span>Heihachi Mishima will come to Tekken 8 on September 30th if you have the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8-playable-character-year-1-pass/9PKZ04TN37M8">Playable Character Year 1 Pass</a>. Otherwise, he will be available on October 3rd for purchase. If the pricing for Lidia and Eddy still holds true, Heihachi Mishima will be available as a standalone DLC character for $7.99. The new Unforgotten Echoes story expansion will be a free part of the Version 1.08 update for all players, allowing players to go hands-on with Heihachi, Lidia, and others while also bringing in a few new features including a customizable main menu to change up your favorite fighter on display.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft’s fall has continued in a new historical way on Thursday. The first day of trading since announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed</a> until February 2025 has seen Ubisoft stock prices on the London Stock Exchange fall to an 11-year low.</p>



<p>As of writing, Ubisoft stock prices sit at <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview">€9.28 per share.</a> It’s the first time since November 2014 that shares have fallen under €10. The current trading price represents a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-new-52-week-low-amid-company-turmoil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">near-20% fall of yesterday’s decade-low</a> price.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To add to the bad news, Ubisoft’s market cap sits at just about €1.27 billion. Just over three weeks ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/">it was at €1.99 billion</a>. </p>



<p>Trading in the US hasn’t open as of publishing, but closed on Wednesday night at just $2.25 per share. If the London market is any indication, a drop in the US could also be expected.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Ubisoft announced not only the aforementioned delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but multiple disappointing updates for investors. It had <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lowered it’s financial targets</a> for the second quarter of FY2025 and the remainder of the year, confirmed that Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underperformed financially</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened an investigation</a> into the company.</p>



<p>The company has promised more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-developers-promise-to-continue-to-improve-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates and improvements</a> to Star Wars Outlaws after the lukewarm launch. It also announced that Ubisoft games will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-will-release-games-on-steam-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return to having Day One releases</a> on Steam with Assassin’ Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>As far as if those changes are good enough for investors and players to turn things around, that remains to be seen. Based on the initial response from the market, it doesn’t look good enough just yet.</p>

<p>As announced today by Microsoft at the Tokyo Game Show, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/trials-of-mana">Trials of Mana</a>, Legend of Mana and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are all available today across Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>

<p>While the two Mana games are available on Game Pass, the Final Fantasy games are not. The forthcoming Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake is also coming to Xbox, but not Game Pass.</p>
<p>The Pixel Remasters include the first six Final Fantasy games, remastered to HD standards and with fresh musical orchestrations.</p>
<p>Trials of Mana is a 2020 remake of the 1995 SNES game of the same name, while Legend of Mana was originally released in 1999 for the PlayStation. It was previously rumoured the latest release, Visions of Mana, would be coming to Game Pass, but this was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-not-coming-to-game-pass-xbox-confirms">denied by Xbox</a>.</p>
<p>More details are available on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/26/square-enix-classic-rpgs-final-fantasy-mana-dragon-quest-3/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix stated it was "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>, which would include Xbox. It's part of a move to "diversify earnings opportunities".</p>
<p>At the same time, though only recently made public, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">admitted profits for Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth "did not meet expectations"</a>, but there's no news yet on whether these games will also make the jump to Xbox.</p>
<p>These aren't the only Square Enix games arriving on other platforms, though.</p>
<p>Announced yesterday, tactical RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/triangle-strategy">Triangle Strategy</a> is heading to Meta Quest VR headsets on 31st October. It will bring a new perspective on the isometric game, allowing the camera to be freely moved and units and move selected directly using VR controllers.</p>

<p>At <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-to-further-deepen-the-relationship-with-xbox-gamers-says-final-fantasy-14s-naoki-yoshida">Eurogamer spoke with Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki Yoshida</a> about bringing more Square Enix games to Xbox following the success of the MMORPG.</p>
<p>"So now we are moving towards the policy of releasing our games on a multiplatform basis, and we really want as many players as possible to play our titles," he said. "So with Final Fantasy 14 as the starting point, we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox. So I hope players will look forward to future things to come on the platform."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bethesda has removed the freshly-returned Thatcher's Techbase Doom mod once again - despite its creator having cheekily scrubbed it of all political references.
</p>
<p>
The publisher of Doom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-yanks-thatchers-techbase-doom-mod-from-in-game-browser">previously pulled the mod</a>, which satirises the late and highly-controversial British prime minister, for the inclusion of "real-world politics".
</p>
<p>
But this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thatchers-techbase-doom-mod-returns-in-a-blaze-of-politics-free-malicious-compliance">the mod returned in a blaze of malicious compliance</a>, retitled  ███████'█ Techbase and now with images of Thatcher covered over. The game's soundtrack was even changed from minor to major key. Alas, its return did not last long.
</p>
<p>
"Bad news everyone," Thatcher's Techbase mod creator Jim wrote on X last night, posting an image of Bethesda's latest message to him via its customer support.
</p>
<p>
"This mod has been reported one or more times for a Code of Conduct violation," Bethesda's message stated, claiming that the mod maker had still included "real-world politics" and was now "deliberately disobeying a Zenimax employee".
</p>
<p>"[The mod] has been removed. As a result, this account is receiving an official warning," Bethesda continued, with all the humour of a Conservative party political broadcast.</p>
<p>
"Further violations of any part of our Terms of Service may result in a temporary suspension or even a permanent deactivation of your account."

This seems to be the end of the road for Thatcher's Techbase - er,  ███████'█ Techbase. That said, the <a href="https://thatchers-techbase.github.io/get-original.html">original version remains available to play on PC</a> through the usual, non-Bethesda channels.

			<p>Earth Defense Force is quite possibly my favourite series of all time. I know that sounds like I’m going for a bit, but I’m really not. While I love the high-quality offerings of series like Zelda and Final Fantasy, I find they don’t always hit the spot. Tears of the Kingdom left me unenthused, and honestly, Final Fantasy hasn’t landed for me for a few years now too. EDF, on the other hand, understand the assignment every time, and Earth Defense Force: World Brothers 2 is the second cutesy take on the series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earth Defense Force: World Brothers 2 - Launch Trailer Nintendo Switch/PS5/PS4/PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52QB-0NKNeU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>World Brothers 2 is the follow-up to the voxel spinoff that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/edf-world-brothers-review-earth-defense-force/">came out back in 2021</a>, and it just sort of feels like more of the same. You’re a person, there are things to shoot, and you get bigger things to shoot with as enemies get bigger too. The main difference is that it doesn’t feel quite as culturally insensitive so far, although I’ve somehow not unlocked all of the characters yet, because there are hundreds.</p>


<p>The core concept is the same as before, you get voxel characters who represent characters from across the series, or nationalities from across the world. That means alongside the Air Raider from EDF 6, you’ve also got characters like Yodel Sister and Viking Brother. It’s innately silly, and the cutesy art style brings with it a substantially lower difficulty as well. It makes for a good game for younger gamers, and that’s clear to see throughout. It’s why the controls are so simple, and the combat is so forgiving, and I don’t begrudge that, even though I like just a touch or two of complexity.</p>


<p>With that in mind, the game succeeds in what it’s trying to do. The weapon choices are much more limited, because every class has its specific weapon it does best with, and while you can change things up, you never need to until the hard difficulty. You also get to control a full team of four, which means you can mix and match as you please. This usually means you’ll have a Wing Diver on your team, because they can fly and it’s so fast, but other than that, the sky’s the limit.</p>
<p>It’s all good fun, but it’s just so… beige. Not the colours, of course, but the flavour of the whole thing. I didn’t leave any moment thinking “Wow, this is incredible.” Instead, it’s just pushing through levels for the sake of it, collecting new characters because they’re there. It’s definitely a lot more entertaining in multiplayer, and I still love the idea that this is some weird multiversal event, but it just doesn’t feel like anything’s really at stake, even when the story is telling you otherwise.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the biggest sin that World Brothers 2 commits is coming out so soon after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/earth-defense-force-6-review/">Earth Defense Force 6</a>, which is not only the best the series has ever been by a fairly large margin, but also manages to be one of the best games about time travel around.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		As with the original, Earth Defense Force: World Brothers 2 is a simplified and cutesy take on the whole EDF think. While it succeeds in that goal, it loses a lot of the allure as it does so.	</p></div>
