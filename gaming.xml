<p>Warhorse Studios, the creator of the Kingdom Come franchise, has revealed that the second game in the critically-acclaimed series is <strong>free to play </strong>this weekend, exclusively on Xbox. Earlier this year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and many believe it’s lining up for several Game of the Year awards.</p>



<p>It’s the twilight period for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, with the game’s final DLC dropping soon, bringing an end to years of development and evolution. If you’ve never played the ambitious open-world epic, now is the time.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-free-this-weekend">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is Free This Weekend</h2>



<p>If you own an Xbox Series X or an Xbox Series S console, you can play Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for free this weekend. It’s a no-strings-attached kind of deal, and it’s set to run hand-in-hand with one of the biggest discounts ever applied to the game.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we published our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review</a>, dubbing the game a ‘monumental medieval masterpiece’. It was years in the making, borne of a Kickstarter campaign that began more than a decade ago.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The free play window for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is set to run from November 6 (yesterday) to November 10, giving you plenty of time to soak up all that the stellar title has to offer.</p>



<p>It won’t be enough, though. That’s why the massive discount has been arranged, so if you want to keep up your adventures with Henry of Skalitz, you can do so by purchasing the game at the lowest price it has ever boasted.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 this weekend.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-devs-tricks-up-sleeve-cheaters/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-devs-have-%E2%80%98tricks-up-their-sleeve%E2%80%99-to-combat-cheaters.1346602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, revealed that extra effort is being applied to take care of cheaters when 1.0 is released later this month. As one of the biggest concerns around, fans are worried that cheaters will negatively impact the game’s launch, which has been building for <strong>a decade</strong>.</p>



<p>Buyanov has explained that years of ‘hatred’ haven’t prevented a ‘huge department’ from working ‘day and night’ to produce new methods to combat cheaters in the spearhead extraction shooter game.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheaters-be-damned-in-escape-from-tarkov">Cheaters Be Damned in Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/1-0-steam-cheating-measures-battlestate-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a>, Nikita Buyanov, the prolific leader of Battlestate Games, explained how the company has ‘a few tricks up our sleeve for the release’ of Escape from Tarkov. This is in reference to combating the cheaters that have plagued the game for years, causing one of the most consistent issues around.</p>



<p>It’s one of the reasons why so many players have turned to PvE over the last year and a half, removing other players from their experience and eradicating the concern of cheating.</p>



<p>Buyanov explained how the studio has remained stalwart despite years of criticism:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is truly unfortunate and somewhat upsetting to read all kinds of comments over the years and navigate through waves of hatred, as if we are not doing anything.</p>



<p>We have a huge department working on this, banning players day and night and coming up with new methods. But it’s impossible to change the players’ opinions. And that can be depressing at times. To be honest, to some extent, this emotional background is very discouraging and frustrating. But we’re used to it. It’s a never-ending race, and we’ve never given up and don’t intend to give up.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-rewards-revealed-pre-order/">revealed the rewards</a> coming to all Escape from Tarkov owners when the game goes live on November 15. There’s a pack incoming, including exclusive outfits, dogtag models, hideout customization elements, and more.</p>



<p>Also on November 15, Escape from Tarkov will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-i-need-to-buy-escape-from-tarkov-steam-again/">released on Steam</a>, marking the first time that the game has been available outside Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher.</p>



<p>Do you believe that cheaters will be taken care of when Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release is here? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-dev-counter-claims-leaking/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fired-rockstar-dev-makes-counter-claims-about-%E2%80%98leaking%E2%80%99-dismissal-case.1346590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on GTA Forums that was later verified by the site’s admins, a former Rockstar Games employee divulged information about the recent controversy that saw more than 30 employees suddenly dismissed from the company. In the words of Rockstar, they were fired for leaking game information in a Discord server, but that might not be the case.</p>



<p>As the user posted, nobody was leaking anything in the private Discord server that contained only Rockstar Games employees, but instead, they were using it to discuss unionization in a bid to encourage change at Rockstar Games for the better.</p>



<p>It has been alleged that Rockstar Games fired these employees for taking part in this activity.</p>



<h2 id="h-former-rockstar-employees-are-lashing-out">Former Rockstar Employees Are Lashing Out</h2>



<p>The lengthy post on <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/#comment-1072605777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the GTA Forums</a> reveals a tale of heartbreak and disappointment at the sudden dismissal of more than 30 Rockstar Games employees in the United Kingdom and Canada.</p>



<p>In the post, the user named ‘Organize’, who joined the forums in June, revealed that Rockstar Games broke several UK employment laws when dismissing staff on grounds of gross misconduct. Many have claimed this was a thinly veiled attempt to bust unionization efforts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of “Hey, are you free for a quick chat?”</p>



<p>Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for “gross misconduct” regarding posts made in Discord.</p>



<p>They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning – “and no other reason”</p>



<p>They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.</p>



<p>For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they’d receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.</p>



<p>These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.</p>



<p>These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.</p>



<p>Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn’t public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.</p>



<p>This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The user revealed that almost enough members had been reached to ‘seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining.’</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they’ll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.</p>



<p>Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we’re next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what’s to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.</p>



<p>Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That’s all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This would have allowed the employees to address key issues in the company: ‘worsening crunch, inadequate pay, and inflexible working arrangements.’ To protest the firing of these Rockstar Games employees, the IWGB union and former employees <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/">marched on Take-Two’s London office</a> yesterday.</p>



<p>In recent Rockstar Games news, Grand Theft Auto 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/">was delayed by several months</a> and will now be released on November 19, 2026, rather than May 26, 2026.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about these claims on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>In a new TikTok ad, it was once again teased that Rogue and Gambit are coming to Marvel Rivals. Fans were quick to spot and screenshot the images, but it became tough to replicate it until a Marvel Rivals leaks page uncovered the ad and confirmed it was real.</p>



<p>Rogue and Gambit would join a roster of more than 40 playable heroes from across the Marvel Universe, and they’re expected to arrive on November 14 when the game’s fifth season goes live.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-rogue-and-gambit-coming-to-marvel-rivals">Are Rogue and Gambit Coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>The imminent arrival of Rogue and Gambit has been teased in recent patch notes, with eagle-eyed players spotting the characters in the background of an image posted by NetEase.</p>



<p>On November 14, the game’s fifth season will drop, and many believe that’s when Rogue and Gambit will surface as the latest new characters.</p>



<p>In a recent TikTok ad, art of the two characters was revealed. It was picked up by Marvel Rivals pages on social media and shared around before <a href="https://xcancel.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1986491569122299996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XOX LEAK confirmed</a> the content’s validity.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans are wondering why NetEase hasn’t dropped the trailer for season five yet, which would undoubtedly reveal the presence of Rogue and Gambit as new playable heroes.</p>



<p>There are rumors that the trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">season five</a> will be released on November 11, revealing everything coming in the supersized update.</p>



<p>In recent news related to the game, one of the most prominent esports organisations in the business <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sentinels-announce-marvel-rivals-esports-exit/">left Marvel Rivals</a> and made quips about how NetEase isn’t effectively supporting the ecosystem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two has been in a sticky spot of late. The company faced a protest yesterday in London as former Rockstar employees unfairly dismissed were joined by union members outside Take-Two’s office in the heart of the United Kingdom. Then, an announcement of another GTA 6 delay caused the company’s stock value to plummet by 10%.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, Strauss Zelnick, confirmed that Borderlands 4 also failed to meet expectations, adding another layer of woe to the Take-Two story this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-didn-t-do-as-well-as-everyone-thought">Borderlands 4 Didn’t Do as Well as Everyone Thought</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed that, while Borderlands 4 had a great launch, it failed to wow with sales figures, and the numbers were ultimately ‘softer’ than the company would have liked.</p>



<p>Here’s the quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The critical acclaim for Borderlands 4 was superb, and we’re really happy with the release.</p>



<p>Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. In terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were <strong>a little softer than we would have liked</strong>. In the fullness of time, we think it’s going to do great.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That means that Zelnick expects Borderlands 4 to keep selling as time goes on, even if the game is already slipping far down the charts in favor of other, more recent titles.</p>



<p>In recent Take-Two news, the publisher found itself in hot water over the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6. While many thought it would be the case, it caused Take-Two’s stock value to drop by around 10%, representative of the shaken faith of investors.</p>



<p>Are you surprised that Borderlands 4 didn’t sell as well as expected? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of the week – congratulations on making it this far! I hope your NYT Connections streak is still looking clean and consistent. I’m here today to support that goal, bringing you today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions, allowing you to solve today’s puzzle in the quickest way possible.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections hints and answers you need for today.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-7">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 7)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #880:</p>



<ul>
<li>HULA HOOP</li>



<li>EGGPLANT</li>



<li>SALSA VERDE</li>



<li>BAGEL</li>



<li>SWING STATE</li>



<li>RELISH</li>



<li>ANIMAL PRINT</li>



<li>POLKA DOT</li>



<li>WASHER</li>



<li>BARNEY THE DINOSAUR</li>



<li>PESTO</li>



<li>HOUNDSTOOTH</li>



<li>INNER TUBE</li>



<li>CHIMICHURRI</li>



<li>HERRINGBONE</li>



<li>PEOPLE EATER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of what you might see on a fashionable coat or a retro couch</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Zesty, herby, and often spooned over grilled meats or sandwiches</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Round and hollow — some edible, some inflatable</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words are feeling kind of purple</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 7.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-7-880">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 7 (#880)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– ANIMAL PRINT, HERRINGBONE, HOUNDSTOOTH, POLKA DOT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CHIMICHURRI, PESTO, RELISH, SALSA VERDE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAGEL, HULA HOOP, INNER TUBE, WASHER</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BARNEY THE DINOSAUR, EGGPLANT, PEOPLE EATER, SWING STATE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Fancy a singing and talking Yoshi?</p>

<p>Nintendo's 'My Mario' campaign has lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e3127119-fdb6-43d2-ad95-e162068ea3df">multiple Yoshi-themed announcements</a> today, and apart from the new app, there'll also be a new singing and talking Yoshi released later this month.</p>
<p>This fluffy Yoshi, available on <strong>18th November 202</strong><strong>5</strong>, is a toy that will flap its arms, sway from side to side, talk and sing. It comes with 13 different voice lines and has two melodies: "Yoshi's Story" and "Yoshi's Song".</p>
<p>When you press the musical note on the bottom of Yoshi's foot, you can swap between the "talking mode" and "melody mode". Here's a look:</p>

<p>Apart from this, there'll also be a plush Yoshi, sitting Yoshi with a blanket, and Yoshi rattle released on the same date. All of these items can be hand-washed, making them easy to clean. And last but not least is a Yoshi board book releasing on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Once again, Nintendo has also announced a new Yoshi Switch and mobile app, as well as more standalone wood block amiibo sets.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/petit-planet-is-like-animal-crossing-meets-the-little-prince.1346548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Petit Planet is not the first to mimic Animal Crossing to some eyebrow-raising degrees, nor will it be the last. Developer HoYoverse doesn't shy away from acknowledging the similarities – a character even balks at the idea of its new planet-owning lead falling into debt for merely having a home – though they don't deny that upgrades <em>will</em> come at a price. In my short time of about five hours with a preview of the closed beta, Petit Planet offered a charming, <em>"The Little Prince"-</em>themed take on Animal Crossing: New Horizons with an emphasis on clear progression and multiplayer. While these are two things some seemed to crave and were left empty in ACNH, the Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail studio may offer an answer – with potential caveats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all I enjoyed about Petit Planet, I started disappointed with its opening on a lackluster character creator. The skin tone range is limited and the hairstyle options are a bummer, though more hair and eye styles and colors for each are available for in-game currency later on. I acknowledge this isn't the final version of Petit Planet, so I'm hoping that'll be the case for a game touting customization that limits its global players to four skintones, with only one looking darker than a light brush with the sun. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Petit Planet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall setup of Petit Planet is that you're joining three anthropomorphic animal members of a company called Loomi Co in developing a fledgling planet and exploring the surrounding galaxy. You get to choose between two with different environments and different starting planets to begin with. I chose the one described as "hot and dry" with golden prairies. As you complete tasks assigned by Mobai, the fill-in for Isabelle and<em> </em>Tom Nook, you're given special water for an equally special tree that serves as the heart and, in a way, control center of your planet. With new levels and upgrades, the playable area takes shape with a multi-level field, larger river, and a beach and ocean. I liked that, after a point, I could take a look at the sorts of upgrades ahead, like a mountain area and new kinds of trees. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The overall setup of Petit Planet is that you're joining three anthropomorphic animal members of a company called Loomi Co in developing a fledgling planet and exploring the surrounding galaxy. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first hour held a death grip on my playtime with confined tutorials and limited space for any sort of exploration or creativity, but it loosened up considerably after that, while still introducing new mechanics. The next three or four hours is where upgrades start getting locked behind daily progression. Not the mobile-game clock countdown kind, but real days similar to ACNH. Since Petit Planet access is tied to logging into a HoYoverse server, you can't force your way forward by changing your device’s clock. That being said, I didn't run out of interesting things to do while needing to wait.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent my time with familiar activities; smacking trees for fruit, catching bugs, picking flowers, smashing rocks for ore, fishing, and, a nice and quite different touch – using shellfish tongs to collect tidepool creatures. Then of course there's crafting and cooking, all the things you'd expect, but with a dash of charm in the starry, round designs and constant, clear direction. Activities that involve tools require strength, or basically energy replenished by consuming fruit or food. Fruit and sources to make food were ample in my playtime, so this wasn't much of a hassle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also enjoyed meeting the three Neighbors I encountered, or Petit Planet's NPC residents who you invite to live on your planet and build relationships with. I especially love that, familiar to HoYoverse's other games, each character has a distinct identity that goes deeper than their aesthetics and catchphrase. Each has background stories, and more information about them and their individual tastes that can be discovered over time. The first two are used as introductions to core mechanics, but I'm excited to see who else I'll run into in space travels. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/beachcombing-1762465176130.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">During my playtime, I unlocked access to a car of my own that let me explore the stars – with limitations. The car runs on earnable and purchasable (with in-game currency) batteries. One lasted me about two or three trips to random Planettes, or tiny planets in a sea of stars that have limited and sometimes unique resources or potential new Neighbors. I found one on these Planettes, and convinced her to move to my larger Planet. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>More than any other game HoYoverse has made, Petit Planet looks intended to grab the attention of young audiences.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other place I was able to travel to was called the Galactic Bazaar, or an online multiplayer hub with two simple mini-games and plenty of spots to sit and chat with other players. More than any other game HoYoverse has made, Petit Planet looks intended to grab the attention of young audiences. The player characters even look like children. Yet when you get to the Galactic Bazaar, you're immediately encouraged to sit and talk with strangers. The in-game text chat didn't seem to have limits on mild expletives I tested. You do <em>have</em> to sit in certain spots in the Galactic Bazaar to chat with others, but as it is, I didn't see any other ways to limit other player interactions in this space I <em>had</em> to visit as part of the main quests. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/fishing-1762465196763.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Safe online spaces for children are another conversation entirely, but I do hope HoYoverse has plans to make sure I'm not invading spaces of younger folks when I just want to play a game like Animal Crossing with my friends. That all being said, the <a href="https://planet.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/detail/159689" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official closed beta test FAQ </u></a> calmed my worries a tad seeing that this beta test is limited to "users aged 18 and above," so I'd like to imagine that more serious safety features beyond blocking others are on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing I'm worried about is pricing: what's going to be the cost to play this free-to-play game? As with any of HoYoverse's games, it seemed there were ample ways to earn the few currencies I saw in-game, but it's hard to see exactly how that'll work in the future. I doubt we'll see HoYoverse relinquish its gacha method of random rewards mixed with a slight chance to get what you want, but it's hard to say if characters, cosmetics, or both will be what they target for this. It's also worth noting I found two different AI chatbots in Petit Planet. One as an on-demand source of in-game help, and another was a barista you can chat with in the Galactic Bazaar. These are easy to dodge if you don't care to use them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/shooting-stars-1762465220458.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All that being said, Petit Planet being an online HoYoverse game is a potential massive strength. Progression has been clear and fun so far, and knowing how HoYoverse has supported its other big games, it's highly probable that we'll see this get plenty of updates, events, and regular quality-of-life support. Mobai mentioned that we don't have a "restaurant yet," and I'm already eyeing cute cosmetics I want to save for and whole furniture sets I want to craft. The data from my playtime will all be wiped, but I still couldn't help but be excited about what the upgrades I've earned will bring to my planet tomorrow.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/petit-planet-is-like-animal-crossing-meets-the-little-prince]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Nintendo kicked off its 'My Mario' campaign for parents and children in August, it also announced a new 'wood block' sets doubling as amiibo were on the way.</p>
<p>It's now revealed <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e3127119-fdb6-43d2-ad95-e162068ea3df">three more wood block sets</a>. This includes standalone three-piece sets for Yoshi, Peach and Luigi. This follows the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-heres-a-closer-look-at-the-super-mario-wood-block-sets-doubling-as-amiibo">a three-piece set for Mario</a> (priced at 2,980 yen) and a 30-piece set including every amiibo &amp; multiple blocks.</p>

<p>Nintendo announced a new 'My Mario' campaign for parents and children in August, which included a whole range of products as well as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-announces-new-hello-mario-app-for-switch-and-mobile-devices">Mario-themed smartphone and Switch app</a>.</p>
<p>In an update, the Japanese firm has now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e3127119-fdb6-43d2-ad95-e162068ea3df">announced a new Yoshi-themed app</a> for Switch and mobile devices. Like the Mario one, children and parents will be able to interact with this particular character's face in all sorts of fun and interactive ways.</p>
<p>The app will be released for free on the Japanese Switch eShop on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>, and will also go live on the App Store and Google Play on the same date. Here's a rough translation about what you can expect, along with another look:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pwoyqj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>"Stretch out Yoshi's tongue to eat items, or have different colored Yoshis appear from eggs. Have fun playing with this mysterious Yoshi, who shows off a variety of expressions.</p>
<p>"After playing for a while, Yoshi will fall asleep. You can't play while he's asleep, so use this as a guide for when your child is resting."</p>

<p>If you didn't test out the original 'Hello, Mario' app, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/feature-nintendos-new-app-reminds-me-of-a-universal-truth-it-feels-good-to-squash-marios-face">we went hands on with it</a> here on Nintendo Life. Here's our own summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the most part, this is an interactive soundboard. Mario's ever-grinning face pops up in the middle of the screen, and you're free to squish and squash it in any way you please, all while he utters the general chorus of "<em>Ooh!</em>", "<em>Haa!</em>", and "<em>Wa-Haa!</em>" with every poke.</p>
<p>"...Nintendo couldn't resist adding a <em>little</em> bit of 'game' to the whole affair. Spinning Mario's face in a circle or firing him through a pipe (also accessed from the menu) brings up a little bubble-popping challenge, where you can tap the bubbles or drag Mario's face into them, each pushing a counter up towards 100. Nothing outside of a small confetti burst happens when you reach triple-digits, but it's <em>just</em> enough to hit every beat in that 3-5-year age bracket"</p>

			<p>EA and Battlefield Studios didn't just deliver a solid multiplayer experience that players know the Battlefield series for in Battlefield 6. Battlefield Studios has also come up with its response to Call of Duty: Warzone with a new free-to-play battle royale mode called Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<p>After years of battle royale modes being extremely popular, there's a lot that should already be second-nature to anyone jumping into Battlefield REDSEC, like keeping track of your ammo, making sure to find armor, and staying with your squad to have the best chance of staying alive.</p>



<p>All of those general tips apply to Battlefield REDSEC, but like any new battle royale worth its salt, it's not just doing the same thing everyone else does without its own unique twists. That's why there are more than a few tips and tricks this guide will go over to help give you an edge when jumping into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-tips-and-tricks-guide">Battlefield REDSEC Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-beware-of-the-circle">Beware of the Circle</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The always-encroaching circle, which is usually a kind of toxic gas in battle royale games, is a staple of the genre, and it's obvious that you should be aware of it and not let yourself get caught in it. That said, many clever battle royale players have discovered ways in which to use the circle's constant encroachment to their advantage, deliberately moving into it to get into a better position on the map, and potentially flank an opposing squad.</p>



<p>You can't do that in REDSEC because you'll just die instead. The circle is absolutely lethal, and you'll die the moment you find yourself caught in it. If you want to use the circle to reposition in your battle royale, then you can find that in Warzone or Apex Legends, but not in REDSEC.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-avoid-contracts">Don't Avoid Contracts</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your goal in REDSEC, like in any battle royale, is to be the last one standing. Surviving to the end is always the number one priority, but you won't survive if you don't take any risks. Completing contracts is a risk, because they push you into different parts of the map and potentially right into another squad's lap, but they're a risk you have to take.</p>



<p>Completing contracts gets you better gear, with rewards that can be vital to your survival without having to run across the map and scavenge for them. You always want to be improving your loadout, and completing contracts is a quick way to do that while also completing challenges for the battle pass and earning XP. You can also, of course, scavenge for gear while completing contracts as you go from one point to another.</p>



<h3 id="h-upgrade-your-pistol">Upgrade Your Pistol</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You won't keep your pistol with you for very long once you drop into a match, but if you plan to start with a hot-drop (choosing to land in a very popular POI with other players all around) you'll probably need to take out at least one of the enemy players in front of you with your pistol.</p>



<p>So it's worth your time to take a few minutes in the menu before you jump into a match and upgrade your pistol with a few attachments. Having a pistol with stats as good as possible could be the difference between winning an opening fight and having to redeploy right away.</p>



<h3 id="h-shakedown-enemies-before-finishing-them-off">Shakedown Enemies Before Finishing Them Off</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is a tip that definitely won't always apply, because it requires you to have the space and time to do it. But if you have those things, then once you've downed an enemy, don't just immediately finish them off.</p>



<p>Stand over them before killing them, and you'll be prompted to 'Shakedown' the enemy player. Doing so will reveal where the rest of that player's team is in the moment, helping you finish off the rest of the squad. Of course, if you've already taken everyone else out, this doesn't apply, but it is a key tactic to remember at the beginning of a firefight, and could be the difference between winning and losing.</p>



<h3 id="h-play-your-role">Play Your Role</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The goal in REDSEC is, first and foremost, to be the last squad standing. So it's understandable if your impulse is to go as an Assault or an Engineer, to take advantage of assault rifles or SMGs, weapon classes that'll help you win firefights in most cases. </p>



<p>That's completely fine, but if you're loading up for a match and you see that everyone else on your squad has the same idea of playing as either Assault to help with infantry fights, or Engineer to help with vehicle takedowns and maintenance, and no one is going Support or Recon, the smart thing to do is to step up and be the one to play either Support or Recon.</p>



<p>Of course, the gear you find on the ground will help determine how effective you can be while playing as any particular class, but that doesn't mean you should all go as one or two classes. Having a diverse squad is another layer of being prepared for anything and everything when you jump into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-waste-your-tanks">Don't Waste Your Tanks</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield REDSEC. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps more valuable than any tier of weapon you can find on the ground in Fort Lyndon when jumping into REDSEC is a Vehicle Card, specifically a tank card. Now, using vehicles in REDSEC is not the same as using them in the regular multiplayer modes in Battlefield 6. They have limited ammo and fuel, so you won't be able to use one for an entire REDSEC match.</p>



<p>So do yourself a favor. If you're lucky enough to get a vehicle card for a tank, don't use it until you're near the very end of the game. Make it your trump card to win the match at the end, and make the most of it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/petit-planet-preview-hoyoverses-foray-into-life-sims</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/petit-planet-preview-hoyoverses-foray-into-life-sims.1346527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse must be intent on dominating all of my free time, what with my crippling <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a> addiction having no end in sight. Add one more game of theirs into my daily schedule with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow"><em>Petit Planet</em></a>, a life simulator in the style of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>. If you know anything about me, it's that I have a&nbsp;<em>long</em>&nbsp;history with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>, so you&nbsp;know&nbsp;I had to check this one out.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;while it&nbsp;shares many similarities with Nintendo's&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>, I soon discovered that&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, via its Closed Beta, has its own unique DNA to help stand out among its competitors. With a beautiful, celestial, space-themed aesthetic and HoYoverse's consistent live service model, I think we might have a hit on our hands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-shooting-star.jpg?itok=QZMgUexQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-shooting-star.jpg?itok=sHzLTWXS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wish upon a shooting star.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Space-Faring Journey Begins in <em>Petit Planet</em></h2>

<p>As a HoYoverse game,&nbsp;it's fair to have some expectations when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet:&nbsp;</em>Namely, gacha as an element. While I can't say for certain whether gacha comes into play later or not (this was a Closed Beta, non-monetized), it doesn't seem to follow the same formula as the company's flagships, such as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/what-is-genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail</a>.</em></p>

<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is a more relaxed, straightforward experience focusing on chill gameplay. I love me a good story, but sometimes I'm not in the mood to get engrossed in&nbsp;a deep narrative.&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;is succinct and to the point, without sacrificing its identity or charm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bugs-petit-planet.jpg?itok=Tf10KLOi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bugs-petit-planet.jpg?itok=oYk-WfPa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dripped out and ready to catch some bugs!</figcaption></figure><p>But first, we make our character. The character creator is limited for now, but I imagine more options will be available in the 1.0 launch; alternatively, you're able to unlock more stuff like hairstyles and such later on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, we're introduced to a group of helpful individuals who will serve as your guides for the time being. Mobai is a tea-loving dog that helps us get our first town up and running, along with a rabbit named Esassani and Glenn. Their personalities are individualized and quirky in a way that you'd expect from HoYoverse games, but they're all very likable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-full-planet.jpg?itok=VPTW1Sik 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-full-planet.jpg?itok=o9oziZ2Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In good time, this might be your town!</figcaption></figure><h2>It's Time for a Move-In</h2>

<p>It's time to move on to our first planet<em>,&nbsp;</em>which serves as the basis for our nice little community we'll eventually make. We get a choice of two planets to start, and I was pleased to find that biomes can actually differ. Like&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, no two planets should be the same, even if they share similar characteristics.</p>

<p>I went for a straightforward, grassy terrain for my planet with some hills and nice open areas. After a gorgeous cutscene involving an RV trip through space, traversing across fire and ice planets, and some water-based ones too, we arrive. Later on, too, I believe we'll be able to explore new galaxies such as this.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-terrain.jpg?itok=hrLjBQol 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-terrain.jpg?itok=PjcSqltf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Terrain ripe and ready for you to make your own!</figcaption></figure><p>It's essentially a blank slate once we land, as Mobai assigns tasks. We're given a bunch of different tools to use and test out as we go through this sort of tutorial, chopping trees, mining rocks, and gathering other resources.</p>

<p>Of course, there's fishing, bug catching, and even shellfish tongs for crustaceans, shrimp, and the like. All of these activities concerning gathering have an energy limit, and that can only be replenished by eating. There seems to be enough fruit on the island, and other food besides, to keep that energy up, but the energy limits helped me remember that this is indeed a live service title.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fishing-petit-planet1.png?itok=Xyj0tiBV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fishing-petit-planet1.png?itok=aZgbKFQw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Gonna grab ya!</figcaption></figure><p>Fishing is simple, following the same principle of throwing your bobber near a fish and waiting for them to bite. For bug catching, slowly walk over to the insect, hold your net, and release to capture it. There are a plethora of species to catch, be it fish, insects, and others, though I wish a few had more of a distinct visual identity -- for now, many creatures looked too similar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of these animals you catch, by the way, can be thrown into a museum called the Omni-Gallery, which starts out humble but eventually becomes its own large building with a shockingly good layout for its aquarium. I have yet to see the insect area, but I'm sure it's just as impressive.</p>

<p>Speaking of buildings, you'll eventually unlock a store much like Tom Nook's, which sells different furniture and clothing daily. Beyond that, we have neighbors' houses and who knows what else, but I'm excited to see what HoYoverse has planned.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-neighbors1.jpg?itok=r8UKAq3D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-neighbors1.jpg?itok=eRvQH7gB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's always good to be neighborly!&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Being Neighborly in&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em></h2>

<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing,&nbsp;</em><em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;is opting for what seems like a smaller pool of possible neighbors, but ones that have more personality and actual stories. That was one complaint many folks had about&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing --&nbsp;</em>everyone follows one of a few cookie-cutter templates -- but that doesn't seem to be the case here.</p>

<p>So far, I've met a few neighbors, all of whom seem to be a part of the tutorial. I assume we'll have an influx of neighbors arrive in due time, and likely enough that each town will feel unique from one another. For now, I got to see Yunguo and Isaki.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-voyage-petit-planet.jpg?itok=tESuEBHu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-voyage-petit-planet.jpg?itok=3v-jGYid 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what you'll find on your voyages?</figcaption></figure><p>Yunguo and Isaki move in soon after your own arrival on the planet. You're able to pick out their house locations and all that, which is great. Soon, I had my own little community going, with Yunguo and Isaki wandering around the island and giving me various tasks.</p>

<p>Yunguo, for instance, is a farmer and helped me get acquainted with farming mechanics. You're able to grow your own food and such, which is another chill task to keep you occupied. Isaki is a cute little fox with a bit of a beetle obsession. Regardless, both have their own storylines, plus you can give them gifts or just chit-chat with them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dorjelang.jpg?itok=kn--7xKd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dorjelang.jpg?itok=l2IclvHw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Looks like Dorjelang wants to mooove in, get it?</figcaption></figure><p>One other villager I met, Dorjelang, I was able to recruit later on via a Star Voyage, which allowed me to explore a sea of stars. Here, we can find different islands with valuable resources and even find new neighbors. Dorjelang was one such neighbor, and after a bit of talking, I got him to visit town.</p>

<p>A bit more talking with Dorjelang, and I find he's a hatmaker. Sure, let's add him to the town. So eventually he moves in, and now my planet is feeling even more lively!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-mushroom-furniture1.jpg?itok=hgRpg0VX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-mushroom-furniture1.jpg?itok=7GavlmCw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm digging this mushroom aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><h2>Quality of Life Features in&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em></h2>

<p><em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;brings forth a lot of quality-of-life improvements to the&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>formula. UI is snappy and quick to use, so if you're looking for an item, inventory management isn't a hassle. The inventory seems bottomless, but if you're looking for something specific, there's a sort function to find things more easily.</p>

<p>Rearranging buildings, like neighbors' houses or the Omni-Gallery, is also a speedy process. Using the Planet Maker app on the in-game phone gives us a grid layout of our planet, and from there, I was able to rearrange buildings to my heart's content. This also allows us to place items on the ground just as easily, so the process really couldn't be any simpler.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I haven't gotten to the point of terraforming my planet, but I assume that's a feature that'll be unlocked in the future. For the time being, I swiftly unlocked the ability to paint pathways and such with a paint roller item, so I suspect it's only a matter of time until I can alter my coastline, make elevated areas, and the like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-sky1.png?itok=cpCqtriX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-sky1.png?itok=Bj2NCMtt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>A beautiful galaxy is out there waiting for us to explore!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Petit Planet </em>Closed Beta Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The celestial theme of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;really helps it stand out. Seeing the stars in the sky on your cute, round little planet creates such a cozy atmosphere. Through the use of a resource called Luca, we can continually upgrade our planet and allow it to evolve, so I was able to gain constellations for my sky and cute star patterns on the grass.</p>

<p>There's also a heavy emphasis on the communal aspect of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>. There's a giant social hub called the Galactic Bazaar where players can meet and interact. The process to make new friends seems quite easy, and having them visit your planet should be a cinch. The Bazaar looks like a lot of fun, too, but due to the nature of the Closed Beta, I didn't have a chance to see it bustling with players.</p>

<p>So far, I'm very impressed with&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>. It gives me the same warm and fuzzy feelings that&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>does, without feeling like a total imitation. One thing about HoYoverse I've learned is, they're very good at adding an impressive amount of content and updates over time. With more of said updates, events, and the like, a year from launch I predict&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;has amazing potential to be even greater than its inspiration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the battle gets underway in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment</a> this week, it seems the team at Koei Tecmo's AAA Games Studio has already got some future updates planned.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/zelda_musou/status/1986357898071638423">Zelda Musou account on social media</a> has revealed how the developer is apparently gearing up to release two free updates in the future, which will allow fans of the new title to enjoy the experience "for even longer".</p>
<p>We don't have the specifics about these updates just yet, but we'll let you know when the details are revealed and they go live on the Switch 2. This announcement follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-receives-its-first-switch-2-update-version-1-0-1">the first patch for the new entry this week</a>, which fixed some issues and also added a new shortcut feature to the game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2tmgkjo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>If you're still not sure about this new entry, be sure to check out our review here on Nintendo Life. Here's a quick summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-dumps-its-10000-mah-power-bank-for-pennies-10k-units-already-sold-on-amazon-2000641824</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-dumps-its-10-000-mah-power-bank-for-pennies-10k-units-already-sold-on-amazon.1346479/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With the holidays quickly approaching, we’re all up to our knees in gift shopping. If you’re looking for some easy corporate sponsored White Elephant gifts or perhaps an extra stocking stuffer to fill up the sock, look for something that everyone and their mother could take advantage of. I’m talking about a portable power bank. Anker has myriad of portable chargers in its product lineup, consisting of all different sizes (both physical and in the storage sense).</p>
<p>As the tech has gotten better, prices have come down so you can get something really reliable for dirt cheap — especially when there is a sale. Right now, Amazon has this travel-ready Anker power bank with a 10,000mAh capacity for 40% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5384/">Anker PowerCore is normally priced at $29 (which isn’t even all that expensive) and it is now available for just $15</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5384/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Like it says in the name, this <em>Anker PowerCore Slim 10000</em> power bank holds a total power capacity of 10,000mAh. If you’re not familiar with these units, let’s put it a bit more eloquently. This portable charger can provide an iPhone 17 with two full charges from zero to 100%. Likewise, it can bring a Galaxy S25 to 100% just barely under two times. It can also bring an iPad mini 6 back to full one time.</p>
<p>The Anker power bank is lightweight and slim in design. It can easily fit into any pocket or into any bag you may be traveling with. It measures in at 5.99 inches by 2.81 inches 0.61 inches. It’s got a scratch-resistant exterior, so don’t be afraid to put it in your bag with other stuff. It’s been durability tested to withstand a drop of up to 3.2 feet.</p>



<h2>Universally Compatible</h2>
<p>The <strong>power bank uses USB-C for both input and output</strong>, which makes charging quick and easy for any USB-C device. It comes with the USB-C capable for you to charge both your devices like your phone or tablet as well as to recharge the power bank itself. It also has a micro USB port which can be used for recharging the power bank as an alternative.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB-C port supports speeds of up to 15W</strong> in either direction. That’s not the fastest charging on the market, but this can still save you in a pinch if you’re in Penn Station, phones about to die, and you still need to figure what address you’re going to and train you’re taking. Afterall, remember. This thing is only $15. For what it can do, it’s an excellent deal at that price point.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-rolling-out-its-black-friday-deals-powerful-16-inch-gaming-laptop-is-now-71-off-2000641711</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-rolling-out-its-black-friday-deals-powerful-16-inch-gaming-laptop-is-now-71-off.1346467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops don’t come cheap. Of course, the exact price depends on the specs you’re after, but machines that can handle the latest titles without slowing down often land in the $800 to $1,700 range. If you’ve been on the lookout for a solid option without blowing your budget, Amazon is making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p>We just spotted the 16-inch Kaigerr gaming laptop going for $490 on Amazon, after an unbelievable 71% drop, and no, it’s not a glitch. It’s an early Black Friday deal available to both Prime and non-Prime members. Hurry to grab yourself this powerhouse, as there’s no telling how long the discount or the stock will last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5382/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Memory Paired With Solid Storage</h2>
<p>You’re getting an impressive 16-inch display, which is slightly larger than most standard screens in this range, and pushes brilliant visuals that are both sharp and vivid. The High-Definition IPS screen is bright while also being comfortable on the eyes, so whether you’re pushing some creative boundaries in the morning or streaming at night, you will enjoy an immersive viewing experience throughout. There’s also a backlight keyboard that makes it easy to type in dim settings.</p>



<p>Power-wise, it packs a Ryzen 7 5825U processor with 8 cores and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz. This translates into ultra-fast performance, even with resource-intensive apps. The processor is paired with 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD, so you’re getting both speed and sufficient storage right out of the box. These specs should be enough for most users out there initially, but if you ever want more, the laptop supports up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD expansion.</p>
<p>Graphics are handled by the Radeon Vega 8 integrated GPU, which keeps everything running smoothly. It’s not really meant for ultra-high-end titles at max settings, but you’ll have no problem running popular games like Fortnite or Minecraft.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, plus a bunch of ports like USB 3.2, HDMI, a full-function Type-C, a TF card slot, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can connect external displays, add essential peripherals, and more without feeling limited.</p>
<p>All things considered, this gaming laptop delivers a lot of value for under $500. You’ll enjoy fast performance, immersive visuals, massive storage, plus quality graphics, whether you’re playing, working, or streaming. If you have been wanting to treat yourself to a powerful machine, now is a great time to make the move.</p>

"Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. [Developer] Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. So, in terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were a little softer than we would have liked. In the fullness of time, we think it's going to do great."</p><p>It's true that some PC players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/" data-ref-id="1100-6534683">review bombed Borderlands 4 on Steam</a> about its performance and optimization issues.

Pitchford also shared a number of tips for better performance on PC and consoles.</p><p>However, the PC sales figures may not tell the whole story. The American/Canadian console sales for October 2025 haven't been released yet, but PlayStation's list of the top downloads for North America reveal that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/playstation-store-october-2025s-top-downloads/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dropped to 14th place</a> after <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/02/playstation-store-september-2025s-top-downloads" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">debuting at number three</a> a month earlier.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackery-offloads-its-1500w-power-generator-at-55-off-the-ideal-backup-for-winter-outages-2000641816</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery-offloads-its-1500w-power-generator-at-55-off-the-ideal-backup-for-winter-outages.1346455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re cruising right toward the the end of 2025 which means we’re in the thick of the holiday season and we’ve got lots of gift shopping to take care of. You can hold out until Black Friday or Cyber Monday in order to saver some cash, but right now, if you know where to look, you can find some pretty lucrative deals ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>For instance, Amazon has the popular portable power station — the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 — currently on sale for 55% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/">1500W AC battery normally goes for $839 and this discount brings it down to just $386</a>. This bundle also includes an AC cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is a great product to keep on hand in the back or your car or in your garage in the event of an emergency. You find yourself without power, perhaps during a thunderstorm causing a blackout, you can rely on this backup battery to keep your phones charged or to power important appliances.</p>
<p>On the subject of charging phones, the Jackery Explorer 1000 vs power station is capable of refueling your mobile devices up to 7.5 times faster the first generation model. With its six ports, you can even keep six different devices charged at once. This way, everyone in the family is covered in an emergency.</p>
<p>The six ports include<strong> three standard outlets which provide AC 1500W pure sine wave power</strong>. Then we have two USB-C ports, one able to produce 100W while the other does 30W. Then there’s the USB-A port capable of 18W.</p>



<h2>Fast-Charging</h2>
<p>When it comes time to actually recharging the Jackery power station itself, charging with standard settings will have it back up to capacity from zero in just 1,7 hours. If you need something a little faster than the default mode, you can actually set it to emergency super charging mode using the companion app on your phone. On this setting, the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is able to get back up to 100% in just one hour.</p>
<p>Perhaps you don’t need it charged super fast and you’re more concerned about the noise it’s making. Set it to quiet charging mode which will bring it down to barely 22dB, letting it slowly recharge over five hours. You can also choose to purchase the optional solar panels which open you up to even more charging options. The panels can be used to recharge it in just three hours.</p>
<p>The battery is built to last. The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 will be able to provide you with roughly 4,000 cycles of recharging in its life. This is estimated to work out to about 10 years of use.</p>

                <p>Skydance Games is once again pushing back its upcoming action game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra/">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>--although it hasn't given any new details about when to expect the game, except "beyond early 2026."</p><p>The publisher announced the delay on its Twitter. "Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect," the announcement reads.</p><p>To that end, Skydance Games, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed/1100-6531490/" data-ref-id="1100-6531490">already delayed the game</a> to early 2026, has announced that it is once again pushing the date beyond that window.</p><p>You can read the full statement below:</p><p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the first game from Skydance New Media, a developer founded in 2019 by the similarly named film studio. Amy Hennig, of Uncharted fame, is the studio's president and is leading development on the title as well, which puts players in the shoes of four playable characters, including Black Panther and Captain America, as well as a Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, and Nanali, a Wakandan spy leader.</p><p>As suggested by the game's title, Rise of Hydra is set during World War II in Nazi-occupied Paris, but--in true action-adventure form--the game will span the globe and take players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-will-be-set-in-occupied-paris-wakanda-and-beyond/1100-6528536/" data-ref-id="1100-6528536">Wakanda and beyond</a>.</p>

He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible with most original Switch games, which is a great feature to tide early adopters (like me!) over until more Switch 2 exclusives launch. The console comes with 256GB of internal storage, but that probably won’t be enough room for your entire digital game library. Thankfully, however, <strong>Samsung’s 512GB P9 microSD Express card</strong> is already on sale for $94.99 ($5 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT995SPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> you clip the on-page coupon. The 256GB model is also available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FT99KCV8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, though only for its MSRP of $54.99.</p><p>The current discount may seem small, but the P9 is already around $20 less expensive than most other 512GB microSD Express cards. The only option that’s cheaper is <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FONN-MICRO-SD-EXPRESS%2F15708762625" rel="sponsored">a card from Onn</a>, Walmart’s house brand, which is available for around $85 but is frequently out of stock. Also, while the Switch 2 is one of the first mainstream gadgets to use a microSD Express card for extra storage, you can pop them into certain cameras, tablets, and drones with a microSD USH-I slot. The P9 offers sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s, but only gadgets with a microSD Express card slot can take full advantage of the highest speeds.</p><p>As for how far 512GB of storage gets you, well, it depends. The number of digital games that will fit on the P9 is reliant on their size; <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/814762/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a></em> requires 43.4GB of space, while <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a></em> only takes up 4.1GB. If having a combined 768GB of storage for games seems like overkill, consider that the Switch 2 version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade </em>requires a 93GB download.</p><p>Even physical game collectors may end up needing a microSD Express card, as many publishers have opted to release their games on game-key cards. These titles use a physical cartridge to authenticate your copy of the game, but require you to download a digital copy onto your system’s internal storage. There are also plenty of indie games that are only released digitally, or are only released on a cartridge long after their initial launch. Regardless of which types of games you choose, though, it’s better to have more space than you need than have to decide which games to take with you on a trip.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/815946/samsung-p9-microsd-express-card-nintendo-switch-2-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies-2000641696</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies.1346440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen can often feel limiting, especially when you need to work on multiple applications at once or share the display with others. Adding a full-size second monitor isn’t an option for everyone, but you can consider investing in a portable display that offers that extra space without the bulk.</p>
<p>Most portable monitors out there are quite affordable, with prices starting at $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less. Amazon is currently offering the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/">15.6-inch <em>Yxk</em> portable screen for just $39, thanks to a 33% discount off its regular $59 price</a>. If you’ve been looking for a budget-friendly way to upgrade your work or play setup, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Consistent Visuals From All Angles</h2>
<p>The display itself measures 15.6 inches, which is the same size as most standard laptops. You’re getting a 1080p Full HD IPS screen with HDR support for clear, vibrant visuals with exceptional color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle ensures consistency from all angles, so you will be able to view the content clearly even when you’re not sitting directly in front of the screen. This also makes it easier to share the screen with others, as everyone won’t have to huddle around a single spot uncomfortably.</p>



<p>Long work sessions will no longer be tough on the eyes, thanks to Low Blue Light technology that actively reduces the amount of blue light emitted from the screen. Even better, you can choose between several display modes (mirror, extend, or second screen only) based on what you’re working on. Maybe go for the second screen mode when you need to work on different apps simultaneously, and the mirror mode while presenting! There are also two built-in speakers that make sure audio comes through clearly.</p>
<p>In terms of connectivity, it has two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini HDMI, meaning you can connect it to a range of devices, including laptops, phone, Xbox, PC, etc. The built-in stand makes it easy to set it up literally anywhere, from desk to bed.</p>
<p>Despite the generous size and power, the monitor weighs just 1.43 lbs and is only 0.31 inches thick. It slips into your laptop bag without bulking things up – ready to go where you do! Note that the discount ends soon, so it’s best to snag one for yourself before that happens.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Take-Two Interactive is using some AI tools in areas of its business that aren't creative, but the company is not looking to use those tools to replace any staff, CEO Strauss Zelnick said during Take-Two's November earnings call.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think there are plenty of areas of business where the tools we have rolled out at the enterprise are helping us. We are not either using this as an excuse to, or frankly seeing the opportunity to, reduce headcount," Zelnick said on the call, answering a question about how Take-Two has rolled out AI tools in the non-creative areas of its business. "We are seeing this as an opportunity to take our very talented people and release them from more mundane tasks so they can do more creative and more interesting tasks and we can work better as an organization. But if you said, 'Can you cut your cost profile by 5% tomorrow by using all things AI?' The answer is no."</p><p dir="ltr">Zelnick has previously said in interviews that he thinks the capabilities of generative AI tools are overstated, and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-believe-ai-can-compete-with-grand-theft-auto/1100-6535814/">AI can't replace games made by humans like Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. During the earnings call, he clarified those comments somewhat, but he also reiterated that he thinks AI can potentially be a useful tool in game development in the future, if "properly deployed."</p><p dir="ltr">"To be clear, I didn't say that I don't see it as a positive," Zelnick said. "What I said was that AI is based on backward-looking data sets meeting compute, meeting LLMs, and none of that replaces forward-looking genius. That's not an opinion, that's factual. I defy anyone to controvert those facts.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, technology drives a lot of what we do here. Now, creativity is our lifeblood, but how do we express our creativity? We do so with computers, with technical tools. We always have. So as toolsets improve, we can become more efficient, we can become more effective. And our creative people, therefore, are freed up to be more creative. So AI, depending on how you define it, and properly deployed, of course is positive for creativity, and therefore is, of course, positive for game creation."</p><p>Zelnick's comments that AI won't lead to layoffs at Take-Two come in contrast to other executives. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/">Microsoft's Brad Smith</a> have both said that AI advancements will lead to job losses in the short term, though they claim AI will eventually lead to higher employment rates.</p>

                <p>Major League Baseball wrapped up its 2025 season last week, and now, Sony San Diego Studios is looking ahead to the 13th iteration of MLB The Show. As expected, MLB The Show 26 is in development and the team behind the game is pulling the curtain back on a few of the features that will be included.</p><p>Sony shared the MLB The Show 26 details on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/06/goal-setting-mlb-the-show-26/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official PlayStation blog</a>. Next year's game will introduce Road To The Show's high school and college modes, as well as a focus on players' mid-to-late careers. Meanwhile, Diamond Dynasty is adding two new experiences, Diamond Quest and Weekend Classic. However, the team didn't elaborate on what those experiences entail.</p><p>Franchise mode has been adjusted to be "more strategic and rewarding" in the offseason, with no further details in that area. Some of the subtle changes to the game include new animations and a revamped throw meter. The popular Negro Leagues storylines will continue with Season 4, which will once again revisit some of the players whose achievements were overlooked for decades.</p><p>Players who want to get an early start on next year's game can earn up to 26 The Show packs by playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mlb-the-show-25/" data-ref-id="5000-660215">MLB The Show 25</a>. Earning a Now &amp; Later pack in 25 will allow players to redeem a Show pack when 26 is released by signing into the title with the same account they used for the previous game</p><p>Fans who sign up for The Show's <a href="https://account.theshow.com/scoutingreport" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scouting Report</a> by November 15 will earn five Now &amp; Later packs. On November 21, Now &amp; Later packs will be available to earn in MLB The Show 25 in the 11th Inning XP path. By early 2026, there will be a dedicated Now &amp; Later program in the game.</p><p>Sony hasn't set a date for MLB The Show 26, but the yearly editions traditionally arrive in March.</p>

              <p>Have you heard the news? <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> has been delayed again</a>. The open-world crime simulator is no longer releasing in May 2026 and will now instead launch in November 2026. So why the delay? According to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, it’s because Rockstar Games is seeking “perfection” and the studio’s Metacritic track record is proof that this strategy works.</p> <p>During a November 6 earnings call, Zelnick, who leads Rockstar parent Company Take-Two, was asked about how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>GTA 6</em> delay</a> was affecting the studio and what Rockstar Games was doing at this stage in development. While Zelnick declined to get into the “inner workings” of the developer, he did talk about the company’s culture and focus on making critically acclaimed games.</p>

 <p>“I think the culture of Rockstar [Games] is extraordinary, and we’re all pushing hard to to seek perfection,” said Zelnick during the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251106169372/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reports-Results-for-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2026">earnings call.</a> Take-Two’s stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/take-two-gta-vi-delay.html">sank around 7 percent</a> after news of the delay was made public. The CEO then praised how highly rated Rockstar-developed games are on review aggregator Metacritic.</p>

 <p>“I mean, the Metacritic scores of Rockstar releases are, generally, speaking, not generally I mean, with very few exceptions, have been over 95,” explained Zelnick.&nbsp; “<em>GTA V</em>, as you know, has been the standard bearer, not just for our company, but for the industry through three console generations, and to this day, is still, I would argue, the most technologically advanced title in the marketplace, despite [being more than a] decade old, and that doesn’t happen by accident.”</p>

 <p>I’d quibble a bit here and point out that only seven of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/company/rockstar-games/?sort-options=score">Rockstar’s video game releases have hit 95 and only 4 got a higher score on Metacritic</a>, with most landing in the high 80s and low 90s. But there’s no denying that over the last 15 years Rockstar Games has mostly produced critically acclaimed blockbusters like <em>Red Dead Redemption, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption II.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Zelnick added that Rockstar and all of Take-Two’s studios are focused on “seeking excellence, teamwork and kindness.” Not sure how reported efforts at union busting factor into that, but it’s a nice sentiment.</p> <p>Of course, the problem is that with each passing year and each delay, the expectations for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> grow and grow. The video game industry isn’t standing still and waiting for Rockstar to make the next big open-world masterpiece. The genre has continued to evolve thanks to games like <em>Elden Ring, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Far Cry, Tears of the Kingdom, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5,</em> and others. What people expect from a big, AAA open-world video game has changed a lot since 2013’s <em>GTA V</em> and 2019’s<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Will Rockstar’s pursuit of “perfection” make it harder for the studio to keep up with the rest of the industry, leading to a game that feels dated? Or will the studio innovate and help reshape the genre it practically created? We’ll find out in November 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-ceo-strauss-zelnick-2000641798">Probably. Maybe. We’ll see.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Corded, heavy, and noisy vacuum cleaners should really be a thing of the past by now. If you’re still dragging one of these around every morning, wondering who ever said cleaning was therapeutic, it’s probably time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Dyson has some of the best options out there, and right now, one of its latest models just hit its lowest price ever. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/">Dyson V9 Motorbar vacuum cleaner is now going for just $269 on Amazon, after a massive 55% discount</a>. It comes with multiple attachments to tackle different spaces, and does its job without waking the whole house up. This early Black Friday deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it ends soon. Get your orders in before the price goes back up to $599, or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cleans Multiple Surfaces Like a Pro</h2>
<p>This vacuum is Dyson’s most lightweight model yet, meaning you won’t be left with sore arms after a session. It comes with a whole set of attachments that include a crevice tool, a hair screw tool, a Motorbar cleaner head, and a combination tool; one for every type of surface and mess. The Motorbar cleaner head automatically adjusts to different floor types and is built to de-tangle hair as it cleans. <strong>V9’s high-velocity motor spins at up to 120,000rpm to generate up to 100 Air Watts</strong> of powerful suction, so expect it to handle even the most stubborn dirt and debris like a pro.</p>



<p>You can choose between three cleaning modes based on what you’re tackling; Eco, Med, and Boost. A <strong>single charge gets you up to 40 minutes of runtime</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to sweep through a couple of rooms, plus the living area. There’s a bright LCD screen on top that keeps you in the loop about remaining run time, current power mode, filter maintenance reminders, etc.</p>
<p>Best of all, the <strong>vacuum easily converts into a handheld</strong> for when you need to clean stairs, car seats, upholstery, etc. Once you’re done cleaning, simply press the eject button to empty the dirt into the bin. Then, you can drop it into the wall-mounted charging dock, and it will be ready for the next cleaning session in no time!</p>
<p>This is the lowest price we have seen this new model drop to. On a regular day, it would run you around $599, but you can grab it for $269 if you’re quick.</p>

In the aptly-titled Celeste's Journal quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to visit two separate locations on opposite ends of the Dam Battlegrounds map to collect this trader's possessions, so strap in for quite a raid.</p><p>If you want to make things easier on yourself for Celeste's Journals, you'll want to equip an augment with a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with both of the journals and return to Speranza to complete this quest. This can be tough to pull off due to the long trek you'll need to make through potentially dangerous areas to gather both of them, so also be sure to bring a decent gun and enough ammo to keep you feeling safe.</p><p>When you're ready to set off and finish this challenging quest, follow the steps below.

            <p>Hi everyone, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> has been delayed again. It's now set to arrive on November 19th, 2026, about half a year on from the May 26th date it'd landed on following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">last delay</a>. November 19th, 2026 will apparently be a Thursday, just in case you were wondering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This latest delay was announced by Take-Two and Rockstar as part of the former's latest financial report. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," reads a tweet from Rockstar. The tweet begins "hi everyone", which isn't funny, but my evening brain's finding it so, mainly because it makes the post read a bit like a substitute teacher announcing that the regular teacher's stuck in traffic until November 19th, 2026, so can you all please react to that news without erupting into complete anarchy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick spoken to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">IGN</a> about the delay, which sees the much-hyped crime/love game slip a whole year from its original autumn 2025 release goal. "Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience," he said. Asked what's changed since he said he was confident in that original 2025 goal, the exec added: "It’s- it's all of 2025. We’ve had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>He's also chatted with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">The Game Business</a>. In that discussion Zelnick stressed that Take-Two "feel really good" about the new date, adding that even though it's a year away, the company's date setting's "not that far in advance if you look at when you need to deliver a game to get it out". In the meantime, the exec said, Rockstar'll keep on plugging with GTA Online so people can get their crime/not as much love fix.</p><p>So, there you go. This latest delay comes on a day which has seen protests outside of Take-Two's London offices and Rockstar North's Edinburgh HQ in response to the studio firing around 30 UK-based workers for "gross misconduct", as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Edwin reported</a>. The IWGB Union have claimed that this was done as retaliation against an attempt to unionise, while Rockstar have since asserted that the fired staff shared "confidential information on a public forum".</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Important update regarding MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. <a href="https://t.co/y3WRSjVmds">pic.twitter.com/y3WRSjVmds</a></p> <p>— Skydance Games (@SkydanceGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Rise of Hydra</em> was originally supposed to ship in holiday 2025. Then in May of this year, Skydance <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">announced it would be pushed back</a> to early 2026 so the team could add more “polish.” At this point it seems like there’s more than just additional polish that’s needed.</p>

 <p>For anyone who hasn’t been following the project, <em>Rise of Hydra</em> takes place in Occupied Paris and is based on the limited comic book series <em>Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers</em>. The action-adventure sports a team-up between Steve Rogers, Azzuri, Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones, and Wakandan spy chief Nanali.</p>

  <p>The game was first confirmed back in 2021, teased at the D23 Expo in 2022, and finally received a full Unreal Engine 5 trailer in 2024. Skydance has been hyping the cast and the cinematics looked great but we’ve yet to see any real gameplay or get a real sense of the caliber of the game. But it would be cool if a new game Hennig worked on <a href="https://kotaku.com/before-it-was-cancelled-star-wars-1313-was-going-to-be-470003660">finally got to actually come out</a>.</p> <p>It’s also the only <em>Black Panther</em> game we’re likely to get for some time. EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">canceled its own</a> and shut down the studio making it. Things were very different when <em>Rise of Hydra</em> was first greenlit as well. Hopefully it arrives before too much longer. Just maybe not during fall 2026.</p>

<p>A new update from Battlefield 6 developers reveals that bots are being reintroduced to Verified Experiences. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have been addressing bots across various modes in their title since the game’s launch. The lead producer recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-bots-system-explained-by-lead-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> how the bot system works in BF6, the criteria that need to be met, and how they can help the situation. Now, a new update reveals that bots will be returning for their community experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-will-grant-reduced-xp-and-each-game-mode-supports-12-of-them">Battlefield 6 Bots Will Grant Reduced XP and Each Game Mode Supports 12 of Them</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding bots returning to Battlefield 6’s Verified Experiences was shared through an official post from the BattlefieldComms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986550835615027359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). <span>The developers had&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank">temporarily removed</a>&nbsp;bots from Verified Experiences to support healthier matchmaking in their Community Servers and Portal Experiences update last month,</span> and are now reintroducing them to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post explains that each game mode will support up to 12 bots. If bot backfill is enabled, matches will require eight players to start, with up to 6 bots filling each team. If backfill is not enabled, you will need 20 players to start the match. </p>



<p>Bots will provide reduced XP in BF6, and player XP will remain at 100% (similar values to Multiplayer modes). Moreover, when bots are enabled, players’ statistics, such as hours played, kill/death ratio, and total revives, will not show any gains or losses. The stats system is currently not functioning as intended and is being actively adjusted. Lastly, challenges will remain completable.</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 players are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editing game files</a> to turn off matchmaking against ‘overpowered’ aim assist. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies</a> across all platforms.
