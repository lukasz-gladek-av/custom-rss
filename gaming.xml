Here’s what we’ve learned about <em>Elden Ring</em>, its story, and its characters while playing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. <strong>Major spoilers incoming. </strong></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h127857"><a id=""></a><strong>What is the Shadow Realm?</strong></h2><p>The Realm of Shadow is essentially an alternate, death-filled version of the Lands Between. The Scadutree at its center is literally a shadow version of the Erdtree in the Lands Between, and the prevalence of ghostly tombstones and coffins delineate that this is a world steeped in death. Though the Realm of Shadow exists under a veil, it’s believed to be sitting smack in the center of the original <em>Elden Ring </em>map, right under that cloud that’s just south of the Erdtree.<br></p><h2 id="h127858"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is Messmer the Impaler?</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743">Messmer </a></span>is the son of Queen Marika, and the brother of Malenia and Miquella. He was born with a snake living inside of him (that he calls the Abyssal Serpent) which threatened to take him over, so his mother contained the serpent by removing one of Messmer’s eyes and placing a magical seal there instead.<br></p><p>Before the Elden Ring shattered, Messmer was sent to the Realm of Shadow to purge the tower-dwellers (the Hornsent) who were not followers of Marika’s religion/bathed in the light of grace. Remember: in the Lands Between, the Hornsent are called Omens, and are shunned from society or killed in attempts to remove their horns. That’s because they represent the dominant religion of the land <em>before</em> the establishment of the Greater Will and its vassal, Marika. As we progress through the DLC, however, the beef between Marika and the Hornsent gets a bit more complicated (more on that later).<br></p><p>For some reason, Marika abandoned Messmer in the Realm of Shadow, but he refused to stop purging folks. </p><figure id="" data-id="514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-recommend-id="image://514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-recommend-id="image://514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h127859"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is Kindly Miquella and why did he go to the Shadow Realm?</strong></h2><p>Miquella is the twin brother of Malenia, both born to Marika and Radagon and both cursed—Malenia with scarlet rot, and Miquella with eternal youth. Though Miquella traps himself in a cocoon at the base of a tree he tried to grow to cure himself and Malenia, he is stolen while in slumber by Mohg, who wanted to use his blood in order to start his own empire (though now, it appears that Miquella may have tricked Mohg into doing all of this so he could enter the Realm of Shdaow).<br></p><p>When Miquella fell into his slumber, he entered the Realm of Shadow to find the soul of the Promised Consort, who turns out to be Radahn, the very same Radahn who is the child of Radagon and Rennala. Miquella wants to stand at the gates of divinity (seen in the trailer for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>) and complete a ritual in order to become a god. That ritual involves capturing the dead Radahn’s soul in Mohg’s body—remember, you have to kill both of those bosses in the base game to even start the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC, and now we know why.<br></p><h2 id="h127860"><a id=""></a><strong>Why did Miquella choose Radahn as his Consort?</strong></h2><p>Some think that Miquella chose Radahn to be his Consort because of his sheer strength as a demigod—the only person to best him was Malenia, and perhaps her Scarlet Rot affliction made it impossible for Miquella to name her as Consort. A cutscene that plays after you defeat Radahn in the DLC shows that Miquella proposed some sort of vow to Radahn that would result in him becoming his consort after ascending to Godhood. It’s unclear if that’s why that big battle between Malenia and Radahn that we saw in the original trailer for <em>Elden Ring</em> took place—if that battle was part of the vow or something else entirely. We also don’t know for sure if Radahn accepted the vow <em>or</em> was just acting while under the influence of Miquella, who can even charm the player during the final boss bottle, stealing your heart and insta-killing you.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-recommend-id="image://8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-recommend-id="image://8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h127861"><a id=""></a><strong>What does Miquella want, and is he all that Kindly?</strong></h2><p>Early on in the DLC, you meet several NPCs who represent different factions in this world: Needle Knight Leda, the last remaining footsoldier for Miquella; Freyja, who once fought alongside Radahn; the Hornsent, a member of the aforementioned tower folk; and Sir Ansbach, who served Mohg. Though they come from disparate backgrounds, they are all in the Realm of Shadow to find “kindly Miquella,” and they recruit you, as well.<br></p><p>But it appears that Miquella charmed all of them, twisting their minds to support his cause. That’s why, when you head towards the Shadow Keep (Messmer’s castle), an in-game event will take place: you hear the audio cue for using a rune arc, and the words “somewhere, a great rune has broken…and so too has a powerful charm.” After speaking to the NPCs, you learn that Miquella himself broke this rune, thus also freeing all of those under his charm. They’re confused, uncertain who to follow or where to go, as they were only united because Miquella was forcing them to be. Ansbach remembers fighting Miquella for Mohg, calling the once-Kindly Miquella a “monster.”<br></p><p>After this event takes place, Miquella’s goal becomes even more clear: the crosses you find scattered across the map are places where Miquella has shed parts of his being in order to be born anew, and breaking his rune arc is part of that process.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-lore-messmer-miquella-1851492064&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-lore-messmer-miquella-1851492064">I posited before the release of the DLC</a></span> that Miquella wanted to right his mother Marika’s wrongs, and bring justice to the people of the Realm of Shadow who were (seemingly) crusaded against because of their horns (more on that later), and that still seems to be the case. Miquella wants to bring about an “Age of Compassion,” and many NPCs reference his love, but the way he’s going about everything is pretty fucked up—charming people into fighting for him and using the dead body of one lord to house the soul of another.</p><figure id="" data-id="1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-recommend-id="image://1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-recommend-id="image://1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h127862"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is St. Trina?</strong></h2><p>St. Trina is only briefly mentioned in the base game, but she has a whole section dedicated to her in the DLC, and an NPC dedicated to her as well: Thiollier. The DLC confirms beliefs that players have had for years: St. Trina and Miquella are the same person, just like Radagon and Marika are believed to be two halves of a whole. A cross near where you can find St. Trina confirms that this is where Miquella discarded his “love.” And yes, just like Radagon and Marika, a soul can clearly exist in two different bodies in this world—and fall in love with itself.

They burst out of these jars and are a horrid mass of human limbs and extra, fatty growths. Kiling them can result in them dropping an item simply called Innard Meat. The description says that this meat is used to fill great jars, and that “This is what becomes of the condemned, who get sliced up and stuffed into jars to become saints instead.”</p><p>Albi and others believe that Marika and her people lived in the Shaman Village, an area in the Realm of Shadow that you can find after gesturing in front of a statute of Marika, which will reveal a door to the wildflower-covered region. Though there are two Tree Sentinels there you must fight, there’s little else in this area, save for two items: a spell that conjures up a minor Erdtree, and a lock of Marika’s hair.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="40d9c1f75ea58331ccce37d70bef3545" data-recommend-id="image://40d9c1f75ea58331ccce37d70bef3545" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished sits amongst hundreds of wildflowers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished sits amongst hundreds of wildflowers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="40d9c1f75ea58331ccce37d70bef3545" data-recommend-id="image://40d9c1f75ea58331ccce37d70bef3545" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished sits amongst hundreds of wildflowers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The spell’s description reads: “Marika bathed the village of her home in gold, knowing full well that there was no one left to heal.”<br></p><p>The only other reference to shaman in the DLC, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKWkWp69dA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKWkWp69dA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as noted by YouTuber Gingy</a></span>, is a Hornsent ghost saying that a shaman’s place is in the jar. We now know that, at some point, the Hornsent were torturing the shaman—an item you can find called the Tooth Whip describes this process. And people like Albi suggest that, based on environmental clues in the Belurat Gaol, it’s likely Messmer was desperately trying to save the villagers from this horrible fate.<br></p><p>So, it appears that Marika didn’t kill the Hornsent because they were remnants of an older religion—she may have become a God just to smite them for what they did to her people. That means that Miquella’s quest to right her wrongs is unfounded, making the manner in which he’s gone about all this even worse. So yes, you have to stop him.<br></p><hr><p>These are the main beats and important characters in <em>Elden Ring:</em> <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.

So I’m bemused, each time, when it’s the other way around.</p><p>I’m pretty disappointed by the state of the Steam release of the game. For no good reason you have to play it through an Ubisoft Connect account, and it lacks basic PC options like a way to play in a window on my ultra-widescreen monitor. (It even overrides Steam launch settings to force this!) Also, other people on Steam are so VERY mad that it doesn’t have the promised achievements. It’s not an auspicious launch. But it’s still <em>BG&amp;E</em>, a game that I seem to replay every five or so years. So much so that honestly, I don’t want a sequel. I certainly don’t want a sequel that looks like anything in any of the bullshit trailers that have appeared over the years, pretending to be from a game that exists.

That’s not necessarily a problem, but I could use a better understanding of how voltage flows, combines, splits, can be attenuated, and more. <em>The Signal State</em>’s puzzles are all about that, asking you to route signal paths in specific ways such as, “SRC 2 is a binary signal. When it is at 100 volts, send SRC 1 to OUT 1. Otherwise, send 0 volts to OUT 1,” or, “Send SRC 1 to OUT 2, but with its intensity boosted by a percentage by SRC 2.”</p><p>Riveting stuff, huh? Sure, it’s dry. But dry is what I need right now and <em>The Signal State</em> seems like the perfect set of exercises for me to just drill the basics of voltage flowing across a system. This is especially useful for me as I’m slimming down the number of individual Eurorack modules I own to prioritize my use of semi-modular gear. So as I figure out what modules I’m keeping to fit into a tinier, more portable 42HP rack, hopefully <em>The Signal State</em> will key my brain into thinking more about direct utility and voltage control than shiny, fancier stuff (but damn do I really want that Qu-Bit Nautilus delay module and maybe it was a mistake to sell my Monsoon…).</p><p>And though I do use and love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://vcvrack.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://vcvrack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VCV Rack</a></span>, that’s an actual piece of music software and doesn’t have the puzzles, challenges, and restrictions that are conducive to making progress in learning new skills (especially musical ones). — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-recommend-id="image://4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-recommend-id="image://4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get the fuck out of the Gold Saucer</p><p>I’m back in the Cait Sith saddle folks and it feels, ugh, fine.

That whole completing random mini-games, including actual honest to god Fiverr-style gig work just to get bathing suits to get on the beach to do a random boss fight that didn’t exist in the original game was just not working for me.

Haha fuck yeah!!! Yes!! Shooting boxes on a mine cart? Well this fucking sucks. What the fuck. When I reached the Gold Saucer in the original game it was a fun reprieve.

A lot of those copies may have been bought by normies just eager to see what the CD-ROM drives on their pricey new PCs could do, because when I bring it up in gaming circles, I’m more often met with derision than reverence. “The puzzles sucked!” many say. “It’s just so boring.” Well, it certainly made for a stark contrast with <em>Doom</em>, released the same year, and while I admired both, <em>Myst</em>’s<em> </em>was the world I got utterly lost in. I think everything about the game is brilliant. Its distinctive architecture and atmosphere seeped into my mind so deeply that, out and about in the real world, I’d sometimes spot something vaguely <em>Myst</em>-like and feel transported into the game.

Now, finally, this landmark sequel has gotten the remake treatment it so clearly deserved, and I can experience its atmosphere and its puzzles in free-look, free-movement glory.

However, now that I (mostly) understand what I’m doing, I’m having a blast in <em>Diablo 4. </em>The loot is flowing, the demons are dying and my druid is quickly growing in power as I complete quests and level up the battle pass.

And while Nintendo has taken steps to address the dreaded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">Joy-Con drift</a> and earlier quality control problems, some issues persist.</p><p>In this buying guide, we focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed to match your play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re almost all the same and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fcontrollers%2F">PowerA</a> and <a href="https://pdp.com/collections/nintendo-switch-controllers">PDP</a> make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)</p><p>Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), there are certain things that it likely won’t be able to do unless otherwise noted:</p><div><ul><li>It won’t have HD rumble. This is what Nintendo calls its advanced haptic feedback, which is more precise than that of many third-party controllers and more akin to Sony’s haptics engine in its subtlety. That said, some more limited rumble may be present.&nbsp;</li><li>Many third-party Switch controllers don’t have motion controls for gestures or gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, though more options are starting to implement the latter feature with varying degrees of quality.</li><li>Most non-Nintendo options lack an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figurines, which unlock special features in some games.&nbsp;</li><li>Most third-party options won’t be able to turn on the Switch remotely. (You’ll have to manually press the console’s power button.)&nbsp;</li><li>While some Switch controllers have 3.5mm headphone jacks, getting audio out of them can only happen through a wired USB connection, not wirelessly. For most people, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690100/how-to-pair-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-earbuds-nintendo-switch">pairing Bluetooth headphones to your Switch</a> is a sufficient (and very easy) workaround.</li></ul></div><div><p>If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>. It’s the only traditional gamepad that checks all the boxes above — minus the 3.5mm audio jack — and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers we’ve tested. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-NS-Switch-Joysticks-Button%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89/dp/B09MS2VFSB/?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a>, meanwhile, makes for a great Xbox-style controller with exhaustive customization, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Ergonomic-Controller-Handheld/dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=theverge02-20">Hori Split Pad Pro</a> is great for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B08XY8SK9B/?tag=theverge02-20">DualShock-esque Pro 2 controller</a>, both of which are well worth a look.</p></div><div><p><h3>What we’re looking for</h3></p><p><h4><strong>Connectivity</strong></h4></p><p>Does it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz?</p><p><h4><strong>Quality</strong></h4></p><p>Do the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches?</p><p><h4><strong>Extra features</strong></h4></p><p>Are there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macros? Can you use it on multiple platforms?</p><p><h4><strong>Customization</strong></h4></p><p>Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity?</p><p><h4><strong>Value</strong></h4></p><p>Is it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?</p></div><p><h3>The best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode</h3></p><div><p>The Switch Pro released alongside the Switch console in 2017, and it’s a tough controller to beat. It offers an unmatched set of features (HD rumble, motion controls, NFC), and it’s one of the most comfortable Switch controllers out there.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity: </strong>Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>No / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble: </strong>Yes, HD / <strong>NFC: </strong>Yes / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> Yes</em></small></p><p>More than seven years down the road, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller is still the best gamepad for the Switch. It launched alongside the console in 2017 as a more traditional alternative to Nintendo’s quirky Joy-Cons, and in many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. </p><p>Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also the only controller we’ve tested (again, aside from the Joy-Cons) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.</p><p>The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.</p><p>Given the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973">if you have no more than two controllers</a> connected to your Switch at once.)</p><p><h3>The best Switch controller for handheld mode</h3></p><div><p>The Split Pad Pro represents Hori’s take on the Nintendo Switch Pro controller, one that is split into two separate pieces. The Split Pad Pro is a good Joy-Con alternative for people who primarily play their Nintendo Switch in handheld mode.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> Joy-Con slots / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> No / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> via Joy-Con slots / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></small></p><p>I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. That’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.</p><p>The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One-half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.</p><p>The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — not to mention support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC&nbsp;— so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23007610/hori-split-pad-pro-attachment-nintendo-switch-price-features-review">Split Pad Pro Attachment</a> that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t try to add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).</p><p>The company also sells the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348870/hori-split-pad-compact-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-features">Split Pad Compact</a>, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Compact-Light-Yellow/dp/B0BDSNHLDY?tag=theverge02-20">costs around $50</a>. It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.</p><div><p>The Hori Split Pad Pro is a comfortable controller that may be larger than your standard Joy-Cons but is more ergonomic.<br></p></div><p><h3>The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch </h3></p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="7csjbY" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-NS-Switch-Joysticks-Button%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89/dp/B09MS2VFSB/?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><p>If you’re looking for a Switch controller that’s also a great Bluetooth controller for PC, Mac, Steam Deck, iOS, and Android, GuliKit’s KingKong 2 Pro is a worthwhile purchase. It has drift-free Hall effect analog sticks, Amiibo support, and it feels like an Xbox controller in the hand.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> No / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>Yes / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> Yes</em></small></p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KingKong-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Bluetooth/dp/B09QJN8ZD9?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a> rivals the Switch Pro Controller in build quality, but it feels more like a modern Xbox controller, and its textured rear grips might give it the edge for some. Unlike most third-party controllers, it retains Amiibo support, though some users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/vmiyjh/gulikit_king_kong_pro_2_amiibo_compatibility/">have reported issues</a> with inauthentic Amiibo products. The KingKong 2 Pro can connect via Bluetooth to the Switch and to PC, macOS, iOS, Android, and other platforms. And because it uses GuliKit’s Hall effect sensors for its analog sticks, it’s immune to drift.</p><p>We recommend checking out <a href="https://youtu.be/JluAuIJ-tSY">this video at iFixit</a> to see a thorough explanation of how it works, but in essence, Hall effect sensors use magnets to alter electrical current instead of physically rubbing on (and eventually wearing down) a sensor to produce an input. While we haven’t heard widespread reports of chronic analog stick drift issues on the Switch Pro Controller thus far, controllers with Hall effect sensors will never<em> </em>encounter it, and the peace of mind is worth the added cost. (The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller below <a href="https://twitter.com/GuliKitDesign/status/1564852820141957120">also uses GuliKit’s sensors</a>.)</p><p>Control-wise, almost everything about the KingKong 2 Pro feels just right. The face buttons, bumpers, and D-pad all strike a balance between travel, tactile feedback, and feel. The analog sticks are incredibly fluid yet easily snap back into their default positions. Clicking the sticks doesn’t require much force, either, even when they’re off-axis. And while we can’t fully credit GuliKit for the excellent ergonomics afforded by the Xbox-inspired shape, we can award points for the sturdy materials used and nailing a well-balanced weight. </p><p>The controller provides exhaustive customizability options, too. You can swap button layouts, program macros, and cycle through preset levels of rumble intensity and trigger sensitivity (which may not apply when using it with the Switch, as it doesn’t support analog triggers). However, managing these settings is less than ideal, as you can only change them by inputting button combinations. Sure, the combos are simple, but memorizing them all is challenging. Thankfully, GuliKit clearly spells everything out in the comprehensive manual you’ll receive with the gamepad.</p><p>It’s worth noting that GuliKit recently released a <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1222182.html">KingKong 3 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1130420.html">KingKong 3 Max</a>. The KingKong 3 Pro builds upon the premium controller by adding four slots for detachable rearward buttons or paddles (two come in the box) and a 1,000Hz polling rate for improved responsiveness. The KingKong 3 Max is similar but includes three pairs of back buttons (including short and long styles) and a 10-minute macro recording limit (versus 10 seconds on the KingKong 3 Pro). There’s also a dedicated trigger mode switch, RGB lights around the analog sticks that signal which sensitivity mode you’re in, and NFC for Amiibo support.</p><p><h3> A Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck</h3></p><div><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller comes with its own charging dock, features remappable controls, and is compatible with the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and Windows PCs thanks to its Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity. Unlike the 2.4GHz-only version, it features drift-free Hall effect sticks.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></small></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature motion controls and customizable back paddles. It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the 22-hour battery, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.</p><p>The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options because it includes 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.</p><p>As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list. </p><p><h3>A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock</h3></p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="cNNs5L" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B0CSPHXJYM/?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo Pro 2</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->50</span></p><p>The 8BitDo Pro 2 offers many of the same features as the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller but at a lower price point and with a DualShock-style layout. It features extra triggers, hand grips, remappable buttons, and back paddles, as well as the ability to pair with a range of devices via Bluetooth.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble: </strong>Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power: </strong>Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></small></p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B08XY8H9D5?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo Pro 2</a> is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387041/overwatch-2-review-new-battle-pass-heroes-maps"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.</p><p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate-software.html">8BitDo’s Ultimate software</a>&nbsp;on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;for $50 (or $54.99 if you want the incredibly cool&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-bluetooth-controller-for-switch-pc-macos-android-steam-raspberry-pi-special-edition">translucent purple</a>&nbsp;version).</p><p><h3>An adapter that lets you use your own controllers</h3></p><div><p>8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 looks like a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch’s dock, it enables you to wirelessly pair it with a number of older PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.</p></div><p>There are many <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/7/18068220/gbros-wireless-adapter-gamecube-controller-nintendo-switch">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/24/16533008/nintendo-switch-gamecube-controller-support-update">devices</a> that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09M8CVMYF?tag=theverge02-20">$19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2</a> lets you turn a Bluetooth&nbsp;controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)</p><p>To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/Manual/USB-Adapter-2/xbox-switch.html">8BitDo has an extensive support page</a> that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.</p><p>If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKG18DR?tag=theverge02-20">and a USB hub</a>), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.</p><p><h3>Other Switch controllers you should know about</h3></p><div><ul><li>We like CRKD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review"><strong>Nitro Deck</strong></a> around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though, not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up <a href="https://crkd.gg/collections/allndp"><strong>Nitro Deck Plus</strong></a> adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).</li><li>We recently tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Wireless-Controller-Switch-Drifting-Nintendo/dp/B0CDX449NJ?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</strong></a> ($49.99) for consideration. It offers many of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit can’t claim. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.</li><li>We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>GameCube Style Wireless Controller</strong></a> ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Black/dp/B08DRRJBC6?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>PowerA Enhanced Wireless</strong></a><strong> </strong>($59.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.</li></ul></div><p><em><strong>Update, June 28th:</strong> Updated to include details on several new models we’ve tested, including the Gamesir T4 Cyclone Pro and PowerA’s GameCube Style Wireless Controller.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Amazon Games has many projects in the pipeline, but the two biggest ones are the next Tomb Raider game and the Lord of the Rings MMO, both of which are produced in partnership with franchises owned by the Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Those are massive IPs that may well interest millions of fans. However, it's been a while since we heard about any of those. The new Tomb Raider game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> to be in production (with Epic's Unreal Engine 5) in April 2022, while the publishing deal with Amazon was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in December of that year. As for the Lord of the Rings MMO (which Amazon was making before the deal <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canceled-due-to-contractual-dispute-between-tencent-and-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell through with Tencent</a> and had to be renegotiated with the Embracer Group once the latter company acquired Middle-earth Enterprises), the game was only <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked about briefly in May 2023</a>.</p>
<p>When can players expect to see them? According to Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann, recently interviewed <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-tomb-raider-lord-of-the-rings-1236046995/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Variety</a>, it shouldn't be that long, although neither project will be rushed.</p>
<p><em>It’s not going to be tomorrow, but it’s not too far away. As I said, we’re getting into a much more regular cadence of shipping games. That’s all I’m allowed to tell you right now… It’s all about quality. You don’t want to just be rushed out. That’s doesn’t work. It has to be Triple-A quality, because the bar is so high.</em></p>
<p>We've heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that Tomb Raider specifically should be released in less than a year, featuring an open world that protagonist Lara Croft will traverse with her motorcycle. If that's the case, a reveal at Gamescom or The Game Awards at the latest makes sense.</p>
<p>With Tomb Raider, Amazon is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing a new TV series for Prime Video.</a>&nbsp;Earlier rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that the universe would be connected between the games and the live action, but Christoph Hartmann seemed to dispel that notion in the Variety interview.</p>
<p><em>Obviously, we want to work much closer together, and we’ll be working much closer together with the different entertainment areas Amazon has and a very natural one is Prime Video. You see it with “Tomb Raider,” where we’re gonna have a “Tomb Raider” game coming and they’re doing a show. And some people say, “Oh, will they be linked together?” And I give them the example, look at “Spider-Man.” There’s amazing, amazing games. There’s great animated content, there’s great live-action, and everyone seems to be very happy with that. So it does not need to be always that everything is mingled together, but it’s really one brand, which really just shows for me why transmedia nowadays is so important, and how games is such a vital part.</em></p>
<p>As for the Lord of the Rings MMO, it may well be too late for that project to be intertwined with the TV series (which is getting its second season soon). As a reminder, we don't know much about this game other than it'll be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-very-different-from-new-world-will-use-a-next-gen-version-of-its-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on an enhanced version of the New World engine</a>, albeit with different priorities due to the specific intellectual property.</p>
<p>Overall, Hartmann said Amazon now has eight games in development, with the publisher aiming to get two or three out in a given year. This year's titles are probably <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> (out on September 17 on PC and consoles) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-brings-the-mmo-to-consoles-with-cross-play-new-10-player-raid-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World: Aeternum</a> (slated for October 15 on PC and consoles). Amazon also announced deals to publish Bandai Namco Online's Blue Protocol (although the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in a dire financial situation</a> and the game hasn't been mentioned by Amazon press releases in a long while), the next games <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-glowmade-horizon-zero-dawn-fable-battlefield-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Glowmade</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-to-publish-disruptive-games-multiplayer-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disruptive Games</a>, and Maverick Games, and two projects in development at the internal <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-amazon-montreal-studio-new-multiplayer-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montréal</a> and Bucharest studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24188110/megan-thee-stallion-otaku-hot-girl-jujutsu-kaisen-yuji-itadori-gojo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7rUk10">Yuji Itadori might just be a high schooler fighting for his life in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24084825/anime-awards-2024-winners-list-jujutsu-kaisen-demon-slayer-chainsaw-man"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>anime</a>, but now he’s caught the attention of a global star IRL. Rapper <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24091333/megan-thee-stallion-hot-girl-anime-inuyasha">Megan Thee Stallion</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23940797/megan-thee-stallion-halloween-cosplay-anime-taste-death-the-kid">official hot girl and anime lover</a> — shouts him out in a big way on her new album, <em>MEGAN</em>. Her song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USxIYOaIpig">Otaku Hot Girl</a>,” contains an introduction narrated by the English voice actor of Itadori and numerous references to <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>and other anime. </p>
<p id="Rxxtt3">Megan Thee Stallion released <em>MEGAN</em> on Friday. Fans quickly took note of the introduction of “Otaku Hot Girl,” which starts with a voiced introduction from Adam McArthur, the voice actor of Yuji Itadori in the English dub of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>in addition to <a href="https://x.com/lesbianmista/status/1806550400343880028">sampling a tune</a> from the anime. In the song, McArthur says in the voice of Itadori that he likes, “a tall woman with a nice big ass, like Grammy winner Megan Thee Stallion,” and references other characters from the series by name, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24040106/usher-gojo-satoru-cosplay-jujutsu-kaisen-anime">like Gojo Satoru</a>. </p>
<p id="xDAODd">The introduction references a viral fan moment within the <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>fandom. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H80iK0EMq2Q">official English dub</a>, another character asks Itadori who his type is and he says, “A tall woman with a nice big ass. Just saying, Jennifer Lawrence.” Based on this, fans popularized the idea that Itadori would also have a crush on Megan, since she could be his type and because she is a known anime fan. In response, Adam McArthur shared an audio clip on X in 2021 where he rerecorded the line and replaced the name Jennifer Lawrence with Megan Thee Stallion. The clip later became popular and widely used on social media platforms like TikTok and the idea that Itadori could have a crush on Megan has become widely accepted by fans. And now, the track has prompted excitement among fans as people share viral <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kaludiasays/video/7385414157027298591">reaction videos on TikTok</a>. </p>

<p id="nQ5uvO">But the song’s anime references aren’t limited to just Itadori, the lyrics also mention things like<em> </em>Gojo’s domain expansion powers and Sasuke from <em>Naruto</em>. However, the singer encountered trouble with this track. The musician said she had to rerecord the track a few days before the album release because she didn’t get clearance to use the characters’ names in her song. “I really hope y’all think this shit sound fire because I had to jump through 8 million hoops to get this shit,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@biran337/video/7384949254210506030">she said in an Instagram live</a>. </p>
<p id="gkhDji">The track oozes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24054429/megan-thee-stallion-hiss-tokyo-ghoul-anime-meaning">Megan’s love for anime</a>. Still, the artist has had to deal with fans who think she’s a fake fan despite her repeated participation in several anime fandoms. In her years as a star, she has become known for her <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23940797/megan-thee-stallion-halloween-cosplay-anime-taste-death-the-kid">incredible cosplays</a> and referenced <em>Naruto</em> in one of her breakout hits, “Girls in the Hood.”  Now, this song allows her to respond to skeptics. In one line she talks about how she won’t be bothered by people with anime avatars online. She sings, “I’m not finna argue with a Sasuke avi/Incel mad, I’m a weeb and a baddie.” </p>
<p id="HTdCvX">So if you want to rock out to some anime-inspired lyrics “Otaku Hot Girl” is out to listeners now. </p>

In response, Okamura responded: “Wow, okay. I can see we’re starting with a tough one, huh.” </p><p>“Well, it’s not my place to answer on behalf of anyone outside the company, or to guess how they might feel about it,” said Okamura. “But just speaking for myself, personally, I’d like nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again. If that could happen, that would be the dream.”</p><p>However, Okamura isn’t pretending as if that will ever happen, clarifying that “people have moved on to new things” and “that’s just our current reality.” <br></p><p>“We can’t just take it for granted that everyone would work with us again, or let ourselves be completely dependent on them. I just don’t think it’s right for us to be the ones to make that kind of demand of anyone. So we’re working with the expectation that whatever we make, it’s up to us, it’s on our shoulders to do a good job,” said Okamura. </p><p>The <em>MGS</em> producer also addressed fan concerns that Kojima and the original developers of <em>Snake Eater</em> would not be included in <em>Delta</em>’s credits. </p><p>“Mr. Kojima and all the original development staff are of course credited for their original roles. They were already included in the <em>Master Collection</em>, and they’ll be listed in [<em>Delta</em>] as well. They’re a part of these games too, so absolutely, they’re in.”</p><p>The answers from Okamura feel oddly honest and transparent, something that is becoming increasingly rare among big publishers and developers. I’m sort of shocked Konami kept this in the final edit, but I’m happy to see the publisher is letting Delta’s devs speak openly about Kojima and the <em>MGS </em>franchise. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-permanent-injuries-1851529537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-permanent-injuries-1851529537"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a></span><em> </em>launches sometime later this year on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, the individual responsible for disrupting several Nintendo events has confessed to his actions. <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OatmealDome</a> on Twitter spotted a 27-year-old man admitting to sending threats to Nintendo due to his frustration with games. The prosecution is seeking at least a one-year imprisonment for the wrongdoer.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>[Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO]</p><p>A 27 year old man accused of sending 39 bomb threats to Nintendo recently appeared at trial.</p><p>He admitted to the charges: "The more I lost [in Splatoon 3], the more frustrated I would become."</p><p>The prosecution is seeking a 1 year prison sentence. <a href="https://t.co/93ShXbDeYq">https://t.co/93ShXbDeYq</a></p></div>— OatmealDome (@OatmealDome) <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1806527226935959710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ktv.jp/news/articles/?id=13276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kansai Television News</a>, Kenshin Kazama confessed to sending threats to Nintendo at a trial on June 26, 2024. He tried to justify his actions by explaining that he sent the messages when he was feeling stressed and irritated from losing in a game. – Now that’s stupid.</p>



<p>Kazama sent 39 threats to Nintendo between August and November 2023, including messages like “I will kill everyone involved. Be careful about events with spectators,” which led to several event cancellations and disrupted Nintendo’s business.</p>



<p>The prosecution revealed that Kazama caused damage worth ¥700 million or around $4.3 million. They have stated that the situation is “serious” and “there is no room for leniency for a childish motive.” The prosecution has requested at least a one-year prison sentence for Kazama to learn from his actions. The final verdict will be revealed on July 24, 2024.</p>



<p>Conclusion: Do not send threats to Nintendo, or anyone for that matter. </p>



<p>In other news, pre-orders for games showcased at the Nintendo Direct June 2024 event are now live, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-now-available-for-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-and-luigi-brothership-pre-orders-are-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-can-pre-order-super-mario-party-jamboree-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>

The overall rating number represents the quality of the entire team, using both offensive and defensive parameters to determine it. </p><p>College Football 25's top-rated team is the University of Georgia (UGA), which has an overall team rating of 95. UGA's overall team rating should not be entirely surprising to some, as we learned yesterday that UGA was ranked the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-best-offensive-teams">top offensive team</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-best-defensive-teams">second-best defensive team</a> in College Football 25. Additionally, we learned earlier this week that UGA's Sanford Stadium was ranked number five in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-toughest-places-to-play">the top 25 toughest places to play in College Football 25</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Alongside UGA, seven additional teams have a team overall rating of 90 or higher, including Ohio State (93 overall), Texas (92 overall), and LSU (90 overall). The full list is available below. </p><p>College Football 25 is the first game in the college football gaming franchise since 2013's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ncaa-football-14">NCAA Football 14</a>. Most notably, College Football 25 marks the first time <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ncaa-football-players-comments">real-life student-athletes</a> are being used, with all 134 FBS schools confirmed to be featured in the game in some capacity, such as stadium traditions and mascots. Additionally, college bowl games, awards such as the Heisman Trophy, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-road-to-glory-mode-nil">Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals</a> are featured in College Football 25. </p><p>College Football 25 will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date">be released on July 19</a> for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

Or maybe you're looking to run a few Grandmaster Nightfalls and increase your odds of success. Whatever the reason, roaming arms dealer Xur is sure to have something that'll catch your eye. Here's a closer look at what Xur has for sale this weekend.</p><p>For his weapons, Xur is offering the Exotic catalysts for <strong>Polaris Lance </strong>and <strong>Jotunn</strong>. Hunters can pick up <strong>St0mp-EE5</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Peregrine Greaves</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Skull of Dire Ahamkara</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326484-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326484" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326484-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326484"></a><figcaption>Xur's new location inside the Tower.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326484-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44. Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

All shoulder-charge abilities deal bonus damage when activated in the air, and damaging tough opponents like mini-bosses and Tormentors with one of those attacks will refund energy to that ability. Appropriately, strength is the highest stat on these Exotic boots, mobility will give you that extra bit of speed, and resilience isn't too bad either. It's not a bad roll at all, making this Exotic worth picking up this weekend.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 16</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 20</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 64</li></ul><h3>Stomp-EE5 (Exotic Hunter leg armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326706-destiny22024-06-2819-06-56.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326706-destiny22024-06-2819-06-56.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326706"></a><figcaption>St0mp-EE5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326706-destiny22024-06-2819-06-56.jpg"></figure><p>A favorite for Hunters in the Crucible, St0mp-EE5 increases sprint speed and slide distance, improves several jump abilities, and allows you to take reduced damage from targets when you're airborne. Most of the stats on this roll are pretty well-balanced--although strength is quite low--so this is a pretty good version of the Exotic leg armor to grab ahead of next week's Iron Banner PvP event.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 68</li></ul><h3>Skull of Dire Ahamkara (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326707-destiny22024-06-2819-07-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326707" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326707-destiny22024-06-2819-07-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326707"></a><figcaption>Skull of Dire Ahamkara</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4326707-destiny22024-06-2819-07-13.jpg"></figure><p>A Warlock classic, Skull of Dire Ahamkara gives the space-wizards extra resistance to damage as they charge up and fire off a Nova Bomb. Landing the Super will also refund some energy back to your Warlock, depending on the number of kills. Void Warlock builds are pretty popular now, and with Pale Heart weapons allowing you to quickly charge your Super ability, this is a great Exotic to grab. The crucial Intellect stat is the highest here, while resilience and recovery are pretty good as well. Strength could be better, but it's not often that we see Xur offer a Skull of Dire Ahamkara helmet with mostly good stats like this.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 19</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 67</li></ul><h2>Exotic Weapon Catalysts</h2><h3>Jotunn</h3><p>Faster charge time or draw time when surrounded by combatants.

His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

And with its striking new Fortnite design, it's even more enticing. Along with the cool graphics, you're getting six dedicated macro keys, a media roller and secondary media keys, and Yellow Switches that are linear and silent. This full-sized keyboard also includes a numpad and function keys, giving you all the inputs you'll need for gaming, streaming, and working.</p><hr><h2>Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro - Fortnite Edition</h2><h3>$170</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326614-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%281%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326614" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326614-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%281%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326614"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326614-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%281%29%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>This ultra-lightweight mouse clocks in at just 63 grams, making it a great companion for fast-paced shooters or the demanding building mechanics of Fortnite. With a 1,000Hz polling rate, Razer Focus Pro 30K Optical Sensor, and two programmable side buttons, it's a great all-around gaming mouse. It supports both wired and wireless connections, with a battery powerful enough to get up to 90 hours of game time when running at 1,000Hz and up to 17 hours at 8,000Hz. Its switch is rated for 90 million clicks, so it should last you a (very) long time before needing a replacement.</p><hr><h2>Razer Goliathus Extended Chroma - Fortnite Edition</h2><h3>$100</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326615-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%282%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326615" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326615-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%282%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326615"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326615-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%282%29%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Need something to pull together your battlestation? This massive desk mat is a great option, as it gets you vibrant Fortnite graphics along with premium materials that elevate your gaming space. Clocking in at just over 36 inches wide and nearly 12 inches tall, it's perfect for the BlackWidow and DeathAdder listed above. The micro-textured cloth surface helps pick up even the smallest mouse movement, and it's a much more comfortable place for your hands than the hard surface of your desk.</p><hr><h2>Razer Kraken V3 X - Fortnite Edition</h2><h3>$100</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326616-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%284%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326616" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326616-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%284%29%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326616"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4326616-httpshybrismediaprod.blob.core.w%284%29%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The last Razer x Fornite gadget up for grabs is the Razer Kraken V3 X. Built with 40mm drivers for booming audio, the Razer HyperClear Cardioid Mic for crisp voice chat, and comfortable memory foam ear cushions, it's a good-looking and relatively affordable headset. It's also pretty light at 285 grams, so it should remain comfortable no matter how long you're gaming.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>For years, telling friends about The Legend of Heroes games has felt less like recommending a cool new RPG and more like assigning Summer homework. Hyping up a game in this franchise comes with the caveat that you need to play every entry in order so you can fully understand the story, but when you’re talking about over a dozen 80+ hour JRPGs, that isn’t an easy ask. It’s why I’ve been so excited for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak to get an English release, and so frustrated that it’s taken so many years for it to happen. In a world where games that were once niche Japan-only titles now get synchronised global releases, the delayed release of this new entry point in a long-running franchise has likely lost much of its momentum for a potential global audience. That isn’t fair at all, when this is one of the most engaging and enjoyable new JRPGs I’ve ever played.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzbJsCpSZEE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak takes place in the Republic of Calvard, a country far east from the main locales from the last handful of The Legend of Heroes games. You won’t be expected to know what happened in previous games, who their protagonists were, or what the dozens of characters in those games may or may not be up to when you start this one.</p>


<p>You’re given a clean slate in the form of new series lead Van Arkride, who works a day-job as a humble Spriggan. Essentially, he’s Columbo with a license to kill – clients come to him looking for a detective, a bounty hunter, or a combo of the two. When a young girl by the name of Agnes Claudel comes to him seeking help in tracking down seven mementos from her great-grandfather, Van ends up taking her in as an assistant and the two of them set off on a conspiracy-unfurling journey through the seedy city of Edith and beyond.</p>
<p>Typically,&nbsp;protagonists in The Legend of Heroes live up to that “hero” moniker, with a lot of them being plucky young swordsmen with a lawful moral compass and plenty to learn about the dark secrets of their world. Van isn’t like that at all, and it ends up being such a breath of fresh air to play as a protagonist who isn’t just bucking the trends of his franchise, but of the JRPG genre as a whole.</p>


<p>Working as a detective-slash-fixer means that Van knows every dirty little secret about the city of Edith and the people who occupy it’s seedy underbelly. He has connections to secretive factions like Oroboros, and no qualms with taking on jobs that are slightly on the wrong side of being illegal. At the same time, he does his best to protect Agnes and his other inexperienced companions from being too exposed to the shadier sides of his business. Striking that balance as he tackles underground mafias and scientific conspiracies is incredible storytelling, and it’s a thrill whether you’re a longtime fan or fresh to the franchise.</p>
<p>A lot of other aspects of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak are a fresh glow-up from prior entries. This game utilizes a brand new engine, resulting in lots of much-needed improvements to the gameplay experience. Character models look better than ever, and the dynamic cutscene animations we had just a taste of in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/30/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review/">The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie</a> are dialled up even further in this game. There’s a much better sense of connectivity and seamless exploration to the game, too – you’ll encounter far fewer loading screens than usual as you run around the streets of Edith, and you can enter and exit houses or stores seamlessly without any loading screens. It’s small stuff, but stuff that has been long overdue for a franchise that’s been running on dated technology for so long.</p>

<p>Most exciting to me of all the changes and upgrades in The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, though, is the combat. There are two different combat modes in the game – real-time action combat like you’d experience in modern Ys games, and positional turn-based battles that feel just like combat from prior entries in the series. You can choose to use one mode or the other as much as you want, with the exception of boss battles that are only turn-based in nature.</p>
<p>The game smartly rewards you for swapping between the two regularly styles – damaging enemies enough in real-time combat will stun them, and if you switch into turn-based battle from there they’ll take increased damage and have delayed turns. It’s something I genuinely wish other JRPGs could implement. I’m a massive action-combat fan, and I also appreciate turn-based battles, but in long games they can both get a little repetitive. Having the ability to swap between the two so often kept me on my toes and excited to play all the way until the credits rolled.</p>

<p>Inevitably, a sequel to The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak will require some knowledge of prior games to fully appreciate the narrative web they’re weaving. As far as this title alone, goes, it’s an amazing starting point for anyone, and a genuinely captivating and exciting JRPG in its own right. It isn’t just easy to recommend this game because it’s a standalone adventure – it’s easy to recommend because it’s just that good.</p>

            <p>
The developer of Concord, Sony's upcoming PlayStation 5 and PC hero shooter, has discussed how it will handle the game's monetisation - and why the game requires a PSN account log-in on PC. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell earlier this month, Concord developer Firewalk explained the game's relatively cheap £35/$40 price point, and said it was a fair proposition for the amount of content the title contained. 
</p>
<p>
"When you buy the game, you get... the 16 characters, 12 maps, six modes," Firewalk's director of IP Kim Kreines said. "Every season, all that seasonal content, that's all free.

<p>
"There's additional cosmetic-only customisation options where you can further personalise your characters' looks - this isn't gameplay, this is only cosmetic - that you can purchase, and that will come out seasonally as well."
</p>
<p>
Seasonal content will remain free for the time being, with added characters, maps, modes and worlds, and weekly cinematic shorts expanding the game's lore.
</p>
<p>
Concord was fully detailed at Sony's State of Play last month, where its five-versus-five PVP gameplay was first glimpsed. A hero shooter like Overwatch, it has a narrative style and colourful cast of characters that seems influenced by James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy.
</p>
<p>
A cross-platform game for both PC and PS5, Concord will once again feature a PSN account requirement on both platforms. This has been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">point of contention</a> for past PlayStation-published releases, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-official-review-bomb-cape-seemingly-gets-an-airing-as-psn-drama-subsides">most notably Helldivers</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-developer-wants-you-to-know-you-can-play-it-on-steam-without-linking-to-a-psn-account">Ghost of Tsushima, meanwhile, will let you play without a PSN account as long as you're offline</a>. So what were the reasons behind it being necessary again here?
</p>
<p>
"That allows us to have cross play, that cross progression, that's that's an important piece of it," Kreines said when asked.
</p>
<p>
"The goal is for players to come together," lead character designer Jon Weisnewski added. "And so for us to have PC players and PlayStation 5 players together, for that cross-play and cross-progression to work, that's a layer that needs to be there - just on a technical level. So the goal is we want to get players together, to have fun and play together, this is part of that experience."
</p>
<p>
"Concord feels like a load of brilliant games combined - but is that enough?" our Chris Tapsell wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">hands-on with the game</a>. "My fingers are crossed for this one being given enough time to find its identity on the fly."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dr Disrespect’s YouTube channel has been demonetized. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, YouTube spokesperson Nicole Bell wrote, “We have suspended monetization on DrDisrespect’s channel for violating our Creator Responsibility policy.” Bell also wrote that Dr Disrespect has been suspended from <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">YouTube’s partner program</a> “following serious allegations against the creator.”</p><p>The allegations refer to multiple reports that the streamer, whose real name is Guy Beahm, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">was banned from Twitch in 2020</a> due to inappropriate messages sent to a minor through Whispers, a Twitch communication app. When Beahm was banned, neither he nor Twitch explained the reason, leaving it a mystery for four years. Late last week, however, Cody Conners, a former Twitch employee, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">posted on X the alleged reason for Beahm’s ban</a>. “He got banned because got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product,” Conners wrote. “He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon.”</p><div><p><em>The Verge</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">was able to corroborate Conners’ post with information from a second ex-Twitch employee</a> who was on the trust and safety team at the time of the incident. In a <em>Bloomberg</em> report, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-25/youtuber-dr-disrespect-was-allegedly-kicked-off-twitch-for-messaging-minor?sref=9YEaDeJj">two more Twitch employees also came forward</a> to corroborate the allegations.</p></div><p>After Conners’ tweet, Beahm <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955">denied the accusations</a>, posting on X, “This has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged and they paid out the whole contract,” referring to a financial dispute Beahm settled against Twitch back in 2021. However, as multiple brands including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-dr-disrespect-fallout-continues-as-2k-games-turtle-beach-the-nfl-and-others-cut-ties-with-the-disgraced-streamer/">Turtle Beach</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185172/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-termination">Midnight Society</a> — a game studio Beahm co-founded — began to distance themselves from the creator, Beahm took to social media again to defend himself. </p><p>“Were there Twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017?&nbsp;The answer is yes,” <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089">Beahm wrote on X</a>, saying that those messages, “sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.”</p><p>Beahm closed the statement by saying he planned to take an extended vacation but would eventually return to streaming. After getting banned from Twitch, Beahm started a YouTube channel in August 2020 that currently boasts over 4 million subscribers. In <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/dr-disrespect-inappropriate-messages-minor-twitch-1235048071/">a report for <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, Ryan Wyatt, former head of YouTube’s gaming partnerships, said that YouTube declined to give Beahm a partnership deal when he joined the platform because of the rumors surrounding his exit from Twitch. Partnership deals, like the kind enjoyed by other YouTube creators like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves">Valkyrae</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal">DrLupo</a>, would have granted Beahm access to special YouTube resources and monetization features as well as ad revenue sharing.</p><p>“Because of those rumors, there was no reason to entertain doing any deal with [Beahm],” Wyatt said to <em>Rolling Stone</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24187720/the-boys-hughie-simon-pegg-dad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ORTzcw"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24176428/the-boys-season-4-review-new"><em>The Boys</em></a> is full of death, but little grieving. Since season 1, Homelander has laser-blasted bystanders, punched Vought underlings through the chest, and ripped apart fellow supes nearly once an episode. The violence is so over the top that the loss of innocent life never really sinks in beyond “Good lord, someone needs to stop that guy!” It’s a bit of a miracle; each week, showrunner Eric Kripke and his team of writers and directors ride the edge(lord) between gleeful shock value and grotesque reality. There is no show that has made me yelp out loud more times than <em>The Boys</em>.</p>
<p id="H9YDUo">Which is why season 4 episode 5, “Beware the Jabberwock, My Son,” floored me. The episode is full of standard <em>Boys</em> absurdity, from the Marvel-at-Comic-Con parody of the V52 Expo to a standoff against Compound V-enhanced sheep. But through the mayhem, writer Judalina Neira and director Shana Stein swerve into a grim scene: Hughie (Jack Quaid) discovering that his estranged mother injected his dying father, Hughie Sr. (Simon Pegg), with stolen Compound V. Hughie almost gave the shot himself, a last-ditch effort to save his dad through superhuman means, but in the end threw the dose away, knowing long-term consequences all too well. His mom didn’t — and despite Hughie Sr. bouncing back for a moment, all hell quickly breaks loose.</p>
<p id="KeU6X9">Pegg’s screen time only amounts to 15 or 20 minutes of an hour-long episode, but it feels painfully long, in the way that standing by a declining loved one in those final years, months, or even days can feel. The Compound V causes Hughie Sr. to immediately lose control of his body, but instead of breaking a hip or having an accident, he teleports into a nearby patient’s torso, exploding blood and guts around the room. Hughie Sr. phases in and out of awareness of his actions. When he’s on, he’s in shock — <em>how did he wind up holding a human heart?</em> Hughie, who has seen these horrors before, remains calm… until it dawns on him that he’s never seen <em>this</em> horror before: his father, a simple but healthy man up until this point, completely breaking down.</p>

<p id="aiCxkj">A few weeks before <em>The Boys</em> season 4 premiered, my own grandmother’s years-long descent into dementia and pain ended with an abrupt bout of pneumonia that I can only imagine ended her suffering. The road to getting there was filled with unending care from her family and friends, who wanted to give her all the time she deserved, and many bumps in the road that could have very well been the end. So I was in A Helluva Place when I turned on “Beware the Jabberwock, My Son” and saw the entire saga of elder care flash through the mania of <em>The Boys</em> — and felt very terrifyingly right. Nothing prepares you for the shock of someone you’ve known for your entire life forgetting your name. </p>
<p id="BK9ehG">Pegg spent most of season 4 lying unconscious in a bed, breathing through tubes. At first I thought this was a cheeky gag for a franchise always willing to honor the actor. Pegg, after all, was <em>The Boys</em> comic artist Darick Robertson’s inspiration for the original Hughie, and his role in the show was stunt casting at its best. But Hughie Sr. popping back to life in “Beware the Jabberwock, My Son” is another cruel and familiar tease — there is no hope ahead in these circumstances. This was Pegg’s sendoff. </p>
<p id="ss1Chi">As the guy constantly shrieking while covered in blood, Jack Quaid doesn’t get enough credit for processing the ethical dilemmas of <em>The Boys</em> with a lighthearted touch. Next to Pegg, who’s never been so vulnerable on screen, Quaid tenderly reframes a question his character considers throughout the season: Will Hughie take a life to solve a problem? Most episodes, Hughie’s weighing the assassination of overpowered superheroes. In “Beware the Jabberwock, My Son,” he’s confronted with euthanizing his own father. Based on what he witnesses, there is no hesitation.</p>
<p id="om8KgU">“If we don’t do this,” he tells his mother, “then he spends the rest of his life scared and confused or in prison or an asylum or he kills more innocent people.”</p>
<p id="o4jMc2">The subplot isn’t Michael Haneke’s <em>Amour</em>, but it lands thanks to the ethereal quality of Pegg’s performance and Quaid’s commitment to playing all the sides of Hughie as Hughie. This is neither actor’s waterworks-cranking Oscar clip moment. It’s <em>The Boys</em>, subdued, and most important of all, a true end-of-life experience — one person fading away, and his family wondering where they go from there. There’s a whole Vought nightmare out the hospital door for Hughie; he feels it as he delivers a fatal injection to his father. But for one second all the chaos of <em>The Boys</em> fades away, and two men have a moment. A death with just a little grieving. </p>

<p>With the instability and uncertainty in the gaming industry still at an all-time high, another game studio is trying to unionize. In a series of <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posts on Twitter</a> earlier this week, Bethesda Game Studios Montreal has announced its intention to form a union with help from the Communications Workers of America (CWA) Canada.</p>



<p>Along with the general announcement, the studio workers laid out their reasons for filing for the certification with the Quebec Labor Board.</p>



<p>“As a union, we will strive to make BGS a supportive workplace that fosters creativity and talent,” they said. “This will allow us to keep creating some of the best video games in the industry in the jobs and at the studio we all love.”</p>



<p>They continued: “Having a seat at the table will ensure job security as well as improve transparency, accountability, flexibility and more. We aim to make sure everyone receives fair compensation for their work and the value they provide.”</p>



<p>By forming a union, they said, it will allow them to work to “push for the changes that reflect the needs and the wants of all developers.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, Zenimax nor Microsoft have commented on the unionization efforts. Bethesda Montreal joins other unions within Microsoft and Zenimax.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-group-sells-all-distribution-businesses-to-bergsala-ndp<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Divestment was announced to shareholders in May, transaction has completed today</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Thunderful's restructuring continues as the group divests all of its distribution businesses to become a "pure-play games company," with a newly-incorporated iteration of Bergsala picking up the affected subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Bergsala NDP AB has acquired Amo Toys, Bergsala Aktiebolag, Thunderful 1 and Thunderful Solutions from the group. The deal was announced to shareholders and investors on May 21, and has been completed today.</p>
<p>This version of Bergsala is owned by Owe Bergsten, Thunderful's largest shareholder and board member.</p>
<p>It means the remaining Thunderful company is comprised solely of games businesses, including developers Coatsink, Jumpship, and SteamWorld creator Image &amp; Form, as well as publisher Rising Star Games, and investment firm Robot Teddy.</p>
<p>The divestment follows Thunderful's announcement in January that it would be <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-announces-restructuring-that-will-cut-20-of-its-workforce">restructuring the company, including cutting 20% of its workforce</a>. It has already <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-selling-headup-for-500k">sold German developer and publisher Headup</a> for €500,000, as well as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-selling-nordic-game-supply-to-distributors-acting-ceo">Nordic Game Supply</a>, which was another of its distribution businesses.</p>
<p>The Thunderful Group was formed in December 2019 by merging Thunderful with Bergsala. The latter is best known as Nintendo's exclusive distributor for the Nordic and Baltic regions – a deal that has been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-extends-distribution-agreement-with-nintendo">extended to March 31, 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Weaker sales of Switch hardware as the console nears the end of its lifecycle were <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-ceo-says-restructure-is-off-to-a-good-start-as-it-reports-full-year-loss-of-60m">cited as a key factor</a> in Thunderful Group's full-year loss of SEK 609.4 million ($57 million). However, prior to this, Bergsala's Nintendo revenues were a major contributor to the group's success.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mika-and-the-witchs-mountain">Mika and The Witch's Mountain</a> appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bG17OYs-GA">Kiki's Delivery Service</a>, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a "mini open world" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The early access build (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1819460/Mika_and_The_Witchs_Mountain/">Steam page here</a>) will ship with the full main story of the game, encompassing 36 individual deliveries and 18 sidequests. That's around five hours of play, with 18 main characters. You can also customise Mika with different outfits, and accessorise her broom with charms and trails. I, for one, would like to equip a siren and a disco ball. The broom can't be weaponised, but it can be upgraded, and upgrade it you must if you want to reach the mountain's summit.</p>
<p>The press release promises that if you pull off "perfect deliveries" you will receive "unimaginable treasures". I don't know mate, I can imagine a lot of crazy things. For example, a broomstick with a siren and a disco ball. </p>
<p>The developers are also planning a free update which allows you to pet animals (a black cat, surely), go fishing while flying around, and participate in some kind of Churro Express minigame. We can also expect additional sidequests and dungeons which will flesh out the "hidden side" of the mountain.</p>
<p>Kiki's Delivery Service aside, Mika And The Witch's Mountain puts me in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">Brew Barons</a>, in which you are an utter maniac who insists on doing every single thing using aeroplanes.</p>

In previews and trailers leading up to its release, HoYoverse has emphasized the game’s combat as the biggest draw. The recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACgiN-216s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACgiN-216s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-release special program</a></span> went deep on combat and showed off just how spectacular it looks. As opposed to the real-time action of <em>Genshin Impact</em> (which can be pretty simplistic), <em>ZZZ </em>looks to offer a more in-depth battle system with normal, special, sub, combo, and assist attacks that let players mix and match their party makeup to deal massive damage. Without getting into the nitty gritty, it seems like a welcome upgrade to the combat of<em> Genshin Impact </em>and comes just in time to compete with the combat prowess of gacha competitor<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wuthering-waves-gacha-impressions-mobile-pc-1851507263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wuthering-waves-gacha-impressions-mobile-pc-1851507263"><em>Wuthering Waves</em></a></span>.</p><p>Alongside its focus on combat, HoYoverse also wants players to be able to progress through <em>ZZZ</em>’s story<em> </em>at a brisker pace than they often can in the company’s other games. Typically in those games, you constantly need to do daily quests to gather upgrade materials to make your characters more powerful before you can take on the newest story quests. (Of course, this is by design, so that players are tempted to spend money and make the upgrade process faster.) The <em>ZZZ </em>team, however, is making some big promises about how it will avoid the usual <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-enjoy-mobile-game-gr-1822341702&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-enjoy-mobile-game-gr-1822341702">gacha grind</a></span>, a move rooted in two big design decisions. </p><p>The first is the removal of the stamina system which was present in earlier betas. This system made it so you could only do so many story missions in a day, creating an artificial hard limit on how far players could progress. Thankfully that is now removed (as noted by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/oh-no-zenless-zone-zero-is-good-now&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oh-no-zenless-zone-zero-is-good-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span><em> </em>in its most recent preview). More notable is a character trial system that will give players access to properly leveled party members for story missions. This removes the need to always have your collection of characters perfectly upgraded and equipped with the proper gear. </p><p>With this system, it sounds like players will essentially be able to play through the story like you can in a typical, non-gacha game. I’m reminded of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/honkai-impact-3rd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/honkai-impact-3rd"><em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em></a></span>, another HoYoverse game that implemented story trial characters later in its life to great effect. Just a week ago, <em>ZZZ</em>’s producer Zhenyu Li talked about not punishing players who want to take a break from the game. “Maybe the team will try to get some new ways to let [returning players] experience the latest content without finishing some pre-conditioned missions,” Li told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/zenless-zone-zero-lets-you-take-breaks-from-the-daily-grind&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/zenless-zone-zero-lets-you-take-breaks-from-the-daily-grind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VG247</em></a></span>. These systems seem to allow for precisely that.</p><p>Some might wonder how a simplified path through the story can exist alongside the traditional gacha mechanics. However, with a high emphasis on combat intricacies in moment-to-moment gameplay, I think most players will still find upgrading and unlocking new characters to be its own satisfying loop, even if they can run through the story at their own pace. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We didn't get to Sandfall and Kepler Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> during our coverage of Microsoft's summer showcase, a couple of weeks ago. If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witchy-swampy-action-adventure-south-of-midnight-gets-a-proper-gameplay-trailer-with-island-sized-alligators">writing up South Of Midnight</a>, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-comes-rampaging-in-on-a-chainsaw-shield-next-year">the debut of Doom: Dark Ages</a> that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land</a> and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-of-war-e-day-takes-the-series-back-to-the-start-of-the-locust-war-complete-with-a-nod-to-mad-world">Locust sinkhole</a> while "omnimanouevring" around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-a-release-date-for-the-end-of-october-open-beta-on-the-way">Black Ops 6</a>. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this "evolution of JRPGs", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.</p><!--more-->

<p>"Once a year, the Paintress wakes and paints upon her monolith," goes the Steam blurb. "Paints her cursed number. And everyone of that age turns to smoke and fades away. Year by year, that number ticks down and more of us are erased. Tomorrow she'll wake and paint '33.' And tomorrow we depart on our final mission - Destroy the Paintress, so she can never paint death again. We are Expedition 33." Excellent! This is the kind of early-thirties moxie and momentum that saves a world, though I would quite like to play a spin-off game starring the sprightly firecrackers of Expedition 69 and the embarrassing midlifers of Expedition 39.</p>
<p>Expedition 33 takes place in a world inspired by Belle Époque France - the period approximately running from 1871 to 1914, when you couldn't move for art nouveau, cabaret dancers and Baudelairean ennui. It was during this period that the Eiffel Tower was built - you can see it in the screenshot there, though it seems to have melted. Doubtless that Paintress is to blame. She's incorrigible!</p>

</figure>
<p>As for how you go about nobbling the Paintress, this is a blend of party and turn-based combat with certain actions seemingly performed in real-time - a performance that reminds me of Lost Odyssey, and which threatens to invoke the dread word "QTE". There's a world map with locations including the Island of Visages and the Forgotten Battlefield, which have hidden quests and other secrets to discover. While there are named story characters - Gustave and Maelle appear to be the stars - you'll also get to recruit "special companions" and "allies of fortune", while following in the footsteps of previous expeditions.</p>
<p>My reservations about the tightrope the combat is walking aside, I think this looks hella swank and damnably cool. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/">the Steam page</a> - it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

  <p id="HDk8cG">There’s no shortage of quality mobile games in 2024, and it can be hard to sift through the sheer number of games downloadable on your phone. That’s where we come in: Over the years, we’ve filled up our phones with mobile games to find the best games across genres. Looking for a hidden object game? A unique tower defense title? A turn-based RPG or classic side-scrolling runner? </p>
<p id="HJfQPp">Let’s dig into the best mobile games you can download today. Most of these games are available on both Android and iOS devices. Lots of them are free to download, with in-game purchases to unlock more game time or extra items. But others require an additional subscription service, like Apple Arcade or Netflix. Our latest update added <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em>, <em>Loop Hero</em>, and <em>Crying Suns</em>.</p>

<p id="v8mps9">The lo-fi roguelike<em> Loop Hero</em> distills the hours-long gameplay loops of most RPGs into a few utterly intoxicating minutes. As your chosen hero travels automatically along a preset path, they’ll automatically battle monsters that award loot that you apply between encounters. Each completed trip gives you an opportunity to return with your resources or press onward to encounter tougher enemies for greater rewards. —<em>AJ</em></p>

<p id="TEGtCc"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on Android and iOS</p>
<p id="oAVgv8">A grim, sci-fi roguelike full of interesting, weighty decisions, <em>Crying Suns</em> feels like a more narrative-driven version of perhaps one of the best sci-fi roguelikes ever, <em>FTL</em>. You take on the role of an admiral who’s emerged from stasis to find the empire they once served in shambles. Take control of the last remaining ship of your fleet as you balance your resources while attempting to outrun those responsible for this galactic collapse and piece together what happened. —<em>AJ</em></p>

<p id="rMHsWe"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on iOS via Apple Arcade or Netflix</p>
<p id="Fy2IE8">Simply put, <em>Krispee Street</em> is a hidden object game — its crowded visuals hide lots of little details to seek out, some of which tell little stories within the contained worlds. There’s so much to love about the silly, colorful art style and the characters that inhabit the world, which is based on a webcomic. (I hadn’t heard of the webcomic before getting into <em>Krispee Street</em>, so don’t let unfamiliarity scare you off.) Despite <em>Krispee Street</em> being visually chaotic with hundreds of things — characters and objects — to find within its margins, I would describe the experience of playing the game as anything but.</p>
<p id="GJLLgZ">When I want a mobile game that’s absolutely chill, I pull up <em>Krispee Street</em> and get inspecting. —<em>Nicole Carpenter</em></p>
<h2 id="IUMQ9x"><strong>Gubbins</strong></h2>

<p id="UpcX3x">I saw someone <a href="https://twitter.com/folly_studio/status/1725116076223307808">describe <em>Gubbins</em></a> as “<em>Scrabble</em> on acid,” and yeah, that checks out. Studio Folly’s word game is a more laid-back version of <em>Scrabble</em>, but with pesky little creatures — the gubbins — that help or hurt the board. Like in <em>Scrabble</em>, you start with a bunch of letters (using them reveals more letters, until you run out) to lay out on your board to make words for points. You want to amass a lot of points by using your letters (and gubbins) creatively. Some of the modifiers will fill in letters automatically, for instance, or lock up parts of the board. It’s one of those games that’s easy to play but harder to master, making it a mobile game that I often come back to. Plus, the colors and music simply rule. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="WsC76Q"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23696522/honkai-star-rail-review-release-hoyoverse"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> is the reason I make sure my phone is well charged before leaving for a day out. <em>Genshin Impact </em>creator Hoyoverse released this gacha game last spring, and I have found it to be the perfect game to play while out and about. This <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23702693/honkai-star-rail-funniest-joke-trash-can-meme">goofy sci-fi RPG</a> has turn-based combat that feels great on my phone’s small screen. And I like that I can sync progress as I play on PC and my iPad so I can easily chip away at regular tasks. </p>
<p id="Ac0U8L"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> has charming characters and stunning graphics that look surprisingly great on my phone. It turns a lengthy bus ride into the perfect opportunity to catch up on an event or finally finish a quest I’ve been putting off. <em>—Ana Diaz</em></p>

<p id="VTiWjt"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on iOS via Apple Arcade</p>
<p id="Rdj9dl">Game Freak, best known for Pokémon, has a less iconic game that should be more well known: <em>Pocket Card Jockey</em>. It was released originally on Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013 and came to English-speaking markets in 2016. But the game’s found new life on Apple Arcade with <em>Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On!</em> The premise is the same as the original, but with a 3D twist on the horse racing element. You see, <em>Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! </em>is both a horse racing role-playing game and collection game where races include fast-paced rounds of solitaire. It’s delightful — just look at these little horses. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="OHgxR5"><em>Two Dots</em> is a classic that stands the test of time. Though it was released in 2014, <em>Two Dots</em> still gets updates and more levels, where you’re tasked with meeting objectives by connecting colored dots. There are a surprising number of different ways for these levels to play out, meaning a ton of challenges. But <em>Two Dots</em> also has a hidden object mode, too, to add in a bit more diversity in the gameplay. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="DU6Y1Q"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on Android and iOS via Netflix Games</p>
<p id="Q2eeTn"><em>Laya’s Horizon </em>fits a whole dang open-world exploration game onto your phone. The game was created by the developers of the viral hits <em>Alto’s Adventure</em> and <em>Alto’s Odyssey</em>, and sends players on a full 3D adventure where you explore by gliding through the sky. What really makes this an easy recommendation for me is that it pairs a simple but beautiful polygonal art style with a touch control scheme that actually makes it feel good to fly. Add the fact that this it’s just a nice, relaxing game to play and you’ve got the recipe for a refined mobile game. <em>—AD</em></p>

<p id="wxGB7i">Tower defense is a classic genre, but <em>Bad North: Jotunn Edition</em> gives it a roguelike, real-time strategy twist. That’s a lot of jargon to explain it, but the premise is simple: Viking invaders are attacking your island, and you’re the one tasked with leading the defenses against the invaders while evacuating everyone else. Each quick round takes place on a procedurally generated island, meaning that’s a ton of variation between rounds. The aesthetics of the game look quite simple, but beyond that facade is a deep strategy game. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="IMkhdU"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on iOS via Apple Arcade</p>
<p id="58fVF4">The general audience for <em>Sneaky Sasquatch </em>will likely skew young, but there’s a reason it’s such a widely beloved and highly rated game on iOS. You play as a sasquatch that rummages through trash and campsites to find food and useful items. The beginning of the game emphasizes stealth elements as you evade the eyes of fearful campers, but this game contains so much more. You can fish, play minigames, race cars, get a job, dress up, and even decorate your home. RAC7 still releases regular updates with new content, too. Before long, no one will be able to stop the sasquatch’s meteoric rise to become mayor of the town. <em>—AD</em></p>

<p id="23BWMz">You’ve heard of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a>, but maybe you haven’t realized that it’s still going strong, with regular updates and tons of Pokémon to catch. If you’re somehow not familiar, <em>Pokémon Go</em> is a mobile-only game developed by Niantic; you walk around your neighborhood — or farther! — to seek out and catch Pokémon. Beyond that basic premise, there’s also a battle system for holding on to gyms and battling your pals. If you’re someone with that “gotta catch ’em all mentality,” you won’t be able to put <em>Pokémon Go </em>down. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="LvKqIz"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Available on Android and iOS, while <em>Jetpack Joyride 2: Bullet Rush </em>is available on iOS via Apple Arcade</p>
<p id="1ej7e5">Another classic mobile game, <em>Jetpack Joyride</em> is what it says on the tin: It’s an endless runner where you’re jetpacking instead of running, dodging obstacles in increasingly difficult levels. It was first released in 2011 by Halfbrick Studios, but it’s still going strong with gameplay updates. <em>Jetpack Joyride</em> has a sequel, <em>Jetpack Joyride 2: Bullet Rush</em>, which is available on Apple Arcade, but the original is still worth keeping downloaded on your phone. —<em>NC </em></p>

Despite Radahn’s return, his fight at the end of the DLC is entirely different and he boasts an entirely new moveset that has made him a real pain in the ass for players to overcome. Of course, he’s no match for this chosen Tarnished though, who manages to deal with Radahn as if they were a pesky bug needing swatting.</p><p>Before entering the boss arena, the player clearly stacks up on spells that’ll help them accomplish the tremendous feat of not using healing flasks, blocks, or dodges throughout the fight. These elements are crucial to the game, let alone its numerous harrowing boss fights, so to manage without them shows an impressive understanding of the rest of the game’s mechanics and skills.<br></p><p>Among the skills used are two incantations, Blessing’s Boon and Golden Vow, which heal the player over time and boost their damage and defense, respectively.

The one used here is a very familiar mixture featuring the opaline and crimson bubbletears, which grant a one-hit invulnerability and the restoration of a significant chunk of health once you’re near death.</p><p>At that point, the player goes into the fight and simply demolishes Radahn. As one person put it in the Reddit comments, “I think this was Radahn’s boss fight against you, not the other way around.” Not only are they passively healed the entirety of the short fight, but anytime they do damage, they regain a good amount of health, too. The player’s almost consistently above the 50 percent mark of their own health bar the entirety of the encounter thanks to the use of the previously mentioned incantations, and at a few points in the fight they can even be seen swapping talismans to mitigate damage even further. I was awestruck watching someone exercise such command over the fight considering the fact that they’re often supposed to have the player on their backfoot, not the other way around.</p><p>At the very end, they also use the Endure skill—which increases your poise and absorbs a certain amount of damage—as well as a damage-reducing aromatic, to stand there and take Radahn’s ultimate meteor attack, and you can see the player’s health bar jump all over the place as their abilities work <em>overtime </em>to passively restore them. They make it with just enough health to land the killing blow and just like that, the DLC is done and dusted; the last boss reduced to an utter joke.</p><p>If recjawjind_fmfb can manage all of that by doing the utmost, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745">rest of us lowly mortals</a></span> can probably squeeze by on the bare minimum, especially considering the DLC got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-patch-realm-blessings-1851561110&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-patch-realm-blessings-1851561110">patched to become easier recently.</a></span> So if you’re thinking that <em>Elden Ring </em>or its DLC are too hard, here’s proof positive that you <em>can </em>reduce this game’s bosses to absolutely nothing with a bit of gumption, ingenuity, and a few skill points dropped into the faith stat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
