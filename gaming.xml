<p>Corinne Busche, the director of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and longtime BioWare employee, has joined Wizards of the Coast’s Skeleton Key Studio. The news was confirmed in by Wizards of the Coast’s Dan Ayoub.</p>



<p>In a new interview with Stephen Totilo’s <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-preps-an-edgy-snake-eyes-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Ayoub confirmed that Busche has joined the studio as a creative lead on a new game currently in production. It’s the studio’s first game since opening in 2022.</p>



<p>Skeleton Key had been working on two projects, but cut one of them in order to streamline its focus. Since then, Ayoub says that a “vast majority” of those who were working on the cancelled project have moved over to the unannounced game.</p>



<p>News of Busche’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure from BioWare</a> became public in January. The move comes after she spent 18 years at the Canadian-based studio. Busche has yet to comment publicly on her new role. At the time she said that she didn’t want people to “read too much” into her departure. </p>



<p>“I want to encourage everyone not to read too much into this,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/corinnebusche.bsky.social/post/3lfxyo5h5vk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">she said</a>. “This was my decision so I could continue making the kind of RPGs you (we) enjoy. Thank you for the outpouring of love and support. You mean the world to me.”</p>



<p>What do you think the new game in development at Skeleton Key is, and Dragon Age’s former director Busche joining the team? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Each joins a catalog of titles available to subscribers of the cheapest PlayStation Plus tier at no additional cost and will remain available until the next batch of games rolls out come May 5. Every game in today’s list is available starting April 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus users will note the April 2025 lineup has a little something for everyone. Teyon and Nacon’s brutally accurate ‘80s love letter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/robocop-rogue-city"><u>RoboCop: Rogue City</u></a>, is likely the biggest headline for players this month. This first-person shooter puts players into the hulking metal shoes of Alex Murphy himself as he works to save a crime-riddled Detroit from another murderous threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-gets-new-game-plus"><u>its more recent and substantial updates</u></a> arrived in January of last year, granting players access to a much-asked-for New Game Plus mode. With or without a reason to revisit its story mode, we felt RoboCop: Rogue City was worth checking out at launch and gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-review"><u>a 7/10</u></a> in our review.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus subscribers looking to scratch that bloody action itch with friends can check out Sumo Digital and Gun Media’s asymmetrical multiplayer adaptation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre"><u>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</u></a>. Players work to survive – or kill – others in a set-up that pits survivors against the bloodthirsty Slaughter Family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an experience not for the faint of heart that aims to simulate what it might be like to hear Leatherface rev up his iconic chainsaw just feet behind you. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review"><u>6/10 review</u></a> at launch, we said it offered “a few entertaining, technically challenged hours of fun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">RoboCop and Leatherface will no doubt get your blood flowing, so it’s nice that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory"><u>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory</u></a> is here to bring down the tempo just a bit. Bandai Namco expanded on the already massive digital world of digital monsters with this turn-based monster collector offshoot back in 2018. It’s got more than 320 Digimon to meet and collect as players look at the events of the original Cyber Sleuth story from a new perspective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As RoboCop, Leatherface, and Agumon make their way onto PlayStation consoles next week, players should make sure to download <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-months-after-launch-dragon-age-the-veilguard-headlines-playstation-plus-march-2025-lineup"><u>the March 2025 titles</u></a> while they still have the chance. It was a particularly strong lineup that included Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection. So, if you’re a subscriber or a non-subscriber who has been looking for a good opportunity to sign up, make sure to add all three games to your library before the offer goes away March 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/gamera-double-feature-gamera-guardian-of-the-universe-gamera-2-attack-of-the-legion">Gamera: Attack of Legion</a> action figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massive <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/world-dragonlance-wizards-coast-books" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonlance book bundle</a> that practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217537"><div id="217537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-pald"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Pald">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217538"><div id="217538" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.</p></div><p id="the-world-of-dragonlance-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The World of Dragonlance Bundle">The World of Dragonlance Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217539"><div id="217539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The World of Dragonlance Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>26 item bundle, pay more for donations to charity "Room to Read".</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shro"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shro">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217540"><div id="217540" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping.

I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.</p></div><p id="anker-power-bank-powercore-10k"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Power Bank (PowerCore 10K)">Anker Power Bank (PowerCore 10K)</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217543"><div id="217543" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Power Bank (PowerCore 10K)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-returns-to-call-of-duty-warzone-here-are-all-the-biggest-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> is bringing back the battle royale map that started it all: Verdansk. It’s been just over three years since players last dropped into the beloved location’s iconic POIs, so we’ve taken the time to highlight its biggest changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verdansk is nothing without each individual building that players spent hundreds of hours dodging (and taking) bullets through – and Activision knows it. That’s why veterans who played the OG Warzone map back when it launched in 2020 will find that its Ukraine-inspired streets, rivers, and structures have been brought back almost completely unaltered. It’s the map you know and love, built from the ground up to suit the updated playstyle introduced with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> and squash a few of the more notable issues players have harped on through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This version of Verdansk has been painstakingly rebuilt from the ground up to give you the very best battle royale experience possible,” Activision explained today in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-map-return-intel-drop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. “That experience balances the immersion, adjusted movement mechanics, and the signature gameplay you remember from the original Call of Duty: Warzone with one overriding goal: To relive the classic and nostalgic Verdansk map we all remember.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Kitted Out</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher behind Call of Duty says its return to Warzone’s roots includes a version of Verdansk that is “95%” accurate to its original launch build. It’s been more than three years since the map was retired in late 2021, so naturally, the team felt it was due for at least a few tweaks that shouldn’t interfere with that nostalgic design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One general rule of thumb, of course, is that Verdansk will benefit from improved lighting that falls more in line with the visuals seen in last year’s Black Ops 6. Upgraded visuals on a finer detail level will also be found in locations like Grazna Bridge and those common fire stations, which feature slightly more weathered paint jobs and chunkier bricks. Another example of cosmetic changes to Verdansk’s iconic locations can be found in a weed problem on Storage Town’s roofs, more reflective puddles, and added electric pipework.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your average Call of Duty fan isn’t going to notice the extra blades of grass added to a random field next to the northwest side of Stadium, but what they will notice are some surface-level design tweaks to a few individual POIs. Storage Town Building 3 is one example of a structure that’s been touched up, with Activision explaining that it’s been gifted a ladder in order to nerf its previous spot as an “unfair power position.” As more than a few similar structures have also invested in ladder additions, players will find that other locations, such as the Hangars, now feature repositioned vehicles and additional cover.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdansk Reheated</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you’ve lived one hundred lifetimes in Verdansk’s original incarnation, none of these aforementioned changes are true gamechangers. However, to accommodate things like Black Ops 6’s omnimovement and swimming mechanics, Verdansk needed to receive a few more alterations that are a bit more than skin deep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verdansk, a traditionally very snowy map, has had its temperature turned up ever so slightly, resulting in the melting of rivers that were previously frozen. That means you’ll be able to swim in some of the deeper bodies of water like the Kastovian Sea – and make more noise when sprinting through some of the ankle-deep rivers polluting the map. Undrivable vehicles have also been given a facelift to ensure there’s no confusion about whether or not they can be used for a quick getaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, those steep, rocky trails and cliffsides that you and your friends have almost certainly died at once before have been tweaked to be more forgiving to players on the run. You’ll also notice that tall structures like telephone poles have been slightly shortened, making for less annoying descents into the Warzone. If you find yourself questioning tree placement come April 3, just know that, yes, the team at Activision has made a few minor adjustments to tree placement to shake things up, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, doors react much more dynamically to the action around them, as bullets and explosions can cause them to swing in either direction depending on where impact occurs. Ascenders, which were previously featured in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 but added post-Verdansk removal, have also been retrofitted to make some of those harder-to-access rooftops easier to reach.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Heads-Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While these changes may seem like a lot when all spread out, Activision reiterates that the “vast majority” of Verdansk 2025 has been revived as a “one-to-one duplication.” Examples of areas that remain largely untouched are Karst River Quarry and Superstore, which look and play the same inside and out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the video game-y aspects of Call of Duty: Warzone’s nostalgia play also seek to return to the feeling players had when dropping into the battle royale mode back in 2020. This can be seen in a complete overhaul to Contracts, Public Events, Field Upgrades, vehicles, and even Killstreaks, which have all been reverted to fit the offerings found in the 2020 Verdansk build. That means everything from the OG helicopter to the hum of a nearby chest to that classic loading screen is back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As other experiences like Fortnite deliver updated takes on classic offerings, it looks like Call of Duty is here to offer its own version of one of its most popular moments in time. So, while something like a lighting tweak may seem inconsequential at first, Activision wants players to know that these changes were made with that infamous Roze skin, for example, in mind. Should everything play out as expected, Verdansk’s reintroduction may provide the definitive way to experience that map ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Warzone brings back Verdansk April 3, 2025. It will launch one day after the introduction of Black Ops 6 Season 3 and following a one-day down period for players. When users boot up Warzone on Verdansk launch day, they’ll be able to enjoy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-drops-back-into-verdansk-with-limited-time-mode-exclusive-rewards-and-black-ops-6-free-trial">a special, limited-time event called Return to Verdansk</a> that comes with unique cosmetics, sprays, Operators, weapons, and much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>The DEA has Schedule 1 drugs, substances, or chemicals defined as "drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." It shares the name with a new game that's blowing up the charts on Steam and players can dive into early access now.</p><p>In Schedule 1, you take the role of a small-time drug dealer rolling into a new city with no cash, no product, and no hookups or clients. The game's objective is to build your drug empire from the ground up as you contend against law enforcement and rival deadly cartel members so you can expand your empire and become a drug kingpin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUxiQ1qN0rg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dUxiQ1qN0rg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Released just yesterday, Schedule 1 quickly climbed to the top of the charts of not only Trending Games, but also Popular Releases, and Hot Releases on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.

It reached a new high today with over 131,000.</p><p>Some players might remember playing Drug Wars on their TI-86 in high school, and at its foundation, Schedule 1 seems similar in that aspect. However, Schedule 1 also has multiplayer capabilities that help you take your empire to greater heights.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-and-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory-join-playstation-plus-april-lineup/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>From April 1, those with a PlayStation Plus subscription will get access to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-april-robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April's monthly games</a>, which include RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory, all of which are very different games and provide a decent amount of variety.</p>
<p>First, you have RoboCop: Rogue City, where you are part man and part machine and bring justice to Old Detroit, a city riddled with all manners of crime. You have to complete objectives by finding evidence, interrogating suspects, and making sure that public order is maintained on a day-to-day basis. However, it's a bit more high stakes than that, as your choices can determine the fate of the citizens involved. The iconic original RoboCop Actor, Peter Weller, reprises his role for this title.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of horror, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will be one for you. This is a third-person, asymmetrical horror game which is based on the revolutionary horror movie from 1974. In this game, you play as a victim where you have to try and stay stealthy while staying out of the Family's reach. You'll have to find tools that will help you survive. Alternatively, you can play as the Slaughter Family, and track down the guests to try and stop them from escaping.</p>
<p>Another very contrasting title in the PlayStation Plus catalog is Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory. In this game, you play Keisuke Amazawa, where you dive into the Digital World to try and prove your innocence after being accused of committing a crime. To do this, you join a group of hackers and join them to solve troubles that are threatening the universe. In this game, you'll get to uncover the backstory to the events that take place in Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth. If you like catching and battling with Digimon, there are over 320 Digimon to discover.</p>
<p>All three of these games will be available to PlayStation Plus members on April 1 and will be available until May 5, when the next games will be announced.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this is the last chance to download <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-be-available-via-ps-plus-in-march/">March's games</a>. They will disappear on March 31. For those who missed it, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection are all currently available for PlayStation Plus members.</p>
<p>These games will stay in your library and will remain playable as long as you have an active PlayStation Plus subscription.</p>

<p>One of the biggest sports superstars (or SIU-perstar) and soccer sensation Cristiano Ronaldo is officially joining the roster of playable fighters in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. One of the most popular figures in sports and social media will have a soccer-themed set of attacks, and can hit his trademark celebration.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-closest-cristiano-ronaldo-will-ever-come-to-joining-wolves">The Closest Cristiano Ronaldo Will Ever Come to Joining Wolves</h2>



<p>Ronaldo <a href="https://x.com/Cristiano/status/1904942189102182598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he would join Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves today, announcing the news to his 115.1 million followers on X (the third most on the platform). He also posted the trailer on his Instagram account, where he has the most followers of anyone on the world: a staggering 651 million followers. Ronaldo will be voiced by voice actor Juan Felipe Sierra.</p>



<p>One of the most recognizable faces in sports and social media is now joining one of the most recognized and beloved fighting game franchises. The original Fatal Fury: King of Fighters released in 1991, and was created by Takashi Nishiyama, the creator of the original Street Fighter. The series was immensely popular in the 1990s, but an original game has not released since Mark of the Wolves came out in 1999, though there have been several ports of different titles in recent years.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>News of the first Fatal Fury game in over 20 years first emerged at EVO 2022, when a new title was announced on stage at the world’s biggest fighting game tournament. Street Fighter characters Ken Masters and Chun-Li will join the roster as part of the first season of downloadable content. Ronaldo was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ronaldo-fatal-fury-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first linked to Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves back in September</a>, when he posted a teaser that said: “A legendary player joins a legendary game.” Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is also one of several titles that will be featured at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this summer; Ronaldo currently plays in the Saudi Pro League for club Al Nassr.</p>

                <p>Communications Workers of America announced on March 25 that user-research workers at Activision have voted to form a union that Microsoft is already willing to recognize.</p><p>Officially called Activision User Research Union-CWA, this is the first video-game-researcher union of its kind in the North American video game industry. A <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/activision-user-research-workers-overwhelmingly-vote-form-union-cwa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> about the union's formation explains that it wants to fight for better wages and job security for those working in user research at the Call of Duty maker.</p><p>The massive number of layoffs the video game industry has seen over the past couple of years was also cited as a reason for the union's formation. Organizing Committee member Pat Dimaandal argues that "workers should not feel punished for pursuing a career that they love, and that’s why we’re organizing toward long-term, sustainable careers in this industry."</p><p>The CWA confirms that there are now over 2,000 unionized workers at Microsoft-owned studios after the formation of this union. Unionization efforts began at Activision several years ago in the wake of the Civil Rights lawsuit against Activision Blizzard. Raven Software was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-accepts-raven-software-qas-union-set-to-begin-negotiations/1100-6504416/" data-ref-id="1100-6504416">first studio to unionize</a>, and Microsoft had to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/06/13/microsoft-union-activision-blizzard-cwa/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agree to allow unionization efforts</a> at its studios during the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard. That opened the door to unions like this one and others at Microsoft-owned companies like ZeniMax Online.</p><p>CWA recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/industrywide-video-game-union-announced-open-to-anyone-in-the-business/1100-6530209/" data-ref-id="1100-6530209">announced the United Videogame Workers-CWA union</a> at GDC 2025 for those not working at a company like Microsoft. UVW-CWA is an industry-wide union that any game developer can join, and the CWA has confirmed it has already gotten over 350 members since it was announced last week.</p>

These are temporary transformations that only a handful of Pokémon get that alter their look and give them a major power boost. However, when Game Freak finally showed the game in action, it didn’t reveal any new forms it would add when <em>Legends: Z-A </em>launches later this year.

The entire game takes place within Lumiose City, seems to have done away with the open-world exploration of recent entries, and adds real-time elements to its turn-based battles.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox exclusives like Indiana Jones, The Great Circle, and Forza Horizon 5 are at the top of PlayStation Store’s pre-order section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-forza-horizon-5-best-selling-playstation-5-ps5-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, if you head over to the PlayStation Store’s pre-orders <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/3bf499d7-7acf-4931-97dd-2667494ee2c9/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>, it is visible that Xbox exclusives are dominating the PlayStation Store. Moreover, it’s not just one edition of these games; both standard and premium editions of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5 are the most pre-ordered games on the PlayStation Store right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-exclusives-have-overtaken-playstation-exclusives-in-pre-orders">Xbox Exclusives have Overtaken PlayStation Exclusives in Pre-Orders</h2>



<p>Interestingly, in pre-orders, Xbox exclusives have overtaken PlayStation exclusive Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The game’s digital deluxe edition stands at the 6th position in the pre-order charts, and the standard edition barely reached the top 10 (at the time of writing). Third-party title, The First Berserker: Khazan’s standard edition is 5th in the PlayStation Store’s pre-order charts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at their performance, it seems like Xbox made the right decision by bringing their exclusives on PlayStation. Players are ready to invest money not just in the standard editions of the game but also shell out more to get access to additional content for these titles. Interestingly, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s pre-orders opened just a few days ago, and they have already beaten every other game on the PlayStation Store within such a short period.</p>



<p>In other news, an Xbox blog post accidentally leaked a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-blog-post-accidentally-leaks-steam-tab-in-user-interface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam tab in its UI</a>. Also, PS5 is outpacing PS4 sales, while Xbox Series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-is-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-trails-xbox-one-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trails behind</a> Xbox One.

<p>The second annual Triple-I Initiative takes place on April 10, 2025, and will feature 37 game announcements from 36 studios. Games like Enshrouded and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core are confirmed to be involved, but they won’t be the only titles on the show.</p>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-game-shown-at-the-triple-i-initiative-2024-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year’s debut</a>, this year’s event wont include any hosts or general advertisements. Instead, it focuses solely on games and those who make them. The showcase will feature revealed, new gameplay, demo announcements, and release date details.</p>



<p>While we don’t know all of the games making an appearance, we do know all of the studios involved with the this year’s showcase. And, based on the studios appearing, certain games could be expected to make an appearance like Endless Legend 2 from Amplitude and Outbound from Square Glade Games. Even Unfrozen is part of the showcase as they work on the new Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. The rest is up to speculation and guessing. </p>



<p>The original Triple-I Initiative featured games like Slay the Spire 2, The Rogue Prince of Persia, The Last Spell, Flintlock, V Rising, and more. If that’s any indication of what to expect, than fans should be in for quite a treat.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of studios involved in the 2025 Triple-I Initiative below. And stick around on the day of the event for full coverage from Insider Gaming.</p>
