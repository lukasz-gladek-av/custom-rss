            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keiji-inafune-level-5-departure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Industry legend Keiji Inafune left Level-5 last year, the&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Professor Layton&nbsp;</em>developer has revealed.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/blog/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">entry</a> on the Level-5 "Five-Star Workshop Devlog", Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino describes the "unexpected challenge" faced by upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for a May release</a>&nbsp;after having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">suffered</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delays</a>.</p>

<p>Hino says that Inafune, who was serving as a producer on the project, left Level-5 "in mid-2024", causing the studio to "reassess and restructure the project". Inafune's departure, together with "harsh evaluations" from early playtesters, led Level-5 to undertake a "complete overhaul" of <em>Fantasy Life i</em>.</p>

<p>If you need a refresher, Keiji Inafune worked with Capcom from the late 80s through to 2010, helping to create enduring franchises like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Onimusha</em>, among others.</p>

<p>He left Capcom in 2010 and created Comcept, the studio that would go on to release the much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Mighty No. 9</em>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Soul Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>ReCore</em>.</p>

<p>Comcept was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-acquires-keiji-inafunes-comcept" rel="nofollow">acquired by Level-5 in 2017</a>, providing development assistance on Level-5 games like&nbsp;<em>Megaton Musashi</em>&nbsp;as well as spearheading the development of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>.</p>




<p>It's not clear what Inafune will do next; he hasn't made any kind of official announcement regarding his departure. He could, however, take the route <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios" rel="nofollow">followed</a> by some of his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bloodborne-and-final-fantasy-16-designer-velux" rel="nofollow">colleagues</a> and start up his own studio, perhaps with backing from a company like NetEase (although that may be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">becoming more difficult</a>).</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is set for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013482" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on May 21st.</p>

That all changed over the weekend as concept art for <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>has reportedly leaked, illustrating some of the franchise’s disparate heroes finally coming together. It may also give us hints about the film’s story, which seems to be a deviation from the typical cataclysmic MCU crossover. If you want to see the art and speculation about what it all means, read on.</p><p>The concept art was originally posted on ArtStation by user noirmutaon and has since been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://noirmutaon.artstation.com/projects/lGN6A5?album_id=1347230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://noirmutaon.artstation.com/projects/lGN6A5?album_id=1347230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted from the art hosting site</a></span>. The account belongs to Mushk Rizvi, a senior concept artist at Marvel Studios. Though the post has been scrapped from the site, fans have already spread the art and begun dissecting what it tells us about <em>Doomsday</em>. Let’s go piece by piece and break it down.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-recommend-id="image://5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1164" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-recommend-id="image://5ca2284893e2a7780c237fd7210fd7b5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1164" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord and White Vision sitting on a couch with beer and pizza on the table in front of them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of the art feels incomprehensible right now because it features characters we’ve not seen interact at all. One includes Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord, having returned to Earth after the end of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3</em>, hanging out on the couch with White Vision, who has been absent from the MCU since his “creation” at the end of <em>WandaVision</em>. White Vision, having come to an understanding with the original Vision, flew away from all the chaos of Westview and we haven’t seen him since. Apparently, at some phase of <em>Doomsday</em>’s development at least, he and Star-Lord were quite chummy and watching TV with beers and pizza. Until Marvel says otherwise, I’m choosing to believe they’re boyfriends. Star-Lord is bisexual in the comics, so fuck it. They’re boyfriends cuddling on the couch.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-recommend-id="image://7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1560" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-recommend-id="image://7fd76325c6a9f4a02e90606f51398c67" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1560" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord, Wong, and the Young Avengers are shown speaking around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jokes aside, Star-Lord does seem to be playing a significant role in the movie, as shown in the art of him and sorcerer Wong chatting with members of what fans believe to be the Young Avengers. Members include Wiccan, Stature, Hawkeye, what appears to be Speed, and Ms. Marvel being her usual fangirling self. It looks like Star-Lord and Wong are mentoring the kids in some way, probably briefing them on a mission. Fans have noted that the roster is missing a few key members who were expected to be part of the group based on previous MCU appearances, including Eli Bradley, who appeared in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> and is typically known as Patriot in the comics, and America Chavez, who had a major role in <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>. Just because they’re not in the concept art doesn’t mean they won’t show up in the final film, but fans seem to be divided on the Young Avengers line-up based on this image. I’m happy to see what looks like a reunion for Wiccan and Speed, though. Maybe Agatha’s ghost will show up at some point.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e974546c3fc4ab4dbe9de08b81592f70" data-recommend-id="image://e974546c3fc4ab4dbe9de08b81592f70" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1138" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk and She-Hulk talk to another Hulk in a village of Hulks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hulk and She-Hulk talk to another Hulk in a village of Hulks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e974546c3fc4ab4dbe9de08b81592f70" data-recommend-id="image://e974546c3fc4ab4dbe9de08b81592f70" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1138" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk and She-Hulk talk to another Hulk in a village of Hulks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Based on some pieces of concept art, fans are speculating <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> may transport our modern-day superheroes to medieval times. One of these images includes what looks like a small village of Hulk people dressed in period attire, including Bruce Banner and Jen Walters.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a19b75d8e4628b885dc40a9ca4a4aee4" data-recommend-id="image://a19b75d8e4628b885dc40a9ca4a4aee4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="895" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Doom sits on a throne with Mr. Fantastic in chains on the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doctor Doom sits on a throne with Mr. Fantastic in chains on the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a19b75d8e4628b885dc40a9ca4a4aee4" data-recommend-id="image://a19b75d8e4628b885dc40a9ca4a4aee4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="895" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Doom sits on a throne with Mr. Fantastic in chains on the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Adding onto the medieval time travel theory is an image of Doctor Doom himself sitting on a throne surrounded by mostly faceless subjects also in period clothing, but he also has what looks to be Reed “Mr. Fantastic” Richards on his knees, chained up and awaiting judgment. Doom is notably not the main villain in the upcoming <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, so it’s unclear if we’ll get much of a sense of the relationship between these two before <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>premieres in 2026. It’s also unclear if this art is depicting the beginning of a new conflict between them or if it’s building off of something we’ll see unfold in <em>First Steps</em>. (Doom is confirmed to appear in the film in a post-credits scene.)</p><p>Another wrinkle in all of this is that it appears Doctor Strange and possibly Yelena are working for Doctor Strange in this odd reality. It looks like Doom’s presence may do a lot more than just yank us backwards in time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-recommend-id="image://191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-recommend-id="image://191de005b15db655030ec4c62c6a45bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther stands in front of a panther-shaped mountain carving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Most of this concept art is easy to wrap your head around, but one piece is raising eyebrows because of its implications for the larger MCU. It depicts what, at a glance, looks like another version of T’Challa, the Black Panther who was originally played by the late Chadwick Boseman. <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> acknowledged the actor’s death by having the hero die of an illness and passing the moniker to his sister, Shuri. It would be strange for Marvel to have made such a show of writing around Boseman’s death just to bring him back with a different actor four years later, but this art might not be of T’Challa at all. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j0zrx1/comment/mffmx89/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j0zrx1/comment/mffmx89/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan points out</a></span>, the url associated with this piece specifically mentions T’Chanda, the grandfather of T’Challa and Shuri. That man is long gone by the time of <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, though, so it’s unclear how this might be implemented into the film, if at all. Some fans have noted that the concept art looks like it might be based on <em>Snowfall </em>actor Damson Idris, so he might be joining the MCU in some fashion in the near future.</p><hr><p>Because the MCU has been pivoting into this movie rather than leading up to it for years like it did with the last <em>Avengers</em> crossover, we still don’t know much about <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> in the grand scheme of things. Doctor Doom is an enigma to us, so we can’t be sure of his motivations in the movies yet. But if this concept art is at all indicative of what the final movie will look like, it’s going to at least be an interesting spin on the MCU, one the franchise arguably needs right now. <em>Avengers: Doomsday </em>is set to premiere on May 1, 2026.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/blog/en/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from Level-5 has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" data-ref-id="5000-581996">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has seen a massive overhaul over the past several months, following "harsh" feedback and the departure of Keiji Inafune from the Japanese company.</p><p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time was announced over two years ago and is the successor to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fantasy-life/" data-ref-id="5000-53790">popular RPG for the Nintendo 3DS</a>, where players could take on different jobs within a fantasy world. This follow-up has been delayed several times. It originally had a 2023 release window, but now won't be coming out until May 21 of this year. Level-5 CEO Akihirio Hiro has now publicly discussed the development difficulties Fantasy Life i has encountered.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alqHzDtQvhE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/alqHzDtQvhE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>He revealed that producer Keiji Inafune left Level-5 last summer amid "harsh" feedback from internal playtests. Inafune is well-known for his storied history working on franchises like Mega Man at Capcom and spearheading the now-infamous Kickstarter game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mighty-no-9/" data-ref-id="5000-193714">Mighty No. 9</a>. Level-5 <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/yo-kai-watch-dev-level-5-acquires-keiji-inafunes-comcept" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acquired Comcept</a>, Inafune's company, around a year after the critically bashed release of Mighty No. 9. Inafune has served on a producer of several Level-5 projects since then, including Fantasy Life i.</p><p>Inafune's departure and poor playtest feedback allowed Hiro to accept that "major revisions were necessary" to improve Fantasy Life i. Hiro explains that development on the project shifted to include Level-5 studios from all across Japan, not just the Osaka studio that was initially working on the game. The addition of features like open-world exploration, parkour, cross-play, and cross-save to Fantasy Life i followed, according to Hiro. The UI, story, and progression systems of the game have also been refined.</p><p>Now, Level-5 believes that it "enhanced what was already great about the game, making the experience significantly more enjoyable" and has gotten more positive feedback from internal testing. As a result, Hiro confirmed that Fantasy Life i is now in "its final stage of development" and should make that May release date. Level-5 will slightly delay the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/" data-ref-id="5000-463484">Inazuma Eleven Victory Road</a> due to the "ripple effects" of what has gone on with Fantasy Life i, but will reveal its release date during a livestream on April 11.</p><p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time will be released for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 21.</p>

<section><p>Sandfall Interactive's upcoming title is one of the most exciting JRPGs in years, and it's being made in France</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">Games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 don't get made anymore. And that's because games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <em>can't</em> be made anymore. French developer Sandfall Interactive's influences were obvious to me from the moment I began playing the game, and confirmed when director Guillaume Broche and producer François Meurisse effusively recounted the joys of playing Final Fantasy, Persona, Zelda, and many other Japanese titles.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of gameplay, Expedition 33 looks to be moving in the right direction; drawing from its clear inspirations while also adding interesting twists and new takes. But many other games have done this--in this respect, Expedition 33 isn't notably unique or rare. What does, however, differentiate this game from its contemporaries is how it evokes the vibe of a transitional period of time when JRPGs and its flag bearers struggled to find their place on a new generation of consoles.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preview: Style and Substance</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While Sandfall Interactive often looks to Final Fantasy as a point of comparison, for me, it is much closer to the games Hironobu Sakaguchi made in the nascent years of the Xbox 360, back when Microsoft was courting Japanese developers and gamers in hopes of expanding its presence in the region.</p><p dir="ltr">After leaving Square Enix, where he created Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi founded Mistwalker. The studio's most notable releases were Xbox 360-exclusives Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon. At the time, it was an exciting prospect: the father of Final Fantasy making new IPs that, to many, looked like the rebirth of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. With the spiritual successors of two of the most beloved franchises in Japan being exclusive to Xbox, Microsoft was sure to finally crack that Japanese nut.</p><p dir="ltr">Both games garnered some popularity and helped move the needle ever so slightly, but it wasn't meaningful enough to significantly improve Xbox's position. Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon aren't remembered as the instigators of a tide shift for Xbox in Japan. However, for me, the games and their legacies are fascinating as snapshots of a time when JRPGs got a little insecure.</p><p dir="ltr">With Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, Mistwalker pushed the genre from its adolescence--where it was carefully nurtured by Japanese developers in safe, controlled environments--out into the chaos of a changing video game landscape. It was the genre's awkward teenage years where it let go of what it used to be to figure out what it wanted to be, at a time when it was being told what it needed to be. The resulting identity of the games undergoing this journey is so unique to its time and context that you just had to be there to see and feel what that was like.</p><p dir="ltr">Much like JRPGs from the 2000s, developer Sandfall Interactive is also trying to find its place in the world while trying to reconcile multiple identities with its first game. The concept of Expedition 33 is born of an intense love of Japanese games, but the small team behind it is based in France. After playing it for a few hours, Expedition 33 feels like it could end up being exactly what I hoped would emerge from the period of uncertainty, challenge, and risk-taking Mistwalker's games faced: who or what I remembered, but self-assured in what it wants to be, and proud of its changes.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat was the focal point of the three-hour demo I played, and as the core driver of gameplay it was an insightful illustration of how Sandfall Interactive is interpreting its inspirations and building upon them. Expedition 33's combat feels like how I remember playing Mistwalker's games: a combination of the classic turn-based RPG gameplay that captured me in my formative gaming years and <em>just a little more </em>layered on top. Back when I played Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, this combination resulted in some awkwardness, but Sandfall's ideas feel like they have been executed more confidently.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio calls its gameplay style "reactive turn-based combat," and this is a very apt way to describe it. It takes the basics of any classic JRPG--attack, cast magic, use item, flee--and removes almost all the parts where you're <em>only</em> watching it happen. The basic attack and item use are the only press-and-watch commands I found, while everything else required me to engage one, two, and even three further times to maximize their impact--that's the "reactive" part. All magic and abilities are quick-time events that made sure I remained engaged and focused so that I could do more damage or recover more health.</p><p dir="ltr">Gustave functioned as my all-around damage dealer; my Cloud, Squall, Zidane, or Tidus. His abilities were oriented around increasing damage for himself and others. "Mark" allowed me to paint a target with a crosshair so the next attack would deal 50 percent more damage. However, the actual execution also involved hitting a button with very specific timing indicated by an on-screen bar--think of it as a QTE version of Squall's slash and gunshot combo from Final Fantasy 8.</p><p dir="ltr">Lune, meanwhile, was more akin to a mage, with elemental spells that could exploit weaknesses and be bolstered with the same timing-based button press. The twist on her gameplay involved the elements interacting with each other. Using combinations of elements can change their damage values, but it's a multi-stage process where you "paint" an enemy with Stains of an element and then follow-up with another to consume it and activate the effect. There is a little diagram on screen that keeps track of which elements an enemy has been painted with so players can plan their approaches.</p><p dir="ltr">Maelle is difficult to categorize since she is a secondary damage dealer like Barret, Zell, or Auron might be, but with an interesting mechanical twist. The majority of her abilities involve running up to enemies and slashing them, with a successful QTE increasing damage. However, the added wrinkle is that she has a stance system tied to these various attacks. By using an ability, I was able to go from an un-stanced state into an offense-oriented one that would increase my damage but also make me take more damage as a trade-off. From there, I could use abilities to transition into defensive stances, or others that have their own risk versus reward trade-offs that had important strategic considerations.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">Although Sekiro was the inspiration, the QTE and parry system as a whole, when used together, feels more like a rhythm game</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">When the flow of battle switches to defense, with the enemies attacking, there's also always opportunities to affect the battle to your advantage. This is where, surprisingly, Sandfall looked to From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice to bring a similar parry system to Expedition 33's combat. The vast majority of enemy attacks have specific timing windows during which, if the parry button is pressed, damage is completely nullified. The window is very tight, but even those who aren't able to react quickly naturally can build muscle memory through repetition and familiarity with the enemy's attack animations. Many attacks have multiple hits, often with staggered timing between them and this is where the extra challenge lies. However, when I was able to parry every part of a multi-stage attack I was able to escape without taking damage and, better still, riposte with my own attack to turn the tables. The final piece of the defensive puzzle is jumping-specific attacks that are telegraphed and can only be avoided by launching into the air. While airborne, a pull of the trigger will execute a mid-air counterattack--think of it as the game's Mikiri Counter; another Sekiro reference point.</p><p dir="ltr">Properly executing parries is incredibly satisfying, with crunchy sound effects and flashy visual effects synchronizing with each successful parry, further rewarded with an over-the-top counterattack. Although Sekiro was the inspiration, the QTE and parry system as a whole, when used together, feels more like a rhythm game. The mixture of inputs at specific timing and the feedback received tickled the same part of my brain that is activated by games like Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, Taiko no Tatsujin, or even Beat Saber.</p><p dir="ltr">A safer defensive option, however, is the dodge. Hit a button as an enemy is attacking and the party member under siege hops backward to get out of the way, and can do so multiple times too. There is a standard dodge, which has a pretty generous timing window, and a perfect dodge, which is done at the very last split-second, it's timing matching that of the parry. With the right loadout, doing this can be rewarded with the AP points spent on actions.</p><p dir="ltr">For those that want or need it, lowering the difficulty option makes the timing windows for the follow-up inputs more generous and there's an accessibility option that will auto-complete all your offensive commands. Dodge and parries, however, are not automatically executed using this setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the Final Fantasy 10-like tracker of attack order, there was a wonderful synergy between defense and offense that leveraged timing-based inputs to make every interaction feel rewarding and useful. It also builds a palpable sense of momentum that can sometimes translate to a complete party wipe where no damage is inflicted on any of my crew. With all the metaphorical wheels turning, gears clicking, and pistons firing, the battles have the same thrilling energy as Persona 5 and its baton pass system. Expedition 33's combat is made of familiar mechanics, but they're synergized and layered on top of a classic system that really executes on the foundational decision of doing turn-based combat, but elevating it just a little more. At the risk of overselling it, when I reached a flow state, it had that intoxicating effect that had me seeking out more opportunities to fight enemies. And that is a good sign.</p><p dir="ltr">As a permanently From Software-pilled person, I am prone to looking at things through a Soulslike lens. That, it turns out, also goes for Sandfall and its approach to enemies. While the standard grunts can eventually be trivialized (provided you're on point with timing), the bosses are far more formidable--I died a whole bunch of times to a few of them and even opted to avoid one or two optional ones for fear of getting into a spiral of grudge matches. Difficulty isn't the only ingredient taken from the Souls games, as the team has also tried to make sure each boss is memorable both visually and mechanically. I fought nightmarish eldritch creatures that spat ink at me; a vicious French Mime that repeatedly kicked my ass until I decided to come back later for him; rotund sea-dwelling creatures that draw power from flowers; and many other weird monstrosities.</p><p dir="ltr">Each boss was a little puzzle that could be solved with the offensive and defensive tools at my disposal, but a few presented unexpected challenges. The ink-spitting giant, for example, was a bit of a tank but after a little experimentation I found a very effective combo of marking it, shocking it with lightning, and casting a defensive barrier to nullify any attacks I wasn't able to parry or dodge. I had it all worked out until it reached down and ate one of my party members, removing them; their tools; and their involvement in my strategy. This happened a second time until just Lune was left. With all items depleted, a sliver of health left, and not enough AP to really dent its lifebar, I turned on my Sekiro brain and decided to just focus on parrying to use the counterattack for big damage. Against all odds, I emerged victorious and I can't describe the elation I felt having locked in and avoided all damage from a barrage of attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, tough bosses are a pillar of the JRPG experience--you can look to Final Fantasy's Emerald Weapon, Omega Weapon, Penance, and the like for that. Expedition 33 builds on that pillar with a greater focus on boss phases that switch up the flow of battle. It's boss fights, but just a little more.</p><p dir="ltr">In my discussions with Expedition 33's devs, one thing was mentioned repeatedly as the holy grail of JRPGs for the team that, sadly, has fallen out of favor: the world map. There's a big difference between an overworld that connects areas in modern open-world games and the classic world maps of JRPGs. Expedition 33 firmly aligns with the latter style, using an isometric viewpoint of a miniaturized world that a tiny version of your characters runs around in to travel to new areas or discover hidden ones. You can even set up camp and chat with party members, listen to music, or reflect on events. It's not quite as charming as summoning a Moogle that is somehow able to sprint over mountains to come and save the game for you, but it injects the same sense of a grand adventure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451614-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451614" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451614-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451614"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451614-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451615-ss_9e050e6a61a4d9f4fe54bc62c8c73da38e9a63b0.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451616-ss_483a27df5072beb3a4650634a764bda750fbcb82.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451617-ss_0902af724ac45a9093dee022a7893dc50cbf555e.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451618-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451619-ss_e49800e906e8a0f00707458c836567c933603bac.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451615,1300-4451616,1300-4451617,1300-4451618,1300-4451619" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451615-ss_9e050e6a61a4d9f4fe54bc62c8c73da38e9a63b0.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451616-ss_483a27df5072beb3a4650634a764bda750fbcb82.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451617-ss_0902af724ac45a9093dee022a7893dc50cbf555e.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451618-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4451619-ss_e49800e906e8a0f00707458c836567c933603bac.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451615-ss_9e050e6a61a4d9f4fe54bc62c8c73da38e9a63b0.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451616-ss_483a27df5072beb3a4650634a764bda750fbcb82.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451617-ss_0902af724ac45a9093dee022a7893dc50cbf555e.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451618-ss_d3a10809f5cc2a8df7773f41acd1493f4fb900ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4451619-ss_e49800e906e8a0f00707458c836567c933603bac.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's so much more to Expedition 33 beyond its gameplay mechanics. It has a simple premise and great hook: a figure called the Paintress appears at certain points in the world of Lumiere and writes a number on a distant monolithic structure. This starts a countdown that, when it runs out, makes everyone of the age of the initial number cease to exist. As Expedition 33, you're tasked with finally stopping the Paintress and the cycle of death. Early in the journey, however, you encounter a mysterious antagonist that has aged, meaning he has somehow escaped certain doom to live a long life. There's a fascinating Belle Époque France meets post-apocalyptic world to discover, characters to meet; Nier Automata-inspired music to listen to, and more. Every part of Expedition 33 feels familiar, but they all come together to create an experience that feels fresh at the same time, kind of like how Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon once felt.</p><p dir="ltr">While borrowing design ideas and reinterpreting gameplay mechanics is something many are capable of doing successfully, being able to capture the vibe of a game that existed at a certain place and time is so unlikely that it verges on impossible. And yet, Expedition 33 looks to be doing that. But the game it could be isn't one trying to find itself; it's one that wants to show you what its genre has become. And that's potential worth keeping an eye on.</p>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya is still interested in developing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a>, after the PlatinumGames and Microsoft action game was cancelled back in 2017.</p>
<p>Kamiya has now founded a new studio, Clovers, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">developing a sequel to Okami</a>. A new post on the Clovers account includes a video showing "some excitement around Kamiya's desk".</p>
<p>"He was reminiscing about the development of Scalebound while watching YouTube videos," reads the post. "It never made it to release, but even now, he still feels proud of it."</p>

<p>Kamiya is quoted as saying: "I'd love to make it again someday.😊"</p>
<p>He also shared the video on his own social media account, adding: "Let's do it, Phil!"</p>
<p>Scalebound was planned to be an action game with a human protagonist in a fantasy world, with a sidekick dragon.</p>
<p>"He's got his own headphones and smartphone," Kamiya says in the video.</p>
<p>"Just like an isekai reincarnation," a developer responds, referring to the trend in Japanese anime for stories about characters being transported to other worlds (think Spirited Away).</p>
<p>"Yeah, exactly! That's the big trend right now," replies Kamiya.</p> <div>

<p>After more than four years of development, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-microsoft-and-platinum-part-ways-on-scalebound-development-ceased">Xbox One exclusive game was cancelled</a> and Microsoft and PlatinumGames parted ways on the project.</p>
<p>That's not the last we've heard of the game, though. In 2021 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-microsoft-and-platinum-part-ways-on-scalebound-development-ceased">Kamiya publicly apologised to Microsoft for Scalebound's cancellation</a>, after discussing the development challenges and admitting: "We weren't experienced enough."</p>
<p>Then in 2022, Platinum president Atsushi Inaba revealed in an interview with IGN <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-would-love-to-resurrect-scalebound-and-wants-to-discuss-it-with-microsoft-properly">Kamiya had been "talking about wanting to work on Scalebound again for a while"</a>. Kamiya himself added: "I'd like to appeal to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> directly! Let's do it, Phil!"</p>
<p>It seems Kamiya is once again trying that tactic to appeal to Xbox boss Phil Spencer. Will it work this time? Is Kamiya now free to resurrect Scalebound with Clovers?</p>
<p>Or maybe he's just jealous that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, with the backing of Spencer. Can Phil work his magic this time?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-irish-language-program-from-the-90s-is-my-new-favorite-tv-show.1123887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The journey that got me here isn’t important, but I’ve signed up for an introductory Irish language class that starts in a week. Because I’m an overachieving nerd, I decided to start digging around the language in advance, which has trapped me in a horrifying maze of words that aren’t spelled at all like they sound. But on the plus side, it has also led me to <em>Now You’re Talking</em>, an early 90s language learning series that I’m completely in love with.</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03znk3q/clips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Now You’re Talking</em></a> was apparently a BBC series tied to a now out-of-print language book. It is, in the nature of all beginner language scenarios, wonderfully surreal. In the first episode, adults walk up to playing children and chilling teens to demand to know how they’re doing; young people lurk around bus stops and bike racks to comment forcefully on the weather. The second episode features a scenario where a couple making out on a couch is constantly interrupted by the girl’s family as an excuse to say the words “brother,” “sister,” and “mother.” The show is narrated by a woman who has to have something to do while she’s explaining language to us, so in the second episode she’s randomly at the gym, walking on a treadmill and telling the viewer about how you ask for someone’s name. Because it’s the early 90s, everyone is in chunky sweaters and windbreakers.</p><figure><figcaption>A video game reference makes this a video game blog I guess</figcaption></figure><p>But my favorite regular <em>Now You’re Talking </em>segment is the story of Sean and Deirdre, two people who meet in the show’s town of An Baile Mór. In the first episode, Deirdre’s horoscope tells her “today the cavalry rides in” and that she’s in for some luck. That luck comes in the form of reaching for the same door as Sean, a man with a delightfully 80s haircut and outfit. They try to use the same payphone (<em>a payphone!)</em>; given his/our limited language skills at this point, Sean can’t make very much conversation, so he playfully takes her bag and then gives it back to her after her call. Then, because they can’t say much else, after she thanks him for giving back the bag he basically stole in some kind of wordless neg, she starts to walk away, and he can only call after her that it’s a nice day out even though they’re inside (Tá lá breá ann). She looks him up and down before agreeing it is (Tá) and then, desperate to say whatever the viewer will understand, he calls out what I <em>think</em> is him saying that it’s hot (Tá sé te), which is very confusing given that Deirdre is wearing a scarf, and she replies with immense flirtatiousness that it certainly is. The whole thing is wildly pregnant with subtext, but not <em>too </em>much, and it makes the whole interaction incredibly trippy.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Now You're Talking - Episode 1" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nz--LpYC30?start=1152&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the second episode they meet again, when Deirdre is celebrating her parents’ anniversary and he’s the waiter at their restaurant (reader, I gasped!). Since the second episode is about how to introduce yourself and others, Sean says his name and then everyone stares at each other meaningfully until he walks away, because Deirdre doesn’t have the words to explain how they met. Later, Deirdre introduces her family, which feels like something you’d reserve for someone you’re actually dating and not a guy you talked about the weather with at a payphone. Sean makes small talk with her little brother about his identity, asking “And who’s this?" (Agus cé seo?) and “what’s your name?” (C’ainm atá ort?) the way you would for a kid who I feel like would be much younger than her brother seems to be. (Her brother, it should be noted, appears to be wearing a baseball cap with a radio and headphones fitted in, complete with an antenna.) Deirdre’s dad threateningly informs Sean that Deirdre is his daughter (I’ll be honest here, I have no idea how to spell what he’s saying, but I did understand it!), which causes him to gulp and ask for their order.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Now You're Talking - Episode 2" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-WjR1XVOrU?start=1239&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When the family leaves the restaurant after the meal, they can’t talk about what occurred in any detail because we don’t know any of those words yet, so they grin and say their goodbyes and remind each other how they’re related. Also, there’s some kind of weird lineup across the street that makes it look like the whole town is watching the interaction. <em>But then</em> Deirdre passes back by the restaurant and Sean bluntly suggests coffee (a word we haven’t learned, but which is easy to sound out), to which she eagerly agrees (Cinntae).&nbsp;</p><p>I am on the absolute edge of my seat here. <em>Now You’re Talking</em>’s narrator says the third episode will involve learning about how to say where you live and how to give your phone number, which I hope bodes well for what will surely be an incredibly awkward date given Sean and Deirdre’s limited language skills. Obviously <em>Now You’re Talking</em> isn’t the first show to employ an ongoing narrative to help teach viewers language, but it’s such a good move to get me invested, and the structure of an ongoing meetcute is such a good way to slowly introduce new language concepts.</p><p>Apparently there are multiple different dialects in Irish; <em>Now You’re Talking</em> uses the Ulster dialect, but I don’t know which one my class will be in, so there’s a good chance I’m setting myself up to be a version of the assholes who filled the Japanese class I ferociously failed in grad school 20 years ago, where kids far younger than me confidently asserted incorrect things they’d learned from anime while I could barely spell on my own name. Each roughly 20-minute <em>Now You’re Talking</em> episode I’ve watched so far has taken me hours to get through because I keep pausing to try to understand why the <a href="https://www.acleversheep.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuaimeanna-agus-litriu-202011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spelling</a> sounds the way it does, which I doubt a handful of conversational short classes at a local community center will focus on. I wouldn’t say that it’s taught me Irish yet, but this morning I walked around my apartment muttering “Tá sé fuar” (It’s cold) to myself, which is technically speaking a foreign language! I’m so excited to learn more, and <em>so</em> excited to find out what will happen to Sean and Deirdre next.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman"><h3>Major Publishers Can’t Keep Making Fewer, Bigger Games</h3></a><p>"Destined to fail.

			<p>Despite having been released over four years ago, Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the best-looking open-world games ever released, and the latest version of the DreamPunk mod makes the game almost feel like a next-generation game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new version of the mod</a> introduces new features and improvements over its previous version, such as Dynamic Contrast and Realistic Cloud Lighting, improved weather conditions to make them look as realistic as possible, remade core LUT to allow for a higher dynamic range and more realistic sunlight and more. The new version of the mod also introduces some graphics configuration improvements to better fit NVIDIA DLSS 4 and the improved capabilities of the recently released RTX 5000 series. The end results are incredible, as showcased in the 8K resolution video below provided by NextGen Dreams.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 on RTX 5090 with New DreamPunk 3.0 Graphics - Ultra Realistic Modded Showcase in 8K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etXFdqPu1Wk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was among the<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-4/"> first games</a> to support the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a>. The new version of the upscaler, whose release coincided with the launch of the RTX 5090 GPU back in late January, introduces plenty of improvements over the previous version, including a new Transformer model that brings significant image quality improvements. DLSS 4 also comes with an RTX 5000 series exclusive feature, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, which brings significant performance improvements in supported titles.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about how the game was changed with the 2.0 patch and the Phantom Liberty expansion by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-mode-sumo-independent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Sumo Group publisher Secret Mode has announced that it will split from the group and go independent, having secured the backing of investment firm Emona Capital.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/secret-mode-splits-from-sumo-to-become-independent-publisher" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, Secret Mode execs James Schall and Ed Blincoe led the buyout alongside Emona, and the goal is to focus on discovering and publishing indie games for PC and console without the backing of former owner Sumo Group.</p>

<p>Although the publisher technically has significant investment from Emona, it will remain entirely independent from a business perspective, with Schall and Blincoe continuing to lead the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-little-to-the-left-secret-mode.jpg?itok=5GLJBmVH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-little-to-the-left-secret-mode.jpg?itok=HOJ8iom7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Little to the Left&nbsp;</em>is just one of Secret Mode's publishing endeavors.</figcaption></figure><p>Schall says that becoming independent will allow Secret Mode to put "all [its] efforts into uncovering the indie gems that gamers never knew they needed in their lives".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the studio is "committed to bringing [its] players the very best indie titles", but not just the ones being released in the future; Schall also says the mission is to help people "discover existing indie masterpieces that have undeservedly flown under the radar".</p>

<p>This news comes after Sumo Group, Secret Mode's former owner, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">announced it would lay off a number of staff</a> and refocus on support and work-for-hire projects rather than developing its own IP.</p>

<p>That move doesn't affect anything Sumo Digital, which is the development wing of Sumo Group, already has in the pipeline, so you can rest easy; there shouldn't be any more delays to&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>as a result of this shakeup.</p>

<p>As for Secret Mode itself, it's not entirely clear what's next for the publisher, although Schall says that he and the studio "hope to make some exciting announcements" regarding their future plans "in the coming months".</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar Games have announced the acquisition of Video Games Deluxe, the Sydney-based team who collaborated with them on the 2017 re-release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire">L.A. Noire</a>, virtual reality spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire-the-vr-case-files">L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files</a> and, most recently, post-launch updates for Grove Street's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a>. The studio will now be known as (drum roll please) Rockstar Australia.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Video Game Deluxe were founded by Brendan McNamara in 2013. You might remember McNamara as the founder of original L.A. Noire developer, Team Bondi. Team Bondi had an outsized reputation for long hours, tyrannical management and high turnover, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-team-bondi-part-ways">as explored in an IGN report from 2011</a> based on anonymous developer interviews, which led to an investigation from the International Game Developers Association. The studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/la-noire-developers-team-bondi-in-administration">went into administration later that year</a>, after Rockstar announced they would not publish their next title.
</p>
<p>
McNamara and other former L.A. Noire developers subsequently got together to make a spiritual successor, Whore Of The Orient, at new studio KMM Interactive Entertainment, but the project and studio were eventually shuttered after publishing partner Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment pulled funding.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any reporting about what it's like to work at Video Game Deluxe, who have done good work over the years. They're the outfit credited with "saving" Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, a technical disaster of such magnitude that Rockstar felt moved to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-can-claim-another-rockstar-game-for-free-right-now">hand out free games as compensation</a>.</p>
<p>
It's likely that the newly rebranded Rockstar Australia will be pitching in with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> development - Rockstar's latest is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">due for release on console</a> later this year, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">a PC release date forthcoming</a>. "It's been an honour to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade," McNamara said <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/rockstar-games-acquire-video-games-deluxe">in a statement regarding today's announcement</a>. "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."

It’s because of one cutscene in the game that revolves around the cooking and eating of cheese naan. It shows it in great detail, complete with steaming hot melted cheese, as the player character and their companions sit down for a meal in Kunafa Village.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you progress through the story in the Windward Plains, your hunter will be invited to a meal in the village of Kunafa, where those who live in the desert reside. These villagers who know nothing of hunting and haven't even seen weapons before treat you to a dish that resembles a freshly baked cheese naan. As you bite into its crispy surface with charred spots, both steam and melted cheese come pouring out. The meal is an unbelievable feast for a hunter from the outside world, making it a scene that shows just how much you're welcomed by these villagers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Automaton translated a number of social media posts from fans who were so inspired by the Monster Hunter Wilds cutscene that they sought out cheese naan in real life. A Nepalese restaurant in Tokyo called Salam Namaste also got in on the fun, tweeting: “Salam Namaste when we get 99 cheese naan orders at midnight.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">深夜にチーズナン99個注文が入った時のサラムナマステ<br> <a href="https://t.co/WA7E2pYlNP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WA7E2pYlNP</a></p>— サラムナマステ Salam Namaste Tokyo सलाम नमस्ते👂🥘🌕🍗🥃 (@salamnamaste01) <a href="https://twitter.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896048091155054753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“The cheese naan is too popular,” <a href="https://x.com/salamnamaste01/status/1896188428393537908" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the restaurant added</a>. “Even though I had a lot of cheese, I started to run out so I had to go to the supermarket to buy more.

When we thought about how they get animal-based nutrients, we decided that they must raise livestock and eat dairy-based foods. You're able to get a grain similar to wheat when you go out to a more wide-open part of the map, right? So maybe they make something like naan using that grain. On top of that, we wanted it to be something made from simple ingredients, and not too complicated. We thought that a dish like cheese naan would be simple yet possible to depict in a delicious way, and so we put a good amount of effort into that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while it may appear to be a casual dining scene, it seems that a lot of labor went into showing this dish similar to one that exists in real life, cheese naan, in a delicious and meaningful way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's actually incredibly difficult to depict something that's crispy on the surface but springy on the inside using CG,” added Fujioka. “We'd been making attempts at the food scene in Kunafa from early on in development, even at the prototype stage, and we just couldn't get it to look the way we wanted. Still, the Wilds development team is incredibly talented, and I was shocked to see them ultimately reach the way it looks in the released version after a lot of trial and error.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Years ago, a mentor told me that the most important part of any story is surprise. A few years later, a writer I deeply respect wrote that perhaps the difference between good and great writing is technique, though even that was probably not as important as conviction. But what keeps us invested in a story is curiosity, the gap between what we know and what we want to know, the questions that drive us. Combine all three, and you tend to create something special. Each and every one of us has played a game that grabbed us from the jump, that connected with us in some unexpected way. A game that surprised us. Whose belief in itself was obvious from the first frame. That made us want to explore. I have played <em>a lot</em> of video games, friends, and that feeling is increasingly rare for me, especially in the AAA space. So when I tell you that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 grabbed me by the throat from the jump and didn’t let go for a single second of the three-and-a-half-hour demo I played, twice, believe me when I tell you that’s some powerful magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re unfamiliar, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a pretty fascinating setup. See, there’s this being called the Paintress, and every year, she paints a new number. When she does, every person of that age dies. Poof. Vanishes. Turns to dust. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. And the thing is, she’s counting down. Every year, the people dying get younger. So every year, the people of Lumiére send a volunteer Expedition of people with one year left to live on a desperate, impossible, doomed mission: go to The Continent across the sea and kill the Paintress so she can never paint death again.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - March 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expeditions have been going on for a while now; you’ll find journals from Expedition 84, so if you can do the math in your head, you’ll get how desperate this whole thing is and how young (but still older than the average RPG protagonist) your characters are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get weirder once your crew lands on The Continent. They almost immediately run into an old man who nearly dispatches the whole Expedition single-handedly. You play as Gustave, one of the survivors: traumatized and alone, walking through countless corpses from other expeditions and his own. He’s about to shoot himself when he’s found by Lune, another member of the Expedition. She’s not blind to reality (they’re probably both going to die), but Expedition members swear an oath: “When one falls, we continue.” As long as one of them stands, their fight isn’t over.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lune and Gustave clearly care about each other, but they don’t always get along. When they find an unsigned message indicating another member of Expedition 33, Maelle, might be alive, Gustave wants to drop everything and try to save her and then get out of Dodge; Lune is worried that the whole thing is a trap. Expedition members are always supposed to sign their messages. At one point, later on, Lune asks Gustave if he’s a coward because he just wants to get Maelle and get out. He’s not; he’s just dealing with watching almost everyone he knows die. And Lune? She’s the one that said they should land on that beach in the first place. Neither one of them has it easy. These characters are adults, and they’re written like it. They don’t always agree; they’re dealing with guilt and loss and trauma, and they’re not always kind to one another in the heat of the moment. But they care about each other. And at the end of that exchange, once they’ve calmed down, they share a laugh. Compelling characters are complex and flawed, and Expedition 33 seems to understand that.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Compelling characters are complex and flawed, and Expedition 33 seems to understand that.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if they weren’t, Expedition 33 could probably skate by on the world. My demo was fairly linear: there were branching paths with hidden grapple points, platforming, goodies and secrets to find, and tough optional enemies to take on, but this isn’t an open-world game. And it’s better for it. Expedition 33 reminds me of Final Fantasy X; these environments may be linear, but they’re gorgeous, whether you’re standing atop a hill looking at the Indigo Tree or both underwater and somehow not, Expedition 33 is a visual feast and I stopped in every environment I entered to marvel at the beauty and composition on display. There’s even a world map you traverse to get from place to place, like the RPGs of old.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What really hooked me, however, was the combat. Clair Obscur may be turn-based, but it’s not a DVD menu. There’s <em>a lot</em> of depth here. Every character has a melee and ranged attack, the latter of which must be aimed manually. Melee attacks build AP and ranged attacks spend it. You’ll also need AP for Skills, unique attacks that each character has in their arsenal. And on top of that, each character has a particular attribute. Gustave can use certain skills to build up stacks of Overcharge, which he can spend to cash out for a devastating attack; Lune’s spells grant elemental Stains that can supercharge her other spells for additional effects and damage; and my favorite, Maelle (you do rescue her; this is not a spoiler. She’s in Clair Obscur’s trailers), can switch between three different stances offering buffs to attack, AP generation, and defense. Managing your AP, setting up a big combo, and planning ahead matters; like FFX, the turn order is displayed on the left side of the screen, so you can plan every turn in advance, but strategy is only half the battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other half is moment-to-moment execution. You don’t just choose an option and wait for a canned animation to play out. When an enemy attacks you, you can dodge, parry, or jump to avoid it. Dodging avoids attacks while parrying nets you a potentially huge counter-attack and awards AP, but has a tighter window. Sometimes, the only way out is to jump over something. Sure, you can engage in the time-honored tradition of blocking with your face, but the harder fights are gonna force you to engage with these defensive mechanics. And if you parry an attack that hits your whole squad? All of them strike back in a beautifully choreographed counterattack that never gets old.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, I ran into a very powerful enemy who could kill my characters in a single hit. But the thing was, he had to hit me. If I could parry him, I could win. It took me a couple tries on my first run (he had a tricky attack that forced me to parry or dodge twice in a row), but once I figured out I could parry the first hit and dodge the second, I managed to take him down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the backend stuff called Pictos and Luminas. You can equip up to three Pictos to any character, which provide buffs like “shooting this enemy might light them on fire” or “attacks do more damage” or “killing an enemy grants more AP” as well as stat upgrades. Win enough battles with a Picto equipped, and you can have everyone equip its effects, minus the stat bonuses, provided they have the required points. And this is where you can do some really degenerate stuff. Sure, Maelle has a skill that puts her in Virtuose stance (where she does 200% damage) if she uses it while the enemy is burning. Normally, you’d have to have somebody use another skill to set this up, but what if you give Gustave and Lune a Lumina that means their ranged attacks are likely to set enemies on fire? Or maybe you equip a Picto that cranks up your Base Attack damage or that awards more AP for nailing a parry, allowing you to stay on the offensive longer than you’d normally be able to. Then you’re cooking with gas.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combine all that and battles offer a lot of interesting choices. Does this character dodge or do you risk more to try to land that parry? If someone’s low on health, do you spend an item or AP to bring them back up, or do you bet it all on dodging or parrying the next attack? How do you level up your characters? Who gets what skill as a Picto so they can stack the right stats and they don’t have to spend Lumina points to get that effect? And on and on it goes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Expedition 33 is constantly finding new ways to make itself interesting.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And through it all, Expedition 33 is constantly finding new ways to make itself interesting. What’s a Gestral, and why is Lune obsessed with them? Who is the Paintress, and what does she want? Why is the world the way that it is? Are all these beings actually hostile? Some of them seem pretty friendly, and you have the option to fight them or leave them alone. What’s the deal with that old man? How does any of this stuff work? In my demo, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 didn’t stop to explain itself, and I appreciated that. It trusted me to figure stuff out, and I was more invested in what was going on as a result. Most importantly, I could never predict what would happen next. By the time “Thank you for playing” came up on my screen at the end of my demo, I was thoroughly hooked. On my second runthrough, I found even more hidden areas, and laid the smackdown on one of the optional fights that had flummoxed me the first time around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When my time Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was up, I wasn’t ready to stop. I wanted to fight more battles, learn more about the world, and spend more time with these characters. Sandfall Interactive is a new studio, but you’d never know this was their first game from playing it. Surprise. Conviction. Curiosity. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 nails all three. It had my interest before I played it; now it has my undivided attention. If Sandfall can stick the landing, they’ll have put together something remarkable.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-accused-of-ai-slop-yet-again-this-time-for-new-guitar-hero<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Call of Duty publisher Activision has been blasted over its use of cheap AI once again, this time for a clearly-generated piece of artwork designed to announce a new Guitar Hero game for smartphones.
</p>
<p>
You'd think that the announcement of a new entry in the legendary Guitar Hero series would be worth... I don't know, paying an artist to put something original together.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the first announcement of Guitar Hero Mobile, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/">posted to Activision's Instagram</a>, comes with its logo splashed over some weird AI backdrop, where four suspiciously-similar silhouettes hold red guitars in identical poses surrounded by towers of amps that look like washing machines. 
</p>
<p>
But clearly this is fine now, apparently, because it's only been a week since Activision admitted it had begun using cheap-looking AI artwork for its flagship Call of Duty franchise. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Players spotted a note from Activision confirming Call of Duty "uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets"</a> that was belatedly added to the Steam page for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
As well as AI-generated in-game calling card 2D art assets, Black Ops 6 promotional artwork used last Christmas featured a Santa Claus zombie with six fingers. Maybe they should get him in Guitar Hero, he might be pretty good at it.
</p>

<p>
Response to Activision's new Guitar Hero Mobile ad is as you'd expect. 
</p>
<p>
"AI Hero looks awesome 🔥" reads one comment. 
</p>
<p>
"I was actually excited, but then I saw the cover it's made out of AI, so I won't touch this, sorry," wrote another. 
</p>
<p>
"Ruin my fav game with AI slop," said a third, "I hope Activision falls over dude."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Microsoft unveiled its new Muse AI tool designed to aid "gameplay ideation" and the preservation of older video games, supposedly - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-generative-ai-model-muse-isnt-creating-games-and-its-certainly-not-going-to-solve-game-preservation-expert-says">a claim one expert branded as "idiotic"</a>.

                <p>A new competitive mode called Seek and Deploy Extraction is coming to Halo Infinite this year, and to celebrate, Halo Studios has partnered with ForgeHub for a contest to build a multiplayer map for it. The event runs now through May 13 and features a $20,000 prize pool.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios recently released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sCBLERWYs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sneak-peek video on YouTube</a>--seen below--for S&amp;D Extraction that included info on the Halo Infinite map contest. The first-place winner will take home $5,000, with the runner-up receiving $4,000, per <a href="https://www.forgehub.com/events/contests/12631" rel="nofollow ">ForgeHub's website</a>. Additionally, only one 4-vs-4 arena can be created per person for this event, though people can collaborate in teams.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sCBLERWYs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E3sCBLERWYs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite's take on the tactical competitive mode--think Counter-Strike--will see squads of four rotating between offense (planting the bomb) and defense (stopping the bomb) each round. Winning six rounds first in S&amp;D Extraction will see your team come away victorious. The video notes that players won't have to "worry about carrying a bomb," as a designated area will prompt you to plant it. The starting weapon for Spartans is the Bandit Evo, though you can buy different weapons and equipment between rounds.</p><p dir="ltr">One mode that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-battle-royale-mode-could-have-been-a-game-changer-dev-says/1100-6527192/">seemingly not coming to Halo Infinite is a battle-royale experience</a>. A developer who reportedly worked on the game's multiplayer mode claimed it had the chance to be "a game-changer for the franchise." Last month, however, did see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-doesnt-have-a-fuel-rod-cannon-but-will-have-a-rocket-that-fires-fuel-rods/1100-6529207/">the addition of a new power weapon that fired fuel rods</a> for the FPS.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">there are multiple Halo games in the works utilizing Unreal Engine 5</a>. There are no concrete details yet on any of these titles, though.</p>

		<p>Double Cross Studio and publisher 2P Games have confirmed that the twisted card game Sultan’s Game will be released on March 31st for PC via Steam. Sultan’s Game has the label of being a twisted narrative card game because you, as his advisor, have to complete different acts within a week or suffer the consquences of failure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sultan's Game | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8KOjHJ-_As?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Sultan’s Game&nbsp;is finally launching soon and we appreciate the overwhelming support from the community along the way,”</em> said Yin Li, Producer and Developer, Double Cross Studio. <em>“Both long-time supporters and newcomers will be able to immerse themselves in the Sultan’s turbulent world soon; stay tuned for the upcoming new information!”</em></p>
<p>Every seven days in Sultan’s Game players draw one of four card types; Carnality, Extravagance, Conquer, and Bloodshed. Carnality cards instruct players to seek pleasures of the body like sex, Extravagance instructs players to spend obscene amounts without a care, Conquer sends players on adventures to complete, and Bloodshed demands a blood sacrifice to please the Sultan. To complete these demands, players will be navigating court politics, the back alleys of the city, and wandering into brothels. Every decision made will have an impact on relationships with other people in your life from political rivals, allies, and family members. The various paths will lead to a variety of different endings, with decisions allowing you to try and control the Sultan, to outright killing him.</p>

<p>There is a demo available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game/">Sultan’s Game on Steam</a> right now.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Take this Down: Being an Accurate Accounting of Doty and Taryon Darrington in the Basilisk’s Den</em>&nbsp;Barber manages to embody the voice and observations of an Automaton that has a vocabulary smaller than can be counted on two hands. Picking up in the Mincing Mongoose Tavern the quick talking Taryon is matched in pace by the intuitive and calculated observations of Doty, and TechRaptor has been provided with an exclusive excerpt.</p>

<p>Tary and Doty are about to be greeted by a group of adventurers looking to hire some assistance to take on a Basilisk that has been terrorizing the town of Lichenvel. This new party is comprised of a half-orc and two Eisfuura, a race of birdfolk on Exandria.</p>

<h2>Excerpt from&nbsp;<em>Take this Down: Being an Accurate Accounting of Doty and Taryon Darrington in the Basilisk’s Den</em>, by Jess Barber</h2>

<hr><p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{96}" paraid="1618617820">Current location: The Mincing Mongoose Tavern, Beaded Alley, Port Damali, Menagerie Coast, Wildemount, Exandria, Mortal Plane. Recommended maximum occupancy: seventy-five medium-sized creatures. Current occupancy: six.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{110}" paraid="1225477402"><em>The tavern where I established myself to commence the search for questing partners was a squalid little affair in the most dangerous part of town, absolutely teeming with cutthroats and villains. Risky, yes, but a necessary evil if I wanted to find like-minded compatriots willing to brave the trials and hardships of adventuring life. As I swilled rotgut whiskey, the only thing the tavern had on offer, I returned the steely-eyed glares of the other patrons, and wondered whether I would manage to escape with my life.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{116}" paraid="1369027242">"Are you still working on your wine there, m'dear?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{126}" paraid="275252197"><em>Name: Hilda Thurgood. Occupation: Tavern Proprietress. Ancestry: Gnomish. Apron: Blue Gingham. Cheeks: Rosy.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{132}" paraid="23731557">"Oh dear, is it not to your liking?" Hilda's brow furrowed in concern as she noted Tary's mostly-full glass. "It's one of my favorite vintages, but I suppose it is a little on the sweet side. Shall I bring you something else to try?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{142}" paraid="1593204177">"Oh! No, no, it's quite delightful, actually." Tary turned on his most sparkling smile. "The perfect terroir for my palate. In fact, I was just about to ask if you had any additional recommendations. It's so difficult to find a good sommelier these days, one must cherish the opportunity when one can."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{150}" paraid="746195104">Hilda's cheeks grew even rosier. "Well, that's awfully kind of you to say. I was actually just sampling from a new vineyard in Kamordah—" She was cut off by the bell on the tavern door jingling cheerfully.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{164}" paraid="1621728785"><em>New occupant analysis: Ancestry: Human. Age: Early thirties. Hair: Close-cropped black curls. Eyes: Dark, with a roguish sparkle. Lips: Full, with the slightest smiling tilt, hinting at shared secrets. Shoulders: Broad. Jawline: Chiseled.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{170}" paraid="1713494016">Tary was no longer looking at Hilda, his attention having shifted fully to the new patron. His heart rate had increased approximately ten percent. Doty recalled the protagonists from Tary's favorite romance novels, and Lawrence, and in general the sort of faces that tended to lead to Tary making bad decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{176}" paraid="996700783">This was concerning.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{182}" paraid="821747334">The human lifted a hand in Tary and Doty's general direction, smiling. He had a tiny, fetching gap between his front teeth. "Afternoon!" he said. "You wouldn't happen to be Sir Darrington, would you? The one looking for a new adventuring party?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{188}" paraid="590837791">"Wh—" said Tary. "I'm—was I—oh! Sir Darrington. Yes. Yes! Indeed, that's me. Please, do sit. All of you."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{198}" paraid="570955009"><em>Analyzing additional party members. One: larger-than-average half-orc. Long tusks, roughspun clothing, significant tattoo coverage. Analysis: Intimidating. Two: smaller-than-average eisfuura. Fluffy feathers, jaunty cap, leather vest with elaborate stitching. Analysis: Adorable.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{214}" paraid="723162557">It took a little doing to replace two of the chairs with a bench capable of supporting the half-orc's weight, but eventually the newcomers got settled in around the table, with the concerningly handsome human sitting catty-corner to Tary—a little closer to Tary, in fact, than Doty would like. "I'm Clarke," he said, extending a hand, which Tary shook warmly.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{220}" paraid="904875354">"Charmed, I'm sure," said Tary. "And your friends?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{226}" paraid="947337582">&nbsp;"This is Dayner—" The small eisfuura. "And Bex." The half-orc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{240}" paraid="1357058711">"Pleasure," chirped Dayner, extending a wing to Tary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{250}" paraid="843914930">Tary took careful hold of the longest primary feathers. "The pleasure is all mine."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{1}" paraid="1402955125">Bex lifted one large hand in a wave. "Hope you don't mind if I don't shake your hand," she said. Her voice was much quieter than Doty expected, and a little shy. Up close, he could see she had an assortment of twigs and dried leaves carefully woven into the unkempt reddish-brown curls of her hair. "Sometimes I accidentally, uh." She made a crushing gesture with both hands that very effectively conveyed broken bones, snapped ligaments, and general agony.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{7}" paraid="621031090">"When you put it like that, I certainly don't mind at all," said Tary. "And while we're at it, let me introduce my traveling companion, Doty. Say hello, Doty."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{13}" paraid="746592624"><em>Creak</em>, said Doty.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{23}" paraid="1230810895">"<em>Fascinating</em>," said Clarke. "Your flyer mentioned an automaton, but I'll admit this isn't what I was expecting. Where did you get it?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{33}" paraid="62174805">"Well," said Tary, "I built him."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{39}" paraid="1187222330">"Built! Well, damn." Clarke sat back, looking impressed. "You really are an inventor and an adventurer, huh. I figured that was an exaggeration, but I see now it wasn't one bit."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{49}" paraid="1475600979">"Oh, well." Tary's cheeks pinked. "I like to stay busy, I suppose. You mentioned you saw my flyer…?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{59}" paraid="1111385143">"Right, your flyer. We saw it down by the waterway this morning, and as soon as I read it I thought, maybe we could help you. Or, more accurately, we thought maybe <em>you </em>could help <em>us</em>."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{77}" paraid="1855420558">"Please," said Tary, leaning forward and balancing his chin on his hand. "Say more."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{83}" paraid="1140380410"><em>Body angle: Fifteen degree incline toward conversational partner. Blink ratio: One-point-seven times standard. Currently remaining below threshold for 'fluttering eyelashes'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{103}" paraid="1002606636">Clarke smiled, leaning forward, too, until the angle of his body matched Tary's. When he braced his elbows on the table, the swell of his biceps strained the fabric of his shirt.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{109}" paraid="841066796">This was very concerning.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{115}" paraid="1348720607">"Let me start at the beginning," said Clarke. "There's a small fishing village about a day's ride from here, name of Lichenvel. They've been having trouble lately with a basilisk. It's just been a general nuisance so far: getting into the storehouses, interfering with the catch, that sort of business. So far, nobody's been hurt, but, well." His expression grew somber. "I'm sure a seasoned adventurer such as yourself is familiar with basilisks. You know as well as I do that it's only a matter of time."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{125}" paraid="559770756">Tary went from <em>Expression: Enchanted</em> to <em>Expression: Serious</em> one-point-one seconds too late. "Ah, yes. Yes, I certainly do."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{139}" paraid="404277764">If Clarke noticed the delay, he didn't show it. He continued, "They put out a call for help, and we answered. The three of us have traveled together a long time, doing this sort of work. For coin, of course,&nbsp; but we also try to do some good in the world, and we're no strangers to monster-hunting. We felt we were well-equipped to take the beast on. And we would have been—"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{149}" paraid="168470672">"We would have been!" cut in Bex. <em>Tone: Distressed.</em> "If it weren't for Swink being a rotten little—"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{159}" paraid="1441881376">Clarke winced, and Bex stopped, frowning. "Sorry," said Clarke. "There's been some—inter-team conflict—"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{165}" paraid="663646985">"We got ditched," interrupted Dayner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{175}" paraid="517993732">Clarke sighed, rubbing his forehead. "One of our members abandoned us. It's not that the three of us aren't capable—we've taken on plenty of challenges on our own. But Swink was a skilled warrior, and to defeat a basilisk, you need someone who knows how to handle a sword. And that's not any of us."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{185}" paraid="281501348">"It's not?" asked Tary. Doty calculated that the natural variation in Tary's line of sight had decreased significantly, in a way that indicated Tary was trying very hard to keep his focus on Clarke's face and nowhere else. "I'm just—surprised," Tary said, when Clarke looked puzzled. "You look like you might have trained a bit, is all."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{195}" paraid="1267103819">Dayner covered her beak with a wing, muffling a cough. The blood flow to Tary's cheeks doubled.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{203}" paraid="12693597">"That's kind of you to say," said Clarke. "I mean, I do carry this." He gestured to a dagger slung at his waist; fairly standard-issue adventuring gear. "But honestly that's mostly for show. Really, I'm more of an academic. Here, look—may I?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{213}" paraid="563580536">There was a bit of spare thread clinging to the collar of Tary's cloak. Clarke reached long, elegant fingers towards it, then looked up at Tary, waiting for permission.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{219}" paraid="1312901962">Tary, holding his breath, nodded.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{225}" paraid="972174843">Clarke plucked the thread away from the fabric of Tary's cloak, and made a flourishing little gesture. There was a spark, and then, instead of the thread, he was holding a sleek, green feather.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naoki-yoshida-square-enix-directors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida has seemingly been removed from Square Enix's list of its board of directors, suggesting that he's either been removed from the post or that he's voluntarily stepped down.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enixs-naoki-yoshida-no-longer-on-companys-board-of-directors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, a recent Square Enix <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/en/news/files/9ac53f2f381de8e15cecedaae031d93e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> regarding a change in executive structure names Yoshida as an executive officer rather than a director, although he's still listed as a director on the company's official <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/officer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">executive list</a>.</p>

<p>While it's possible Yoshida has been demoted to executive officer rather than executive director, it's also possible he's finally been allowed to step down; he said <a href="https://dotesports.com/ff/news/square-enix-wont-let-naoki-yoshida-leave-its-board-of-directors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in 2023</a> that he "[doesn't] want to be on the board" and that "it's much more fun just to make games".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-producer-naoki-yoshida-square-enix-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=mbsA4oCk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-producer-naoki-yoshida-square-enix-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=fTHbn7zq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida may have been demoted from his position as executive director, but he may also simply have stepped down.</figcaption></figure><p>If Yoshida has indeed been demoted against his will, it may well have something to do with the fact that one of the games in which he was heavily involved, 2023's&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>

<p>However, it's also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s most recent expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" rel="nofollow">along with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remaster</em></a>,&nbsp;contributed to a softening of what might otherwise have been a rough quarter for Square Enix.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely possible that the situation is a mixture of both; Yoshida wanted to step down, and thanks to the lackluster performance of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, he was allowed to do so.</p>

<p>Since there hasn't been any kind of official announcement from either Yoshida or Square Enix specifically regarding his change in role, it's hard to say, but I'm sure Yoshida is much happier away from the board.</p>

<p>Samsung has taken to the stage at MWC 2025 to unveil a stunning lineup of technology ranging from new OLED television sets to immense gaming monitors – and everything in between. The set included an incredible <strong>500 Hz OLED monitor </strong>and a gorgeous 240 Hz OLED laptop – and a conceptual handheld gaming device <strong>that folds in the middle</strong>.</p>



<p>This is following on from Samsung’s success with foldable mobile phones and tablets, and it’s a natural enough progression point, but is anyone asking for it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-foldable-gaming-experiences">Foldable Gaming Experiences</h2>



<p>At MWC 2025, <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Samsung revealed</a> Flex Gaming, a conceptual device with a 7.2-inch screen that folds down the middle for ease of storage. It was revealed at the showcase, and a demo was held, but it wasn’t confirmed if the device was usable.</p>



<p>It looks as though it boasts a relatively traditional layout featuring a pair of joysticks and a d-pad, but there’s a recess on either side of the device. This is to allow the joysticks to ‘enter’ the device when it’s collapsed, which means it takes up even less space. </p>



<p>It was sat alongside a Steam Deck and Razer Blade 16, and all these devices were being used to run KRAFTON’s ‘popular games’, which included InZOI, a realistic competitor to The Sims.</p>



<p>Tech aficionados flocked to the event to check out Samsung’s new 77-inch QD-OLED televisions, as well as a 31.5-inch QD-OLED monitor, both of which boast utterly remarkably visuals and colour expression.</p>



<p>One of the more bizarre elements of the Samsung lineup was the Flexible Cabinbag, a bag-like device that unfolds into an 18.1-inch display. It can be compacted to fit inside a briefcase, and it comes equipped with – you guessed it – an OLED screen. That’s the order of the day where Samsung is concerned.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d invest in a folding handheld gaming device? Let us know in the comments.</p>

All game data has been completed, and we are currently making the final balance adjustments. Compared to the version shown at Tokyo Game Show 2024, it has become even more fun. After release, I’d love to jump into online play and enjoy it together with everyone!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>I believe that once you try the full version, you’ll find yourself thinking like: “Oh? This is even more fun than I expected!” → “Wait, this is seriously amazing!” → “Wow?! So many things to explore!”</p><p>In terms of content volume, this is the largest <em>FANTASY LIFE</em> game yet in every aspect. I apologize for the delay in the release, but this extra time has allowed us to bring full multi-platform support, cross-save (so you can carry your save data across different consoles), and cross-play (letting players on different platforms enjoy online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [454 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> together). We’ve also made major user interface improvements, ensuring a more polished and seamless experience. Now, we’re finally bringing this game to completion in the best possible form. Please look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Behind this Project…</strong></p><p>In mid-2024, <em>FANTASY LIFE</em> faced an unexpected challenge. At that time, producer Keiji Inafune left the company, and we had to reassess and restructure the project.</p><p>Meanwhile, internal test players had given the game harsh evaluations, making it clear that major revisions were necessary. In response, I decided to take on the role of producer, shifting the core development team from Osaka to our headquarters.</p><p>While the Osaka team had been dedicated from the start, the project evolved into a collective effort across our whole company—with developers from Fukuoka, Tokyo and beyond, we were able to significantly strengthen our development capabilities.</p><p>This restructuring allowed us to expand the team and create an environment where we could focus on fine-tuning the game’s quality right up until the very end.</p><p>From that point onward, we undertook a complete overhaul of the game: adding <a title="Genres > Open-World [574 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> exploration and parkour-style <a title="Genres > Action [2,530 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, restructuring the system’s progression flow, improving the core mechanics, and refining the scenario to be even more emotionally impactful.</p><p>Thanks to the solid foundation of the game’s core mechanics, these additions didn’t just fit in—they enhanced what was already great about the game, making the experience significantly more enjoyable. The improvements received high praise from our internal testers too, marking a major milestone: <em>FANTASY LIFE i</em> was finally nearing completion after its long development journey.</p><p>For us, watching Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka (and Hokkaido, too!) come together as one to push the game’s quality to a higher level was a powerful reminder of the true joy in creating a large-scale game.</p><p>The day that we can deliver the ultimate Fantasy Life experience to all of you is almost here! Get ready for it!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Joe and Anthony Russo's new Netflix movie, The Electric State, is getting a tie-in game. The game is called The Electric State: Kid Cosmo, and it's a prequel to the movie.</p><p>Described as a "bite-sized adventure puzzle game," Kid Cosmo focuses on the movie's characters Michelle and Chris. The game is described as being a "narrative-driven game" and taking place over the course of five years. You can <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see footage of the game at Variety</a>.</p><p>Kid Cosmo launches on March 18 for iOS and Android--only Netflix subscribers can get it. As for the movie, the film debuts on Netflix on March 14.</p><p>The game hails from the Russo brothers' production company, AGBO, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-hemsworths-netflix-movie-extraction-might-become-a-game-under-agbos-new-deal-with-nexon/1100-6499357/" data-ref-id="1100-6499357">received $400 million in funding from gaming giant Nexon in 2022 to produce video games.</a> Anthony Russo told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game, which focuses on the characters Michelle and Chris, will provide more depth than what's possible in the movie alone.</p><p>"There's just a limit in a two-hour medium to how much ground you can cover, in terms of story. So the game does hold something very special in terms of like, who these people are, what their relationship is to one another, and how it evolves and grows over time," he said. "And I think people will find it very relatable. It's a wonderful, complicated brother-sister relationship in everything that that entails."</p><p>AGBO is likely to produce more video games in the future, as Anthony Russo said a "very important" aspect to the company's mission is to have its film and TV projects work "hand-in-hand with our gaming efforts." While Kid Cosmo is a mobile game, Anthony Russo said it's possible future games could land on other platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0g_7kEqKdU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y0g_7kEqKdU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Every idea has a different way that it can best be explored and best be brought to audiences or gamers for an experience," he said when asked if future games could be AAA console or PC games. "So we really like to tailor everything to the creative idea that we’re exploring, evolving and building upon, in terms of how we find an expression for it."</p><p>AGBO <a href="https://www.agbo.com/about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently hired longtime Fortnite boss Donald Mustard</a> to help lead its gaming efforts, and Joe Russo said Mustard is now working on "building out what we think the future of storytelling could be." He said this could take the form of "some hybrid between linear and virtual and gaming."</p><p>"The three of us together are trying to explore and ideate around what opportunities there could be over the next decade using new tools and new technology to tell stories and can we make it can we make it true transmedia, where the same assets that we're using for CG in movies is also the same assets that are in the game, that are also the same assets in a virtual experience," Joe Russo said.</p><p>Netflix is involved in gaming, too, though the company is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">still trying to find its footing in the space</a>. As part this process, Netflix has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">closed a AAA gaming studio</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-wont-release-these-six-previously-planned-games/1100-6529261/" data-ref-id="1100-6529261">canceled plans to release multiple games.</a></p><p>The Russo brothers are also making multiple more Marvel movies, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-mcu-sdcc-rdj-doctor-doom-russos-deadpool-wolverine-avengers-doomsday-secret-wars/1100-6525402/" data-ref-id="1100-6525402">Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. </a></p>
