			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza, a new entry in the series starring one of Nintendo's most iconic characters besides Mario, is launching in a few months on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The new 3D platformer will be released on July 17th, a little over a month after the next-generation Nintendo console debuts worldwide on June 5th. While not a lot of information is currently available on the game, the trailer shown during today's Nintendo Direct provided a decent overview of what to expect, including a new design for Donkey Kong clearly inspired by the successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a colorful and lively experience that looks heavily inspired by Super Mario Odyssey.</p>

<p>With the announcement of Donkey Kong Bananza, 2025 is looking increasingly like the year of Donkey Kong. Back in January, Nintendo brought one of the best entries in the series, Donkey Kong Country Returns, to Nintendo Switch, complete with improved visuals that make it a worthwhile purchase for those who have never experienced the game before, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</em></p>

"Slowly asphyxiating to death in an unforgiving alien wasteland has never been so joyful", wrote he, reminding me of the over air-fried chicken nugget I got stuck in my throat last week. The original Astroneer will keep receiving updates for "years" to come, say developers System Era Softworks. As for Starseeker, it's aiming to be a different kettle of space entirely.</p>

<p>It's doing that through the power of mates, chiefly. Not just a few mates, but many. Mates squared. "Exploring deep space on the ESS Starseeker, players will need to work together with the entire crew of the space station," say System Era, "to complete planet-wide objectives across a multitude of star systems using cutting edge technology". Alec called the original's tone more "Vengaboys than 65daysofstatic" (them what did music for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>), and it definitely all seems far more bubbly and chipper than your garden variety forage-for-dysentry-berries-or-die-in-poverty 'em up. Labour's new fifteen point berries-or-poverty plan being what it is, I'm thankful for the escapism.</p>
<p>A "focus on discovery, cooperative expeditions, and camaraderie" is the vibe here. "Players will have an advanced set of tools at their disposal to tackle expeditions while they face off with the unknown perils of space- - fascinating creatures, hazardous flora, and mysterious forces that await them".</p>
<p>This'll all be done from your space station, the titular ESS Starseeker - "an ever-evolving space station where players get together to plan expeditions, upgrade their capabilities, and even hang out with other players".</p>
<p>The devs promise livestreams, vlogs, a limited beta, and a more in-depth gameplay trailer all over the coming months. You can find Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454370/STARSEEKER_Astroneer_Expeditions/">on Steam here</a>, and it's due for release 2026. I'm actually not being glib when I say I hope there's a way to talk to these monsters, they look ace.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No gameplay was revealed, with Nintendo instead choosing to reveal the project with a cinematic trailer and the promise of a 2025 release window. We likely won't have to wait too long to see how the sequel builds on the original GameCube game, but we can at least rest easy knowing Kirby creator and Super Smash Bros. mastermind Masahiro Sakurai is serving as the project's director.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the Kirby Air Riders reveal trailer below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo released its original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> spinoff for GameCube players in 2003. It's an off-the-wall entry for the all-powerful pink hero that sees him trading out platforming challenges for fast-paced racing gameplay. It's unclear how exactly Kirby Air Riders will shake up the formula, but after more than two decades of waiting, Sakurai and his team will surely have plenty to reveal at a later date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last original new Kirby game was Kirby and the Forgotten Land for Nintendo Switch. This was Kirby's first adventure in a full 3D perspective, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">we gave it an 8/10</a>. We said that it "successfully warps the series’ already fun mix of ability-based combat, platforming, and secret hunting into the third dimension. The post-apocalyptic setting may not be as thematically interesting as Planet Popstar, but it is still lovely and vibrant, with cleverly designed levels that make consistently smart use of Kirby’s abilities."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Kirby AirRiders</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 is currently scheduled to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-confirmed-during-nintendo-direct">launch June 5, 2025</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-launching-alongside-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Toby Fox has been a busy guy. During today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the small white dog dev showed the first full trailer for Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4, revealing that chapters 3 and 4 will launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. It will also be available on all other platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune's first two chapters are mysterious little RPGs following a character named Kris through their adventures in a "Dark World" with their classmate Suzie and a prince named Ralsei. They borrow a number of characters and themes from Fox's previous work, Undertale, but thus far it's been unclear if there's any relationship between the two stories. Trailers lately have been referring to it as a "parallel" story to Undertale.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In today's trailer, we got our first-ever look at Chapters 3 and 4, though the look was cryptic as is Fox's wont. There was a brief look at the Castle Town with all the characters we've met so far hanging out together (including Queen!), a new battle that looked like some sort of rock show with Guitar Hero-like controls, Suzie throwing Kris into what looks like a chapel with both characters slightly off-color, and a look at two new villains. One, for Chapter 3, appears to be a creepy smile in a static-y TV (recalling the tease at the end of Chapter 2), and the other, a bit less comprehensibly, seems to be a pile of...weird jellyfish? That Suzie and Kris are running from? No idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune has thus far been released chapter by chapter, with chapter 1 coming out on Halloween 2018, and Chapter 2 debuting in September of 2021. Both of the first chapters were free. The total number of chapters is still unknown, but the menu screen has previously seemed to hold room for seven total, meainng that two more may be on the way. The anticipation for these latest chapters has only grown in the last year, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-will-100-come-out-in-2025-says-creator-toby-fox">Fox confirming last Halloween that 3 and 4</a> would "100% come out in 2025". The Nintendo Switch 2 version will include all four chapters, including the two previously released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we haven't yet reviewed the beginnings of Deltarune, we gave Fox's previous game, Undertale, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/undertale-review">rare 10/10</a>, calling it a "masterfully crafted experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The absolute madmen did it. During today's Direct covering all things Nintendo Switch 2, it was demonstrated that for the first time ever, the console will have a built-in voice chat feature thanks to its infamous C button.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase revealed how players will be able to seamlessly bond when playing their favorite Nintendo Switch 2 titles, all with the press of that C button. Discord users will note that the footage shown reveals a variety of familiar features, including a similar layout where players can watch each other enjoying the same or different titles and, with the help of a camera that can be purchased separately, even see each other. It's made all the easier by a built-in microphone that is shown to be relatively reliable regardless of each player's gaming environment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is looking to bring that gaming party setting to players to the comfort of their homes when Switch 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-confirmed-during-nintendo-direct">launches this summer</a>. That means helping a friend out by watching their game stream will be just as easy as organizing a group photo in a game like Mario Kart World. The C button's chat menu aims to be an all-in-one multiplayer feature that could result in Nintendo's most successful online push in decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has tried out a version of a voice chat before, but none of them have ever been just a normal voice chat feature like everyone else has. In 2017, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/19/nintendo-switch-online-app-is-available-to-download">it launched the Nintendo Switch Online app</a>, which allowed players to voice chat with friends while playing specific, compatible games. However, the app's functionality was limited, and critically, tied to the phone instead of the system itself. This is the first time Nintendo's ever had the voice chat actually built in, and at last puts a cap on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/18/nintendo-voice-chat-podcast-episode-1">running joke IGN's been making about Nintendo Voice Chat for years now</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're still dissecting everything we saw this morning on the Nintendo Switch 2, so check out our breakdown of everything announced today. And if you want to tune into the real Nintendo Voice Chat that's been there for you all along, you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">check out our podcast page</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 C Button &amp; Camera Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything Nintendo Switch 2 voice chat is able to do remains unclear, but it already looks leaps and bounds better than the previous Switch voice chat option that required the use of a mobile app. For a better look at everything else Nintendo had to show during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, you can click <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing...</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade will release on Nintendo Switch 2 as one of many third-party games announced for the console.</p><p>As of writing, specific details are scant. There is no price point or release date for the game's Switch 2 port. In a short video segment, which was part of the April Nintendo Direct, Square Enix director Naoki Hamaguchi promised "more updates on the Final Fantasy VII Remake project for Switch 2." What exactly this statement means is unknown. Perhaps the sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, will also see a Switch 2 port. The aforementioned video segment showed off a couple early portions of the game, with principle characters Cloud and Barrett fighting robots. Other third-party games releasing on the Switch 2 include Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Sid Meier's Civilization VII, and Borderlands 4.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrXgnDfqP4Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YrXgnDfqP4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For anyone unaware, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-yuffie-episode-ps5-upgrade-detailed/1100-6488309/" data-ref-id="1100-6488309">Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade</a> originally released in 2021 as a PC port and PS5 upgrade for the erstwhile PS4 exclusive. It improved graphical features and added a mini-story featuring party member Yuffie. Final Fantasy Remake is a partial remake of the classic game, covering the party's journey through the city of Midgar.</p><p>As for other Switch 2 news, the newest Mario Kart game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-officially-confirmed-for-switch-2-as-mario-kart-world/1100-6530411/" data-ref-id="1100-6530411">Mario Kart World is priced at $80</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">The console itself</a> will run for $450.

                <p>Nintendo has confirmed that it explored "a lot of ideas" for what to called the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> before landing on that name. In an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ask the Developer interview published on Nintendo's website</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said Nintendo's teams had a difficult time coming up with a name for the console.</p><p>"There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one," he said.</p><p>One of the ideas that Nintendo considered was "Super Nintendo Switch." Nintendo decided against this, however, because it "didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as the Super NES."</p><p>"Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo," Kawamoto said. "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>The Switch 2's development director, Takuhiro Dohta, went on to say that the Switch 2 is not aimed at people who prefer "high-performance hardware," but instead its ambition is to be a product that can appeal to the widest possible audience. "So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system," Dohta said.</p><p>Another Switch 2 designer, Tetsuya Sasaki, said the name "Switch 2" is "simple and easy to understand." Sasaki added that it was always the plan for the system to be a "proper successor to Switch," so keeping the same name made sense.</p><p>Dohta, meanwhile, added that the teams had "lots of back and forth" about what to call the Switch 2, but in the end, they came together and "agreed that it should be Nintendo Switch 2 after all."</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">priced at $450 and scaling to $500</a> for a bundle that includes a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>.

One of the few original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> shown at today's Direct was Drag x Drive, a sports game that utilises the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode.
</p>
<p>
The new controllers can be used on their sides to replicate the movement of a mouse. With Drag x Drive, players will use one Joy-Con 2 in each hand and move back and forth to mirror the motion of using a wheelchair.
</p>
<p>
The game itself is 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball, and alongside some new accessibility options on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> itself, appears to show Nintendo taking disability more seriously.

<p>

It's a little like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, with players lifting the Joy-Con 2 to shoot and pass a giant ball. They can even wave to request a pass, while ramps up the side of the court can be used for slam dunks. 
</p>
<p>
Though there's no firm release date, Drag x Drive will arrive at some point this summer.
</p>
<p>
As for the console itself, Nintendo is expanding the existing Switch accessibility options. 
</p>
<p>
"In addition to existing accessibility features on Nintendo Switch, to support players' wide range of gameplay styles," says Nintendo, "Nintendo Switch 2 offers a variety of new accessibility options including the ability to adjust font size, enable screen reader, and speech-to-text features within GameChat."
</p>
<p>
Considering Nintendo has lagged behind other companies when it comes to accessibility, it's certainly a plus to see new features being added to Switch 2.
</p>

		<p>The classic GameCube game Kirby Air Ride is getting a sequel with Kirby Air Riders coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders – Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1C4XSLAacNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are pretty thin on the ground outside of the reveal trailer, but we see Kirby riding on his jet-powered star and joined by three other Kirbys on a variety of different craft.</p>
<p>Kirby Air Riders is in development with Super Smash Bros. series director Masahiro Sakurai at the helm. Sakurai is a truly beloved figure for the openness with which he led Smash Bros. development over the past decades, often in the foreground to demo new fighters that were coming to the smash hit series. Given the labour of love that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> was for him, it’s great to see that he’s taken a bit of a break from the series to lead a different classic series revival.</p>

			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> presentation was a wave of new information about Nintendo's hotly anticipated console, and some of the first-party Nintendo games that will be available on the console either at launch, or later this year.</p>
<p>We also got confirmation for a number of third-party titles that will be available on the Nintendo Switch 2, including Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Hades 2, Hitman: World of Assassination, Hogwarts Legacy, Star Wars: Outlaws, and more.</p>
<p>Some of these games are classified as specific editions, like how Elden Ring for Nintendo Switch 2 isn't just called "<em>Elden Ring</em>," but instead is called "<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition,</em>" which in the case of Elden Ring signifies that this version of the game will include the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion.</p>
<p>The Tarnished Edition will also include new customizations for Torrent, new weapons, and new armor, when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>Some of the games confirmed were also brand new announcements, like a new FromSoftware game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a>, or Enter the Gungeon 2. We also got a reiterated confirmation that Hollow Knight: Silksong is indeed planned to release sometime later in 2025.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition however, has been confirmed to launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p>
<p>But on the note of release dates, we don't know when each of these games will release, as some of them came with specific release dates, while others just had a release window for 2025, and others still had no release date attached to them at all.</p>

			<p>A new game by FromSoftware called The Duskbloods is coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2 next year.</p>
<p>Announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, the next game by the renowned development studio will be a brand-new multiplayer title sporting a rather eerie setting and atmosphere not too different from Bloodborne's and a deep dive into what feels like a vampire-themed story, so much so that the game almost feels like a new entry in the Castlevania series. Sadly, details are scarce at the moment, but judging from the trailer below, it seems like the game will share some similarities with Elden Ring: Nightreign, especially regarding characters' mobility. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn more about the game, as a developer diary series called Creator's Voice featuring director Hidetaka Miyazaki will be coming on April 4th.</p>

<p>Before The Duskbloods launches next year exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, although it will likely be a timed exclusive, FromSoftware will release the aforementioned Elden Ring: Nightreign next month on PC and consoles. You can learn more about the multiplayer game featuring roguelike mechanics set in the same world of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">2022 Game of the Year</a>, which is also launching on Nintendo Switch 2, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">hands-on preview</a> of the closed beta.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th. It'll boast <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">a 1080p screen</a>, a 4K-compatible dock, and support for up to 120fps, with 256GB of storage and backwards compatibility with original Switch games.</p>

<p>What's more, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">GameCube games will also be available</a> as part of the console's Switch Online library, although you will need an Expansion Pack membership to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the Switch 2 will open on April 8th, although it sounds like only "selected Nintendo Switch Online members" will be invited to pre-order the console first, with pre-orders subsequently opening up to more people. Stay tuned for more.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo is releasing a new 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em> game that will be an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. The game, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, will release on July 17th, which is a little more than a month after the June 5th launch of the Switch 2.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> is a 3D platformer that gives DK a new look that’s seemingly inspired by his appearance in <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>. “Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it!” according to the description of Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIddsPkdX9U">YouTube trailer for the game</a>. “Bash, throw, and climb through just about anything in DK’s brand-new 3D platforming action-adventure game!”</p><p>In the trailer, you can see DK scaling walls like a super-powered Link from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, picking up and tossing rocks to smash through enemies and walls, and digging into the ground with his fists. There also looks to be old-school 2D sections and mine cart rides.</p><p>The game looks full of energy — DK and various characters in the trailer are really expressive and fun. It’s a shame it won’t launch at the same time as the Switch 2, but at least we won’t have to wait too much longer after the system releases to play the game.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel"><em>Hyrule Warrior</em>s: <em>Age of Calamity</em></a>, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is another prequel whose story connects directly with the larger tale unfolding in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. But this time around, the game looks even farther back into the past to focus on the battle Princess Zelda fought alongside King Rauru against Ganondorf.</p><p>A brief trailer for the game highlighted how <em>Age of Imprisonment </em>will allow you to play as Zelda and Rauru as you fight against hordes of Hylian monsters. Nintendo didn’t reveal much about the new game’s plot, but announced that it’s set for release this winter.</p><p>The <em>Zelda </em>franchise played a key role in the original Switch’s success. <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, which was also one of the last Wii U titles, quickly became one of the handheld console’s bestselling games and a critical darling that kicked off a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">new era of open-world gaming</a>. The Switch gave Nintendo a chance to double down on <em>Zelda</em> spinoffs like the <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>series and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677194/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-zelda-nintendo-hands-on-release-date-e3-2019">Cadence of Hyrule</a></em>.</p><div><p>The company kept its <em>Zelda </em>momentum going with updated versions of classics like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics">Link’s Awakening</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22576029/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-nintendo-switch">Skyward Sword</a></em>. And even though the first Switch was nearing the end of its life cycle, Nintendo pushed the series even further into the future with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Tears of the Kingdom</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">Echoes of Wisdom</a></em>. The way <em>Zelda </em>flourished on the Switch is undoubtedly part of why the franchise is being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">adapted into a live-action movie</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-of-legend-of-zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-at-universal-studios-pulled-offline">seemingly getting the theme park treatment</a>. And now we know a bit more about how the princess’s legend will continue with the Switch 2.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From deserts, to snowy landscapes, to more fantastical settings, <em>Mario Kart</em> looks as speedy and destructive as you’d expect it to be.</p><p>The new game is set in a massive open world with dynamic time of day and weather.

The JoyCons can also be used as a mouse, which should make first-person shooters even more fun on the device.</p><p>Here’s a fun one: with headphones, the Switch 2 features 3D audio, a technology that simulates surround sound.</p><p>The console itself features an improved kickstand and <em>two</em> USB-C ports, letting you charge the device while using extra peripherals. </p><p>The new system also includes 256GB internal storage, thank god.</p><p>The new Dock enables 4k resolution (!) when playing in Docked mode.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> might be promising exciting new instalments of classic franchises (like, say, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">open-world Mario Kart</a>), but Nintendo's now also confirmed it'll be releasing special enhanced editions of original Switch games featuring higher resolutions, improved frame rates, and more.
</p>
<p>
While the company is yet to share an exhaustive list of games getting the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition treatment (as it's calling the initiative), the following are so far confirmed: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, Metroid Prime: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends Z-A.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Switch 2 Editions will be available to purchase physically and digitally, but players who already own the original Switch versions can alternatively purchase an upgrade pack to gain access to the new Switch 2-exclusive features. Upgrade prices haven't yet been revealed, but Nintendo <em>has</em> confirmed - via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiLoePc9tds">post-Direct trailer</a> - the Zelda upgrades will be free to anyone with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership.

<figcaption>Here's a look at Zelda's Switch 2 enhancements.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiLoePc9tds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Starting with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, these'll both get enhanced resolution and improved frame rates on Switch 2, alongside support for HDR, and a number of brand-new features. Zelda Notes, for instance, is a available via the Nintendo Switch App on smart devices and offers a range of helpful tools to get the most out of your Zelda-ing, such as pointers toward shrines and Korok locations - and it'll even read out directions so you don't need to be looking at the screen. Additionally, Tears of the Kingdom players can upload their creations to the app then share them with other players.
</p>
<p>
Kirby and the Forgotten Land, meanwhile, is getting additional story content in its Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - taking place after the Forgotten Land has been struck by a mysterious meteor - alongside improved graphics and frame rates. And as for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, its Switch 2 Edition adds support for mouse controls in addition to its standard control scheme. Switch 2 players also get several fidelity options: it's playable at 4K and 60fps with HDR in Quality Mode, and at 1080p/120fps with HDR in Performance mode.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Legends Z-A is also set to received a Switch 2 Edition which similarly promises enhanced resolution and frame rates, and there are improvements coming to Super Mario Party Jamboree.
</p>
<p>
Alongside Switch 2's paid upgrades, a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">post-Direct announcement</a> has revealed Nintendo is also preparing free updates for a number of original Switch titles. The company hasn't gone into much detail about these yet, only saying the updates will "improve playability" on Switch 2. Improvements will vary by game, but Nintendo says updates may enhance performance or add support for features such as GameShare. Titles so far confirmed for free updates are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arms</li>

<h2>Mario Kart World announced</h2>
<p>We all knew it was coming but the Nintendo Direct fully confirmed that Mario Kart World is going to be one of the Switch 2 launch games. Once again you'll be able to face against characters from the Mario franchise - be it in a kart or on a motorbike. Mario Kart World brings weather conditions and changes to the time of day too! Best of all, you're no longer subject to the rules of the tracks and even have to drive between the tracks you race on.</p>
<p>There will be a Mario Kart World direct on Thursday 17th April at 2pm (local time).</p>

<h2>Switch 2 system details explained</h2>
<p>Here's everything we know about the <strong>Switch 2 system</strong> we know so far - from its <strong>hardware</strong>, <strong>controllers </strong>and<strong> internal software</strong>. We wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo is still keeping some secrets though, so we recommend keeping an eye on our 'Everything we know about Switch 2 guide' as we'll be updating that every time new information is announced.</p>
<h2>Switch 2 console details</h2>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the important facts concerning the Switch 2 console itself. (Don't worry, the screen has its own section.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Plays compatible Nintendo Switch games</li>
<li>256 GB of internal storage</li>
<li>Reading and writing data is faster</li>
<li>Two USB-C ports - one at the bottom of the console, one at the top</li>
<li>Improved sound from built-in speakers in handheld and tabletop modes</li>
<li>3D audio for selected games</li>
<li>Built-in mic for Game Chat (voice and video chat)</li>
<li>Uses noise cancelling technology to filter sounds and remove background noise</li>
<li>New stand which allows you to freely adjust the viewing angle and doesn't look like it will snap off at a moments notice</li>
<li>The Switch 2 is 13.9cm wide (the same as the Nintendo Switch!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Switch 2 screen details</h2>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of what the Nintendo Direct revealed about the Switch 2's screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>7.9 inches</li>
<li>1080p</li>
<li>Supports up to 120 fps</li>
<li>LCD screen</li>
<li>Supports HDR for selected titles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Switch 2 dock details</h2>
<p>We also learnt more about the Switch 2's dock:</p>
<ul>
<li>4k support for compatible games</li>
<li>HDR is supported in TV mode</li>
<li>In-built fan ventilation in stand</li>
</ul>
<h2>Joy-Con 2 details</h2>
<p>Here's a quick run down of all the important details revealed about the Joy-Con 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach magnetically</li>
<li>Detached by pressing release button on the back</li>
<li>Bigger SL and SR buttons</li>
<li>Larger control sticks</li>
<li>Mouse controls</li>
<li>C-Button for Game Chat (voice and video chat)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's learn more about the C-Button and mouse controls!</p>
<h2>Game Chat and Joy-Con 2 C-Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>C Button</strong> has been a mystery ever since it was spotted during the Switch 2's reveal back in January, but now its purpose has been revealed.</p>
<p>Pressing the C Button allows you to open <strong>Game Chat</strong> when playing a game on the Switch 2. It should be able to pick your voice up at a distance and it can also be used in handheld mode. You'll also be able to share your game screen, which is adjustable. It can even be used when you're playing different games.</p>
<p>The Right Joy-Con 2 C-Button lets you pull up a chat menu where you'll find options like mute.</p>
<p>While an Online Nintendo Switch is required to use Game Chat, there will be a welcoming period where the feature will be available for free until March 31st 2026. (You will have to pay once this date passes.) Game Chat will also support Nintendo Parental Controls, including a Game Chat History.</p>

<h2>Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls</h2>
<p>The Joy-Con 2 controllers will come with mouse controls, which can be accessed by detaching the controls from the Switch 2 and placing them flat down on a surface. Doing so will let you use them just like a computer mouse! Though, since this is Nintendo, there are some motion controls as well.</p>
<p>During the Nintendo Direct, we got a look at Drag x Drive - a game coming in Summer 2025 where these mouse controllers will be fully utilised. Drag x Drive is a three versus three basketball game.</p>
<h2>Switch 2 Camera</h2>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is a new accessory coming for Nintendo's next console. Using it during Game Chat will allow you to video call other players when playing together - whether it's the same game or not.</p>
<p>This camera will be available from launch and will cost £49.99.</p>
<p>Here's hoping the days pass quickly until it launches, but slowly after the Switch 2 is in our hands!</p>
