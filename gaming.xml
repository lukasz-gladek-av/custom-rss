		<p>FuturLab has announced that it will be releasing PowerWash Simulator 2 on October 23rd, making the announcement with a new trailer. The follow up to PowerWash Simulator is going to be available on &nbsp;Steam, Epic Games, Windows Store, Xbox Series X|S, PS5 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2 with a price of $24.99 / €24.99 / £19.99 / JP¥2970.</p>

<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 expands massively on the original game, with powerwashing just being one of the activities in the game. The town of Muckingham &nbsp;will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham. There will be additional locations to explore too including &nbsp;Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City. You will have access to new tools including an abseiling rig and cherry picker to reach those hard to reach spots.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/06/powerwash-simulator-2-preview-twice-the-cleaning-power/">PowerWash Simulator 2 Preview – Twice the cleaning power?</a></h2>
<p>In our PowerWash Simulator 2 preview, Stefan said, <em>“There’s plenty more to PowerWash Simulator 2 that we didn’t really get to toy with, from the customisable home base, to designing van liveries, to playing co-op online or in split-screen, and the career story, though we did at least get to give Ulysses the cat and some random kittens a little tickle every now and then. What’s most important, though, is that this retains that soothing essence of the reverse colouring book gameplay, with a few new options and tools just adding a smidgeon more variety.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>developer FuturLab has revealed the upcoming cleaning sim's release date, and it's much closer than you might think, so it won't be long before you can load up your power washer once again.</p>

<p>As announced via a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 23rd. As far as we know, the game is due to launch on day one for Game Pass as well, although given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, that might not be quite such an enticing prospect anymore.</p>

<p>Announced back in March this year,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is, as the name suggests, the sequel to 2022's relaxing cleaning sim&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>. Like its predecessor, this followup will let you loose on a variety of filthy environments, and it's up to you to make them clean once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-grime.jpg?itok=tqaHQAwT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-grime.jpg?itok=4urDB8zd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's so much grime and dirt in here it's practically painful.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a sequel if there weren't improvements and new features galore, and so you can expect to explore not only Muckingham but the environs beyond its borders this time around.</p>

<p>Those locations will be part of a brand new campaign that will take you to such aptly-named locations as Sponge Valley, Power Falls, and Lubri City. I wouldn't think too hard about that last one if I were you.</p>

<p>New multi-stage jobs will test your cleaning prowess over several different stages, and naturally, you can expect a range of new tools to help you tackle those jobs, including a new abseiling rig, a cherry picker, and a surface cleaner for bigger areas.</p>

<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which shows off some of the game's satisfying-looking cleaning action (as well as its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">frankly criminally adorable cat</a>), right here.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 23rd.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-25000mah-100w-laptop-power-bank-is-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-rushing-to-clear-its-inventory-2000632554</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-25-000mah-100w-laptop-power-bank-is-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-rushing-to-clear-its-inventory.1318726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small power banks that charge your phone are handy, but did you know power banks exist for laptops too? They’re less common but incredibly practical, especially since they can charge your phone and other devices at the same time. Running out of battery during a flight or during a long day away from outlets becomes a non-issue when you have serious charging capacity in your bag. For Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">has dropped the price on the most popular Anker (25,000mAh, 100W) laptop power bank to $89, down from $134</a>. That’s a $45 discount and an all-time low for this Anker model, <strong>available exclusively to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Anker power bank <strong>boasts an enormous capacity of 25,000mAh</strong> which equates to usable real-world powering of your devices. For context, it’s enough to give a full charge to a MacBook Air, enough to supply your iPhone several full charges or keep your tablet going for hours of continuous use. With a 90Wh rating, it also falls within airline requirements for personal protective devices for your carry-ons, so it’s permissible to bring it onboard your flights.</p>
<h2>Triple 100W USB-C Ports Upgrade Your Charging Experience</h2>
<p>The <strong>crown jewel here is the three USB-C ports</strong>, each of which is capable of dispensing a <strong>whopping 100W of power</strong>. That’s important because newer laptops require serious power to charge at a full speed. A MacBook Pro 16-inch, say, requires about 96W for best-in-class charging. With 100W per port, you’ll be able to charge your laptop at full speed, <strong>all while powering other devices simultaneously.</strong></p>



<p>The built-in cables rectify one of the greatest nuisances of power banks: forgetting or misplacing charging cables. <strong>Anker ships two USB-C cables embedded on the power bank itself</strong>. One of them reaches a distance of up to 2.3 feet and gives you a degree of mobility when outlets are centralized or when you want to access your device as it charges. This retractable cable is rated for more than 20,000 times of retraction so it should not readily fail due to wear and tear. The other cable is 0.98 feet long and also serves as a strap for carrying, designed to withstand over 20,000 bends. Such a dual purpose creates durability and portability.</p>
<p>Along with the built-in cabling, there are also other sources of charging <strong>available in the form of a USB-A port and a second USB-C port</strong>, for a<strong> total of four devices being charged simultaneously</strong>. This setup is best for traveling families or professionals who carry multiple devices along. You may charge your laptop off one built-in cabling, your cell phone off the other, your wireless headsets off the USB-A port and a smartwatch off the additional USB-C port.</p>



<p>Recharging of the power bank itself is incredibly quick due to a 100W ultra-fast recharging feature. It achieves a capacity of being at a 30% state by being plugged into a charger of 100W within a total of 22 minutes. <strong>Recharging takes a total of about 90 minutes</strong>&nbsp;so keep it topped off during your morning getting-ready process or lunchtime.</p>
<p>As a Prime member for $89 during this Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re getting laptop-level powering capability at a budget-friendly cost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will the jump button come back in the next <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>? Will<em> Battlefield 6</em> really work right out of the box? Can <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> prevent the further atomization of modern society? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I am still thinking about Xbox and how much Microsoft keeps fumbling the bag. And I’m <a href="https://x.com/JamiesAct/status/1975227593763999973">apparently not</a> <a href="https://x.com/JamiesAct/status/1975244040896716915">the only</a> <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1975556977536475617">one</a>. But for real: what’s going on <a href="https://x.com/Omnipotentgam0r/status/1974904157829321171">with those Walmart displays</a>?</p> <h2>The Saudi Arabia <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> DLC will let you manually jump</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Reportedly funded by</a> Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the <em>Valley of Memory</em> DLC is a free major update for the 2023 game that takes Basim to the AlUla region in search of his long-lost father. It includes a new skill, tool customization, difficulty levels, and replaybale missions and challenges. The most important change to me, however, is the addition of a manual jump to add more depth to the parkour. The stealth action series hasn’t had a dedicated jump button since <em>Unity</em> as movement became more streamlined and automated. Hopefully, the experiment pays dividends in <em>Valley of Memory</em> and paves the way for more complex parkour in the next big <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is reportedly coming to PS Plus this month</h2> <p>That’s according <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">to billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, who says last year’s PS5 exclusive will be arriving as part of the Extra and Premium tiers later this month. It arrives alongside <em>Alan Wake 2</em> on PS Plus Essential and <em>The </em><em>Last of Us Part 2</em> on Extra and Premium. Not a bad haul for this year’s Halloween.</p>

 <h2>Physical copies of <em>Battlefield 6</em> are out early and include at least part of the game on the actual disc</h2>   <p>Bucking recent trends, <em>Battlefield 6</em> apparently comes with the actual game on the disc, at least on PS5. A fan on Reddit claims the servers are live and the campaign and multiplayer both work. You can preview the game’s full day-one update and all of the over 200 changes it makes <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1975214752314937744">here</a>.</p>

 <h2>Funcom layoffs hit <em>Metal Hellsinger</em> studio</h2> <p>The Outsiders, a Funcom studio based in Stockholm, Sweden, is shutting down, founder and creative director David Goldfarb <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m">announced yesterday</a>. The team had previously produced the rhythm-based demonic FPS <em>Hellsinger</em> which sold one million copies. ” It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen,” he wrote. The veteran developer said the plan is to “continue on in some new form.”</p> <h2><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is out October 23</h2>  <p>The sequel to the hit <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-sim-2-trailer-release-campaign-splitscreen-1851769691">OCD management game</a> arrives with some upgraded visuals, split-screen co-op, and an increased focus on story beats which the original game kept mostly in the background.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marathon</i>, Bungie’s upcoming hero extraction shooter, is getting another invite-only test soon. The test will run from October 22 to 27, and <a href="http://www.bungie.net/7/cen/News/Article/techtestapply">folks can sign up right here</a>. Things haven’t gone great for <i>Marathon</i> thus far, but following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">disappointing reception</a> of the first alpha test, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">embarrassing accusations of plagiarism</a>, it’ll be interesting to see what tweaks Bungie has made and just what the game is shaping up to be.</p> <p>Revealed back in 2023 with a very impressive cinematic trailer, <i>Marathon</i> is a reboot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-marathon-halo-destiny-extraction-shooter-1850480259">Bungie’s classic <i>Doom</i>-like shooter</a> from the ‘90s. It’s also Bungie’s first new shooter since it made the pivot to <i>Destiny</i> in the early 2010s, following its departure from Microsoft and the <i>Halo</i> series.</p>

 <h2>There’s still no release date for <i>Marathon</i>, and the game has a lot to prove to fans</h2> <p><i>Marathon</i> was originally slated to release for current-gen consoles and PC on September 23, 2025. That date has come and gone. Unfortunately for Bungie, folks didn’t find the game terribly fun during the alpha earlier this year, and so the studio made the decision to indefinitely delay its release. The drab environments didn’t really speak to Bungie’s artistic strengths, and the hero shooter element (which I, a huge extraction shooter fan, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">tried to be open-minded</a> about) still seems like an odd fit.</p>

Matches mostly consisted of fights with the same repetitive robots instead of incorporating the more alluring palette of creature designs the <i>Marathon</i> franchise has.</p>

 <p>We do know that the upcoming closed test will let players try out a new feature: Proximity chat, which allows you to hear other players’ voice chatter only when you’re near them. Bungie initially wanted to avoid using this, as the studio felt it was ripe for toxicity and abuse. While proximity chat can result in, well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/warzone-2-features-proximity-chat-gulag-contracts-mw2-1849793098">rather silly situations in a shooter</a>, it’s a pretty important feature in a PvPvE game; overhearing nearby players not only adds a bit of voyeuristic drama, but it can also help you avoid getting jumped sometimes.</p>

 <p>The closed test will also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-marathon-details-leak-from-latest-closed-test/">feature some tweaks to TTK (time-to-kill) as well</a>. We’ll see if this is enough to start rehabilitating <i>Marathon</i>’s image for folks.</p> <h2>It’s been a real cluster-f over at Bungie from the sounds of things</h2> <p>Conversations about the nuances of what does and doesn’t work in <i>Marathon</i> were all pushed to the side when it was revealed that Bungie had lifted designs from artist antire.al without permission or acknowledgement.</p>

 <p>Bungie had its explanations for how the artist’s work made it into its game, essentially saying that it was material used for inspiration and research that found its way into production pipelines, and thus made it into the game. The studio blamed this oversight on a former employee and promised a full review of all its assets to be sure this wouldn’t happen again.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-physical-copies-require-no-additional-downloads/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-physical-copies-require-no-additional-downloads.1318714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Players have reported that Battlefield 6 physical copies include the entire game and do not require any additional downloads to play. </p>



<p>It’s less than 3 days until the highly anticipated Battlefield 6 releases on October 10, 2025. Interestingly, some players who had pre-ordered the physical copy of BF6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-physical-copies-reportedly-received-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received the game early</a> and have started providing reports on what is available on the disc, and it seems you can have the whole experience right off the bat. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-servers-seem-like-they-are-already-online">Battlefield 6 Servers Seem Like They Are Already Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-physical-copies-are-content-complete-and-require-no-initial-install-according-to-early-copy-holders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the original poster, who had received Battlefield 6’s physical copy early, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2p42z/?share_id=gftOQn-SiPIYz2EDMKSD6&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> some other details as well. A player asked the OP whether the game was playable without an internet connection and required no additional downloads, and the answer was “yes”. The OP also confirmed other points, such as being able to play the campaign through the Battlefield 6 disc, and the multiplayer servers seem to be online as well. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have also contributed to the hype ahead of the game’s release recently. During a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a>, the developers stated that “requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more.” These points are likely to make fans happy, as even more exciting content appears to be on the way. </p>

While it's not as sweeping in scale as Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, it'll still take a solid 40 hours to complete (and much longer if you want to unlock all its secrets). Best of all, the hit game is <strong>down to just $40 (was $60)</strong> for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Big Deal Days</a>. This is by far the lowest price of the year, and it's close to its lowest price ever (the game hit $38.50 way back in 2023).

A decade later, it would be re-released on Nintendo Switch as Skyward Sword HD. Benefiting from updated graphics, simplified controls, an autosave feature, and a streamlined introduction sequence, it's arguably the best way to experience the iconic adventure. This deal is for a physical copy of the Switch game, but the offer won't stick around forever. We're expecting it to disappear at the end of Big Deal Days, though quantities are limited, and it very well looks like it'll sell out sooner. Note that Skyward Sword HD will run on both Switch and Switch 2.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6417698/" data-ref-id="1900-6417698">Skyward Sword HD review</a> awarded the game a 7/10, thanks to its clever dungeons, excellent story, and heaps of quality of life improvements that make it more enjoyable than its predecessor.</p><p>"Skyward Sword is also filled with many genuinely magical moments," wrote critic Kevin Knezevic. "The soundtrack, notable for being Zelda's first fully orchestrated score, is still delightful, and the story is one of the most touching tales the series has ever woven, shedding light on the origins of Hyrule and other elements that have become hallmarks of the franchise. The game's dungeons are a highlight, as well, filled with clever puzzles that test your observation and lateral thinking. After Breath of the Wild excised classic-style dungeons, Skyward Sword's feel especially fresh and satisfying to explore, and the boss battles that await within are among the most fun encounters in the series."</p><p>This isn't the only great Switch game on sale during Amazon's shopping holiday.

		<p>Redemption Road Games has delayed Kingmakers just before its anticipated early access release date of October 8th, and the studio has not stated when the game is now expected to release. This is the second delay for Kingmakers, which was originally scheduled for early access in Q1 2025. If you need a refresher of what Kingmakers is, it is a game where you go 500 years back in time, fighting in a medieval battle to change the course of history using modern weapons and tech.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Redemption Road Games said, <em>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch of October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating the game. We are sorry for letting you down. Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short, it’s an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don’t want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out of the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that’s nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</em></p>
<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from a AAA third person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6 story castles, where every room can be entered, and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>When you drive a car into a tree, you’re ejected through the windshield, the tree breaks from its stump, and then rolls over whatever hapless soldiers are along its path. Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore- with or without their thousands of soldiers. We set out to do all of this, with full drop in/drop out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it. So this is what we’re doing now. We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top of the line rig or a PC that’s seen better days. Thank you so much for all of your love and support. We hope we are doing everything we can to earn it. We will be presenting a half hour long deepdive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we’ve been working on.”</em></p>

The case 'entered default', granting NOA the right to take the full requested amount in damages as a result, though we didn't know what the final sum would be.

<p>One section of the document reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NOA has been, and continues to be, damaged as a direct and proximate result of Williams’ conduct. NOA has reason to believe that Williams has engaged in the infringing and unlawful reproduction and distribution of hundreds or thousands of copyrighted Nintendo Switch Games, and that through the various Pirate Shops, he has distributed or facilitated the distribution of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of unauthorized copies of such Nintendo Switch Games. NOA also has expended and continues to expend significant resources to halt or stem video game piracy, including through developing, implementing, and updating its TPMs and policing and investigating reports of piracy such as Williams’.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the document, Williams has remained silent on the matter. NOA states that it was contacted by a lawyer claiming to represent the defendant back in January 2025 with a message that read “Mr. Williams understands that Nintendo may have a right to obtain documents in support of its motion for default judgment”, though there has been no further communication in the months since.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Williams will pay up to Nintendo's demands, but the Big N is showing no signs of backing down any time soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Back in July, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/nintendo-files-two-new-lawsuits-in-continued-clamp-down-on-switch-piracy">dished out a handful of lawsuits</a> in its continued clampdown on Switch piracy. Four months on, one of these legal claims has come back as another win for Nintendo after the defendant failed to plead or otherwise respond within the court's given time.</p>
<p>The case in question was against James 'Archbox' Williams, the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit, who Nintendo accused of offering "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games" via several "pirate shops".</p>
<p>According to the initial case, Williams was a self-confessed "pirate" who had previously publicly stated that he "[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game”. The lawsuit (as shared by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-archbox.pdf">TorrentFreak</a>) saw Nintendo request "actual or maximum statutory damages" for several violations should he be found guilty.</p>
<p>However, no such ruling has had to take place. In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.18.0.pdf">new court document</a> filed by the Superior Court of the state of Washington on 8th November, it was revealed that the case has now 'entered default' after Williams "failed to plead or otherwise defend within the time prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil<br>
Procedure".</p>
<p>A default judgment can be reached early on in legal proceedings if the defendant fails to take the required actions. In this instance, the claim can be passed without a court hearing, usually granting the claimant the full requested amount plus interest and costs.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.15.0.pdf">accompanying more detailed document</a> from Washington's District Court explains that Williams responded to a Nintendo cease and desist letter in March 2024 stating that he would "'comply and cooperate with any demands or requests . . . within [his] control' but denying any infringement of Nintendo’s intellectual property".</p>
<p>Nintendo then sent a court order to the same address (and another possible abode that the document describes as the "Surprise Address"), to which Williams did not reply within the prescribed time. And so we arrive at the default judgement.</p>
<p>The court can set aside this decision if it transpires that Williams <em>did</em> reply to the proceedings or if it rules that Williams has a strong enough defence. But, for the time being, at least, this looks like another line in the 'win' column for Nintendo.</p>
<p>A Nintendo lawsuit submitted around the same time as the Williams case was against <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/pour-one-out-for-the-modchip-seller-facing-nintendo-in-court-alone">modchip seller Modded Hardware</a>. This claim is now progressing to the next stage, with the alleged owner of the store, Ryan Daly, standing self-represented in court.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_Pb2cLqmk4">debuted a new animated short</a> titled "<em>Close to You</em>" with absolutely no explanation as to what it means. The short was simultaneously uploaded to the Nintendo Today app, the company's social media channels, and its YouTube channel, each with nothing more than its title to accompany it.</p>



<p>Of course, wild speculation online immediately followed the video's publishing, with fans going in a few directions based on the video's contents and what seem to be subtle hints regarding what it could mean.</p>



<p>The video itself is a nearly four-minute short of a baby following a magical soother around the room, accompanied by high-quality animation and visual fidelity, and some playful music which fans recognized as music from Pikmin 4. The music, along with the fact that a blurry Pikmin can be seen crossing the background of a shot at one point, has fans pointing to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o0f26r/new_pikmin_teaser/">being a Pikmin-related tease</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Close to you" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_Pb2cLqmk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But is it a tease for an upcoming Pikmin game? Or is it potentially a tease for a different Pikmin project, maybe even a Pikmin film or series? Or what if it's not a Pikmin project, and something else entirely?</p>



<p>It could be, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-posts-mysterious-close-to-you-animated-short-film/">VGC's deputy editor Chris Scullion speculates</a>, a tease at the origin story for Rosalina for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a>. Or it's still something entirely different, like potentially a new project featuring baby versions of Nintendo characters, and this is Rosalina, followed by Baby Peach, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and the rest of Nintendo's iconic characters all coming together in either a new game or a new Rugrats-style series featuring the various Nintendo babies.</p>



<p>Your guess is as good as mine or anyone else's at this point. Hopefully, we don't have to wait too long for Nintendo to explain more about "<em>Close to You</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-crucial-p310-ssd-now-costs-only-cents-per-gb-a-steal-for-steam-deck-or-rog-ally-storage-upgrade.1318660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re here in the thick of Prime Big Deals Day and there are some great opportunities to save on pretty much anything. Kitchen appliances, bedding, automotive tools, and, yes, even gaming hardware are on sale with huge discounts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/">Right now, Amazon has the Crucial P310 internal SSD discounted by up to 49%</a>. The 1TB version — normally $135 — is now down to $80 while the 2TB version — normally $240 — is now down to just $122. That’s a savings of up to $188.</p>
<p>File sizes for AAA video games have been surpassing behemoth levels for some time now. Look at something like <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. It requires a whopping 150GB of your storage to install. And that’s a game from 2018. I can’t even begin to imagine what absurd size requirement Rockstar’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will have.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This PCIe Gen4 2230 NVMe M.2 SSD is smaller than your standard internal SSDs and that’s because it is designed with PC gaming handhelds in mind to help you bring your whole game library with you when you hit the road.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck has three models, each with a different internal capacity. The LCD version of the Steam Deck only comes with 256GB while with the OLED, you have a choice of 512GB or 1TB. The ROG Ally and all new ROG Xbox Ally each come with 512GB. If those numbers aren’t enough for the gaming you want to do on the go, then you can upgrade with the Crucial P310 SSD.&nbsp;Installation is easy and should only take you about five minutes of your time to get you started gaming with way more storage.</p>
<p>While the Crucial P310 SSD is made with the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally in mind, it is additionally compatible with certain laptops such as the Microsoft Surface or select Dell models.</p>



<h2>Extreme Performance</h2>
<p>The Crucial gaming SSD is capable of read and write speeds of up to 7,100 MB/s. You can expect fast load times. Power efficiency is always good to have with PC hardware both for environmental reasons and to keep the electric bill down. Here, though, there is an added benefit. Game longer. Better power efficiency means easier on the battery means you can play for longer before it dies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/">For a limited time, you can expand the storage on your PC gaming handheld to a large capacity of either 1TB or 2TB with the Crucial P310 internal SSD.</a> The 1TB is down 41% to $80 while the 2TB is down 49% to $122.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I finally broke the seal on </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>this past week because I am a mark for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-skins-rumi-mira-zoey-event-2000630221"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>and its trio of monster-slaying idols. Epic fast-tracked skins, cosmetics, and a reskinned mode themed around Netflix’s animated musical, and I paid for my first V-Bucks to play as Rumi and fight hordes of demons with shotguns and SMGs. Friends, it gave me the ick. I loathe </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s brand of artless, cross-promotional excess, and even a solid social hub and battle royale can’t wash that away for me. You know what can, though? Watching the singing voices of Huntr/x get into </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> now that their characters are in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Rei Ami, the singing voice of Huntr/x’s rapper Zoey, has been campaigning for a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>X </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>collaboration for months, and even </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rei.ami/video/7555327877944839455"><span>got to reveal her character’s skin ahead of the crossover’s launch</span></a><span>. Now that she’s finally got it, she’s been playing </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>on streams and TikTok Lives as Zoey, and I haven’t seen a pop-off as hype as the first time she got a Victory Royale in the skin in a minute. My girl is out here emoting in real life.</span></p>

   <p><span>Ejae and Audrey Nuna, the singing voices for Rumi and Mira, aren’t </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>players, but they did shoot a promo video reacting to the skins in which the group jokes about taking a class on how to play Epic’s game.</span></p>

   <p><span>Well, it looks like those lessons are happening. Rei Ami posted a video during their ongoing promotional tour for </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters,</span></i><span> showing them spending some of their spare time playing </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>. Ejae managed to get 36th place in her first battle royale match as Rumi, though she was killed by another player called WetPickle4996. I want to talk to that player. Do they know they just destroyed the Honmoon?</span></p>    <p><span>I’m obsessed with this, and I’m waiting for some talented animators and artists to draw Zoey teaching Rumi and Mira how to play </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> like a new fandom in-joke. Huntr/x probably doesn’t have that much time to game these days, though, as the group is about to make their live debut on </span><i><span>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</span></i><span> as the musical guest. The trio is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzuUNSf0bCg"><span>performing “Golden” on tonight’s episode</span></a><span>.</span></p>

Up to four players can fight against the undead together in the roguelike game when version 1.14 drops later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Poncle revealed the new online co-op mode for Vampire Survivors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTa_8nDjIo4">on YouTube</a>. The trailer--seen below--shows how players can either create or join a lobby, with an ID number seemingly utilized to group up. It's unclear whether there will be cross-play at this time. "Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665 ... More players doesn't make it easier, or does it," Poncle wrote in the video's description.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire Survivors Online Co-Op is Coming Soon | Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Vampire Survivors video also features five different cards for version 1.14, with online co-op being the first one unveiled. Poncle stated that another announcement will occur next week. The developer teased that "we might finally answer a burning question that has been asked thousands of times."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-survivors-adds-co-op-teases-adventures-mode-and-more/1100-6516980/">Vampire Survivors actually got local co-op</a> roughly two years with version 1.6. However, that requires sharing a single screen, while online co-op will let each player run off on their own if they want. In 2023, Poncle did <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-vampire-survivors-couch-co-op-details-revealed-and-online-co-op-could-be-coming/1100-6515861/">hint at online co-op</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Vampire Survivors got another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-vampire-survivors-update-is-out-now-adds-several-saga-frontier-characters/1100-6530763/">free update that introduced characters from Square Enix's fantasy-RPG series SaGa</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> will be launching on 23rd October, 2025. It'll be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>This was announced on the official PowerWash Simulator 2 X account, which posted a release date trailer. This not only introduces some of the grimey locations you'll be cleaning up, but also the home base you'll be hanging around in. This home base, obviously, has pet cats called Bubbles and Squeak.</p>
<p>The game is also coming to Game Pass, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">so for those who are still subscribed even with the recent price changes</a>, you'll be able to play it as part of your ongoing subscription.</p>

<p>We do know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-powerwash-simulator-2-is-bringing-back-the-ludicrous-brilliant-lore">PowerWash Simulator 2 will be continuing the original games' ridiculous and brilliant lore</a>, which should give avid cleaners something more to delve into other than muck. Those interested in getting their hands dirty can wishlist the game now on Steam, or try out the demo first if they're curious as to what the hype is all about.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-offers-more-of-the-same-relaxation-but-can-it-warrant-its-sequel-status">In Eurogamer's PowerWash Simulator 2 preview</a>, Ed Nightingale wrote: "With that in mind, this refined sequel provides FuturLab the perfect platform to continue tweaking and experimenting with its cleaning sim - as long as the dirt doesn't wear too thin. Perhaps we could even get some rug cleaning DLC to really get the ASMR tingles going - and monopolise my relaxation time for good."</p>

		<p>Yacht Club Games has announced that it is delaying Mina The Hollower, with the developer stating that the game will not be ready to release by October 31st. The delay is not expected to be too long, but Yacht Club Games is not going to commit to a new release date until it has been submitted to platforms and gone through all the necessary steps.</p>

<p>In a statement, Yacht Club Games wrote,<em>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine. With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</em></p>
<p><em>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line. The game is&nbsp;so&nbsp;close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Finalizing design, art, and sound</em></li>
<li><em>Overall game balancing</em></li>
<li><em>Implementing localization</em></li>
<li><em>Eating cheese</em></li>
<li><em>Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thank you for your understanding and patience.”</em></p>

<p>Mina The Hollower was announced three years ago and is an action adventure game that has used the Game Boy 8 bit aesthetic as inspiration. Mina is a mouse, a whip-wielding inventor that uses this signature weapon for attacking enemies, and to whip walls and items in the world to destroy and manipulate them. The game is expected to release for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, XS, Xbox One, Switch and Switch 2.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5478621784a18"><a title="Mario's Super Picross" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5478621784a18/marios-super-picross.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>New month, new NSO icons. With the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-missions-and-rewards-october-2025-dk-bananza-dlc-mario-galaxy-mario-party-3-marios-super-picross">Nintendo Switch Online Missions &amp; Rewards Program</a>, you can nab some rather unique icons for your Switch profile.</p>
<p>Now, you <em>could</em> grab some icons for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party_3">Mario Party 3</a> — and they're quite nice, too — but have you seen those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a> icons? No? Well just look at them! (Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/IconsNSO/status/1975373237623418889">NSO Icon Alerts</a> for highlighting them!)</p>
<p>These icons, shown below, are part of the monthly Play &amp; Redeem scheme for NSO members. All you have to do is boot up Mario's Super Picross on the SNES app and then you can purchase those icon elements using Platinum Points.</p>
<p>It doesn't even take 10 seconds if you have the SNES app downloaded already, so if you like 'em and you have the points... What's stopping you?</p>
<figure data-uuid="4311ccd07c8f1"><a title="Mario's Super Picross NSO Icons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4311ccd07c8f1/marios-super-picross-nso-icons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario's Super Picross was added to the Nintendo Classics service (formerly Nintendo Switch Online) back in 2020. Acting as a direct sequel to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/marios_picross">Game Boy original</a>, this one is largely the same, except once you beat the first level, you'll have access to Wario's version of the game, where you have additional rules to consider.</p>
<p>The game only launched in Japan on the Super Famicom, though it did launch on the PAL Wii and Wii U Virtual Console stores in 2007 and 2013 respectively.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Switch Online release is available to everyone. Plus, If you have a Switch 2 (or a USB mouse) you can actually play it with mouse controls, too!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While it initially sounded absurd to release the third title in a trilogy before the first two, thematically and chronologically, it makes perfect sense. If Dragon Quest III was a tale of the most famous Erdrick of the trilogy, Dragon Quest I and II both take up the helm generations after the fact and continue the work initially started to protect Alefgard from catastrophe. What we got to play at Tokyo Game Show 2025 was just a small taste of the opening hours of both titles that encompass the Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake, which rounds off the trilogy. </p>



<p>Both of the first two Dragon Quest titles take a different approach to the hero's journey. For the first and inaugural Dragon Quest title, it's literally one man versus the world as the nameless Hero must acquire Wrdrick's legendary equipment to best the big bad Dragonlord before they can take over the world. In the second Dragon Quest title (and last in the trilogy chronologically, taking place roughly a century after the first game), it's up to a small party of Luminairies and family members to do the deed. Perhaps Square-Enix will fix some of the gear issues and give the Prince of Cannock something better to wear than a coffin all the time.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, Square-Enix and Armor Studio have given Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake the same overhaul that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the third title received last year</a>. This has the unfortunate side effect of making all three titles feel relatively homogenized compared to how the original trilogy both looked and played on the original NES. Dragon Quest I remains the largest outlier of the trilogy, with both a singular protagonist and a shorter runtime, but it still captures the same joy of JRPGs as the other two.</p>



<p>The original NES release of Dragon Quest, or Dragon Warrior in the West, was a very short adventure by modern standards. Even with the added necessity to groom in the US release of Dragon Warrior, players could expect to finish the adventure in roughly ten hours with only a few major plot points and dungeons along the way. Square-Enix has remedied that by including new story scenarios neatly into the gameplay in places that feel natural. For the first title, a new scenario was added to retrieve the Thief's Key from a merchant, only to have it be stolen by Robbin' 'Ood before the player can get to it. This leads to a small side quest in a dungeon that was originally optional in the adventure (Craggy Cave) and an encounter with the thief himself, one that players would recognize from the HD-2D Remake of Dragon Quest III and many other subsequent titles in the series.</p>



<p>Similarly, Dragon Quest II received a substantial amount of new content, with the majority that I was able to play in my short demo being that of an underwater map to recover Lorelai's Harp as well as a small lottery minigame. Dragon Quest II frequently was at the bottom of ranking lists across the entire series and was the most in need of a proper overhaul, so I'm glad to see that it's receiving all sorts of new content this time around, beyond just the fresh coat of paint. </p>



<p>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake will be out soon, with a release date set for October 30th, 2025 across PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 1 and 2, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. With less than four weeks to go before release, that's the perfect time to jump into Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake and explore the foundations of the trilogy before diving into the next two titles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Aloft Bloom & Blight Update Set to Bring Big Improvements in November]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-bloom-and-blight-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aloft-bloom-blight-update-set-to-bring-big-improvements-in-november.1318627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Funcom and developer Astrolabe Interactive have announced the Bloom &amp; Blight update for cozy survival adventure&nbsp;<i>Aloft</i>, and it's set to bring big improvements to the game next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update will arrive on November 4th, and the two studios are talking a big game for the update; it's apparently set to improve "almost every facet" of the game.</p>

<p>According to Funcom and Astrolabe, Bloom &amp; Blight will "revamp and improve almost every aspect of [<em>Aloft</em>], including world generation, tech tree progression, exploration and travel, ecosystem restoration, and combat", so this is a pretty ambitious undertaking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=kwigv55z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=_Jing2EI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>is getting a very big update indeed soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the changes coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update were outlined in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/517473930105061675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">developer blog</a> back in late September, and it does indeed look like the developers are pulling out all of the stops with this one.</p>

<p>Progression will be overhauled to be less confusing and directionless, and ecosystem restoration will be redesigned so that it feels more "engaging" and less "likely simply ticking items off a checklist".</p>

<p>It's not just content within the game that will be getting changes, however;&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s developers are also working on the technical side of things, with the save data system getting a complete overhaul to "achieve long-term stability".</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Aloft </em>since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">January Early Access release</a>, or even if you're new to the game, you should hopefully find a significantly improved and expanded version of the survival adventure after Bloom &amp; Blight lands.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s latest major update comes just a couple of days after publisher Funcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarked on a spate of layoffs</a>, with&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> as a result of these staff cuts.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that sci-fi survival sim<i>&nbsp;Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</i>proved to be the company's most successful release yet, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">a million sales within just two weeks of its launch</a> back in June this year.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and you can remind yourself what our very own Isaac thought of the game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview" rel="nofollow">reading his preview from January</a>.</p>

              <p>We’re fairly used to Nintendo making strange or iconoclastic decisions, whether it’s releasing folding two-screen portable gaming devices or announcing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch-classics-2000625301">Virtual Boy peripheral for the Switch 2</a>, but even now the Japanese games company is capable of surprises. It has just uploaded to its various worldwide YouTube channels a stunning four-minute animated short called <em>Close to You</em>, about a baby learning to take their first steps, and there’s no explanation for why. Is it a Princess Peach origin story? Something to do with Rosalina? Is it something to do with <em>Pikmin</em> of all things?</p> <p>It is a truly wonderful cartoon. Evoking Pixar in almost every possible way (complete with&nbsp;<em>Incredibles</em>-like faces), the short shows the mother of a baby just popping out of the room, after which the baby’s toys begin to become animated. Wooden blocks hop about and a rattle rolls itself to the baby’s foot. While enjoying the rattle, the kid’s pacifier falls out of their mouth, and that too comes to life, playfully moving around and evading the baby’s attempts to grab it back. In the end, it gets wedged in a mobile dangling above the baby’s crib, giving the tyke the motivation to reach higher and attempt their first steps.</p>

  <p>There’s obviously no way to know if this baby is a boy or a girl, let alone the child form of a particular character. Given the kid’s white with blonde hair, it could be either Zelda or Link, or Samus, or pretty much any gaming character bar Mario or Toad. Hell, my hair was that blonde as a baby, maybe it&nbsp;<em>is</em> Mario. (It isn’t.)</p>

 <p>Someone has claimed that there’s a Red Pikmin appearing in the video at 1:40. Um, I paused it there, and here it is! But there are musical nods to the&nbsp;<em>Pikmin</em> series in here, and they’re certainly the sorts of mischievous creatures who would move toys around a room.</p>

Movie</em> and its forthcoming <em>Mario Galaxy </em>sequel. It’d make some sense if it were related to that, perhaps depicting a moment from Princess Peach’s childhood? She’s fairly magical, and the pink of the pacifier points in that direction. Then again, the blue of the onesie implies Rosalina. Actually, that’d make sense, given the next movie is set in the <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> universe, and that’s the game in which she first appeared. Let’s go with that!

Rosalina, the resident of the Comet Observatory and mother figure to the game’s star-shaped Lumas, will obviously play a central role in the forthcoming film, so it only makes sense to see her being highlighted here…</p>

              <p>If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to finally grab a Kindle, that moment just arrived. Amazon rarely discounts its e-readers, especially the base model that consistently tops the bestseller lists. Summer is peak reading season so the retailer typically holds prices steady through the July Prime Day when demand is already high.</p>
<p>But this Prime Big Deal Days event has brought an unexpected surprise for Prime members: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4586/">the newest Kindle model is down to $84, reduced from $109</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low on the lightest and most compact Kindle</strong> Amazon has ever made, and it solves one of the biggest frustrations readers face: lugging around heavy books or scrolling through distracting phone screens when you’re trying to lose yourself in a story.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4586/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Have to Choose This Kindle</h2>
<p>This latest generation Kindle (2024) eliminates the little irritations that previously made e-readers <strong>slow to react or more difficult to read</strong> under certain circumstances. The <strong>front light is also increased by 25%</strong> at its highest setting over its predecessor so you are free to read comfortably even in direct sunlight without eye strain or having to shift position to prevent glare. The <strong>6-inch display is also purely glare-proof</strong>&nbsp;so being outdoors by the pool or on a park bench becomes just as comfortable a place to read as being indoors. There is <strong>also a dark mode setting</strong> whereby the text and background are reversed and gives white text on a black display for midnight reading sessions.</p>



<p><strong>Page turns are significantly quicker now</strong> which may sound like a trivial thing but becomes a real distinction when you’re engrossed in a thriller and whizzing through pages rapidly. The increased contrast ratio causes text to seem sharper and darker against the background and better replicates the sensation of reading ink on paper than before.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is six weeks between charges</strong> if we assume a reading of about 30 minutes per day by shutting off wireless and setting the light to a luminous 13. If you read longer hours or leave wireless on so your reading stays current among multiple devices, a few weeks of life remain until it’s necessary to charge it.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB of capacity stores thousands of books</strong>, a number far greater than most individuals will want to keep current at a single moment. Even if your downloads are a delicate balancing act between text-heavy novels and graphics-intensive comics or magazines, you’ll have quite a bit of capacity left for other titles. The reader itself <strong>is Amazon’s thinnest and lightest Kindle</strong>, weighing a mere 5.56 ounces.</p>
<p>One of the greatest benefits of reading a book on a Kindle rather than a phone or a tablet is total lack of distraction: There are <strong>no text messages flashing, no urge to see what’s new by email, no social media scrolling</strong> and no other programs demanding your focus. You turn on the thing, resume where you left off, and read. That’s it.</p>
<p>This is a members-only deal for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and it’s also a record-low price for this model, at $84. If it’s been on your mind to pick up an e-reader, or it’s been a couple of years since you’ve picked up a Kindle, it’s your turn yet.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s associate creative director has explained why the timeline doesn’t allow for Wall Runs.</p>



<p>Activision’s latest Call of Duty installment, Black Ops 7, is all set to arrive on November 14, 2025, with the developers conducting open beta testing until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-has-been-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 9</a>. Ahead of the game’s release, the devs have provided players with an insight into BO7’s movement features, explaining why Wall Jumps can transition into Wall Runs. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-doesn-t-have-wall-runs-as-the-timeline-doesn-t-allow-it">Black Ops 7 Doesn’t Have Wall Runs As the Timeline Doesn’t Allow It</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-say-that-you-can-blame-the-black-ops-timeline-for-the-wall-jump-not-being-a-wall-run-black-ops-2-really-gave-us-a-foundation-for-the-technology-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie revealed why Wall Runs weren’t included in the game. Leslie first explains that when they began developing BO7, they “wanted to pick up threads from Black Ops 2.” Which is why all the technology available in the game is from that era. Leslie explained that the team is very precious to their canon and they have to respect that. </p>



<p>Leslie added that they couldn’t have Thrust Jump as the tech didn’t exist until 2035. Similar to that, Wall Run would have made sense if the game were set more in the future; however, as the tech did not exist in the Black Ops 2 era, “so it made sense not to do it.” </p>



<p>Black Ops 7 does have Wall Jumps, which allow players to gain some height by chaining three jumps. Leslie also spoke about how players can get much higher with the new feature, and they “took a lot of learnings from everything we did on Black Ops 3 – it was really important that we kept the combat in-frame.” </p>



<p>In other news, here’s an explanation for why&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders was banned</a>&nbsp;on Black Ops 7.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, October 7, 2025. Below, we look back at Sega's uneven attempt to revive the classic 2D franchise, and how it ultimately fizzled.</em></p><p dir="ltr">There's no denying the glaring flaws of Sonic the Hedgehog 4--the wonky physics, the blatant remixing (or one might even say "rehashing") of classic levels and bosses from the first two Sonic games, and the soundtrack's questionable and often derided soundfont being chief among them. But despite its problems, even 15 years later, I still find myself occasionally coming back to replay both episodes. Not only that, but dare I say, I enjoy myself.</p><p dir="ltr">The game certainly had its shining spots. I appreciate how, instead of every zone having the same hazards and obstacles scattered throughout, each act of each zone had its own distinct gimmick to help one stand out. For example, Casino Street Act 1 featured your standard pinball flippers, bumpers, and slot machine gimmicks. Act 2 shifted the focus to a new mechanic entirely: flipping around and racing across playing cards that act as platforms. The third act brings in colorful cannons that you can manually aim to shoot Sonic across the level. The game was darn pretty to look at, capturing the colorful aesthetic of the classic games with a modern sheen. And even though longtime Sonic composer Jun Senoue went a little too hard with the Genesis/Mega Drive synths for the music, it was still catchy as heck.</p><p dir="ltr">There were signs that Sega was taking feedback to heart. Many of the flaws that plagued Episode 1 were significantly reduced for Episode 2. Zones like White Park and Oil Desert offered more originality than those in the first episode. Instead of being a mindless sidekick who simply follows Sonic around and runs into everything, Tails was given new utility, able to carry Sonic across chasms, blast through water and snow at high speed, and even destroy every enemy on screen with a powerful team blast. Players who owned both Episodes 1 and 2 could replay Episode 1's levels as Sonic's metallic rival, Metal Sonic, complete with new story elements that run parallel to the original game, harkening back to the lock-on technology of Sonic 3/Sonic &amp; Knuckles in the '90s.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png" data-ref-id="1300-4580715" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png" data-ref-id="1300-4580715"></a><figcaption>Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bringing Metal Sonic into a prominent role was a franchise rarity, marking his chronological return to the series after being destroyed in Sonic CD. Aside from Sonic Heroes, the character had more or less been relegated to minor appearances in almost every Sonic game before or since, simply showing up for a boss fight with little to no fanfare, getting blown up, and never being seen again. In Episode 2, his presence is felt throughout the entire story, appearing every handful of levels to duke it out with Sonic in multiple boss encounters. Whereas up to that point Sonic CD had sort of been an outlier among classic Sonic games, Sonic 4 did a great job of giving it a stronger connection to them. In a similar vein, bringing back Little Planet, the setting in which Sonic CD took place, and turning it into a planet-sized power source for a new Death Egg was another unique callback that I can't help but feel could have been explored further.</p><p dir="ltr">That's why Sonic 4 remains equal parts fascinating and frustrating. It had some cool ideas to bring in underutilized classic Sonic elements in new ways, but took way too long to introduce them. Episode 1 felt like a glorified remix of Sonic 1 and 2 with the occasional twist thrown in. Episode 2 showcased more ambition and originality, but by the time you were invested in what they were setting up, the game was over. And Episode 3…well…</p><p dir="ltr">For years, there was no indication that an Episode 3 was ever in production. Most fans assumed that Episode 2 simply didn't sell well enough to warrant a third episode being greenlit. However, several years after Episode 2's release, former Sonic 4 brand manager Ken Balough stated in an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230208104748/https:/www.sonicstadium.org/2015/01/sonic-4-episode-3-was-planned-then-cancelled/" rel="nofollow ">that the game was planned to be a trilogy,</a> only to be cut short for undisclosed reasons. This statement was given further credence just this year when a beta of Episode 2 was discovered, revealing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnSsIwqBbZ8&amp;pp=ygUdc29uaWMgNCBlcGlzb2RlIDIgYmV0YSBlbmRpbmc%3D">a cut sequel hook</a> showcasing the Death Egg powering up with the help of the Master Emerald--and Knuckles.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to providing tangible evidence of Episode 3's planned existence, the scene implied that Knuckles would have played a prominent role, likely as a playable character. Would he have been able to retroactively explore levels from Episodes 1 and 2 on his own like Metal Sonic, or would he have been a "sidekick" character who Sonic could team up with during gameplay like Tails? Would Episode 3 have linked up with Episodes 1 and 2, effectively creating a "complete" Sonic 4, like how Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles became the complete Sonic 3? All we can really do is speculate.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnSsIwqBbZ8" data-width="640" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YnSsIwqBbZ8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">And nothing screams "missed potential" quite like the reveal that there were talks for Episode 3 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230208104748/https:/www.sonicstadium.org/2015/01/sonic-4-episode-3-was-planned-then-cancelled/" rel="nofollow ">to be developed by Christian Whitehead</a>, the lead developer behind the later universally praised Sonic Mania. Imagine an Episode 3 with pitch-perfect classic physics coupled with the Mania Team's impeccable level designs. Even better, imagine if they incorporated tweaked physics for Episodes 1 and 2 to bring them more in line with the classic games. Granted, we did get Mania several years later, but hey, I like the thought of the Sonic 4 saga being allowed to go out on a high note.</p><p dir="ltr">While I know Sonic the Hedgehog 4 was never going to be a masterpiece by any stretch--much less a worthy successor to one of the greatest gaming trilogies of all time--I can't help but be fascinated by the massive potential it had to be something great, if it had been allowed to conclude as Sega originally intended. For what we ended up with, the discourse around it remains more or less unchanged since it was first released 15 years ago. It's still an enjoyable if not uninspired sidescrolling Sonic adventure that could have been so much more.</p>

                <p>Since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage/" data-ref-id="5000-571409">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> in 2023, Ubisoft has added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-adds-new-game-plus-parkour-improvements-and-more/1100-6519901/" data-ref-id="1100-6519901">a New Game+ mode</a>, a parkour update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirages-permadeath-mode-delayed-to-2024/1100-6519834/" data-ref-id="1100-6519834">a permadeath mode</a>, and a PS5 Pro patch. But all of that pales to the amount of content coming next month when Ubisoft launches the free DLC expansion, Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TjZ8XG8QBY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2TjZ8XG8QBY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ubisoft announced the expansion to celebrate the second anniversary of the game. During the Valley of Memory reveal stream, it was disclosed that this DLC will add around six hours of gameplay and story as Basim discovers that his father may still be alive. To find him, Basim has to journey to AlUla, an ancient valley that is overflowing with thieves and dangerous men.</p><p>In addition to the primary quest, Basim can accept new assassination missions and side quests. He can also play the oud once players earn music sheets by conquering parkour challenges. Ubisoft has also teased "a unique twist on Assassin’s Creed’s classic black box missions," without elaborating any further.</p><p>The expansion will come alongside an update that further improves parkour and adds replayable missions and challenges. There will also be two new difficulty levels, as well as new skill-and tool-customization options that let players reach higher skill levels.</p><p>Valley of Memory was <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-assassins-creed-game-is-reportedly-getting-saudi-funded-dlc-this-year/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly funded and backed by Savvy Games</a>, which is owned by the government of Saudi Arabia. That country's human rights violations and other controversies haven't stopped Saudi Arabia from investing in several video game companies, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/" data-ref-id="1100-6511622">Nintendo</a> and the recent purchase of Pokemon Go dev <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">Niantic's video game division</a>.

Earlier this year, Assassin's Creed Mirage received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-assassins-creed-mirage-discovery-tour-arrives-as-a-free-mobile-app/1100-6534470/" data-ref-id="1100-6534470">a Discovery Tour feature</a> as a free mobile app. The most recent game in the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows, added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-introduces-new-game-plus-a-higher-level-cap-and-more-fixes/1100-6533521/" data-ref-id="1100-6533521">a new game+ mode</a> last summer. Meanwhile, rumors about a modern remake of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/" data-ref-id="5000-172624">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a> continue to heat up.
