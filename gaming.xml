Its fanciest features — like recognizing familiar faces or 24/7 recording — are locked behind subscription tiers, but even if you don’t pay a monthly fee, you can get notifications to your phone when it sees a person, vehicle, or animal, and save any clip logged within the last three hours. You can even set up designated zones to trigger your notifications and recordings, so you’re not pestered every time a car passes by.</p><div><p>A Google Nest Cam attached to two bright, adjustable floodlights, this camera has free video recording, powerful lights, and on-device processing of smart alerts for people, vehicles, and animals.

            <p>
Not very shockingly for a game that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukongs-record-setting-launch-popularity-soured-by-co-publisher-request-to-avoid-feminist-propaganda-in-streams">set Steam records</a> within hours of release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is getting DLC, the first in a series of follow-up projects that continue the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> epic's explorations of Chinese mythology. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That's from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win?leadSource=uverify%20wall">a new Bloomberg interview</a> with Daniel Wu, co-founder of Hero Games, the largest external shareholder in Wukong developers Game Science. What the DLC actually consists of and when it'll launch remain to be seen, but the article compares it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, which has demonstrated how a timely and substantial expansion "can spur a fresh flurry of sales for the original."</p>
<p>I imagine there will be new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-bosses">bosses</a> and a few more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-black-myth-wukong-meditation-spots">meditation spots</a>, but perhaps they'll flesh out the setting in less combative or progression-driven ways. Edders, who authored our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong review</a>, is hoping for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-needs-an-assassins-creed-style-discovery-mode">some kind of Discovery Mode</a>.
</p>
<p>
DLC aside, the Bloomberg piece dips into the backstory of both companies: a much-publicised 2017 meeting between Wu and Apple bigwig Tim Cook, which didn't really go anywhere; Game Science's "four failures in a row", including several free-to-play mobile games, prior to releasing Wukong; and the fact that even following Wukong's success, with Game Science now worth "several billion yuan", the 2000-person Hero Games team aren't making a profit. 
</p>
<p>
Hero Games sunk 60 million yuan ($8.5 million) into Game Science back in 2017. They aren't profitable, it seems, partly because they're still making their money back from previous Game Science flops, but Wu also notes that "this is the most gruesome year for China's games industry ever," with wider economic difficulties leading to cuts in entertainment spending and a number of cancellations.
</p>
<p>One way to keep growing Wukong's audience could be to make more of an appeal to overseas players - according to Game Developer, the <a href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449">vast majority of the launch sales came from China</a>.</p>
<p>
As ever with Hero Games, Wu declined to answer questions from Bloomberg about a notorious guidance document asking English-language Wukong streamers and video makers to avoid discussing "feminist propaganda", Covid prevention measures, or Chinese government policy. In what a less generous soul might read as an exercise in telling on your creepy self, the (not legally binding) caution about "feminist propaganda" came in the wake of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">an extensive IGN report from last year that Game Science has a culture of sexism</a>.
</p>
<p>
The developers and their partners have staunchly avoided discussing or fielding questions on the subject. I asked a PR representative for Black Myth: Wukong about the streamer "Do's and Don'ts" in August, and was told a week or two later that "unfortunately, we cannot provide a comment at this time".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-is-the-obnoxious-game-we-needed-it-to-be/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Video games allow designers and developers to take whatever ideas they have in their minds and bring them to life in ways you can only imagine. Sometimes, you get games with great stories; sometimes, you get games with great art styles; and sometimes, you get Squirrel With A Gun.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-hands-on-another-indie-must-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This sandbox puzzle game</a> is one of the more over-the-top games you’ll ever play. You see inspiration from games like Untitled Goose Game and even Goat Simulator, but things are done in a way that makes everything feel unique.</p>



<p>From the opening cutscenes, you get an idea of what you’re in for with this game. What you think is a cute, innocent squirrel quickly turns into the menace of the town once you find a gun. Get it? Because the name of the game is… Yea, you get it!</p>



<p>Anyway, from the opening Secret Bunker to various areas throughout the town, there is no shortage of chaos that unfolds. From going through a house filled with lava to saving a wedding to getting into an old-fashioned western shootout, the game just feels all over the place with what happens. There doesn’t feel like there’s any rhyme or reason behind locations aside from doing the craziest things you can think of. And, to be clear, that’s not a bad thing. You can’t expect a game called Squirrel with a Gun to have much in the way of logic.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-post-launch-support/">What’s Up With Squirrel With a Gun Post-Launch Support?</a></h6>



<p>In each area you have to collect Golden Acorns which are used to unlock new weapons and vehicles. There are also reload wedges and clothing to collect, with some clothing actually impacting the game play. For example, the eye patch makes your neck snapping a bit more effective to make sure your victims never get back up.</p>



<p>From a weapons standpoint, you have a nice mix. From shotguns to grenade launchers to six shooters, each weapon has its own pros and cons. The shotgun will help you jump higher, coming in handy for certain puzzles in the game. The sub-machine gun&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each weapon also has its own finishing animation, but each gun only has one. They are all fun the first few times, but they do get old after a little while. But just when you think you are over the animations, you trigger one after going through a group of wanna-be Agent Smith’s that reignites that enjoyment again.</p>



<p>It’s not just running around the town wreaking havoc, however. The puzzles are both challenging and satisfying. Figuring out how to place weights to open a staircase, learning how to cook the burgers for the miserable cookout guests, and finding out which gun you need to reach a certain area of a building all give you just enough of a challenge without it being something you have to look up online. Each area has a flag pole that you can climb to get an overview of the level with each level section giving you a hint of what you have to do.</p>



<p>There are actual boss fights within the game to give you that sense of story and accomplishment. The first boss fight involves a tank manned by “Father”. The second involves a helicopter, and it’s just as over-the-top as any Mission Impossible movie.</p>



<p>There are some things that frustrate me with the game. The biggest being the camera. It can be hard at times to really see what’s going on in the game, and manually reorienting the camera over and over can get frustrating. It would be nice to have a quick button click to reset the camera, especially during the more intense action sections of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, you can be hit by agents shooting at you without any indication aside from actively looking at your health. When you are focused on the events on-screen, you can quickly lose track of your health.</p>



<h2 id="h-squirrel-with-a-gun-review-verdict">Squirrel With A Gun Review Verdict</h2>



<p>Squirrel with a Gun is the exact type of obnoxious game it needed to be. While things can feel a little empty at times, the game having a shorter completion time of just 5-6 hours helps keep things from getting too dry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite its name, platforming and puzzles are the best part of the game. Each feels rewarding when completed and adds to the joy that comes from playing this game. The gunplay can get kind of dull after a bit, but it’s nothing that’ll stop you from completing the game</p>



<p>It’s the perfect game for those looking for something new and out there without wanting to break the bank or spend 30+ hours on something. It fits nicely in its space, and is a fun first step for a game that sees a larger sequel come in a few years.</p>

"However, we don’t plan to do anything like deliberately changing conversation topics in order to cater to new fans."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>He continued: "We are middle aged guys ourselves, so I guess that’s the kind of target audience we’re going for, probably. I think this is precisely one of [the series'] selling points. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, everything starts with three unemployed middle aged guys being like, 'Let’s go to [the job centre].' They have a different air about them than a group of young heroes would, complaining about back pain and the like. But this humanity you feel from their age is what gives the game originality."</p><p>The Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-renamed-like-a-dragon-in-the-west-explained-why">which had a confusing name change in 2022</a>, focused on original protagonist Kiryu Kazuma through the first six games and prequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a>. While he was just 20 in that game, Kiryu was 37 in the first Yakuza (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/21/yakuza-kiwami-review">which was remade as Yakuza Kiwami in 2016</a>), 38 in Yakuza 2 (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/23/yakuza-kiwami-2-review">remade as Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>), then 41, 42, 44, and eventually 48 in Yakuza 6. He appears in later games too, and continues to grow older alongside the series.</p><p>Yakuza: Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga, who takes over from Kiryu in what's essentially Yakuza 7, is 42 in that game and 46 in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (essentially Yakuza 8). The series does feature plenty of characters who aren't middle aged men, but most of its main cast are.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p>"The characters are flesh and blood human beings much like our players are, so their problems are relatable," Horii said. "That’s why it’s easy to really get into the game and feel like you’re listening to conversations between ordinary people. There isn’t any typical 'game-like' language like 'where is the treasure chest?'"</p><p>Yakuza/Like a Dragon lead planner Hirotoka Chiba gave an example. "There’s a conversation where Adachi is conflicted about whether he should drink beer or not because he’s worried about his uric acid level," he said. "We’re making the hearty talks of middle-aged dudes our identity, rather than youthfulness."</p><p>Fans expecting a hard left turn in the next game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rgg-summit-showcase-to-reveal-next-yakuzalike-a-dragon-game-in-september">which is being revealed on September 20</a>, may therefore have to think again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Adachi is conflicted about whether he should drink beer or not because he’s worried about his uric acid level.</p></div><p>It's unknown if this new game (or potentially games) is the next mainline Yakuza/Like a Dragon entry, another spin-off game like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a>, another remake like Yakuza: Kiwami or Like a Dragon: Ishin, another game from spin-off series <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/20/judgment-review">Judgment</a>, or something else entirely, however.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-fans-buzz-as-sega-trademarks-yakuza-wars">Publisher Sega did register a trademark for something called Yakuza Wars</a> in August 2024, however, and RGG has already said fans will be "surprised" by the reveal.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

That’s an astonishing return for a game Bloomberg reported had a budget of $70 million over six years of development.</p><p>Fans, though, will be most interested in Game Science’s plans for Black Myth Wukong now it’s out in the wild. While the developer has yet to say, Bloomberg’s report confirmed an expansion is in the works, with Game Science said to be following Elden Ring’s lead. Elden Ring, itself one of the best-selling video games of all-time, saw a significant expansion DLC called Shadow of the Erdtree launch in 2024, two years after the base game.</p><p>From Bloomberg: “It won’t take another six years for the next chapter in what’s planned to be a series based on Chinese mythology — though that won’t be a sequel, Wu [Daniel Wu, Hero Games boss] said. Game Science is working on an expansion to Wukong, which will give it a chance to monetize the game a second time. 2022’s Elden Ring, a title with similar play style and design, has shown how the release of an expansion — this year’s Shadow of the Erdtree — can spur a fresh flurry of sales for the original.”</p><p>Last month, IGN verified <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-marketing-team-offers-content-creators-a-steam-key-but-bans-feminist-propaganda-and-all-talk-of-covid"><u>an email sent from the Black Myth: Wukong marketing team</u></a> at Hero Games that told content creators who were granted a Steam key that they must not include “feminist propaganda” or use what are called “trigger words” such as COVID-19 in their coverage.

                <p>PlayStation's latest big game, the multiplayer arena shooter Concord, launched in late August and struggled so much out of the gate that Sony decided to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">stop sales and take the game offline beginning September 6</a>. Lead character designer Jon Weisnewski has now thanked fans for their support ahead of the server shutdown, while acknowledging that the studio doesn't know what the future holds.</p><p>Posting on social media, Weisnewski said the team at Firewalk Studios is <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1831389525530308892" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"packed with tenacious fighters"</a> who built Concord amid a number of challenging scenarios. This included multiple acquisitions--the latest of which was Sony's buyout of the company in 2023--along with an engine upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. Weisnewski also mentioned how Concord was developed during the pandemic and faced delays, noting that "the fact we shipped at all is legendary."</p><p>"To all the players who showed up for Concord: thank you. The positivity and constructive feedback in the face of overwhelming noise was huge for everyone at Firewalk. Building a positive community was why we did this. We saw you. Every stream, post, thread, emoji, we saw it all," the developer <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1831385535186936235" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added.</a></p><p>As for the future, Weisnewski admitted, "None of us know what's next, but I do know this team is capable of wild energy when faced with a challenge."</p><p>When Sony announced the news that Concord would shut down, game director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."</p><p>Ellis said the team will "explore options" for how to "better reach our players," which sounds like the game could return in some form down the road. This is not confirmed, however. For now, Sony is refunding everyone. Even if Concord does make a comeback, many are wondering what Concord could do to differentiate itself in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/">already-crowded market for arena shooters. </a>Some believe <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1831039618122174707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Concord is doomed</a> and won't find success, even under a different model.</p><p>Concord is the first game from Firewalk, a studio founded by developers who worked on Call of Duty, Destiny, Apex Legends, and Halo. The team had about 150 employees when Sony acquired the studio from ProbablyMonsters in 2023; the companies had <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210422005352/en/Firewalk-Studios-a-ProbablyMonsters-Studio-Reveals-Publishing-Partnership-with-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-for-AAA-Multiplayer-Game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worked together for "years" previously.</a></p><p>In 2023, Sony said Firewalk would contribute to the company's efforts to "define a new generation of live-service experiences for PlayStation gamers." Sony is also working with Assassin's Creed veteran Jade Raymond's team at Haven on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-new-ps5-and-pc-game-from-assassins-creed-boss-revealed/1100-6514454/" data-ref-id="1100-6514454">heist-themed multiplayer game called Fairgame$ (yes, really, that's the name)</a>. However, Sony is indeed scaling back its live-service efforts.</p><p>Sony was at one point planning to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surpass-17-million-10-live-service-games-coming-by-2026/1100-6500204/" data-ref-id="1100-6500204">10 live-service games by 2026</a> but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cut the figure in half as the company outlined a plan to focus on quality over quantity.</a> Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online, once described as the developer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-title-ever-druckmann-says/1100-6510559/" data-ref-id="1100-6510559">most ambitious game ever</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">was canceled</a>.</p><p>According to a report, one of the last major decisions that former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan made was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were said to be upset by this, and the blame apparently fell on industry veteran Connie Booth. A 30-year veteran, Booth left PlayStation in October 2023, and no reason for her departure was ever provided. Some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">she was fired.</a> Booth is now an executive at Electronic Arts.</p>

            <p>The mobile release for the supremely popular card roguelike Balatro is later this month.</p>
<p>The game will be available on both the iOS App store and the Google Play store from 26th September. Further, it'll be included as part of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> subscription from the same date.</p>
<p>Playstack has released a new trailer to celebrate the release, which you can watch below.</p>

<p>If you're yet to play Balatro, it essentially uses the rules of poker in a roguelike structure to hit high scores and progress. On top of that, players can purchase a huge variety of Joker cards to tip the balance in their favour.</p>
<p>All of which is to say it's already proven captivating in its current form on Steam.</p>
<p>But now it's coming to mobile, which means Balatro can be played anywhere at any time. That is, quite frankly, a dangerous prospect.</p> <div>

<p>The game originally launched in February, but it was hindered by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama">drama around its rating due to the perceived gambling connotations of its poker theme</a>. "It is what it is," said the game's solo developer localthunk at the time.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">Balatro sold 1m copies in its first month</a>, and I imagine the mobile release will add plenty more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Star Wars Outlaws launched last week, but it has already received criticism from casual and die-hard fans. The scores from critics are incredibly varied, with some giving it high praise while others provided plenty of reasons to dislike it. Currently, the Metacritic score stands at 76 for Star Wars Outlaws. Star Wars Outlaws Director <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-is-a-little-disappointed-with-the-metacritic-score-but-plans-to-keep-improving-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julian Gerighty spoke with GamesRadar</a>, and shared his thoughts and feelings on how the audience has received the game. "I'm a little disappointed with the Metacritic. Of course, recognition from press and critics is very important to us, but players are really connecting with what we did."</p>
<p>However, it seems that the vast majority of the criticism the game has received is warranted. Those who purchased the early access version of the game had to start their file from the very beginning or had their fair share of game-breaking bugs. Although the Star Wars Outlaws Director admitted that he wasn't too impressed by the score it received, he is still hopeful for the overall presence of the game, saying: "This will be a game that millions of people are going to play for years and years, and we're never going to stop improving it."</p>
<p>Although Star Wars Outlaws scored 76, that isn't necessarily bad news. It's still considered a good score. It's clear that Gerighty had high hopes for this game and expected a higher score overall from the critics. However, that isn't the only issue for Ubisoft, the game's publisher. After the launch of Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/game-developer-ubisoft-slides-amid-muted-reception-star-wars-outlaws-2024-09-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft shared</a> that they have hit a 10-year low. This doesn't spell good things for Ubisoft, as this game has the biggest marketing campaign in the company's history. Although Star Wars Outlaws has a vast amount of responsibility in this, they also were behind Skull and Bones and XDefiant, which didn't last very long for the players.</p>
<p>While the full base game of Star Wars Outlaws has been officially released, the Season Pass is still yet to come. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/">Season Pass</a> provides new cosmetics and alternative storylines for players to complete, even if it means caving in and purchasing a microtransaction to access them. Whether they will continue adding more to the Season Pass after the initial releases are done remains to be seen and will most likely depend on whether the game picks up in sales.</p>
<p>Although the game has had its fair share of hardships, Gerighty says that there's a "level of pride, happiness, and sense of accomplishment amongst the team. Outlaws was in development for roughly four years and the team literally reached for the stars."</p>

I can’t speak to the possible features of a new platform, but the Nintendo Account is a strong basis for having that communication as we make the transition.”<br></p><p>Anticipation for a Switch 2 reveal has been heating up ever since Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote back in May</a></span> that a Switch successor <em>wouldn’t</em> be mentioned during the company’s June Nintendo Direct. Naturally, fans took this to mean that a mention <em>would</em> be coming sometime later in the year. Time is starting to run out, but knowing the <em>Mario</em> maker, the first news of a Switch 2 could be shadow-dropped any day now in something as simple as a single press release or a trailer suddenly shared to social media. </p><p>And as manufacturing of the devices gets underway, the pressure will be on for Nintendo to reveal the console itself before grainy cellphone footage from a Chinese warehouse that looks like it’s from 2007 reveals it instead. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Balatro, one of the biggest hits of the year, is heading to a new platform. Developer LocalThunk <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1831695226886300045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced that</a> Balatro Mobile is launching on September 26th.</p>



<p>The game will be available via Google Play, the App Store, and Apple Arcade. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The reveal of Balatro Mobile is the third of three recent announcements from LocalThunk. In addition to the new platform, Balatro received a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-collaberations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Friends of Jimbo” update</a> last month. It was also announced that a major free gameplay update with “new ideas and strategies” will come to the game in 2025.</p>



<p>More details on that update will be revealed at a later date. Pre-orders for Balatro Mobile are now open.</p>

<p>Maximum Football, the free-to-play football game from Maximum Entertainment, is launching in Early Access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starting November 7</a>. The game will first be available in Early Access on PC with its Xbox and PlayStation release planned for Spring 2025.</p>



<p>In addition to the release date announcement, Maximum Entertainment put out a new trailer for the game.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>When it does launch in Early Access, Maximum Football will have a number of modes for players to enjoy right from the bat. Modes such as Exhibition (vs. CPU, multiplayer, and spectator), Practice Mode, and even Dynasty Mode (college football rules) will be available. Also available will be the Maximum Pro League and the full player customization system.  </p>



<p>Post-release, the plan is to add Franchise Mode (professional football) and a Career Mode to the game. The developers also say that “much more” is planned in the months and years after the game’s release. </p>



<p>As mentioned, Maximum Football will be a free-to-play title. While the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/maximum-football-loot-boxes-in-its-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have loot boxes</a> within the game, no updates on  how it plans to monetize the title have been made public just yet.</p>

			<p>The latest list of games to be added to GeForce NOW has been updated, and many top games have been added. To play games via GeForce NOW, you need to own them on the specified client listed by NVIDIA. GeForce NOW is compatible with multiple clients, such as Steam, Battle.net, and Epic Games Store. This month, GeForce NOW users can expect to see games such as Final Fantasy XVI, Age of Mythology, and Epic Mickey: Rebrushed as some of the titles coming to GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>This month, 19 new titles are added to GeForce NOW, with a dozen of them being day-and-date titles, meaning you can stream them via GeForce NOW as soon as the game is officially released. As well as those games that will be available this month, those who are eager to play the Open Beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be able to play it via GeForce NOW as long as you are a member.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-will-include-challenge-levels-and-speedrun-stages.972876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been hoping for some&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>DLC that you can check out after you've finished the main game, then it sounds like you're in luck, as extra stages are planned for the game after launch.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/astro-bot-dlc-will-include-challenge-and-speedrun-levels/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new report from VGC</a>; the site's journalists apparently visited developer Team Asobi's offices last month, and while there, they were told that&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>would be getting some extra content in the weeks and months following its release.</p>
<p>According to the VGC report, Team Asobi is currently planning to add around ten challenge levels and five speedrun-focused levels to the game after its launch. VGC does, however, say that it's not sure "if those numbers are still accurate".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-enemy.jpg?itok=ZpTUpQAZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-enemy.jpg?itok=sMYjrrHZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have more&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>to enjoy post-launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If Team Asobi does decide to bring more content to&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>post-launch, then it seems to me that'll be a very wise decision.</p>
<p><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is set to launch tomorrow as a PlayStation 5 exclusive (although Team Asobi does say it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-director-leaves-door-open-for-pc-version-shuts-down-playstation-vr2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interested in hearing from players</a> regarding a PC version), and the reviews are already in.</p>
<p>Of course, the only review you really need to read is the one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right">written by our very own Andrew Stretch</a>, who describes it as "a 90s platformer done perfectly" and praises its gameplay mechanics, difficulty, and celebration of PlayStation's history.</p>
<p>Lest you think he's an outlier, though, think again; the game's currently <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17118/astro-bot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sitting at a coveted 95% rating on OpenCritic</a>, with 100% of critics giving it a positive score overall. Looks like this one's going to be a hit.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what exactly&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is, it's a 3D platformer that acts as a sort of pseudo-followup to the PS5 pack-in game&nbsp;<em>Astro's Playroom&nbsp;</em>(which remains one of the highlights of the console's software lineup even now).</p>
<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>celebrates PlayStation by including a wealth of cameos from Sony IPs both old and new. Obviously, it's too early to extrapolate a narrative, but the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">failure of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">Concord</a>&nbsp;</em>and the success of this game feel like they should be sending a message to Sony.</p>
<p>You can pre-order&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/astro-bot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here via the PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

The platformer pays tribute to PlayStation’s past with cute little robot cameos representing nearly every video game hero from every era remotely associated with the brand. It was more or less a guided tour through the legacy of one of the big three, and after the PS4 solidified Sony as top dog in the console landscape, I was certainly in the mood to look back at how we got here when the PS5 launched in 2020. Now we have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, the excellent follow-up that builds upon all the tight platforming, adorable robo aesthetics, and PlayStation nostalgia of that pack-in game. But it’s been four years since the PS5 launched with <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> installed and the new game also inadvertently spotlights the fact that, despite four trips around the sun, the system has remarkably little to show for it.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,193348" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of this writing, I’ve seen <em>Astro Bot</em>’s credits roll and collected 250 of its 300 hidden robots, which are tucked into every corner of its levels. Most of these are generic white and blue bots not meant to resemble any hero PlayStation fans have embodied or foe that they’ve faced. Some, however, are based on classic PlayStation characters, from OGs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-5-spyro-crossover-cancelled-activision-1851632213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-5-spyro-crossover-cancelled-activision-1851632213">Crash Bandicoot</a></span> to more recent additions like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470">Aloy from <em>Horizon</em></a></span>. There’s a pretty exciting range of characters to be found on Astro Bot’s adventures. I was grinning ear to ear when I found the Sly Cooper bot locked up in a cell for his kleptomaniac crimes. I was stoked to see some characters like Aigis and Joker from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><em>Persona</em> series</a></span> after they’d been omitted from <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. But after finding a couple hundred, I realized something was off. By my count, I’ve only encountered one that originates from a PlayStation 5 exclusive in those 250: Rivet from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a></span>. But I look at a list of Sony’s output this generation, and ask myself what else would they pick from? What has Sony released for the PS5 that has had any cultural impact that stands alongside characters like Kratos or Nathan Drake? Is it really that surprising that <em>Astro Bot </em>has a dearth of works to draw from?</p><figure id="" data-id="5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-recommend-id="image://5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-recommend-id="image://5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There may be more I have yet to uncover, but the fact that the PlayStation 5 has almost nothing to showcase in <em>Astro Bot</em> becomes more stark as the game goes on. <em>Astro Bot</em> has a series of levels in which its titular hero dons the garb and weapons of different characters from throughout PlayStation’s life. Each of these levels spotlights a character from a different console era (though the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244"><em>God of War</em></a></span> one is a little iffy considering it spotlights the modern, Norse-inspired era that began on PS4 instead of the original Greece-based PS2 games), and there’s is no such level for a PS5 character. There are points when each console era and its respective heroes get their time in the spotlight with a dedicated sequence for each generation. The PS5 is conspicuously skipped over, however, as if there wasn’t enough material to merit it.<br></p><p>Throughout <em>Astro Bot</em>, you’re rescuing marooned PlayStation characters as you all attempt to repair your PS5-shaped ship that’s crash-landed on a remote planet. As I look back at Sony’s latest console generation, there’s something morbidly poetic about watching Astro Bot run around trying to repair and salvage a console that has taken a serious beating. It’s not a PlayStation-exclusive problem, as Microsoft is taking its own beatings across the aisle, but this console generation has been a black hole for PlayStation.</p><p>Four years in, the PlayStation 5 has been characterized by remasters and remakes banking on old ideas from better days, the upheaval of decades of legacy through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">studio shutdowns and job losses</a></span>, the disappearance of beloved series that don’t fit a specific prestige framework Sony’s leaning into these days, and a live-service focus that has panned out exactly once. Just days before <em>Astro Bot</em>’s launch, Sony and Firewalk Studios announced plans to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956">shut down <em>Concord</em></a></span>, one of the biggest pillars of Sony’s focus on forever games, two weeks after it came to stores. <em>Astro Bot</em> is a celebration, but what are we celebrating? Our collective endurance? The memory of a console family that was once characterized by a spirit of innovation which cannot be recaptured in this “number go up at all cost” climate?<br></p><figure id="" data-id="082a40f8930131584dc3f7c57d30be09" data-recommend-id="image://082a40f8930131584dc3f7c57d30be09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nate bot crawls out of a treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nate bot crawls out of a treasure chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="082a40f8930131584dc3f7c57d30be09" data-recommend-id="image://082a40f8930131584dc3f7c57d30be09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nate bot crawls out of a treasure chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In defense of PlayStation Studios, a lot of the defining works come in the second half of a console’s lifetime. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660"><em>The Last of Us</em></a></span> wasn’t even in our field of view four years after the PS3 launched and it went on to become one of the most widely celebrated franchises in PlayStation’s arsenal. So there may certainly be the big, generation-defining games on the way. But <em>Astro Bot</em> reflects so poorly on everything Sony’s done since we last played as its robot hero. It is perhaps the most joyful thing to come out of Sony since the last <em>Astro Bot</em>, but so much of that joy comes from looking back rather than existing in the now because all we have now is a wasteland. I’m scared about what that says for the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
