            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> was one of the most surprising Switch 2 reveals during the April 2025 Nintendo Direct. The Hitman developers were already giving us its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">World of Assassination</a> trilogy, but a brand new game — let alone a James Bond game? — yes please.</p>
<p>Now, courtesy of today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pwRpK8eoLLE?si=jDvevDV5jdCcxYhh&amp;t=1053">007 First Light State of Play</a>, James Bond's origin story will be gracing the Switch 2 at the same time as other consoles, on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>. The game will cost <strong>$79.99 / €79.99 / £69.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), with the Switch 2 version being a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>The State of Play gave us our first in-depth look at the upcoming third-person action game, showcasing two missions: one is an undercover mission during a chess tournament in Slovakia; the second is closer to home, taking place at a gala in Kensington, London.</p>
<p>While the usual espionage and sneaking are a part of First Light, Bond will have a variety of skills that will help him get right in the action if he needs to. Here's a rundown of some of those elements from IO Interactive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Spycraft</strong> ensures that stealth and observation are just as powerful as any weapon in Bond’s arsenal. From eavesdropping on key conversations and pickpocketing vital items, to inspecting the environment for hidden clues and gathering critical information, these mechanics open new pathways and opportunities in every mission.</p>
<p><strong>- Instinct</strong> is a signature gameplay feature in 007 First Light, giving players a versatile resource to turn the tide in any situation. Bond can use his instincts to lure enemies into vulnerable positions, bluff his way out of suspicion when discovered, or sharpen his focus for greater precision and power in combat. This mechanic captures Bond’s quick thinking and adaptability, allowing players to respond to changing circumstances with style and control.</p>
<p><strong>- Gadgets</strong> from Q Branch are a core part of Bond’s toolkit in <em>007 First Light</em>, woven directly into moment-to-moment gameplay. From hacking and cutting locks to creating distractions or incapacitating targets, these versatile tools open up new possibilities for stealth, misdirection, and tactical improvisation in any mission. Players will unlock new gadgets as they progress through the missions, which will expand their loadout and strategies to deal with the challenges they will have to face.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>- Combat</strong> in <em>007 First Light</em> is designed to be fast, fluid, and true to Bond’s character, blending precision ranged shooting, visceral and impactful melee encounters, and a unique escalation system that reflects his measured use of force. In close quarters, Bond can deliver dynamic takedowns, throws, and parries that feel weighty and cinematic, often using the environment to his advantage. When enemies escalate to lethal force, Bond is granted his License to Kill, unlocking his expert marksmanship with firearms that can be seamlessly integrated into the flow of action. This interplay between ranged and melee combat, which integrates Bond’s gadgets, ensures every confrontation feels personal, responsive, and grounded in the <em>007</em> fantasy.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak says "With 007 First Light, we’re building a wholly original James Bond experience from the ground up, one that blends the sharp tension of espionage with the bold spectacle the franchise is known for." Promising gameplay "rooted in our signature approach to immersive design", the aim is to make this feel like a true Bond game.</p>
<p>The voice cast has also been revealed, with Irish actor Patrick Gibson taking on the iconic role. Here's a rundown of the cast, along with some of their more well-known roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patrick Gibson (Dexter: Original Sin) — James Bond</li>
<li>Priyanga Burford (Steeltown Murders, Innocent) - M</li>
<li>Alastair Mackenzie (Andor, Unforgotten) - Q</li>
<li>Kiera Lester (Death in Paradise, Wreck) - Miss Moneypenny</li>
<li>Lennie James (The Walking Dead, Line of Duty) - John Greenway</li>
<li>Noemie Nakai (Tokyo Vice) - Miss Roth</li>
</ul>
<p>if you're extremely impressed by what you've seen so far, there <em>is</em> a rather pricey <strong>$299.99 / €299,99 / £259.99</strong> Legacy Edition — though that appears to be available on all platforms except Switch 2 — which includes a Golden Gun Figurine with a Certificate of Authenticity.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you need to know more, our friends at Push Square got some hands-on time with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/why-007-first-light-is-the-most-exciting-game-of-2026">the game at Gamescom</a>, so have a read of that preview, and let us know what you think of the game so far in the comments<em>.</em></p>

			<p>IO Interactive's take on James Bond will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 27, 2026, the studio announced at the tail end of the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/03/watch-over-30-minutes-of-007-first-light-gameplay-launching-march-27-2026/">PlayStation State of Play</a> presentation today that delved into its gameplay.</p>



<p>Beyond the fact that we would be getting a big showcase of the game today, we got a major hint that a release date was going to be announced when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-price-leak/">price for the base game and its much more expensive collector's edition leaked hours before</a> the showcase kicked off.</p>



<p>The presentation delivered on its promise of showcasing the gameplay, first with a playthrough of an early level with no commentary shown, followed by a later mission in the game shown with commentary from IO Interactive, detailing how different systems in the game work, and how players can figure out their own path forward through multiple options for completing the same objective.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We also got a confirmation of the full cast, with Patrick Gibson, who you might recognize most recently from the Dexter: Original Sin series, starring as James Bond. We also got a better look at what the $300 collector's edition will include, which is a copy of the game along with its deluxe edition digital upgrades, a golden gun weapon skin, and a golden gun figurine complete with a stand, secret compartment, a magnetic steel case, and a certificate of authenticity so you can prove to the people who show off the figurine to that you really did spend $300 for it.</p>

Hitman hitmakers Io Interactive have just screened some extensive footage of their James Bond adaptation, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, during Sony's latest State of Play livestream. As you might expect, it looks and sounds a lot like Hitman, but the whole "James Bond" thing is a definite pace-changer. Catch the whole video below, plus a hasty, opinionated summary from me.

<p>
Sony and Io's Jamesplay blowout spans a couple of First Light missions, the first being a multiple-agent undercover affair during an exclusive chess tournament held in Slovakia, which begins with our hero kicking his heels in a carpark while disguised as a chauffeur. All seams peaceful. But then our hero remembers that he's Bond, <em>James</em> Bond, and has better things to do than fulfil his allotted role in a painstakingly organised MI6 operation.
</p>
<p>
The subsequent 20 minutes or so can be divided into five courses. First, a dash of infiltration that readily channels Agent 47, with Bond using environmental distractions to bamboozle security staff and steal their IDs. Always a fan of bouncers who are hopelessly baffled by leaky hosepipes.</p><p>Then, there's a dollop of social stealth, with Bond hustling a bartender for clues about a weirdo bellhop. Then, it's time for an Xbox 360-ass car chase with a femme fatale in the passenger seat. Next, James must blow up one million red gas tanks while cover-shooting through a crowded airfield to an escaping transport plane. Then, he must do a crafty QTE hack on the plane's attitude controls, so as to wrongfoot the on-board defenders and ultimately, turn the plane into a meteor shower.
</p>
<p>
If it were me, I'd still be in that carpark playing Tetris on my Q-phone. But I am not Bond, <em>James</em> Bond. Io's version of the character is as smug, quippy and basically unbearable as you'd expect from a Bond actor pre-Daniel Craig. I rate him seven Rogers out of Connery so far.
</p>
<p>
The other Jamesplay excerpt from Sony's sprawling Bondcast sees the handsome cad infiltrating a gala in Kensington, London. It may be down to the State of Play presentation, but this one feels much more like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a> mission, with Bond navigating the crowd, eavesdropping for interaction opportunities, pickpocketing the help, and generally keeping it on the down-low.
</p>
<p>
Io and Sony polish everything off with an edited section showing off the game's various supporting systems. Certain actions earn you Instinct, which can be spent to bluff your way out of confrontations, lure guards into takedowns, and slow time for headshots.</p><p>You also get gadgets, of course, such as a laser with which to drop chandeliers on those foolish enough to enjoy their crystal glow, and smoke grenades for when you can't be arsed to hide properly. Lethal force appears to depend on Bond being granted "License to Kill" by his handlers - you can't just murder somebody with a pair of scissors whenever you fancy, for you are Bond, <em>James</em> Bond, not some barcode-wearing hooligan.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think this looks entertaining. It's either a Hitman game that has gracefully yielded to Bond's appetite for getaway shoot-outs, or a Bond game that has studied long and well under Agent 47's tutelage - take your pick. It's out March 27th 2026.

In addition to a new Vanguard hero, Angela, to help kick off the season, a number of heroes are seeing significant balance adjustments to make them more (or sometimes less) competitive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRUcdKzw6nQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Chief among those changes is a decrease in the duration of Luna Snow's powerful ultimate, Fate of Both Worlds. NetEase hasn't released the patch notes just yet so we don't have the specific numbers involved, but it's a change that has felt like it's been a long time coming. Luna's ultimate has always been among the best in the game, capable of making teammates within it nearly invincible and able to stop an enemy push in its tracks. Its lengthy duration often brought fights to a standstill, much to the frustration of some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Her ultimate becomes extra annoying when paired with a Loki, who could copy Luna's ultimate for yet another lengthy period of invulnerability. Loki, too, is seeing some nerfs to his damage and healing in Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard</a> heroes getting hit with nerfs include Emma Frost and Captain America, while a handful of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-duelist-dps-heroes/2900-6105/" data-ref-id="2900-6105">Duelists</a> are also being brought down a peg. Squirrel Girl is having her long-range poke reduced, Psylocke's burst-damage potential is being adjusted, and Black Panther is being hit with a reduction to his survivability.</p><p dir="ltr">On the buff front, a number of Vanguard, Strategist, and Duelist heroes are receiving some help. Blade, Moon Knight, and Scarlet Witch will be buffed to make them more viable damage-dealing picks, while Thor and Peni Parker will receive buffs to their ultimate abilities in order to give them "more playmaking material," according to NetEase. Doctor Strange, often nerfed, will receive an offensive buff.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-strategists-support-heroes/2900-6102/" data-ref-id="2900-6102">Strategists</a>, NetEase wants to give players more options and "bring more diversity in the role." That has translated to buffs to ultimate abilities for characters like Invisible Woman, Ultron, and Jeff the Land Shark. Combined with the nerf to Luna's ultimate, the Strategist field should be a little more interesting in Season 4. NetEase notes that popular heroes like Cloak and Dagger, Magneto, and Phoenix aren't receiving balance changes this time around, but that it will be keeping an eye on the meta in Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Balance changes are just the tip of the iceberg for Marvel Rivals Season 4, which will also add a new Vanguard hero, the Asgardian Angela, to the roster. Angela will be able to wield different weapons depending on the situation, including a spear to dive into enemy lines, dual axes for cleaving through foes, and a shield for blocking incoming damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Team-up abilities are seeing major changes, too. Thor and Angela will gain a team-up that gives Thor the ability to throw and then dive to one of Angela's spears. Existing team-up abilities are seeing some adjustments, with Dimensional Shortcut being removed. Magik instead joins the Arcane Order team up, while Black Panther will join Hulk's Gamma Charge team up, which will grant Black Panther a gamma shield when at critical health.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase additionally confirmed a number of new features coming alongside Marvel Rivals Season 4, including the permanent addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-game-mode-trailer/2300-6465741/" data-ref-id="2300-6465741">Clone Rumble</a> and Giant-Size Brain Blast to Arcade mode, a new map, custom ultimate ability visual effects becoming visible for everyone (with an option to disable it), and another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-skins/2900-6764/" data-ref-id="2900-6764">wave of summer-inspired skins</a> for heroes like Mantis, Punisher, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing. NetEase also announced it's working on adding competitive-placement matches in response to feedback about the game's current seasonal rank resets, though the feature won't be coming as part of Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 4 launches September 12, the same day the game arrives on PlayStation 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>007: First Light seems, to my mind, to be the first true origin story for James Bond that we’re seeing beamed onto a TV. Sure, there’s the Young Bond novels from the early 2000s, but even Daniel Craig’s Casino Royale is less of an origin and more of a “this is when he got his 00 promotion” kind of a story. In First Light, Bond is still an up and coming agent, he’s having to work as part of a team, taking orders for more menials roles on a mission… but would you believe he’s also a bit of a loose cannon? The kind of character to go off mission and break a few rules to get the job done?</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light – Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpP_WXrDArQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But as much as Bond’s reputation and character precedes him, so too does a sense of what he has to look like. Through the decades, each film actor has drawn varying degrees of controversy and appreciation, and the same is true for 007: First Light. Franchise Art Director Rasmus Poulsen told us, “You know, we looked at the IP from afar and we looked at the character from afar. That means we looked at everything from games, movies, all the way back to the books, and specifically the books, to get the real inspiration of who this guy is and what he looks like.</p>


<p>“So Fleming’s description – obviously, we have the scar here, which is amazing for us too, to get to play with – that was really the foundational inspiration for him as a character, including his looks and everything like that. One of the descriptions is about the coldness of his eyes. I’m not sure I recall [the quote] exactly, but that means to us that he shouldn’t be too pretty. There has to be some sort of dualism to his appearance. But as I said, we based it on the IP zoomed out, but the core values from books and seen through the movies.”</p>


<p>The gameplay reveal opens with an assembly of MI6 agents going up against, not an external threat, but one of their own.&nbsp;009 has gone about as rogue as an upside down Sean Bean, and he knows every trick in the MI6 playbook. Still, now’s the time to try and intercept him, as they’ve got word that he’s holding a covert meeting at a glitzy chess tournament. Bond, then… well Bond gets to be the chauffeur and cover a potential escape route, while the rest of the team sneak inside and try to get the drop on 009. He’s still quite far from being a double-oh…</p>
<p>Speaking about this characterisation, Rasmus said, “It was always our intent to do a standalone origin story for a young Bond, because it really allows us to make a Bond that we feel better aligns with the audience. So of course, we’re doing games and it’s really important for us to enjoy the unique opportunities that we have both to dive into the character, but also to give you guys gameplay that fits.</p>
<p>“ So the wonderful opportunity is that you learn on the job with Bond, right? So you two grow together throughout the story of the game. In that sense, it was it felt like the only option for us. It felt so obvious that we have to do this. ”</p>
<p>So, Bond’s maybe a bit of a dogsbody to start with, but that immediately puts him behind the wheel to provide something completely new for an IO Interactive caper: driving. Sure, it’s not the most thrilling job being directed to drop off Bond’s colleagues and then head round back to the parking lot, but once the mission goes completely off the rails, the driving gets to be much faster and more action-packed. This is a major change of pace for IO on pretty much every level.</p>

<p>“We’re not known for driving games,” Rasmus said, “So with that in mind, we had to bring on board specialist skill sets to the team to really help us do that, people with experience in that arena, and that was simply necessary for us to be able to believe that we could pull it off.</p>
<p>And with that said, the good thing about it is when the car dynamics have been set up correctly, the car becomes a toy in itself. Once you nail the handling of the vehicle, it keeps on giving. I think, once you can say that about many of the game mechanics, but in particular, the car is a physics object, if you will, that you can manipulate on the fly. That is one of those technical setups that just gives an experience instantly, even without gameplay. Even without rules, it’s a toy.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I think the integration of the car gameplay in the game has been massively challenging, massively daunting, but something we’ve approached with with great care and I’m happy to say that I think it’s in some amazing parts of the game. I’m really excited, and I love driving games, so it’s been very good.</p>
<p>It certainly looks and feels like a narrative-led car chase, with 009 always kept out of reach up until the car crash that’s conveniently close to an air strip where he can make his second escape attempt.</p>

<p>But let’s come back to the chess tournament a moment, and an evolution of the stealth action gameplay when compared to Hitman: World of Assassination. Bond’s trying to tail a suspicious bellhop, but has to skirt past security &nbsp;Bond is following a suspicious looking bellhop, ditching his station and defying orders in the process, but can’t get into the main building without accreditation. Looking around the area presents a few clear opportunities: a drainpipe to clamber up to reach an open window, plenty of other staff, press and more who you could maybe steal accreditation from, a bunch of dry leaves that could cause a distraction, if only you could find a lighter…</p>
<p>Rasmus admitted, “Obviously, there is a lot of common ground, and we enjoyed reading the internet’s opinions on that, a while back as well, and so obviously a lot of common ground in the sense that a lot of the gameplay interaction is similar to what we’ve done in the past, right? The creative approach element that we’re focussing on here, which is the primary gameplay pillar, is certainly present, which means everything from manipulation, charm, combat, all the way through driving.”</p>
<p>And then there’s the gadgets. As Bond wanders through some familiar feeling crowd, evading both colleagues and security, the Q watch helps to provide an overlay to the environment, analysing the environment and presenting opportunities that you could take advantage of to get through the mission. Here’s we see some of the partnerships and iconic branding of the films filtering through.</p>
<p>“We knew we had to do something fun with gadgets. But the cool thing about that is when designing the game, it’s not so much about the gadget as it is about the environment of the world and situation, telling you what it needs now. What would a superpower be here in this situation? And then from there, rework locations and get this together to build a fabric of opportunities and gardgets that allow those opportunities. […]
</p><p>“It’s funny to discuss both internally and with Omega clarity and readability, because if you’re doing an instrument, readability is key. Of course, our instrument is the game, and not time-telling. So that has been a really fun collaboration there, basing it on Omega design cues, but of course, customised to what the game needs, what clarity do you need as a player to understand how to manipulate the world and how to do that effectively and quickly.”</p>
<p>These brands are going to be wrapped up, in a way, by Q and all the gadgetry he builds at his lab.&nbsp;I’m hoping Q’s been working on some rocket-loaded plaster casts and booby-trapped phone boxes.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the presentation skips ahead to the car chase, things having gone a bit awry, and with Bond partnering with a foreign agency’s operative on-the-fly. Leading to the airfield, what follows is a big and explosive action set piece. Bond, per agency rules, can only shoot to kill if actively threatened, but once combat kicks off, there’s no stopping him. A plane is about to take off, and there’s plenty of big barrels and fuel containers to shoot at to battle past the gun-toting goons.</p>
<p>Haring after the plane, we get something that’s various parts The Living Daylights, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Uncharted 3 – arguably the latter two would have been inspired by the former. The fight on the plane goes wrong, Bond ends up freefalling and, funnily enough, the most pressing objective changes to trying to find a parachute…</p>
<p>Through it all, you can see IO Interactive’s experience with Hitman coming through. Just as I had expected when this licensing partnership was announced, there’s so much common ground with things like the crowd system, having open and secure areas, blending this familiar ground with more fluid movement, suave interactions and new gameplay. A bit like getting a new kitchen installed, the underlying cabinets are still built using the same materials, but there’s a fancy kitchen island for the cooker and the fridge is hiding behind a cabinet door. That’s far from a bad thing, as it plays to IO’s strengths while letting them broaden their horizons.</p>

Seems a bit odd to include such a classic Bond prop in a game that, seemingly, has nothing to do with that era of the franchise, but hey, what do I know?</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-makers-of-hitman-are-working-on-a-new-james-bond-ga-1845713628">First announced back in 2020</a>,<em> 007: First Ligh</em>t is the long-awaited next game from IO Interactive, and it tells the tale of a younger James Bond as he completes some of his first missions. It’s been a long five-year wait for fans of <em>Hitman</em> who are hoping that <em>First Light</em> will play a lot like Agent 47’s franchise. In today’s State of Play reveal, it did indeed seem like this is very much a <em>Hitman</em>-style game, with multiple options for infiltrating areas and a big focus on stealth and problem-solving. However, the gameplay in the presentation also had moments that were marred by some nasty performance dips and a lot of motion blur. Hopefully, <em>007: First Light</em> looks better and runs well when it arrives on Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p>

<p>007 First Light has been revealed in full by IO Interactive, including the game’s release date and the editions that will be available when it drops. It’s coming next March, bringing a refreshing origin story to 007 fans worldwide. Following the release of a lengthy gameplay walkthrough, the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition was uncovered, benefits and all.</p>



<p>If you pre-order the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition, here’s everything you’ll get for your money…</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-007-first-light-deluxe-edition">What’s in the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition?</h2>



<p>Those who want a little more bling for their buck with 007 First Light will want to secure the Deluxe Edition, available to pre-order on PS5, Xbox Series, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>It’s an all-digital special edition, which means the bonuses and benefits are cosmetic-based.</p>



<p>Here’s what you get:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s four exclusive outfits, a new weapon skin for Bond’s trademark handgun, and a ‘Gleaming Skin Pack’ that equips 007’s earbuds, lighter, pen, and mobile phone with a gold skin.</p>



<p>I’m particularly interested in the exclusive outfits. I want to stalk my targets while trying to maintain my cover dressed as a skeleton in a top hat. I hope there’s some kind of lore to explain why that’s a thing. Perhaps I’ve missed a trick, but I’m hardly a James Bond fan!</p>



<h3 id="h-when-is-007-first-light-coming-out">When is 007 First Light Coming Out?</h3>



<p>During the gameplay reveal, IO Interactive also dropped the 007 First Light release date. The game is set to be released worldwide on March 27, 2026. That means there’s still quite a while to wait until it launches.</p>



<p>Are you going to pre-order the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition upgrade? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what your plans are.</p>

The 007 logo on the front cover is a removable magnet, which is a neat little twist on the average steelbook design.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, IO Interactive gave press and content creators a behind-closed-doors presentation of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly anticipated upcoming game, 007 First Light</a>. The booth was certainly a looker, especially with a shiny Aston Martin placed in front of it to remind everyone how big this brand really is.</p>



<p>Inside, we were shown footage from one of the game's early missions. After just a few minutes, it was clear that the Copenhagen-based studio was doing things quite differently from its HITMAN series. There's a decidedly more cinematic style to everything, which is far from surprising given that we are talking about James Bond, one of the most iconic movie characters (even though, of course, he originally appeared in Ian Fleming's novels and short stories) of all time. Every character has more flair, starting with Bond himself, who is immeasurably more charismatic than the glacial Agent 47. At this stage, he's also a lot more brash and cocky than we're used to in the movies; that is because IO Interactive and the licensing partners have decided to go with an origin story that's going to explore how Bond becomes a double 0 agent in the first place. In the mission, Bond is assigned to keep watch outside of an important event, but he cannot help himself and goes inside after noticing some odd behavior from certain guests.</p>



<p>The gameplay eventually shows some of the gadgets available to Bond at this point in the game, but what's quickly obvious is that this is not going to be anywhere near as open-ended a sandbox as HITMAN. In fact, it appears to draw a lot of similarities with Uncharted-style games, which is why I came up with the headline. There are even big setpieces akin to what we're used to from Naughty Dog's games.</p>



<p>There's nothing wrong with that - I loved the Uncharted games, and so did millions of people, if the sales are anything to go by - and this is going to be multiplatform, unlike those titles. It's just that HITMAN fans should be aware this will be quite a bit different from the usual fare they've come to expect from this studio. Visually, the game looks great in the latest version of the Glacier engine, although character models aren't quite as good as what we've seen recently from other engines. I noticed frame rate slowdowns at least a couple of times, but 007 First Light is still in Pre-Alpha, so that is to be expected.</p>



<p>After the presentation, I was able to chat for a bit with IO Interactive's Senior Licensing Producer Theuns Smit. As a reminder, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will launch the game on March 27, 2026</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p><strong>Can you explain what your role entails?</strong></p>



<p>As you would expect from a licensed IP like James Bond, we have a great collaboration between IO Interactive and our partners at Amazon and Metro Goldwyn Mayer. This means that everything that goes into the game, we collaborate with them on that, so there's submissions and reviews and approvals and all of that. It also means that, as we've been crafting this experience, we have been granted access to the consultants who have been working on this IP as well, collaborating together on all of that. I help keep track of things that are moving in, getting approved, and working with our brand partners. James Bond is synonymous with working with Omega, Aston Martin, Land Rover, these folks were all equally and extremely excited to partner on this, and I just help manage those interactions..</p>



<p><strong>007 First Light is an original story, though, correct?</strong></p>



<p>That's exactly right. Obviously, we have over 25 years of experience in the agent fantasy genre with HITMAN, but for 007 First Light, a big focus for us is that from the get-go, we wanted to tell an original, standalone, reimagined origin story. This means that we get to go back to before James Bond is at MI6, before he earns his double 0 status, fresh out of the Royal Navy. We are given the opportunity to explore that space.</p>



<p><strong>In the presentation, Bond seemingly kills some people. Does that mean that by that point in the game, he has already earned the famous License to Kill?</strong></p>



<p>I almost feel like I don't want to completely spoil a few things, because there's a deep narrative connection to it. As you know from 007 lore, it takes two kills to earn double 0 status, and that is something that we lean into, of course, and that is part of the journey you're taking on. But that license to kill doesn't just mean you go into any situation with guns blazing. When met with deadly force, you reciprocate, and in certain moments, like the one you saw in the presentation, it is very much all action all throughout, but in other areas, where perhaps there's a more open approach to a specific area. You try to get back to situation contact. So, License to Kill, do what you need to immobilize the enemies around you, and then go back to situation contained.</p>



<p><strong>Of course, you previously mentioned IO Interactive's track record with agent fantasy games. Even in the presentation, it was revealed that 007 First Light would have a mix of linear and more open missions. Can you share whether it will be an even balance between the two, or should players expect to see more of one type?</strong></p>



<p>For us, it's about the full experience you get in our game. There's the underlying story, the narrative that drives things forward, but that is in combination with the wealth of gameplay we provide. So, various missions will take you to various locations. Some of them are a little bit bigger. Some of them are a little bit smaller. It is what the story calls for, what we need to drive forward in this moment that we will either, you know, enlarge that space, an environment at that location, or put it a bit more on guardrails to tell what we need to tell. So, it's a third-person story-driven action adventure, and that is what determines kind of where we want to make things go more open up and where we want to be more linear.</p>



<p><strong>During the presentation, at some point, I noticed a lure ability greyed out, and the game told the player that they required more 'agency'. Can you explain what agency is?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Same as what you saw on your watch, for example, there's a bit of resource management to the different gadgets that you need to use. Here, it's about relying on James Bond's instincts, basically, so your instincts also have a bit of a gamified gameplay element to them. I'm not going to go into too much detail right now, but to keep things fun and balanced and not completely overpowered, there are moments where you need to or you get to rely on your intrinsic 'Bondiness', so to speak—Bond's charm and wit. Perhaps luring people over or bluffing your way through a situation. You saw a glimpse of that in the infiltration, where some folks are startled by this man jumping from the window and Bond goes like, penetration test, all good. That was an automatic reaction, but later in the game, there's this fun gameplay that comes into it where certain actions allow you to hold that metre up a little bit, and then using that to bluff your way out of a situation, something like that.</p>



<p><strong>Obviously, in HITMAN, disguises were a core component of the gameplay. Are they going to be a lot less prominent in 007 First Light?</strong></p>



<p>That's a good question. We definitely wanted to focus on the fact that these two different games and with James Bond, there are certain things that we get to lean in on more. It goes back to that trademark Bond charm, a little bit of social manipulation, espionage, and leaning into Bond's double 0 training. You can manipulate those around you to get into certain areas where you need to be, and so there are contextual outfits for the stories that you go on, but it is not the same of like, just grab an outfit and go as you're used to in the HITMAN games. We lean into the strength of Bond being Bond and his charm and his wit and his guile to get through situations.</p>



<p><strong>Is there some form of character progression system in the game? Can you unlock some new abilities for him through a dedicated system, or is it just narrative-driven?</strong></p>



<p>For us, it's a bit more narrative driven instead of what maybe it's picked from a role playing game kind of thing. We have definitely found some really fun and interesting ways of taking you through character and player progression. Some of it is tied to the gadgets that to unlock through the story, but also, as you're going for training, as we said, you start off as a young Bond, you can maybe throw fists a little bit, but yeah, you you haven't been the Mature and well rounded agent that he becomes. As you work through that to earn your number, there are key moments where we can expand on the things that you, as the player, get to do. So, it's about taking you and Bond on that same progression journey together from a narrative point view and I feel it works very well.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share an estimate for the game length of 007 First Light?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. I suppose it depends on what kind of player you are. It comes back to our variety of locations. There's a big story to tell. Some of the locations are going to be bigger. Some of them are going to be a bit smaller. But we'll also focus a lot on the immersion; this is not just an action/adventure game, this is a James Bond action/adventure game. That means there's a certain level of immersion that you would expect of the locations you find yourself in. As you saw in the previous trailer, even going to the MI6, what does that mean as a player? Explore around, feel, get immersed. All of that has an impact on the full flow and works out for you to play for yourself.</p>



<p><strong>I know that you'll be giving players the ability to replay the story missions with modifiers, correct?</strong></p>



<p>It's more coming down to the creative approach. This new chapter for Bond in gaming means that you go through certain areas, perhaps you're focusing more on being stealthy or more on using gadgets or something like that, and we wanted to make it so fun that you played again and perhaps tried something else. Take a different approach. That is where we focus when it comes to replayability.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to have some kind of online leaderboards like in HITMAN, where 007 First Light players compete for mission scores or something like that?</strong></p>



<p>Perhaps in the future, but for now, we're focusing on this standalone, action/adventure experience.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share the status of the game? Was the presentation grabbed from a Pre-Alpha or Alpha build? </strong></p>



<p>Yeah, it was a Pre-Alpha, very much work-in-progress build that you saw.</p>



<p><strong>Good to know. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IO Interactive just revealed an in-depth walkthrough of 007 First Light, dropping more than half an hour of preview footage. It was a combination of a raw mission session followed by a gameplay breakdown, accompanied by commentary. The entire length and breadth of the game’s core mechanics were unveiled by the team.</p>



<p>During the walkthrough, my eagle eyes spotted something in the background. In one sequence, there’s a row of classic arcade games across the other side of a room, and one is none other than Freedom Fighters, the 2003 third-person shooter from IO Interactive and one of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-freedom-fighters-be-playable-though">Will Freedom Fighters Be Playable Though?</h2>



<p>If Freedom Fighters were to be playable as a game within a game, I think I’d lose my mind. I adored the shooter when it dropped more than 20 years ago, and it went on to influence games like Homefront.</p>



<p>Here’s a screencap from the trailer:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The 007 First Light preview was one that I’d seen previously at Gamescom, but this was the first time it had been made public. It also offered up the release date for 007 First Light, which is set to drop on March 27, 2026.</p>



<p>I’ve penned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a full preview breakdown</a> of the walkthrough I received at Gamescom, but little did I know, IO Interactive would show the <strong>exact same preview </strong>to the world today! I didn’t see the Freedom Fighter cameo earlier, though.</p>



<p>007 First Light will drop next year, and fans of Hitman will be pleased with what’s on offer. It will also give 007 fans a look at a refreshing origin story for the legendary character.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to 007 First Light? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-preview-i-couldn%E2%80%99t-stop-seeing-hitman-with-a-james-bond-skin.1287999/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I had the pleasure of attending a 007 First Light preview at Gamescom, where I got a glimpse of live gameplay of the highly anticipated, upcoming spy action-thriller from IO Interactive. The team from IO walked us through a brief mission to locate a target at a gala while undercover, but soon fast-forwarded to some intense car chase scenes.</p>



<p>This was one of the most ‘protected’ experiences I had at Gamescom, hidden away behind the scenes in an area mocked up as a theater flanked by a classic Aston Martin. However, for all the pomp and circumstance of the reveal, I couldn’t help but feel I was watching gameplay pulled from the next Hitman game.</p>



<p>Here’s my full 007 First Light preview.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-beginning-of-bond">The Beginning of Bond</h2>



<p>My 007 First Light preview opened with the IO Interactive squad setting the scene for the game. They explained that this is a brash, young, and somewhat inexperienced James Bond, fresh out of the military and working into what will become a legendary career as one of the most recognizable spy characters to ever emerge.</p>



<p>It was easy enough to see that concept surfacing in the first few minutes of the gameplay walkthrough at Gamescom. This James Bond was making quips, stepping out of his lane relatively early on, and perhaps fumbling where a more experienced 007 might not.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as the sequence unfolded, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was watching a Hitman game on the big screen. It was also an early build, so a few bugs were present, emotionless NPCs were everywhere, and interactions felt a little flat.</p>



<p>It might be obvious at first blush, but both Hitman: World of Assassination, the most recent game in the series, and 007 First Light share an engine – Glacier. The visual palette is quite similar, but it goes beyond that, and a lot of the movement, UI, and underlying themes feel as though they’ve been ripped from Hitman.</p>



<p>As the IO Interactive team stalked the luxurious gala venue in Slovakia, trying not to arouse suspicion and searching for their target (in this case, 009), I felt as though I’d done the same thing a hundred times in the last 25 years in Hitman games. What’s different is that 007 is a cheeky British chap with a bit more agility than the gruff Agent 47.</p>



<p>Bond fans will absolutely appreciate the origin story that sees them shaping 007 and becoming acquainted with the likes of M, Moneypenny, and Q, but anyone coming into Bond from a Hitman background might feel a little short-changed. The timeline is also a little skewed. This is ‘young’ James Bond, but from the weapons to the vehicles, the game feels decidedly modern.</p>



<p>I <strong>should stress </strong>that these impressions are based on a short preview, so it’s perhaps unfair to tar First Light with such a tough brush this early on, but if I’m in the business of judging a book (game) but its cover (exclusive preview)…</p>



<p>But as the preview unfolded, I found myself nitpicking something awful. There’s not enough room here to expand on that.</p>



<h2 id="h-meat-on-the-bones">Meat on the Bones</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Car chases are high-octane but very scripted (Credit: IO Interactive)</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s tough to gauge how sizable 007 First Light will be, but I can see it having replayability value on account of the multiple approaches possible for each mission and situation. There are some extra modes attached to the game, like challenge runs, and the title seems to accommodate both lethal and non-lethal styles.</p>



<p>I witnessed Bond getting his ‘license to kill’ from MI6 first-hand, opening the door to a guns-blazing sequence that showcased the faster pacing of the game present in these scenes and car chases, for instance.</p>



<p>I was also privy to the game’s espionage mechanics, with Bond using distraction tactics, neat gadgets, and tricks of the trade like bluffing and persuasion to make his way to his target unimpeded. These are elements that <strong>you’d expect </strong>to see in a Bond game, of course.</p>



<p>I hate to play a broken record, but they’re also elements that are prevalent in Hitman. If you modded the game and replaced the all-new and original model of 007 with Agent 47, you’d probably not be able to tell the difference.</p>



<p>I want to highlight that I’m not <strong>disappointed </strong>with what I saw from 007 First Light; I’m just not yet convinced that it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-reveal-how-hitman-has-influenced-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing apart from Hitman</a> enough for IO Interactive to push it as far as it can, especially as there’s a desire to make it a trilogy. I’ve always enjoyed the Hitman games, and I’d almost certainly enjoy 007 First Light, regardless of how familiar it feels.</p>



<p>For some, that familiarity is nothing but a good thing. It’s a comfort. I’m sure that with a fuller preview or a lengthy walkthrough, I’d have a much better sense of how First Light differentiates itself from Hitman beyond a few gadgets and heavily scripted car chases.</p>



<p>007 First Light is set to be released in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. Let me know what you think about it on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

As part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-007-first-lights-september-playstation-state-of-play-livestream-with-us-here">Sony's big Bond-themed PlayStation State of Play</a>, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has revealed 007: First Light will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC on 27th March next year. Additionally, the studio has unveiled a collector's edition with a price tag likely to leave you at least slightly shaken if not completely stirred.
</p>
<p>
007: First Light was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">announced all the way back in 2021</a>, under the name Project 007, but it wasn't until earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">IO began discussing the game in earnest</a>. The gist is that First Light serves as an origin story for IO's Bond - part of what's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">hoped to be a trilogy</a> - charting the iconic spy's early days as a "young, resourceful, and sometimes reckless new recruit". It's promising stealthy espionage, daredevil action set-pieces, cool spy gadgets, and seemingly everything else you might expect from a Bond game.
</p>
<p>
IO showed off some of that in more detail during Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play showcase, and you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">read more about 007: First Light's gameplay fundamentals</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer. But perhaps the biggest news of the evening was a confirmed release date. We already knew it was coming next year, but IO has now firmed that up into a 27th March launch. Additionally, it's also <a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame">announced a bunch of different editions</a> as pre-orders get underway.

<p>
Anyone that pre-orders 007: First Light's £59.99/€69.99/$69.99 USD Standard digital edition - which can be purchased for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) - will be upgraded to the Deluxe Edition at no extra cost. This gets you the game itself, 24 hours of early access, and a Deluxe Upgrade cosmetics bundle featuring four exclusive outfit skins, one new weapon skin, and the Gleaming pack. After launch, the Deluxe Edition will cost £69.99/€79.99/$79.99 USD.
</p><p>
There's also a physical release - known as the Specialist edition - featuring all the above plus the Classic Tuxedo Skin, for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. And for the big spenders out there, IO is releasing a limited edition Legacy variant. This physical-only release for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC costs a not-insignificant £259.99/€299.99/$299.99 USD and includes everything featured in other editions, plus a couple of exclusive weapon and outfit skins, a Golden Gun figurine with a stand and secret compartment, a certificate of authenticity, and a magnetic steel case. Oh, and a great big box.

<p>
Whether IO Interactive can pull off its ambitious Bond origin story remains to be seen, but Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-one-trailer-io-interactive-has-totally-proven-it-gets-bond-and-its-all-about-the-salivating-consumerism">previously opined that signs are good</a>. "In one trailer, [the Hitman studio] has totally proven it 'gets' Bond," he wrote, "and it's all about the salivating consumerism."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158455/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Spare a thought for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a>, Atari’s newest retro-styled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a>. Developed for over a decade by the Brazilian studio Ilex Games, it has the unlucky distinction of releasing on the very same day as ultra-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, which is bound to take all the oxygen out of the room among the gaming commentariat upon release.</p>
<p>This, however, is an interesting place to start. Samsara’s creators, according to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=g0Y6fvNzSMUiPwMh&amp;v=_39FhizV0Nc&amp;feature=youtu.be">developer podcast</a>, spent years being told by publishers to make their game “more like Hollow Knight.” They resisted calls for ultra-fluid, instant-response combat, opting to stick to their own vision of a platformer where fighting unfolds at a weightier and more deliberate pace.</p>
<p>The result is a surprisingly deep, beautifully rendered but <em>hard</em> indie that draws inspiration from the original <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-prince-of-persia-games-of-all-time-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Prince of Persia</a></strong> titles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, while paying homage to the archetypal spirit of Warren Robinett’s 1980 classic, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a>, for the Atari 2600 (playable on Switch via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50</a>). Samsara, though, is not a remake, a sequel, or revival of the latter title – it’s very much its own thing.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158454/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsara unfolds in a universe that deliberately collides with Atari’s original Adventure, in a setting where dragons roam and high technology mistaken for magic is scattered across 10 distinct biomes, which consist of everything from frozen medieval wastelands and dread-infused cloning labs to dense subterranean green spaces teeming with giant insects.</p>
<p>You control a nameless champion resurrected as a vessel of solar power tasked with restoring balance to the multiverse with the help of fractured communities known as the Orphics. They aim to end the rule of Necromancers who seek to end the cycle of death and rebirth — the concept behind the Sanskrit word <em>samsara</em> — in pursuit of immortality.</p>
<p>Core mechanics centre on sword-and-shield combat with a timing-based parry system, supplemented by spells, ranged weapons like the bowgun, and a slow but high-damage hammer. There are also unique tools used to open up environmental traversal, which see you use solar energy to blast away thorny obstacles and restore ruined platforms.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158458/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Metroid influence is clear in both the world design and sci-fi presentation, particularly the armour and visor-like UI, from which you can customise your build by slotting different discoverable items into a gauntlet to shape your playstyle, whether by favouring raw damage, defensive resilience, and healing, or decreasing the cost of spellcasting.</p>
<p>Each of the three weapons carries its own upgrade tree, allowing enhancements like faster charge times for heavy attacks, stronger base damage, or added defensive perks. In combat, you can switch between these weapons on the fly to adapt to the situation, with the bowgun being particularly useful for targeting enemies from afar while avoiding combat damage.</p>
<p>Samsara’s combat has a lot in common with the Souls-like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, which also leans on deliberate and weighty combat, pattern recognition (especially during colossal boss fights), and spellcasting. Once an attack animation begins, you’re locked in, unable to cancel or heal until it resolves. Likewise, precise timing is key to triggering powerful counterattacks when parrying.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158457/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat encounters thus play out like methodical duels. However, given the genre’s emphasis on backtracking, low-level encounters soon begin to feel repetitive. Pair that with parkour-style platforming that isn’t immediately intuitive and knockback from enemies that can easily send you falling into a pit with the loss of a big chunk of health, and frustration is inevitable.</p>
<p>Another quirk is that when jumping to strike a fast-moving aerial enemy, colliding with them by mistake often results in being knocked backwards into another foe, triggering a 'ping-pong' chain of collisions that drains health rapidly. This issue is especially pronounced in tight spaces with multiple enemies out to eviscerate you; positioning becomes quite unforgiving.</p>
<p>Fumbling attacks on even a minor foe can result in taking steep damage. You have elixirs for healing, which can be upgraded, but taking them effectively requires standing still to avoid any simultaneous inputs, and taking a hit mid-use cancels the recovery, leaving health partially restored. The system’s rigidity adds difficulty and feels punishing, especially during frenetic boss fights.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158453/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But, after several hours, I gradually adapted to the rhythm of combat and what the game’s systems demanded — patience, timing, and a careful awareness of spacing — and began to enjoy myself as I manoeuvred with greater confidence. The game also shifts between relentless combat gauntlets to more exploration-driven areas that provided a welcome change of pace.</p>
<p>Boss battles are among the game’s standout moments, with each prefaced by a brief, pixel-art cutscene that heightens the atmosphere as you face colossal foes that initially feel insurmountable. Success comes not from frantic button-mashing but from learning the 'dance' – carefully studying attack patterns, dodging strikes, and parrying with deliberate timing.</p>
<p>Toppling a hulking adversary delivers a rush of satisfaction, just be prepared to try, try, try again. It can easily take 15-20+ hours to get through Samsara’s campaign, but that number will vary based on skill. Still, there are heaps of hard-to-access collectibles used to upgrade and customise your build, as well as secrets to uncover, so completionists will be kept busy.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158459/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The score leans into sombre, atmospheric textures that echo both mystery and melancholy. Boss fights feature epic symphonics, while most traversal plays out over minimalist ambience and your own footsteps. Samsara’s lore is likewise Souls-esque, with storytelling established through myths, rumours, and accounts offered by the Orphic villagers.</p>
<p>Samsara’s ties to Atari’s top-down 1980 classic are largely superficial. There are nods to the original – differently colored dragons that randomly spawn across the map, bats that swoop in to steal items, lots of keys, and scattered references that serve as Easter Eggs. Beyond these callbacks, though, Samsara is essentially a new IP with a few scattered winks to the past.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, the game ran well without any noticeable FPS drops in docked and handheld modes on both the Switch 2 and the base Switch model. I experienced one instance where the game crashed without auto-saving my progress, and another minor bug that occurred after backtracking to a save point after a boss fight instead of progressing forward as intended.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158456/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fortunately, the game auto-saved after I won the fight, saving me from repeating the encounter. These are wrinkles that need to be ironed out in further updates, but they were far from game-breaking. For Metroidvania and retro enthusiasts who thrive on challenge, Samsara has a lot going for it. But, at present, it risks feeling cumbersome and too rich for the blood of more casual players.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For players with a taste for retro sensibilities — deliberate controls, punishing difficulty, and trial-and-error enemy encounters — Adventure of Samsara offers grit and satisfaction with its varied biomes, parkour traversal, and epic boss encounters that reward patience and mastery.</p>
<p>Yet the experience, at least until you get to grips with its control scheme, feels more hindered than helped by rigid inputs, cheap deaths, and difficulty spikes that can wear you down.</p></section>

<p>'Radiant Starlets' is targeting Switch 2</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you've ever played <strong>Mega Man</strong> and thought <em>"hmm, this is great, but what if I could hook up with the Robot Masters?"</em>, then you're in luck. <strong>Radiant Starlets</strong> is a new title from developer Buster X Buster, and it's looking to combine that classic side-scrolling action gameplay with some intriguing dating sim elements.</p>
<p>The game is targeting a release on the Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/busterxbuster/radiant-starlets">Kickstarter campaign</a> now live with 28 days remaining at the time of writing. The developers are looking for a total of CA$ 100,000, which roughly converts to just under £50,000, but a whole bunch of stretch goals have also been detailed should funding surpass expectations. These include a Boss Rush Mode, hard difficulty setting, a secret extra date, and more.</p>
<p>So essentially, you'll be able to choose which 'Starlet' you want to pursue from eight main stages. When you eventually encounter a Starlet, you'll have the choice to either fight them or date them. If you choose the latter, you'll need to complete a minigame unique to each character. Successfully doing so will then essentially recruit the Starlet to accompany you on further playthroughs, introducing fresh power ups and unique endings.</p>
<p>With some beautiful HD2D-inspired visuals, this one is looking really cool. We'll definitely keep a close eye on the Kickstarter campaign over the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Traverse Challenging Environments:</strong> Play 8 main stages and face against <strong>Starlet Overdrive,</strong> a world-famous S-Pop group bent on obtaining Dream for themselves.<br>
- <strong>Per-Relationship Speed-runs:</strong> Each partner provides a separate speed run and endings. With Radiant Starlets, you're encouraged to try every boss order. Replay to experience each partner’s armor set, minigame, and story.<br>
- <strong>Partner Specific Mini Games:</strong> Each partner has a custom mini game, designed to unlock partner-specific power-ups and narrative.<br>
- <strong>Armor Designed by your Partner:</strong> Each partner playthrough will have a custom armor set with unique properties, creating variances in gameplay between runs.<br>
- <strong>Custom Partner Charge Shot:</strong> Each partner provides you with a <strong>custom charge shot that you blast!<br>
-</strong> <strong>Get power ups from each boss:</strong> The Starlets have all modified Dream's power source to power their equipment. When he retrieves them he will get a part of their powers.<br>
- <strong>Endings for Each Romantic Partner:</strong> Each Romantic partner provides narrative changes and their own distinct ending.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/">Variety</a>.</p>



<p>This is the same series that was announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/">May 2024</a> with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe </a>that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,</em>" Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "<em>It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…</em>"</p>



<p>For Turner's part, she added that she is "<em>thrilled beyond measure</em>" to be stepping into the role. "<em>She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking.</em>"</p>



<p>It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected/">confirmed layoffs last week</a>, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "<em>unaffected</em>," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>True believers, the official <em>Spider-Man Secret Lair</em> has been announced. Alongside its upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exclusive-mtg-spider-man-spoilers-card-reveals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>MTG Spider-Man</em></a> set, Wizards of the Coast have announced several drops of cards featuring the wisecracking wallcrawler.</p>

<h2>The <em>Spider-Man Secret Lair</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/secret-lair-spider-man-superdrop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the Spider-Man Secret Lair will be a Superdrop containing six drops of cards. These drops will feature classic Magic cards reimagined in the style of Marvel's iconic superhero.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-secret-lair-daily-bugle-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=g4hRCsl8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-secret-lair-daily-bugle-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SXukhCeR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But Wizards of the Coast are being secretive about the contents of these drops. The post contains an early scoop of one of those drops, titled <em>Secret Lair x Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Breaking News</em>. As for the other five drops, they are mum at this time.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the cards in the <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop are visually striking. As the name implies, it reimagines the cards as front page stories from the Daily Bugle, complete with a front-page photo, headline, and mana cost where the newspaper cost should be. The artwork is striking, featuring Spidey and other iconic characters like Miles Morales, The Green Goblin, and the Rhino.</p>

<p>The <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop will contain the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Fact or Fiction</em></li>
	<li><em>Frantic Search</em></li>
	<li><em>Scheming Symmetry</em></li>
	<li><em>Blasphemous Act</em></li>
	<li><em>Impact Tremors</em></li>
</ul><p>This isn't the first time a Marvel character has arrived in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.

<p>As for how much mileage Wizards of the Coast can get out of Spider-Man, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed" rel="nofollow">the previews</a> of the upcoming Magic set have shown that nothing is off the table. <em>Spider-Man</em> villains like Venom and Prowler. <em>Spider-Man</em> supporting characters like Black Cat. Spider-Man memes. It's all free game. The question is how well will it be done.</p>

<p>The Spider-Man Secret Lair Superdrop will be available September 22. The <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop will be available in non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you ever doubted the “console wars” were over, here’s a new piece of data to consider: <em>Helldivers 2</em>, formerly console exclusive to Sony’s PS5, is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ps5-console-exclusive-helldivers-2-now-tops-xbox-sales-chart-as-sony-continues-to-dabble-with-its-multi-platform-strategy">the best-selling title on Xbox</a>. In fact, it’s the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-first-third-xbox-best-selling-games-chart/">first <em>and third</em> best-selling game</a>, if you count its more premium edition, and it’s currently the ninth-most played game on the platform — mostly beaten by free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox </em>but also <em>Minecraft </em>and <em>GTA V</em>.</p><div><p>It doesn’t surprise me that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is popular on Xbox, because it was a huge hit on PS5 and PC. Last May, Sony revealed that <em>Helldivers 2</em> had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">become PlayStation’s fastest-selling game of all time</a> with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, and it <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics/status/1961422671381504312">may have now crossed 18 million</a> after reportedly racking up <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">nearly a million on Xbox</a> in its first week on sale.</p></div><p>No, what’s surprising is that we now live in an era where companies like Sony and Microsoft no longer entirely see their hit games as a way to get players to buy their own consoles, and instead just want to sell as many copies of these games as they can. Back in May, we wrote about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">the top three games on PlayStation came from Microsoft</a>, and now it’s reciprocal!</p><div><p>Sony has come around to this position slowly, but by 2022, it planned for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/26/23142569/sony-playstation-pc-mobile-game-releases-first-party-portfolio">roughly half of its games to come out on PC or mobile</a> instead of just console, and though PlayStation game boss Hermen Hulst suggested in 2024 that some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">Sony’s big single-player games might be held in reserve</a>, the company revealed this August that it’s gradually <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146">“moving away from a hardware centric business model</a>.” It’s about selling games, not consoles.</p></div><p>Here’s where some of you will no doubt point out: is <em>Helldivers 2</em> actually a PlayStation game? Since PlayStation is merely the publisher and doesn’t own its developer Arrowhead Game Studios, is it really such a big deal?</p><p>I would say yes, because Sony has been the one in control, the one making the strategic decisions over when and where and how much PlayStation goodness to share. When players balked at how <em>Helldivers 2</em> originally required you to log in with a PlayStation account on PC, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">it was out of Arrowhead’s hands</a>. When players wanted an Xbox version, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead said it was entirely up to Sony</a>.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t have to cut such publishing deals to bring Xbox’s biggest games to PlayStation, though. When it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">chose to bring <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory"><em>Hellblade 2</em> to PS5</a>, it could do so because it owns both giant publisher / developer Bethesda and developer Ninja Theory itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">What is an Xbox</a>, and what is a PlayStation, if not <em>the</em> place to play specific games? Is it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">a launcher and a set of familiar controls</a>? Is it a feeling? That’s the challenge facing Microsoft and Sony if they continue down this road.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox]]></content:encoded>
