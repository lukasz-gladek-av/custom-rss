                <p>Though wireless game controllers have been the norm for many years now, some specialty controllers like racing wheels haven't cut the cord. But there's at least one upcoming racing wheel that is giving wireless connectivity a try. Hori is releasing a new wireless edition of its Apex Racing Wheel, which <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Racing-Wheel-Apex-Playstation-5/dp/B09PX6GHJ7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">initially released as a wired wheel in 2022 for $120</a>. The wireless Hori Apex is officially licensed by Sony and is compatible with PS5, PS4, and PC. Amazon is taking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCZCR26?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders for the $170 Hori Wireless Apex Racing Wheel</a> ahead of its October 24 release.</p><p>We dug around and couldn't find any other wireless racing wheels for modern platforms from major brands, so while the Hori Apex may not be the first of this generation, it is the first officially licensed wireless wheel for PlayStation 5.</p><div title="6525680 - Hori Wireless Racing Wheel" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2563" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6525680 - Hori Wireless Racing Wheel" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCZCR26?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DCCZCR26?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCZCR26?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Hori Apex Wireless Racing Wheel</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCZCR26?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DCCZCR26?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCZCR26?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$170</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Hori says the Apex offers up to 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. If you do need to plug it in, it comes with 6.6ft charging cable so you can keep racing while you refuel the controller. For wireless connectivity, it uses a dongle that plugs directly into your PlayStation or PC, and it has an effective range of up to 32 feet.</p><p>Other features include paddle shifters to make shifting easier, full-size foot pedals, 270-degree rotation, and clamps to secure it to your table or desk. It also has regular inputs, including PlayStation face buttons, D-pad, and four additional face buttons instead of traditional triggers and shoulder buttons.</p><p>Despite releasing over two years ago, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Racing-Wheel-Apex-Playstation-5/dp/B09PX6GHJ7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wired Hori Apex</a> remains one of the most popular entry-level racing wheels for PlayStation. It currently holds a 4.3/5 user average, based on over 3,000 reviews, on Amazon.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you are looking for a more serious piece of kit, there are some solid (wired) options out there. Currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Responsive-PlayStation/dp/B00Z0UWWYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>on sale at Amazon for $230 (was $300), the</strong> </a><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Responsive-PlayStation/dp/B00Z0UWWYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G29</a></strong> offers arguably the best performance for the price. It's currently on sale for $230 (was $300). Also compatible with PC, PS5, and PS4, the G29 has a premium design with durable materials and features built-in force feedback for added realism. The 900-degree wheel rotation is also one of its best features, as it allows you to feel like you're really swinging your digital vehicle around tight corners.</p><p>Alternatively, the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T300-RS-Racing-Wheel-PlayStation/dp/B01M1L2NRL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gran Turismo-themed Thrustmaster T300 RS</a></strong> for PlayStation and PC is another standout wheel, but it holds a lofty $450 price tag. Great for fans of racing sims, the T300 RS contains a dual-belt system in its brushless motor and has proprietary magnetic technology for optimal wheel precision.</p><p>The $400 <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-Magnetic-Shifters-Information-playstation-5/dp/B08Z5CX6V2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thrustmaster T248P</a></strong> is another high-performance racing wheel, and this one places a greater emphasis on customization. It's newer than the T300 RS and it might be more appealing as it has a built-in race dashboard, 25 action buttons, magnetic paddle shifters, and you can even drive stick with an optional TH8S shifter.</p><p>On the budget side, the aforementioned Hori Apex wired model is a solid choice, but there's also the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T80-Racing-Wheel-playstation-4/dp/B00JDYMQ9C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thrustmaster T80</a></strong> for $100 (was $110) that's worth checking out. Like all of the other racing wheels mentioned above, the T80 is officially licensed by Sony.</p><p>Nintendo Switch owners looking for a racing wheel for Mario Kart should <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel/dp/B01C6XAO7M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">check out Hori's duo of officially licensed wheels with Mario Kart themes</a>.

                <p>Humble Choice is technically a membership program for $12/month, but in practice, you can take view it much like Humble's regular slate of game bundles. That's because once you claim the eight free games each month, they will remain in your Steam library even if you cancel your subscription.. August 2024's Humble Choice lineup includes several big name games like Sifu, High on Life, and Gotham Knights, as well as lesser-known gems like Diluvian Ultra and Astral Ascent. Once you <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-choice-august-2024-pc-game-subscription%2F1100-6525599%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for $12/month Humble Choice membership</a>, you'll be able to instantly claim all eight games and add them to your Steam library.</p><p>Here's a look at the full Humble Choice lineup for August 2024. Considering all these games would <strong>regularly cost you $240</strong>, that's a remarkably good deal. Seven of the games have received verified or playable badges for Steam Deck from Valve, and Diluvian Ultra, based on Steam user reviews, works on Steam Deck after rebinding the controls.</p><h2>Humble Choice August 2024 Games</h2><ul><li>Sifu (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>High on Life (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Gotham Knights (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Blacktail (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Astral Ascent (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Diluvian Ultra </li><li>Universe for Sale (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>This Means Warp (Steam Deck Playable)</li></ul><p>As a bonus, you'll also get a 1-month trial of DC Universe Infinite, which will allow you to check out digital comics from the DC catalog.</p><p>Gotham Knights may not have pulled in the best reviews, but it's certainly a nice addition to this month's Humble Choice for those who have wanted to try it. Sifu is arguably the highlight of the bundle, as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sifu-review-i-know-kung-fu/1900-6417823/" data-ref-id="1900-6417823">review</a> gave the martial arts brawler a 9/10 for its methodical and challenging combat, unique aging mechanic, and heaps of replayability. If you're a fan of Rick and Morty, Squanch Games' High On Life uses the same brand of zany humor. The colorful first-person shooter features talking guns as companions and an interconnected world that has some metroidvania elements.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4348349-humblechoice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348349" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4348349-humblechoice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348349"></a><figcaption>Humble Choice for August 2024</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4348349-humblechoice.jpg"></figure><p>While your subscription is active, you can access the Humble Vault. This is where you'll find 50 DRM-free indie games which rotate out each month. So if you decide to stay subscribed to Humble Choice, you'll have plenty of titles to keep you busy.

The new PS5 controller features shiny blue grips and buttons inspired by Astro’s signature blue accents, along with a pair of gawking blue eyes on the touch pad. It also sports some subtle, carved lines on both handles, giving the controller a bit of a sci-fi vibe.</p><p>The distinctions stop there, though. The limited edition <em>Astro Bot </em>model touts the same robust compatibility and battery life as your standard DualSense Wireless Controller, along with the same adaptive triggers, motion controls, and haptics. That being said, Team Asobi has supposedly added <em>a ton</em> of new interactions between the controller and the next <em>Astro Bot </em>game, allowing you to feel a wider variety of textures and surfaces while giving power-ups a more distinct feel. The original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> felt like a glorified tech demo, and if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">our hands-on time with <em>Astro Bot</em></a><em> </em>is any indication, the sequel will follow suit.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216962/d23-2024-all-the-biggest-trailers-and-news"><h2>D23 2024: all the biggest trailers and news out of Disney’s biennial showcase</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24216637/google-photos-collections-library-update-ios-android"><h2>Google Photos’ Library is dead — say hello to Collections</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216202/garm-x-twitter-musk-advertising"><h2>Ad group sued by Elon Musk reportedly disbands</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215215/anker-prime-charger-usb-c-gan-power"><h2>Anker redesigned its wall charger so it won’t constantly fall out of the outlet</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214471/google-chromecast-line-discontinued"><h2>Google is discontinuing the Chromecast line</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’d not go that far, but a pack of foxes can quickly kill you if they show up at the wrong time, like after a fight or when you are low on ammo.</p><p>Another positive change is the reduction in how much rad damage you get per second when swimming around in the game’s water. Previously it was an incredibly high 250 rads a second, which basically meant you’d be dead any time you slipped into water. Now, <em>London’s</em> water only inflicts 169 rads a second, which is still enough that you should be careful, but not enough to instant kill you if you slip off a platform. </p><p>These all seem like good changes to me and I’m excited to jump back into <em>Fallout: London </em>soon. Hopefully, it will stop crashing on me, too. Here are the full patch notes for this update:</p><hr><h2 id="h209037"><a id=""></a>Quest Fixes:</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>“Broken Angel”</strong> —Fixed issue with how the player’s health is handled after the train crash, which disproportionately lowered the max HP of characters with already high health or endurance level, when it should have lowered the player’s <em>current</em> HP instead. </li><li>Since the early-game balance was accidentally built around this bug, we have made the effects of the “Lab Rat” and “Railway Spine” afflictions more serious (though it will still be slightly easier).</li><li><strong>“Charybdis” </strong>— Added The Ferryman to the PlayerFriendFaction to allow a few accidental hits.

<p>Fortnite continues to hold its ground as one of the biggest games in competitive esports. With massive prize pools and large-scale tournaments, the Battle Royale continues to reach high numbers within the esports world. But with so many competitors making up the esports scene, who is considered the best Fortnite player of all time?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-fortnite-player-of-all-time">The Greatest Fortnite Player Of All Time</h2>



<p>How does someone determine who is the best Fortnite esports player of all time? Many factors come into consideration, but the main two are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prize earnings</strong></li>



<li><strong>Placements</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>With various high-paying tournaments and many big events being held in the Fortnite ecosystem, many competitors have kept their names at the top of the list. But only <strong>one </strong>Fortnite player can be considered the greatest of all time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-fortnite-player-ever">The Best Fortnite Player Ever</h2>



<p>The best Fortnite player of all time would be Kyle “<strong>Bugha</strong>” Giersdorf. With over $3 million in prize earnings, Bugha has continued to keep his name at the top ever since his World Cup victory back in 2019. The player certified himself as the Fortnite G.O.A.T. after his first-place back then, but continued to place high in various other FNCS events and more throughout the years later.</p>









<p>Bugha is a 3x FNCS champion, making him one of the top competitors within the series. The creator has been seen competing alongside other big competitors such as Clix, Mero and more.</p>



<p>The gamer continues to prove himself within the Fortnite world, competing at the 2022 Invitational, 2023 Grands and more. </p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>



<p>There are still quite a few other Fortnite competitors that are not too far behind Bugha when it comes to being the best Fortnite player of all time. </p>



<p><strong>Here are a few honourable mentions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Clix</li>



<li>Arkham</li>



<li>EpikWhale</li>



<li>BenjyFishy</li>



<li>Mongraal</li>



<li>Queasy</li>



<li>Dukez</li>



<li>Mero</li>



<li>Edgey</li>



<li>Khanada</li>



<li>MrSavage</li>



<li>Th0masHD</li>



<li>Veno</li>



<li>Kami</li>



<li>Setty</li>
</ul>









<p>Fortnite continues to be one of the best esports, meaning, we could see a different face dethrone Bugha as the greatest someday. Who do you think it could be?</p>

                <p>This week has already been one of Fortnite's most eventful ever after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-battle-pass-and-paradigm-skin-mistakes-are-the-latest-of-many-shop-problems/1100-6525585/" data-ref-id="1100-6525585">the Paradigm goof in the item shop</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">changes to battle pass exclusivity</a>. And there's still more excitement to come. We have a big timer on the battle royale map counting down to something on Saturday, which will be followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-a-d23-presentation-about-fortnite-x-disney-get-a-free-wolverine-themed-back-bling/1100-6525630/" data-ref-id="1100-6525630">a major presentation about the future of Disney's collaborations with Fortnite</a> from D23 later in the evening, With everything going on, it can be easy to forget that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fall-guys-invades-fortnites-battle-royale-modes/1100-6525545/" data-ref-id="1100-6525545">Fall Guys finally entered the Fortnite ecosystem</a> this week.</p><p>And to be fair, this is only the early stages of Fall Guys' integration into Fortnite--it would be more accurate to say that you can play Fall Guys-style mini-games in Fortnite, at least for now. The most noticeable aspect of this being the limited-timeFall Guys obstacle course in the sky above Classy Courts in the battle royale map. You drop near the Courts, interact with the bean statue, and play a Fall Guys course for loot.</p><p>But you're racing the clock, not the other players--the faster you get through it, the better your loot will be when you return to the island. When other players are around, you do get some classic Fall Guys shenanigans, but it's not the same as a direct competition against other people, like the real Fall Guys offers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348269"></a><figcaption>The first phase of Fortnite x Fall Guys is underway.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg"></figure><p>Likewise, the creative maps that have been put together by Fall Guys developers at Mediatonic are approximations of Fall Guys games that have been re-imagined in a Fortnite way. Tumbly Towers, for example, is just another creative map where you have to climb a big towe--only now with traditional bean physics. The Fortnite version of Hex-a-Gone is a re-engineered version of the mini-game in which the platforms respawn after a few seconds (you're scored according to how many platforms you cause to disappear by walking on them) so as to make the rounds longer and allow them to be joinable mid-match.</p><p>All this stuff is <em>like</em> Fall Guys, but it's hardly a replacement for the real thing without the game-show structure. While I suspect Fall Guys will eventually be integrated all the way into Fortnite, Epic and Mediatonic will have to work out a couple of obstacles. And these obstacles are, frankly, so significant that it might take a while for all of this to come together.</p><p>The first issue is that these creative islands aren't going to cut it. It doesn't seem as though the current UEFN tools are able to support the multi-round structure of the game. Fall Guys needs to be a full additional mode on the same level as Fortnite Festival, Lego Fortnite and Rocket Racing, and that takes time. Since Epic usually holds its cards close to the vest, there's not enough information to speculate about a timeline on that, but we can hope it's saving it for the Chapter 6 launch, presumably coming in December.</p><p>That this first part of the Fall Guys rollout in Fortnite was delayed multiple times before it actually happened--this was supposed to be introduced much earlier in the summer--may not be the best sign that a full integration will happen in the next few months, though.</p><p>The other issue is what to do with Fall Guys cosmetics. Right now, nothing ports over between Fall Guys and Fortnite, and when you're playing in a Fall Guys map within Fortnite, it simply converts the skin you're wearing into a bean person. But Fall Guys has a massive number of its own cosmetics, and bringing those over isn't a simple prospect because Falls Guys cosmetics don't work like Fortnite ones do.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348270" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348270"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's Jonesy and his bean version</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg"></figure><p>In Fall Guys, you choose your pants, shirt, hat, and more separately, whereas Fortnite uses head-to-toe skins that determine your entire appearance. Fall Guys in Fortnite would need its own section in the locker for customizing your bean. Some collaboration cosmetics, like Godzilla, are probably going to have to be left behind during this process, but as Epic has done with its drip feed of Rocket League's cross-game cosmetics, they wouldn't need to port everything all at once.</p><p>Despite the obstacles, it seems inevitable now that Fall Guys will end up as another Fortnite game-within-a-game someday. There are so many different sorts of passes in the game now that tossing the Fall Guys season pass in the mix probably wouldn't be that big a deal, and Epic and Mediatonic have absolutely nailed the gameplay feel of Fall Guys. The base is there, and ready to rock. Now, we just need the rest of it. Fingers crossed that it won't take too long.</p>

Out of the in-person Anaheim event, we’re expecting trailers and announcements about new shows and movies destined to make their way to theaters and Disney Plus in the not-too-distant future. </p><p>But one of the more promising parts of the expo is happening online where you can watch it unfold up close if you’ve got a <em>Fortnite </em>account.</p><p>While we’re expecting most of the big Marvel, <em>Star Wars</em>, and Pixar news during Friday’s massive Disney Entertainment Showcase, the studio is also focusing on Marvel’s upcoming animated projects with a panel on Saturday afternoon.

			<p>Anthem was a huge flop for BioWare and Electronic Arts, there's no doubt about it. It had an enormous amount of hype pre-launch but was so underwhelming that</p>
<p>However, in a way, it turned out to be a key lesson for the development of the upcoming single player action RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Speaking to EDGE magazine (issue #401), Creative Director John Epler explained:</p>
<p><em>We’re a studio that has always been built around digging deep on storytelling and roleplaying. I'm proud of a lot of things on Anthem – I was on that project for a year and a half. But at the end of the day, we were building a game focused on something we were not necessarily as proficient at. For me and the team, the biggest lesson was to know what you're good at and then double down on it. Don’t spread yourselves too thin. Don't try to do a bunch of different things you don’t have the expertise to do. A lot of the people on this team came here to build a story-focused, singleplayer RPG.</em></p>
<p><em>We tried a bunch of different <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideas</a> early on. But the form Dragon Age: The Veilguard has taken is, in a lot of ways, the form that we were always pushing towards. We were just trying different ways to get there. There was that moment where we really settled on, ‘This is a singleplayer, story-focused RPG – and that’s all it needs to be’.</em></p>
<p>In the interview with EDGE, BioWare also discussed why Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-wont-let-you-control-party-members-directly-according-to-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> the ability to control the rest of the party. Game Director Corinne Busche said:</p>
<p><em>This is a much higher actions-per-minute game. It is more technically demanding on the player. So when we tried allowing you full control of your companions as well, what we've found is it wasn’t actually adding to the experience. In fact, in some ways it was detrimental, given the demanding nature of just controlling your own character.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to launch this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. BioWare <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-reveal-its-release-date-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to reveal the actual date later this month, possibly at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Meanwhile, review all the known information in our roundup <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>.</p>

<section><p>More layoffs at Bungie look to be the result of a combination of factors, not the least of which is mismanagement. But for the game to continue, it needs to grow its audience.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Bungie CEO Pete Parsons's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> explaining the reasoning behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">laying off 220 employees</a>, some 17% of Bungie's staff, is illuminating. In it, Parsons describes a company that overextended, expanding into too many projects as it tried to incubate multiple games while making Destiny 2, the studio's successful live-service game, and Marathon, a revival of a storied Bungie franchise. "We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red," Parsons wrote. The result of this mismanagement is that 220 Destiny 2 developers from all teams lost their jobs, which is in addition to a previous massive round of layoffs in late 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">But critically, this second group of Destiny 2 developers lost their jobs at Bungie right after shipping arguably the best expansion the game has ever seen. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover" rel="nofollow ">Developers reportedly knew The Final Shape was make-or-break for the studio</a>, and Bungie's staff responded to that call by turning out a phenomenal addition to the game. Less than two months later, they learned that their herculean efforts to make money for the company were not enough to save their jobs.</p><p dir="ltr">The Final Shape should have saved Bungie. It was a phenomenal expansion that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">received acclaim from critics and players</a>, and despite the major stumble that was the Lightfall expansion in the year before it, The Final Shape still had the momentum of 10 years of Destiny 2 investment behind it. And yet, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the" rel="nofollow ">according to Stephen Totilo's reporting at Game File</a>, The Final Shape has sold less well than Lightfall. That makes some degree of sense--Lightfall saw huge sales thanks to the hype that resulted from The Witch Queen, the expansion immediately before it, which was also excellent. Lightfall was a major disappointment, and players burned by it were less likely to turn out for The Final Shape.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348232-20240604193510_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348232" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348232-20240604193510_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348232"></a><figcaption>The Final Shape was a compelling conclusion to the 10-year story Destiny has been telling, but two months later, Bungie was hit with massive layoffs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348232-20240604193510_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bungie leadership messed up with "our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall," as Parsons puts it, shipping an expansion with a weak story and burning a ton of player goodwill and momentum in the process. But that's only part of the issue with Destiny 2 that led Bungie to this place. It wasn't just that Bungie over-invested in other projects while failing to anticipate things like how the end of the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic would affect sales. Bungie leadership also failed to invest in a key element of Destiny 2--for years.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in 2020 with the Beyond Light expansion, Bungie started to "vault" certain old Destiny 2 content, removing it from the game. Among those elements it cut was the Destiny 2 vanilla story campaign. This one decision, I think, has been quietly disastrous, with its wide-reaching effects only just now coming into focus.</p><p dir="ltr">Lots of complaints have been made about the Destiny Content Vault taking away content players have paid for. There's a debate to be had about how much removing content from the game damaged Bungie's credibility, and how the technical limitations of Destiny 2 made it impossible to keep adding to the game indefinitely, but there was a more insidious effect to the DCV: It removed Destiny 2's on-ramp for new players.</p><p dir="ltr">The Destiny 2 vanilla campaign, like the original Destiny's story campaign, worked as a guided tour through the game. It took players to each planet, introduced them to the major characters, and bounced them through content like Strikes and Lost Sectors. It certainly wasn't a perfect introduction to the game, especially since Destiny 2 has added many other major components, such as Gambit, since then, but it did at least give a decent sense of how you were <em>supposed</em> to play Destiny 2. By following the story from the start of the game and through its expansion campaigns, you could slowly acclimate to each piece of the Destiny 2 puzzle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348233-destiny2redwar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348233" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348233-destiny2redwar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348233"></a><figcaption>The Destiny 2 story campaign wasn't a perfect introduction to the game, but it was at least a functional approach to onboarding new players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348233-destiny2redwar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ever since the loss of the vanilla campaign, Destiny 2's new-player onboarding has been a frustrating mess. In 2019, Bungie added the New Light feature to Destiny 2, a new take on the opening moments of Destiny 1 that was meant to bring players up to speed on how to play the game, which it expanded into something of a campaign with Beyond Light. But at least anecdotally, New Light still doesn't really do the job. It takes players through the basics, but does so in a speedy, artificial way that's not particularly immersive--and when it's done, the game drops them into whatever's currently happening with almost no guidance.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio tried another approach to guiding players through Destiny 2 with Guardian Ranks, a new system it introduced with Lightfall. Guardian Ranks are meant to give players an ascending ladder of stuff to do in order to "rank up," which serves to walk them through Destiny 2's content, from its easier repeatable activities to its more advanced gameplay mechanics and endgame dungeons or raids.</p><p dir="ltr">But Guardian Ranks also don't do an especially good job of actually leading players. The system is easily ignored and its importance often isn't well conveyed; it's not particularly clear that it's showing you <em>how to play the game</em>; and it lacks a lot of information and context about what the activities it wants you to do actually <em>are</em>, how they work, or where to find them. It's nice that Destiny 2 has something that says, "Okay, now you're ready for a dungeon," but you still need to know what a dungeon is in order to act on that information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348234-20240809124922_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348234" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348234-20240809124922_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348234"></a><figcaption>The Guardian Ranks system is a compelling way to help players progress, but it still has its issues.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348234-20240809124922_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The issue is compounded by the live-game nature of Destiny 2. Boot up the game in a new season (or in the current case, during a new Episode), and you're usually met with a cutscene about whatever is happening in the game's current storyline. If you've been away from the game for a while or you're new to Destiny 2, you're immediately blasted with a firehose of stuff you don't understand. Even worse, the cutscene often leads you into a new limited-time activity as the game kicks you into the current story automatically, so you're not only confused about what's going on, but now you're playing something you didn't ask for and have no context about. It's an approach that <em>only</em> works for regular players and is totally off-putting for everyone else.</p><p dir="ltr">And that's to say nothing of the fact that even with New Light, the Destiny 2 vanilla campaign, or Guardian Ranks working as intended, Destiny 2 is just a dense and confusing game, even though Bungie has been working to lessen that issue and make it clearer literally throughout the franchise's 10-year life.</p><p dir="ltr">A great example is your character's Power level, the measure of how strong you are and, therefore, what content you're capable of playing. Power is determined not by any intrinsic measurement of your character "level" like in other RPGs, but by the numbers attached to all your gear. So in order to increase your strength, you need to find better guns and armor. You can get that just by playing the game for a while, as when you're low enough on the Power scale, every new item you find will be a little higher than what you have.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348235-20240809130051_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348235" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348235-20240809130051_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348235"></a><figcaption>Bungie has consistently improved on the more confusing elements of Destiny 2, but many of its systems are still very complex, especially for new players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348235-20240809130051_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's fine until you hit a certain number known as the "soft Power cap." From here, only certain activities drop gear that can increase your Power level, and only under certain circumstances. These activities are denoted as dropping "Powerful" gear, and while other gear is stalled at the soft cap, Powerful gear will drop higher than your current level. There are a lot of these activities, so ascending is still pretty easy--until you hit the "Powerful cap." At that point, Powerful gear stops being effective, and the only way to keep moving up is with "Pinnacle" gear. Pinnacle drops also come from specific activities, but there are fewer of them and they're higher-end, like raids. They also advance your character much, much more slowly.</p><p dir="ltr">And then you hit the "hard Power cap," the peak of what you can attain from gear. At the hard cap, the only way to keep advancing your character is by gaining leveling up the Artifact, an object related to Destiny 2's current content Episode. You level it by gaining experience points just by playing, so it's not something you have to think about, but if you want to hit that <em>really </em>tough endgame content, like Master-level raids, you need to boost up quite a few levels on top of the hard cap, which means more grinding.</p><p dir="ltr">I've just explained how Destiny 2 leveling works in a pretty truncated way. It took me 319 words. I didn't mention that Powerful gear has multiple tiers, or that you can "infuse" higher-level gear into lower-level gear, or what drops are offered by repeatable activities, or the old bounty system that was part of the game for years up until two months ago. I didn't mention anything about gear stats, the loadout system, or Exotics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348239-20240809130505_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348239-20240809130505_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348239"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2 has improved in providing clear goals and methods for leveling over the years, but it still maintains its confusing elements.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348239-20240809130505_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Imagine trying to follow that system <em>in the game</em> and you have a pretty good idea what new players are up against. I've been playing Destiny for 10 years and sometimes have to look up the Power system caps and differences after taking breaks from the game.</p><p dir="ltr">What I've heard from people who've tried to get into Destiny 2 is that it's extremely difficult, and a lot of them bounce off. After a certain point, they're not sure what they should be doing or what they should be chasing, or what their effort leads to. They often need friends to explain the game to them, and if they don't have any, they tend to filter out. They certainly never get to the best content in Destiny 2, the stuff that <em>really</em> makes the game worth playing and investing in, like the raids and dungeons, or great missions like the two-player-only Dual Destiny.</p><p dir="ltr">Destiny has had this onboarding problem, where players get lost in a quagmire of systems that have been building on each other and mutating over time, <em>for years</em>. Even as the game has gotten better, with better long-term storylines and more affecting narratives, more interesting gameplay systems and better weapons, improved subclasses and more endgame content, it still has dropped new players into the deep end and left them to sink or swim.</p><p dir="ltr">Imagine how many people wanted to get into Destiny 2 and couldn't--especially after The Witch Queen, a well-reviewed expansion that had the community buzzing. Again, anecdotally, I knew <em>many</em> people whose interest in Destiny was suddenly piqued after hearing about that expansion. Most or all of them played the game. None of them have stuck around.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348236-lightfall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348236" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348236-lightfall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348236"></a><figcaption>The Lightfall expansion was the penultimate chapter in the Destiny 2 story, but it stalled progress with a weak, confusing narrative and a lackluster new location that lacked a feeling of context to everything that had happened before.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348236-lightfall.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That brings us to Lightfall. The expansion was a flop among critics and veteran players, largely because of a story campaign that felt like it made no sense and did little to set the stage for the ultimate throwdown that would be The Final Shape. Good additions, like the Strand subclass, were overshadowed by weak new activities and a new destination that didn't do much to inspire players. What excitement for the future The Witch Queen built up, Lightfall leveled at the absolute worst possible moment.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's important to recognize that the damage that Lightfall did was amplified by the fact that Destiny 2 is so hostile to bringing in new players. The success of The Witch Queen attracted people to the game, but the rough onboarding meant many of them didn't stick around, so Lightfall pushed people out of the existing player community with little way for the game to replace them. With no real way for the Destiny community to get <em>bigger</em>, a stumble like Lightfall meant it could only get <em>smaller</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">For years, Bungie put its efforts into making the game for the existing community while largely ignoring the new player experience, and for a while, that was enough for the game to see success. But clearly, that situation was tenuous, and Bungie leadership's failure to prioritize making sure Destiny 2 could attract and keep new players was a major mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, this isn't an effort to place blame on Bungie <em>developers</em>, who have vastly and consistently improved the game. Instead, the clear focus is on Bungie's leadership, who decided where to put investment and what elements to prioritize, and pumped money into other projects rather than dealing with the shortcomings of Destiny 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348266-finalshapecayde.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348266" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348266-finalshapecayde.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348266"></a><figcaption>Bungie staff did everything right with The Final Shape, but still lost their jobs. Maintaining the game and its community is going to be much more difficult for Bungie in the future.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348266-finalshapecayde.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, Bungie's leadership needs to deal with those mistakes, and quickly. Both rounds of layoffs have had a massive impact on the Destiny 2 community, undercutting excitement for and confidence in the game. Reports say Bungie plans to move away from big expansions like The Final Shape to smaller content drops like Into the Light, which doesn't sound great, either. Maybe that approach will keep Destiny 2 at a quality level high enough to keep the community invested, but cutting the people who've helped make the best of Destiny 2 certainly isn't raising Bungie's chances.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of the path forward, Bungie needs to make the game more inviting to new players if it's ever going to thrive as it once did--and that means investing in plugging holes, rather than cutting the people keeping the ship afloat. If there's any way to recover from the disaster of two devastating rounds of layoffs, it means creating a Destiny 2 that can grow beyond what it currently is. Otherwise, it feels like it's only a matter of time before another cataclysmic event--whether it's restructuring from Sony or just a few bouts of poorly received content--puts Destiny 2 down for good.</p>

Following yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-1-2-enhanced-bundle-surfaces-on-steam-with-new-episode-from-machinegames">"enhanced" Doom 1 &amp; 2 release</a>, developer id Software has <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-EU/article/doom-eternal-pc-mod-preview">unveiled</a> another treat for Doom fans as this weekend's QuakeCon celebrations continue: official mod support for Doom Eternal on PC, which arrives in the form of a new mod browser and the release of its idStudio mod creation tools on Steam.
</p>
<p>
By installing Doom Eternal's new Update 6.66 Rev 3 beta, players can browse, download, and play mods via the new PC Mod Preview. Currently, mod support is only available on Steam (it's coming to the Microsoft Store on PC "soon"), and it first requires players to opt-in.
</p>
<p>
To do so, right-click on Doom Eternal within your Steam library and select "Properties". From there, navigate to the "Betas" tab, select "pc-mod-preview" from the drop-down menu, confirm your choice, then wait for the new update to install.
</p>

<p>
Accessing the PC Mod Preview via the Microsoft Store is a little more complicated. You'll first need to install the Xbox Insider Hub from the Microsoft Store, then navigate to Previews &gt; DOOM Eternal - PC Mod Preview. From there, select Join, wait for registration to complete, then return to the store and install Doom Eternal (BATTLEMODE - PC). If you already have it installed, you'll first need to restart your PC after registration is complete. Once all that's done, mods can be browsed and downloaded via the Mods page on the Doom Eternal launcher.
</p>
<p>
The PC Mod Preview is only one half of id's official mod support, however. The other half is specifically for mod creators, and arrives in the form of id Software's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545650/DOOM_Eternal_idStudio/">Doom Eternal: idStudio</a> tools. "Only available on Steam," explains the developer, the "idStudio Beta allows community members to create and publish original mods for all Steam and Microsoft Store players who opt-in to the Doom Eternal: PC Mod Preview." idStudio is a heavy duty toolkit for Doom Eternal mod creation, and a <a href="https://idstudio.idsoftware.com/doom-eternal-launcher">comprehensive manual</a> is now available online.
</p>
<p>
Doom Eternal's official mod support arrives as idSoftware's annual QuakeCon continues, with this year's event set to conclude this Sunday, 8th August. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/quakecon2024">QuakeCon sale</a> is currently live on Steam, offering discounts on Bethesda and id Software titles until 21st August.

It even includes the Nsync song and some dancing, too. </p><p>It’s an impressive little clip and it already has some folks asking the creator if they plan on animating a full recreation of the<em> Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> opening fight. When asked to do the full thing on Twitter, Feraals replied: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Feraalsy/status/1821613279137165377&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Feraalsy/status/1821613279137165377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“If only it was that easy...”</a></span> So I wouldn’t expect a full recreation of that popular action scene anytime soon, but if it does come out I expect it will look pretty dang awesome. </p><p>Meanwhile, if you’ve already seen <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, you might want to check out our post <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-theory-cassandra-nova-x-men-92-1851432053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-theory-cassandra-nova-x-men-92-1851432053">about the movie’s villain and her origins in the comics.</a></span> </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
