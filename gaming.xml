		<p>Hello Games has announced and launched a new update for No Man’s Sky, calling it Breach. The Breach Expedition is a limited time event that will run for three weeks, taking players to an abandoned universe filled with corvette wrecks that can be salvaged for parts. The end goal of the expedition is to find the Fireship Arcadia, but to get there players will need to venture into hostile environments including the purple star systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Breach Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNaY10DQkJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The purple star solar systems were first teased in the Worlds Part II update, and players venturing to these areas will need to be fully prepared as these are pretty hostile areas environmentally. The prizes of stripping the Corvette wrecks may be worth it though. Equipped with your multi-tool laser you will able to take parts from the wrecks and use them to build ships at a Corvette Workshop. The items you can get as scrap include landing gear, shields, weapons, connectors, and wedge-shaped modules. The rewards going into the Breach include Event Horizon, Eternal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars posters, Aeron Cowling and Aeron Diffuser hull plates, the Atlas-themed Wings of Aeron wing module, the Aeron Drive &amp; Aeron Blade,&nbsp; the decorative Aeron Winglet, Aeron Pillar &amp; Aeron Pyramid, the Aeron Starship exhaust trail and the Aeron Powershield which can boosts your ship’s defences.</p>
<p>Fixes have also been released since the launch of Voyagers, with Hello Games improving snapping, making collisions more robust, and adding the option to apply a colour palette to a Corvette at the workshop.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-cuts-50-off-for-final-clearance-sale-2000638162</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-cuts-50-off-for-final-clearance-sale.1331590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Missing a package delivery because you didn’t hear the doorbell or weren’t sure if someone actually rang feels frustrating, especially when you’ve been waiting days for that shipment. The Ring battery doorbell <em>Plus</em> solves this by giving you real-time alerts, two-way communication with visitors and a full head-to-toe video view of whoever’s standing at your door – all accessible from your phone no matter where you are. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/">just slashed it to an all-time low of $79 (down from $149), making this one of the most affordable ways to add smart home security</a> to your front entrance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Video From Head-to-Toe Really Matters</h2>
<p>The wider-angle view through the Ring <em>Plus</em> doorbell captures visitors from the head down to the heel, rather than cutting them off at chest level, like most standard doorbells. That makes all the difference when delivery personnel deposit packages at your feet and go or when you’ll be able to determine whether someone’s holding something. <strong>HD+ video resolution gives you higher definition than standard HD</strong> so you’ll be better able to distinguish faces, read package labeling, or make out identifying characteristics on cars parked nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Color night vision</strong> eliminates the guesswork of nighttime visitors. Old-time infrared night vision provides you with grayscale video, making it harder to distinguish clothing colors, type of vehicle, or other details useful for identification. Color night vision performs better under ambient light and amplifies what light you have, providing usable color video even where the light gets low.</p>



<p>Motion detection triggers alerts the moment someone enters your field of view of your doorbell camera so you have early notification even before they press the button. You have the ability to block off some of the zones within the camera view, like your neighbor’s window or the busy sidewalk, so you only get alerts of motions you actually are interested in.</p>
<p>The Quick Release Battery Pack makes recharging simple: You remove the battery,<strong> charge indoors through the normal USB cable and click the battery back into place without removing the whole doorbell</strong>. This setup eclipses hardwired doorbells where your current doorbell cabling is poor or doesn’t exist, and eliminates the requirement to call an electrician to install the doorbell. <strong>Recharge time covers several weeks to months</strong>, dependent on the level of use, and some owners have a second battery kept charged so they can switch immediately without downtime.</p>



<p>Installation involves setting up the doorbell to your door frame or wall by using the hardware provided and plugging it into your WiFi through the Ring application. <strong>Installation typically takes 15-30 minutes</strong> or so for the average person, and you won’t require any special equipment aside from the use of a screwdriver.</p>
<p>With two-way audio, you can speak to delivery people, say to visitors you’ll be there in just a minute or deter suspicious individuals without having to open your door. The quality of the speaker and microphone is good enough for average conversation, and the lag between someone speaking and you hearing it is negligible. Your real-time communication makes the doorbell system an intercom system you can use anywhere you have internet access.</p>
<p>At $79, the Ring doorbell <em>Plus</em> is cheaper than most of the bare-bones doorbells available without any smart features whatsoever.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-offloads-its-xbox-controller-2025-edition-now-cheaper-than-buying-one-game-2000638170</link>

              <p>Controllers wear out, drift develops and replacement costs add up quickly when you’re paying $60-70 for a new one. Microsoft’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Xbox wireless controller just dropped to an all-time low of $49 on Amazon (down from $64)</a> and this isn’t just an Xbox accessory anymore. This controller works across Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, Android and iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs and even VR headsets which makes it one of the most compatible gaming controllers available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the 2025 Edition Worth Upgrading To</h2>
<p>The modernized design refines the ergonomics that made Xbox controllers comfortable in the first place with s<strong>culpted surfaces and updated geometry that reduce hand fatigue</strong> during extended gaming sessions. The changes are subtle rather than radical, maintaining the familiar Xbox layout while improving grip points and button placement based on years of user feedback. <strong>Battery life extends up to 40 hours</strong> on a pair of AA batterie, which translates to weeks of gaming for casual players or about a week for heavy users before needing replacements.</p>
<p>The <strong>hybrid D-pad</strong> is an evolution of functionality beyond earlier Xbox controllers: It integrates the precision of an old-school cross-shaped D-pad and the smooth motion of a circular disc, providing you with increased control while playing fighting games, platformers, and menus. Faceted construction gives you tactile feedback so you’ll be able to learn which way you are pressing without glancing down which makes the difference in fast-paced titles where keeping your eyes on the screen and off your thumbs makes all the difference.<strong> Textured grips on the triggers, the bumpers, and the back case enhance control</strong> while you’re handling intense situations where your hands are likely to be sweaty or you are inputting fast movements.</p>



<p>The <strong>Share button is a quality-of-life addition</strong> that simplifies content creation. Instead of memorizing button combinations to capture screenshots or start recording gameplay, you press one dedicated button. The controller communicates with your device to trigger the native capture function, so screenshots save directly to your Xbox, PC, or mobile device’s storage. For streamers or anyone who shares gameplay clips on social media, this one-button approach eliminates fumbling with menus mid-game and reduces the chances of missing the moment you wanted to capture.</p>
<p>Xbox<strong> wireless and Bluetooth dual connectivity</strong> makes this controller fully cross-platform compatible. Xbox Wireless provides the lowest possible latency connectivity to Xbox consoles and Windows PCs along with Xbox Wireless adapter, and Bluetooth takes care of the rest, including smartphones, tablets, Fire TV sticks, and play-capable smart TVs. You can pair the controller to multiple devices and jump between the same without having to re-pair them every time you switch, and this comes in useful should you play your Xbox in the evenings and your PC during break times.</p>



<p>The 3<strong>.5mm headset jack is still compatible</strong> with any wired gaming headset, so you won’t be bothered with the use of USB adapters or wireless dongles whenever you want personal audio. You just plug in your headphones and audio comes through the controller immediately with volume and chat mix controls accessible through your system settings. The dual-role function of the USB-C connector is to not only have direct wired hookups to consoles or computers for zero-lag input and zero-battery concern, but you can also charge replaceable battery packs should you be using the Play and Charge Kit by Microsoft or even third-party alternatives.</p>
<p>Custom button remapping using the Xbox Accessories app allows you to map any button to another action and this is invaluable for accessibility or personal expression. If you don’t like certain button layouts or would like to map controls better suited to the layout of another game, you have the ability to do so without resorting to the in-game options or those that do not exist.</p>
<p>At $49, the controller is l<strong>ess expensive than budget third-party controllers</strong> but provides you with first-party quality and compatibility on a crazy list of hardware.</p>

<p>Build A Beehive’s October 2025 monthly codes can be used to redeem various rewards in the game, with cash being the most sought-after resource. Read on to find out what the latest Build A Beehive active codes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Build A Beehive is a popular simulation-based tycoon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-ink-game-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where the player is in charge of the complete operation of a bee farm. This includes activities like growing plants, attracting and tending to the bees, producing honey, and, in the end, selling the honey that’s been produced for the maximum possible profit. Players begin the game with a tiny plot of land and are tasked with buying some flavors to plant. </p>



<p>These flowers attract different kinds of bees, and maintaining the right balance is of utmost importance. Although simply progressing through the game will give players the resources they need to upgrade both their land as well as their farm, using some Build A Beehive codes to get a small boost will certainly be worth the while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Roblox Build A Beehive is a fairly straightforward process, as the developers do not impose any prerequisite steps on the players.

<p>For players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming these codes:</p>



<ol>

<li>Click the Shop icon on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes into the ‘Codes’ text box.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-playstation-xbox-nintendo-console/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-escape-from-duckov-on-playstation-xbox-or-nintendo-switch-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-console-status-explained.1331578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape From Duckov may sound suspiciously like another game, but it’s very different. It’s why the game has sold like hotcakes, PC players can’t get enough of it, and why its indie status has PlayStation and Xbox owners don’t know if it’s on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>At first glance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Duckov</a> sounds like a novelty rip-off movie from the mid-2000s where everyone was trying to do their own Scary Movie imitation. However, at the core of Escape From Duckov is a very competent extraction shooter with a cute and cuddly theme that bolsters its game world, rather than hindering and overshadowing it.</p>



<p>It rightly takes the bill at launch, and we’re going to duck here so we don’t catch any strays from Escape From Tarkov fans. If you want to know if Escape From Duckov is coming to consoles—specifically PlayStation, Xbox, and PC—let’s take a look at what we know.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-escape-from-duckov-on-ps5-or-ps4">Can You Play Escape From Duckov On PS5 Or PS4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t lose sleep or feathers over this. Credit to Team Soda</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of writing, you can’t play Escape From Duckov on any PlayStation consoles, and this includes the PS4, the PS5, and any of the PlayStation Pro models.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not a matter of consoles being unable to run Escape From Duckov, so you can toss that theory into the pond. Quite simply, Escape From Duckov was coded and developed with PC in mind. First and foremost, it’s a PC title, and it needs to be coded differently for PS4 and PS5 consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-escape-from-duckov-on-xbox-one-or-xbox-series-s-x">Can You Play Escape From Duckov On Xbox One or Xbox Series S|X?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s the same dilemma for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S owners as Escape From Duckov isn’t on any Xbox device, but the possibility of it arriving in the future can’t be ruled out.</strong></p>



<p>If Escape From Duckov is a huge success (which it more than likely will be), it would make complete sense for a console release. This means the extraction shooter flying onto PlayStation, as well as Xbox consoles—maybe on Game Pass?</p>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-escape-from-duckov-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Escape From Duckov On Nintendo Switch Or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo fans are also down bad for Escape From Duckov as the shooter isn’t available on Nintendo Switch or the Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>It’s pretty much a case of rinse and repeat for Escape From Duckov on either Nintendo generation. Team Soda’s extraction shooter is probably testing the waters on PC first, and then all console ports could arrive later down the line.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have the latest news on this as and when it happens.</p>



<p>We’ll have the newest details if Escape From Duckov does get a console port right here. Given that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duckov-sold-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 200,000 copies in 24 Hours</a>, and still continues to smash it, we don’t see why it won’t happen.

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is seemingly shutting down Call of Duty-inspired Battlefield 6 Portal maps.</p>



<p>At least one instance seems to show a map based on the Call of Duty map Shipment. In what appears to be a warning email from EA, the company says that after reviewing the user’s account, it saw content it deemed <strong>“inappropriate”</strong> due to it referencing <strong>“third party products in Battlefield 6.”</strong></p>



<p>When going into <a href="https://x.com/GhostGamingG/status/1980936800303468657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more details</a>, the warning specifically mentions <strong>“Shipment first test”</strong> that had a description of “Shipment 2019 edition”.</p>



<p>The email goes on to say that the user can still play, but any future violations will have restrictions put on the account, such as “temporarily or permanently” removing access to EA games and services.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out directly to EA and Battlefield Studios for comment on whether they’re removing all references to other games in the Battlefield 6 portal or if it’s specific to Call of Duty. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Firearms Expert Reacts To Palworld’s Guns</p>
      </div>
<p>"People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts. We don't believe in it," he said. "We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."</p><p>It's a bold position, to be sure, especially since other big-name publishers like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA are pushing AI on their workers</a> hard. Still, Buckley is aware that the AI floodgates have opened and believes it'll worsen in time.</p><p>"I think over the next two or three years we're going to get into this weird era--and you can see it slowly happening now on Steam--of really low-quality, AI-made games," he said. "It's something that has plagued other stores but Steam had been good at keeping them out. But it's happening. This wave is coming, and I think we're going to enter this kind of authenticity market where people are going to slowly say, 'No, these guys are really trying to make something special' to fight back."</p><p>Pocketpair has been accused of using AI since bursting on the scene in January 2024 with its Pokemon-but-guns game Palworld. Buckley and the rest of the Japanese studio are intimately familiar with AI scrutiny, explaining that instead of fighting the allegations, he hopes Pocketpair's position and overall work ethic prove that the developers aren't down with AI in the slightest.</p><p>"You know, I can't just come out and start fighting with these people [who make the AI accusations] because that just fuels what's going on," he said. "That's when I feel there's nothing more we can do here. I can say 'it's not, we made it' and they can say 'it is, you didn't make it' and what are we going to do? Just go back and forth forever."</p><p>Pocketpair is currently in the middle of a tense lawsuit with Nintendo over Palworld, with the latest in the litigation being that the Pokemon maker believes mods don't constitute "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-argues-game-mods-arent-prior-art-in-palworld-lawsuit/1100-6534882/" data-ref-id="1100-6534882">prior art</a>." This motion essentially invalidates Palworld as a mere copycat of Pokemon, not something wholly original like Pocketpair argues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced that there will be a free update for Pikmin 4, coming in November, and it has released a trailer to confirm what will be present. The main takeaways are a photo mode, Decor Pikmin, and new difficulty levels. In addition, the Pikmin 4 demo will be updated on the same day on the main game’s update release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pikmin 4 – Update Overview – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBtBDFzu9ZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Pikmin 4’s photo mode, you can take pictures anywhere using the Field Camera. This will let you capture moments from the game, and customise those photos with frames and stickers. The world of Pikmin 4 will also see the introduction of Decor Pikmin, which are Pikmin with unique features hiddent around the world. There will be clues present to find them, and when you do you can export them to Pikmin Bloom. Finally, the two new difficulty levels are Relaxed and Fierce. In Relaxed mode, creatures will not attack you unless you attack them first. They will also be easier to defeat compared to normal mode. Lethal mode is for players who want more of a challenge from Pikmin 4, with creatures being more aggressive and harder to take down.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/19/pikmin-4-review/">Pikmin 4 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Pikmin 4 review, Stefan wrote, <em>“There’s a pleasing mixture of the familiar and the new within Pikmin 4. The fresh camera view and tweaks to the gameplay make it feel more accessible, but for returning players, the focus on the Dandori ethos of planning, efficiency and adaptability provides new arenas to test your skills. Oh, and Oatchi’s a real cutie too.”</em></p>

<p>Both versions!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Nintendo followed up on its recently 'Close to You' short with another version that confirmed the presence of <strong>Pikmin</strong>, the company annoyingly kept it locked to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app.</p>
<p>Well, not anymore, because both versions of the film – Pikmin and invisible Pikmin – have been uploaded to YouTube in one 8-minute-long video. Nice!</p>
<p>In case you happened to miss the whole thing, Close to You was uploaded with no warning and depicted a young child happily playing about with objects that seemed to be moving on their own. With some familiar background music, however, many had deduced that this simply <em>must</em> be Pikmin-related in some way.</p>
<p>Turns out it was! The video was uploaded to Nintendo Today!, but updated to show that the moving objects were actually being manipulated by lots and lots of Pikmin.</p>
<p>Many (including us) had hoped that this might be some indication of something more from the Pikmin franchise, but it was subsequently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sorry-nintendos-recent-pikmin-videos-arent-hinting-at-something-more">confirmed to be the first project from Nintendo Pictures</a>, the video production team previously known as Dynamo Pictures. The same company had also produced several Pikmin shorts back in the mid 2010s.</p>
<p>Having said that, Nintendo has just recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> will be receiving a free content update on Switch, adding in new Pikmin designs, a photo mode, and more. Pretty cool, huh? So we guess it wasn't all for show then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft RedLynx, the Finland-based Ubisoft team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/trials-rising/">Trials Rising</a> that also largely operates as a support studio for Ubisoft projects, who recently helped Massive Entertainment bring <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars: Outlaws to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, is expected to layoff 60 developers from its team in Helsinki as the studio shifts to specializing in "<em>small screens</em>."</p>



<p>A statement <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">posted on the Ubisoft RedLynx website</a> sticks to the corporate standard by not calling the cuts 'layoffs' but instead "<em>a restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company's global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company's worldwide studio network.</em>"</p>



<p>The final decision on the layoffs will be made after negotiations with the production and administration teams, who are most impacted by the proposed cuts. The RedLynx developers working on the Snowdrop Engine do not seem to be impacted by these proposed layoffs.</p>



<p>These cuts aren't just part of an effort to cut costs, as they are also part of RedLynx being reshaped from its current multiplatform focus to becoming a studio that specializes in "<em>small screens</em>," which surely means mobile devices, but also probably means the Nintendo Switch 2 and optimizing for PC handhelds, particularly after RedLynx's efforts to bring Star Wars: Outlaws to the Switch 2.</p>



<p>"<em>If implemented, the proposed changes would refocus Ubisoft RedLynx from a multiplatform setup to a studio specialized in small screens,</em>" the statement reads. "<em>This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio's unique expertise, starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading</em>."</p>



<p>RedLynx began its life as an independent studio in 2000, with a focus on smaller mobile and browser titles. Its Trials series is what the studio is known for, and part of what led Ubisoft to acquire the studio in 2011.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gaming-mini-pc-with-ryzen-7-32gb-ddr5-ram-1tb-is-cheaper-than-a-mac-mini-amazon-clears-out-stock-2000638156</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaming-mini-pc-with-ryzen-7-32gb-ddr5-ram-1tb-is-cheaper-than-a-mac-mini-amazon-clears-out-stock.1331521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desktop gaming (usually) means building a tower PC or shelling out premium prices for something capable. The <em>GMKtec K8 Plus</em> flips that equation by packing serious gaming hardware into a mini PC that now costs less than Apple’s base Mac Mini, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4925/">Amazon just dropped it to a record low of $519 (down from $738)</a>. With an AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS processor, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, integrated Radeon 780M graphics, and a 1TB SSD, this pocket-sized system handles AAA gaming at 1080p.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4925/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes This Mini PC Punch Above Its Size</h2>
<p>The AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS processor brings <strong>8 cores and 16 threads with a boost clock up to 5.1GHz</strong> which puts it in the same performance bracket as many full-sized desktop chips. The 16MB L3 cache helps the CPU access frequently used data faster and reduces bottlenecks during gaming and heavy multitasking. What separates the 8845HS from the similar 8745HS model is the <strong>inclusion of an NPU</strong>, a dedicated chip designed to handle AI workloads like Windows Studio Effects, Copilot tasks, and local AI processing without burdening the main CPU cores. If <strong>you’re experimenting with AI tools</strong> or running productivity features that leverage machine learning, this NPU accelerates those tasks considerably.</p>
<p>32GB of 5600MHz DDR5 RAM provides you the breathing room you require to run your games, dozens of tabs open in your browser, Discord, stream software, and your video editor all at the same time without lag. <strong>DDR5 is also higher bandwidth than the older DDR4, so data travels between the CPU and the RAM more quickly</strong>&nbsp;and this provides you better game frame times and better application responsiveness.</p>



<p>Storage arrives through a <strong>1TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD which gives read speeds of 5,000-7,000 MB/s</strong> or so, depending on the drive you choose. This makes a difference when you are loading bigger game files, launching Windows, or transferring footage to where you’ll be editing it. PCIe 4.0 is double the speed of PCIe 3.0, and the ability to upgrade to 8TB makes it so you won’t have to replace the original drive should you decide you want to add another drive.</p>
<p>The AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics is where this system surprises people: Built on the <strong>RDNA3 architecture with 12 compute units and 768 stream processors clocked up to 2,700MHz, it outperforms the previous generation</strong> 680M by a significant margin. This GPU handles demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 at minimum settings around 30-40 fps at 1080p, and less demanding games like FIFA 23 or Fortnite run at medium to high settings with smooth frame rates.</p>



<p>The Oculink interface is something you won’t usually find on retail mini PCs: Oculink gives you a high-bandwidth external GPU connection so <strong>you can attach a full desktop graphics card</strong> in an external enclosure should you, someday, desire increased gaming muscle. It carries exponentially higher bandwidth than Thunderbolt or USB4 where external GPUs are connected, and gives you much less loss of performance and providing you with a real upgrade path without having to replace the whole system.</p>
<p>What’s more,<strong> two USB4 ports at 40Gbps each have Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.4</strong>&nbsp;so you can attach fast storage, charge gear, and power displays all out of the same port. HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 outputs have 60Hz 8K resolution support, and the system can power four displays at 4K resolution. For multi-monitor productivity configurations or creative applications where you want the extra desktop real estate, this connectivity makes the K8 Plus into a real workstation.</p>
<p>Dual i226V 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports support the speedy and rock-solid wired connections of 2.5 gigabit Ethernet, which makes a difference for big file transfers or reducing latency in internet gaming.</p>
<p>At $519, the system costs you less than an entry-level Mac Mini but gives you gaming power Apple’s system lacks and expansion-room flexibility so you’ll have wiggle-room later to upgrade.</p>

<p>The latest video game sales data for the United States (US) has been announced, and Borderlands 4 was the best-selling game in September 2025.</p>



<p>The new data comes from industry firm <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvmuvpws25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, which posted the data ranging from August 31 to October 4.</p>



<p>Following Borderlands 4 for the month was NBA 2K26, which used back-to-back strong months to become <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best-selling game of the year</a> so far. Rounding out the top five for September were EA Sports FC 26, Ghost of Yotei, and Madden NFL 26. That means three of the top five games for the month were sports games. </p>



<p>When looking at the full top 20 for the month, nearly half of the games were new releases. Aside from the aforementioned titles above, Silent Hill f, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, NHL 26, Digimon Story: Time Stranger, and Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 all hit the top 20 for the first time. </p>

                <p>As you can probably assume by the name, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2/" data-ref-id="5000-668231">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> brings players a whole lot of powerwashing fun with a variety of updates over the original game. It sports improved visuals, new washer features, more customization, and a whole lot of cats to pet--making it a good way to kick back and relax, either solo or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/powerwash-simulator-2-crossplay-and-cross-saves-explained/1100-6535497/" data-ref-id="1100-6535497">with friends</a>. So, if you're wondering how long you can spend working your way through this chill cleaning title, we'll fill you in on everything you need to know below.</p><h2>PowerWash Simulator 2 length and job list</h2><p>There are <strong>38 jobs</strong> in PowerWash Simulator 2's base campaign. Solo players should expect it to take around <strong>30-35 hours to complete every job</strong>. Some jobs are short and require only a few minutes, such as the Mobility Scooter or Futuristic Bike. Meanwhile, some larger jobs can take 2-3 hours to clean fully, such as the Motel or Shopping Mall.</p><p>Of course, it's worth noting that the game features co-op--2 players in split-screen and up to 4 players online--which can speed things up dramatically. Working with friends to finish different parts of a job can help you progress much more quickly if you just want to see every job through as fast as possible.</p><p>That being said, if you're ever feeling antsy while undertaking one of the game's larger jobs solo, feel free to hop over and start up another for a change of scenery. New jobs often unlock as you work through existing ones, and you can switch between them without losing your progress.</p><p>Here are all the jobs in PowerWash Simulator 2 in the order you'll unlock them.</p><ul><li>Removals Van</li><li>Public Facility</li><li>Campsite</li><li>Art Deco House</li><li>Dog Car</li><li>Billboard</li><li>Teapot Tea Room</li><li>Shooting Gallery</li><li>Road Sweeper</li><li>Gas Station</li><li>Bandstand</li><li>Mobility Scooter</li><li>Nouveau House</li><li>Airship</li><li>Cement Mixer</li><li>Farm</li><li>Stone Circle</li><li>Rock Climbing Park</li><li>Roller Disco</li><li>Tractor</li><li>Temple Interior</li><li>Car &amp; Trailer</li><li>Theater</li><li>Motel</li><li>Mini Roller Coaster</li><li>Solar System Exhibit</li><li>Streetcar</li><li>Salvage House</li><li>Mining Dump Truck</li><li>Fun House</li><li>Ski Center</li><li>Extra Long Limo</li><li>Shopping Mall</li><li>Futuristic Bike</li><li>Theater Sets</li><li>18 Wheeler</li><li>Town Floats</li><li>Mount Rushless</li></ul><p>As with the first game, this sequel will receive additional jobs via both free and paid DLC in the future. While FuturLab hasn't announced specifics yet, it's safe to assume it will once again be a mix of normal jobs and unique crossovers with popular media franchises.</p><h2>Completionists rejoice: Challenges and secrets</h2><p>Whether you're aiming to earn every trophy or achievement in PowerWash Simulator 2 or you simply want to max out your home base, there's a whole lot for completionists to enjoy here.</p><p>There are tons of customization items to purchase, as well as pieces of furniture you can wash and place around your home base to give it your special touch. Collecting all of this will require you to complete the game and earn enough currency to buy it all.</p><p>Some trophies or achievements ask you to finish cleaning specific objects in a job at a certain time--either before or after cleaning the rest of the mission. For instance, the Shopping Mall asks you to clean a giant owl statue before cleaning anything else, while the Town Floats job expects you to save a large mouse as your final cleaning task.</p><p>Others require doing random things like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/powerwash-simulator-2-gnome-from-home-guide-where-to-find-the-hidden-gnome-in-the-home-base/1100-6535498/" data-ref-id="1100-6535498">finding a hidden gnome in your home base</a>, cleaning an item in a certain way, or even powerwashing an entire job using only one specific nozzle. The latter can be time-consuming if you don't pick a quick job, so we'd recommend the Mobility Scooter to knock those out.</p><p>PowerWash Simulator 2 is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

                <p>Alan Wake developer Remedy Entertainment has confirmed that CEO Tero Virtala has stepped down, effective immediately. The announcement came just days after Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=49a7f7db-a1c3-400f-948b-f25b3b7426f8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> that the studio's latest release, FBC: Firebreak, had "weak" sales and that the company would incur a profit hit.</p><p>Virtala was Remedy's CEO since 2016. A search is now underway for a new CEO, Remedy said, and for the time bing, Virtala will "continue at the service of the company" as part of the handover process.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Remedy co-founder Markus Mäki is taking over as interim CEO. He is vacating his position as chairman of the board and will be replaced in that position by Henri Österlund.</p><p>"I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future," Mäki said.</p><p>Earlier in October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-had-weak-sales-despite-turnaround-says-remedy/1100-6535396/" data-ref-id="1100-6535396">Remedy said FBC: Firebreak had "weak" sales</a>, and as a result, the company was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-had-weak-sales-despite-turnaround-says-remedy/1100-6535396/" data-ref-id="1100-6535396">booking a loss of $17 million.</a> Remedy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-launch-wasnt-what-studio-hoped-for-but-remedy-isnt-giving-up/1100-6532823/" data-ref-id="1100-6532823">undertook efforts to help FBC: Firebreak attract and retain more players</a>, but those efforts do not seem to have worked out like Remedy envisioned.</p><p>The game peaked at 1,992 players on Steam following its release in June but has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">just 10 players on Steam today.</a> This represents just a piece of the game's total possible audience, as it's also available on Epic Games Store, along with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. On console platforms, FBC: Firebreak is part of PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>Remedy has a number of upcoming games in the works, including Control 2 and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2 in partnership with Rockstar Games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield Is Going Through An Identity Crisis</p>

<p>"I think it’s a good game," Nesmith said. "I don’t think it’s in the same calibre as the other two, you know, Fallout or Skyrim, or Elder Scrolls rather, but I think it’s a good game." Nesmith added that he remains proud of the work that he and his former colleagues contributed to the game.</p><p>In fact, if another studio had released Starfield, "it would have been received differently," Nesmith argued. The designer said that Starfield failed to meet expectations set by being a space game from the makers of Skyrim and Fallout.</p><p>Possibly contributing to a comparatively muted response to Starfield was the game's procedural generation, Nesmith theorized.</p><p>"I’m an enormous space fan, I’m an amateur astronomer, I’m up on all that stuff, a lot of the work I did on Starfield was on the astronomical data," Nesmith said. "... but space is inherently boring. It’s literally described as nothingness. So moving throughout that isn’t where the excitement is, in my opinion."</p><p>To Nesmith, procedural generation made the planets feel very "samey" and less exciting, which is "where it falls apart." Nesmith also lamented the lack of enemy variety, saying that regular humans were the only serious enemies despite the presence of "cool alien creatures."</p><p>There's weight to Nesmith's comments given his resume--the designer was at Bethesda since 2004 before his departure, and after significant contributions to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3, he served as the lead designer for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. These days, he's working on the fantasy literary RPG series Glory Seeker.</p><p>While some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-fans-losing-hope-after-space-adventure-absent-from-xbox-showcase/1100-6532288/" data-ref-id="1100-6532288">fans lost hope for Starfield's future</a>, Bethesda did confirm that the NASA-core RPG will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-getting-a-second-story-dlc-and-more/1100-6534318/" data-ref-id="1100-6534318">receive additional story DLC</a>.

            <p>
Microsoft has announced the next batch of games coming to its Xbox Game Pass subscription this month.
</p>
<p>
It includes the brand-new Outer Worlds 2, which is launching on Game Pass, as well as the squeaky clean sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a>!
</p>
<p>
This comes in the wake of a price hike for the subscription service, which has led to the Game Pass Ultimate tier becoming more expensive in the US and UK.

<p>Decor Pikmin! Photo Mode!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Well, we weren't expecting this!</p>
<p>Nintendo has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> is receiving a free update next month, adding in adorably unique 'Decor Pikmin' for your squad, a photo mode, and new modes adjusting the overall aggression of in-game creatures.</p>
<p>There's no firm release date just yet, but Nintendo has also confirmed that an updated demo will also be released on the same day.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Decor Pikmin</strong>: Originally seen in the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id%3Dsmartlink%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.pikminbloom.com%252F%26esheet%3D54343309%26newsitemid%3D20251022648787%26lan%3Den-US%26anchor%3DPikmin%2BBloom%26index%3D4%26md5%3D74e57c1af2194e027495504ed7860345&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1761225063211000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1yLvAAUb9qdTg_c-UvNF35" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pikminbloom.com%2F&amp;esheet=54343309&amp;newsitemid=20251022648787&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Pikmin+Bloom&amp;index=4&amp;md5=74e57c1af2194e027495504ed7860345" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><em>Pikmin Bloom</em></a><sup>1</sup> smart-device app, these curious Pikmin are marching their way to <em>Pikmin 4</em>. Decor Pikmin (like the name implies) are Pikmin that don some form of decoration found in the world – you may see them wearing something like a wind-up toy, a doughnut, a snow hat and much more. Decor Pikmin you gather in the new <em>Pikmin 4</em> update can also be transferred to your squad in <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, including some that are completely new!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>- Field Camera</strong>: Take stylish photos of your character, your squad and whatever you like with this new feature. Set the scene with various angles, hide characters, and decorate your pics with filters, frames and stamps. The camera may even be the key to adding Decor Pikmin to your crew …</p>
<p><strong>- New Creature Activity Levels</strong>: Move at your own pace and enjoy the new Relaxed mode, where creatures won’t attack unless you attack them, or kick things up a notch in the fiery Fierce mode. These modes can be selected when starting a new game or changed at any point after from the game’s settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also been announced that Pikmin Bloom will receive a new update to add in Ice Pikmin, marking the variant's first ever appearance in the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aMlv5rEu2I">A new trailer</a> has also been uploaded to mark this announcment.</p>
<p>We wondered if perhaps the recent 'Close to You' Pikmin videos would perhaps lead to something more, and it sure did! Okay, it's not quite the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' we'd love to see, but hey, we'll take it.</p>

<p>Hello Games is back with yet another update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a>, and this one feels suitably spooky — 'tis the season, after all.</p>
<p>The big addition in today's 'Breach' update is a series of space wrecks that pop up across the universe, all of which are fully explorable. Using the newly added space walking abilities, you'll be able to dive into these wrecks and salvage parts for your ship, which, let's not forget, can now be customised thanks to the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-lets-you-design-and-build-your-own-spaceship">'Voyagers' update</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a new expedition launching alongside this update, which will have you playing space Sherlock to work out what happened to a mysterious wreck. This mission will lead you to the edge of space, to rare purple-star solar systems, to... more ship parts, probably.</p>
<p>For a taster of what you can expect, here are some screenshots from Hello Games:</p>

<p>It sounds like another solid addition to an already jam-packed game, and a prime jumping-in point for those who haven't checked out the Switch 2 version yet — which we described as "an almost perfect port of an almighty behemoth of a game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spooky-gamecube-classic-luigis-mansion-hits-nintendo-switch-online-this-month.1331461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the latest GameCube game to join the Nintendo Switch Online library, and just in time for Halloween, it's spooky horror classic&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion</em>'s turn in the spotlight.</p>

<p>Alright, so perhaps&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>isn't the scariest game in the GameCube's lineup; that honor arguably goes to Silicon Knights' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/horror-gaming-obscura-eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem" rel="nofollow">excellent&nbsp;<em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</em></a>, which remains unavailable on Switch Online for some baffling reason.</p>

<p>Still, if you want a survival horror-tinged game the whole family can gather around the Switch 2 to play, then&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>is a very solid choice. It's landing on Switch Online on October 30th, although you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">going to need a Switch 2</a> to play it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-luigis-mansion-gameplay.jpg?itok=T-dUiGLF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-luigis-mansion-gameplay.jpg?itok=BdmOz_4b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Nintendo Switch Online. Hooray!</figcaption></figure><p>This is the original&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>release, rather than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2018-luigis-mansion-remake" rel="nofollow">Nintendo 3DS remake</a> that launched back in 2018. Like pretty much all games that originated on the 3DS, that remake isn't playable on modern hardware (through conventional methods, at least).</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion</em>, it's essentially a sort of Nintendo-ified take on the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>formula. Luigi has inherited a mansion in a competition he doesn't remember entering, and he must explore said mansion in order to uncover its mysteries and find out what's happened to his brother Mario.</p>

<p>To do so, he'll have to battle ghosts using his iconic Poltergust 3000, a vacuum cleaner that's been specially tuned to hoover up spirits (although it'll also deal with various other items in Luigi's environment).</p>

<p><em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>also features a somewhat similar structure to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, with Luigi hunting for keys around the mansion and periodically battling boss ghosts to progress through the game's story.</p>




<p>This re-release means that all three&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>games are now available to play on Switch or Switch 2 hardware; a remake of sequel&nbsp;<em>Dark Moon</em>&nbsp;is available now on Switch, as is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/luigis-mansion-3" rel="nofollow">third mainline entry in the series</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>via Switch Online starting from October 30th, but you'll need a subscription and the Expansion Pack addon to do so.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-with-immediate-effect.1331458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy CEO Tero Virtala is to step down with immediate effect, and the&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Control&nbsp;</i>studio hasn't found itself a permanent replacement for him yet.</p>

<p>That's according to a <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=49a7f7db-a1c3-400f-948b-f25b3b7426f8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official Remedy website, in which the studio reveals that Virtala will be stepping down and that his interim replacement will be&nbsp;Markus Mäki, who previously served as Remedy's Chairman of the Board.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;Mäki will be vacating that role in order to serve as interim CEO. He'll be replaced as Chairman by&nbsp;Henri Österlund, who's served on Remedy's board for eight years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-control.jpg?itok=IQyx8ZZL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-control.jpg?itok=7iChKOL1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tero Virtala, CEO of&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>studio Remedy, is stepping down.</figcaption></figure><p>Remedy says it's initiating its search for a new CEO "immediately", and that Virtala will remain in his position in order to assist with handover once a permanent replacement is found.</p>

<p>No reason for Virtala's departure was given, but it's been a rough year or two for Remedy, to say the least. Back in August, the studio admitted that sales of its latest release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">multiplayer shooter</a>&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" rel="nofollow">had been unsatisfying</a>.</p>

<p>A major update for the game, Breakpoint, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update" rel="nofollow">released back in September</a>, and while it briefly injected a little life back into&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, it hasn't been enough to sustain player interest, if <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#3m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB's numbers</a> are anything to go by.</p>

<p>It hasn't all been dire for Virtala and Remedy over the last twelve months or so, though; back in February, Remedy announced that survival horror title&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">was finally profitable</a>, having hit the two million sales mark around that time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-ceo-steps-down.jpg?itok=didfl9OL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-ceo-steps-down.jpg?itok=gaDT1WZv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>proved profitable for Remedy, but it seems&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has not.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Remedy's future, the company is currently working on a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">alongside publisher Annapurna</a>, and remakes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy" rel="nofollow">first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>series</a> are also on the way.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Virtala stepping down will affect Remedy's future plans in any way, but I'd imagine the studio will think twice before greenlighting a project like&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>again. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-metroid-prime-art-book-offers-rare-insight-into-nintendo%E2%80%99s-design-process.1331455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Metroid Prime 1–3: A Visual Retrospective </em>is a fabulous resource for learning more than I ever thought I’d be privy to about Nintendo and Retro Studios’ ambitious first-person adventure series. The 210-page hardcover book launches on October 28th, weeks before the series makes its long-awaited return with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777056/metroid-prime-4-release-date-nintend-direct-september-2025">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a></em> on the Switch and Switch 2. It’s the perfect $50 gift for someone who’s pored over video essays about the trilogy’s design, and who’s always wanted to get a behind-the-scenes look at how the games were made. There’s a 35-page free sample available through <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fmetroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective-artbook-arrives-on-oct-28%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo</a> if you want a hi-res taste.</p><p>Most of the book consists of detailed concept art of environments, common enemies, bosses, and Samus Aran herself. It’s awesome to see it all, including assets that didn’t end up making the cut in the games, preserved in this book. The book goes from game to game, from the GameCube to the Wii, ending with a brief dive into <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> on the Nintendo Switch, a remake that apparently took about four years to make. As for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, it’s not mentioned — a whole new book might be necessary to detail that title’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">tumultuous development</a> alone.</p><p>My favorite part is the many notes in the margins from series producer Kensuke Tanabe, a veteran Nintendo designer with credits dating back to <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>. These producer notes are made possible in part by Nintendo’s and Retro’s apparent knack for detailed note-taking; candid design-related squabbles and struggles made over 20 years ago are recalled with decisive clarity. It’s entertaining when Tanabe notes that he and Nintendo sometimes pulled rank to ensure that <em>Metroid Prime </em>possessed certain qualities. “[...] the game we’re making now is a Nintendo game, and this is Retro’s first time working on one. I’ve been working on Nintendo games my entire career, so I believe I have the most experience in making Nintendo games. So please trust me first.”</p><p>He also frequently heaps praise on the team at Retro, like when it convinced Nintendo that morph ball half-pipes were a good idea, for example. “Initially, Nintendo was skeptical,” said Tanabe. “However, Retro responded ‘Please try it out first before deciding,’ and submitted a prototype. I vividly remember that when we finally tested it, it turned out to be incredibly satisfying and engaging.” By the end of the book, it’s clear that Retro left a huge mark on each of the games.</p><p>Some seldom-discussed aspects of the series — and of Nintendo’s game development process in general — are shared in these producer quotes. Tanabe speaks to Retro’s burnout following the launch of <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em>, saying that the team expressed interest in making a <em>Donkey Kong</em> game to boost morale “after having to work on two consecutive games within the same IP under tight schedules and without much of a break.” (That ended up happening in 2010 with <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>, after <em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.</em>)</p><p>Tanabe also speaks to lackluster sales of <em>Metroid Prime 2</em>, which had motivated Retro to propose a sequel that appealed to a wider audience. However, Nintendo vetoed its proposals because they were built on existing game mechanics (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metroid-prime-producer-reveals-axed-open-world-game-plans/">an interview</a> from an ex-Retro Studios employee mentions an open-world design), instead opting to take advantage of the Wii’s motion controls and lean further into the lingering threat of Dark Samus.</p><p>This retrospective is a stunning tome to have on a shelf, with a red embossed outline of Samus Aran. But the real treasures are inside of its stitched covers, in terms of both the art and official commentary detailing Nintendo’s secretive game development process. It’s easy to see how book publisher Piggyback’s format could work with any of Nintendo’s franchises (especially since the company has retained some of its key designers for decades). But for now, I’m just happy that this one exists.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/803399/metroid-prime-visual-retrospective-art-book-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-the-kotaku-review.1331449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Earlier this year, I was interviewing the creators of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-balls-monster-catchin-musical-professor-oak-2000617768"><i><span>BALLS: The Monster-Catchin’ Musical Comédy</span></i></a><span> about the parody show’s spoofing of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. We talked about how, in the ‘90s, Game Freak probably wasn’t designing the world of its monster-taming RPGs to be interrogated, or expecting the core concept of capturing magical monsters in balls to become the source of a heated moral quandary. Established norms like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-starters-chikorita-tepig-totodile-2000637637"><span>dumping your unused Pokémon in a PC box</span></a><span> were probably not meant to make a kid think about the existential dread their seventh-favorite monster might experience in captivity, where they had to put it because they could only hold six Poké Balls on their belt at a time. The </span><i><span>BALLS</span></i><span> writers, however, extrapolated this rote procedure into a scene in which its legally distinct “Collectabuddies” are going mad from being stranded in storage for so long. It’s a dark, disturbing fate that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>hasn’t explored, and in the decades since </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, the dissonance between </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s need to maintain an upbeat depiction of its world’s monster-catching status quo and its exploration of a world in which Pokémon and humanity co-exist peacefully as equals has only become louder and harder to ignore, especially as stories like </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>have put these dynamics under a microscope.</span></p> <p><span>Enter </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, a sequel to the 3DS games </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, set entirely in the Paris-inspired metropolis of Lumiose City. After the near-apocalyptic events that occurred the last time we were in the Kalos region, the people of Lumiose are undergoing an urban redevelopment plan to make it an accommodating home for both humans and wild Pokémon. This ranges from the cutest Pikachu to the most dangerous dragon, like Salamence. Certain areas of the city are designated “Wild Zones” where these untamed monsters live, and humans are free to explore them and battle the wildlife, or catch them, add them to their party, and have them take part in battles in the local competitive scene. That…doesn’t sound like the sort of equal co-existence Lumiose is touting. If the relationship between humans and Pokémon has only changed in terms of proximity, what is their shared city aspiring to that is actually moving the needle of progress?</span></p>

 <p><span>Interestingly enough, </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>seems unsatisfied with its own answer. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series has been gesturing at this issue for over a decade, with </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>(</span><a href="https://jakesteinberg.substack.com/p/pokemon-black-and-white-is-a-reddit"><span>ineloquently</span></a><span>) introducing a villainous team whose entire goal was to free these creatures from their spherical prisons, only to dial that all back by the end. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-detective-pikachu-returns-live-action-movie-1850907630"><span>live-action film</span></a><span> take place in Ryme City, a place where Pokémon battling is outlawed, and there, these critters have day jobs like any other human. As a result, that subseries still offers the most revolutionary vision of a world where man and ‘mon walk side by side.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>, the core verbs are still “catch” and “battle,” and the game has more questions than answers about what the dynamic between the human and Pokémon citizens of its new city even looks like. Lumiose’s redevelopment feels like a half-step toward a new ideal, but the game’s sense of hope for a brighter future in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world primarily manifests elsewhere, both in the story it tells and in the new ways it illustrates the bond between Pokémon and trainer when you’re in the thick of battle. Like most things it has going for it, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s vision of the Pokémon universe is experimental, testing the waters for a future it’s not quite ready to boldly walk into, held back by expectations of what it’s supposed to be. But what’s here still manages to solidify the </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>subseries as the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games to watch, ones that appeal to the diehard lore enthusiasts, the casuals who are tired of repeating the same format, and the ones who have felt burned by the technical fumbles of recent years.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637722"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637722">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Welcome back to Lumiose City</b></h2> <p><span>When I first began my vacation to Lumiose City, I was greeted by Taunie, a sprightly leader of Team MZ, a group of youngsters operating out of a mostly unremarkable hotel to handle a much more remarkable problem. As the city is undergoing its redevelopment, some of the wild Pokémon who are migrating to the Wild Zones are undergoing a painful, forced Mega Evolution in the city streets. These usually temporary transformations are supposed to be activated by a trainer, but the wild Pokémon are undergoing Mega Evolution against their will and need to be pacified so they can return to their original state, as I’m told, these Rogue Mega Evolutions threaten the stability of the entire redevelopment plan.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The existence of that supposed stability, however, is debatable. As I weave through the scaffolding of unfinished construction work, hop across the rooftops, and insert myself into the citizens’ business with my Raichu by my side, almost all I hear from residents is dissatisfaction with the entire project. People love their partner Pokémon, but they’re unsure if Lumiose’s redevelopment plan is as righteous as it sounds on paper. Some folks are concerned about what happens if a powerful Pokémon gets out of the Wild Zones, and others find all the construction and noise of the late-night Z-A Royale tournament battles in the street an annoying distraction in their already hectic city life. Still others claim that sequestering these monsters into their own designated spaces isn’t actually solving anything. But no one seems to agree on how to truly integrate Pokémon and humanity.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In its own way, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> underlines how the more you think about it, the more it becomes clear that this entire world is kind of fundamentally broken. Pokémon are friends, but they are dangerous. Humans want to co-exist with them as equals, but still get to capture them in Poké Balls. I don’t think this is some pretentious CinemaSins “gotcha” moment; I think it’s a sign of a world that has, as time has gone on, started to reckon with itself, but is still struggling to find the happy medium between the central monster-catching premise people know and love and the monster-loving world it wants to depict. I would have been floored if </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>had completely upended everything the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise has ever been, but I think I find its honest admission that it doesn’t know what the answer is to be just as compelling. Yeah, you can point to all the external factors of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> being a worldwide phenomenon of multimedia, merchandising, and moneymaking as the reason that nothing truly revolutionary comes out of Lumiose City, but given that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>will continue long after </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i></a><span>, I think I like the idea of watching a world slowly inching toward a new historical era. Progress is often slow, and maybe I’m intrigued by watching the series grapple with questions about how to move forward, rather than finding an easy answer and solving the universe’s problems in 30 hours.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637724"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637724">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It might not be quite as idyllic as its leaders want it to be, but Lumiose houses one of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s most memorable casts, full of characters who have a vested interest in helping it get there. Game Freak has always excelled at creating memorable trainers, but the series is typically so transient that most of the characters you meet only get a bit of time to shine before you head to the next town. </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> is set entirely in Lumiose, however, so as I work my way up the ranks of the Z-A Royale and save Rogue Mega Pokémon, I’m meeting what feels like a real assortment of unlikely friends bonded by proximity and a sense of home. Lumiose is still reeling from the events of </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, and after a near-cataclysmic event, you’d think most people would be looking to put some distance between themselves and the Prism Tower at the city’s center. And to be fair, several of them have. While there are a few returning characters from previous games, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s cast</span> <span>is mostly made up of fresh faces, with a lot of the old Kalos region staples having moved on and just being referenced with a wink in passing dialogue. Those who are still here from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>are usually a somber echo of who they once were, lingering because they have nowhere else to go. The people who are left cleaning up the wreckage do so because this city is their home, and they’ll stand by it even as dubious corporate interests flock to it.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I’m just a sentimental fool who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791"><span>only recently moved to a big city</span></a><span>, but seeing </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s cast of proud Lumiose residents come together to protect their city and its population hit me like a truck. One endgame sequence resonated with me so deeply, I just put my Joy-Cons down and stared at the ceiling, realizing that living in New York City for almost three years elicits a similar feeling of unity and camaraderie with my people here. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has always been about the power of friendship, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>but those bonds are also the foundation of community</span></a><span>, and </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s cast is one of the series’ best examples of it. Seeing folks in different industries, with different Pokémon training skills, and from different walks of life come together in service of the people is pretty inspiring, even when the individual stepping up is someone whose Pokémon’s attacks I’d been on the wrong side of hours prior. Lumiose and its citizens are still figuring things out, but when I see people like Corbeau, the pseudo mob boss of the city, working alongside local celebrities like the streamer Canari, in service of a place and of people they’ve grown to care for, I can’t help but believe they might find a way to make the city the best version of itself eventually.</span></p> <p><span>There’s been much debate about the size of Lumiose City </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>as an open-world video game space</span></a><span>, but I really don’t mind a walkable city that doesn’t require me to hop on a Pokémon steed to get from one side to the other. I’ve never been a player who finds the act of getting to a destination as interesting as whatever it is I’m actually going there to do, and </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> has plenty to do between filling up your Pokédex with monsters in the Wild Zones, battling in the Z-A Royale, doing (sometimes menial) side quests, dressing up and taking cute pics with your Pokémon, and eavesdropping on some of the </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-secret-npc-dialogue-sinister/"><span>batshit things</span></a><span> citizens have to say. It’s a small map, sure, and as they often do, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans and haters alike are combing through it and noting the lack of environmental details. Windows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trees-have-become-the-pokemon-fandoms-ultimate-brain-wo-1847541501"><span>are the new trees</span></a><span>, as these fixtures appear to be a texture plastered on the sides of buildings rather than actually rendered. Maybe it was helpful that I played the game on Switch 2 and had a smooth ride, but this is the first time I’ve played a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game since the jump to 3D that didn’t make me grimace at moments of ugliness. Yeah, it’s not going to win any awards for its graphics, and there are </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hessianlobo.bsky.social/post/3m3pp3pwfdc2e"><span>plenty of bugs that people will clip</span></a><span>, but it’s a far cry from the technical and visual mess of </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, and when it wants to flex, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s more visually striking moments really pop on Switch 2.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite my smooth ride, I’m seeing players talk about what sounds like a completely different game than I’ve experienced. To some, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> is a technical mess on the same scale that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> were at their horrendous 2022 launch</span></a><span>, and yet, I’ve experienced almost none of the issues they’re reporting. Even with </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, my playthrough wasn’t buggy; it was just ugly and ran like shit. Video game bugs are a dice roll, as they’re often born of very specific scenarios that a developer might not see in testing, and if neither I nor a QA worker saw it, that doesn’t mean it’s not happening to someone else. But if I’m evaluating </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>based on my own experience playing it on Switch 2, all I can tell you is that I have no technical complaints. In fact, it ran so smoothly on the device that it was actually jarring after having spent over 160 hours enduring </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s jank.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000637726" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637726"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637726">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Get in the ring, trainer</b></h2> <p><span>That buttery smooth performance allowed me to get the most out of </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s new real-time battle system. While Lumiose is struggling to come up with a more groundbreaking solution to its city infrastructure, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system is one of the most inspired changes Game Freak has ever put onto a cartridge. Rather than the turn-based battles fans know from previous games, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> has you issuing commands to your Pokémon in real-time, cycling through cooldowns, focusing on positioning, and making quick, reflex-based plays on top of all the usual strategic elemental strategizing. As you tell your Pokémon what attacks to use, you’re also running around the battlefield alongside them. In a way, the co-existence </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> aspires to is best encapsulated in putting trainers in the thick of the scrap, and I loved how cooperative it felt to dodge and reposition as I quickly thought on my feet about what moves to use.</span></p>

 <p><span>This shift fundamentally changes the way you have to think about your Pokémon’s movesets and how they interact with others on the field. For example, I taught my Raichu attacks that would allow him to move throughout the battlefield at a quick pace. If an enemy got too close, I’d have him use Volt Switch, which would shock an opponent and allow him to quickly teleport to my side. I usually kept my distance from other trainers’ Pokémon, so this was a guaranteed escape for him if he got overwhelmed by an enemy. If I needed him to close the distance, I’d have him use Play Rough and slap enemies around, then use Volt Switch again to return to safety, then throw a long-range Thunderbolt at a foe for good measure. I created builds that were about more than just type coverage, but instead formed archetypes like Raichu’s “hit-and-run” attacker or my “keep away” Starmie, whose entire moveset kept it at a distance to accommodate its slow movement. The result is that fights are frantic, exhilarating, and sometimes over much sooner than I’d like them to be.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"We built this city on Mega Rocks and Roll."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Game Freak</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Monster-taming RPG with a new, real-time battle system.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Battle system is a challenging and rewarding spin on an old formula, memorable cast, compelling follow-up on the fallout from X and Y.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Focus on Mega Evolution makes party choices more restrictive, not all Mega designs are made equal, Lumiose is a more compelling stage for thematic exploration than a video game map for literal exploration.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>October 16, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~30 hours to hit credits</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Where the system really shines is in the Rogue Mega Evolution fights, which are longer battles against one large, superpowered Mega Evolved Pokémon that usually requires multiple trainers to take down. These guys will often focus fire on you, so you’re constantly on the move, dodging powerful attacks while also trying to give orders to your Pokémon so they can dish out damage. That’s hard for most Pokémon, though, as Rogues have heightened defenses that are only easily broken by other Mega-evolved Pokémon. Unlike in </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, Mega Evolution is not a one-and-done mechanic you can only use once per battle. Instead, </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>makes Mega Evolution a gauge you fill up and deplete multiple times throughout a fight, allowing you to transform multiple Pokémon into these beefed-up forms in one battle.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Because of this, </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>encourages you to have multiple Mega Evolution-capable Pokémon in your team. The game has almost every Mega Evolution in its roster, with a few notable exceptions like legendary Pokémon Mewtwo and Rayquaza. With </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s addition of another couple dozen new forms, there are around 70 available to you throughout the game, but that does mean that a lot of the Pokémon end up either fairly useless or at least suboptimal in major boss fights. Non-Mega Pokémon are given the ability to use the Mega gauge to power up their moves to try and break through the ceiling, but it’s a far more limited resource compared to transforming one of your other monsters into a powerful version of themselves to make every attack they use stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>My party ended up being five Mega Evolution Pokémon and my Raichu, who, yes, will get to join their ranks in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, but when I went several story battles without using him, it felt like my choices were more restricted than in previous games. There are a lot of Pokémon in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> who can’t pull off these transformations, and it means they all inherently fall behind. I appreciate how these mechanics gel in some truly spectacular fights, but it does come at the cost of some of that freedom to define your party. Unless you like banging your head against a hard wall until it breaks.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000637725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637725"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637725">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This focus on Mega Evolution also sticks in my craw when, frankly, a lot of the new Mega forms are duds. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>Mega Starmie’s human-like arms and legs</span></a><span> are an abomination, even though its quick movement does make up for Starmie’s biggest weakness. Mega Feraligatr’s toilet-seat-like helmet only looks interesting when it’s closed. And who even asked for a Mega Eelektross? There are some bangers, though. Hawlucha’s upgraded luchadore outfit makes him look like a real pro wrestler, Dragonite’s head wings help bridge the gap between it and its gorgeous pre-evolutions, and Falinks making all of its interlocked bodies into a sword-and-shield-wielding soldier is such a cool riff on its concept. Looking back at the original Megas from Generation VI, their designs were also filled with peaks and valleys, but maybe it’s </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s lopsided focus on the goofiest transformations Game Freak could think of that has me feeling colder. Hopefully, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s additions help diversify the roster. Mega Raichu X and Y are already a pretty promising start.</span></p> <p><span>I can’t talk about the battling without also diving into the Z-A Royale, the game’s substitute for the usual gym leader run in most games. This tournament has competitors fighting over a lettered ranking to determine the top-standing trainers in Lumiose. You start at Z and make your way to A at the top. Each ranking jump requires you to earn enough points by battling randos in the Battle Zones that pop up every night, then face a more powerful trainer who holds a letter ranking higher than you. Battle Zones are limited-time pop-ups that will disappear when the sun rises, so it’s an exciting challenge to have to accumulate enough points each night in hopes that you won’t have to come back tomorrow to make up the difference.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> helps you earn more points by pulling off specific challenges, such as using particular elemental attacks, ambushing enemies through stealth, or defeating foes with Mega Evolved Pokémon. I love taking part in these races against time that require me to use my whole team, rather than just one or two aces, and the progression system is immensely satisfying…at first. One of the most deflating moments in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> is when, for plot reasons, you skip several Z-A Royale rankings to jump right to rank F. This is because </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>only has five more major characters for you to face, and when all of these trainers are lined up next to each other for you to count, you realize there are about as many of them as there are gym leaders in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game. For all the posturing of its new ideas, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> can’t help but fall back on old reliables, and it’s a real bummer when you realize the entire progression system is mostly a facade.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637723"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637723">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>We’re now two </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>games in, and it’s not entirely clear what it means for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game to be part of this subseries. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>was set in the past and maintained turn-based battles, but had a fluid, action-based capture and traversal system. </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>moves the timeline forward and has much more restricted traversal, but also an excellent real-time battle system, unlike anything the series has done before. Perhaps the </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>moniker just ends up being a name that differentiates these games from the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games everyone expects. They’re experimental, show us new sides of places we’ve already been to before, and dive deep into the world in a way the usual Pokémon League run doesn’t typically allow. </span></p> <p><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>is a game of trying new things and hoping for the best. Not everyone agrees on what the best course of action is, but nevertheless, Lumiose City has to move forward and carve out a future for itself, much like the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise has been trying to do in recent years. It has started abandoning long-held traditions, both in the games and elsewhere, in the hopes that it can be something greater than </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-van-gogh-go-remote-raids-1851128900"><span>the corporate machine has forced it to be for so long</span></a><span>. Maybe not every change is going to work for everyone, and it will take time for a series that was stuck in its ways for so long to find its footing. But at least the people of Lumiose are trying, and so is Game Freak.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/charge-3-devices-at-once-with-this-anker-wall-charger-now-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon.1331446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modern homes never seem to have enough outlets and dragging around multiple chargers for your laptop, phone, and tablet turns every trip into a cable management nightmare. The Anker 735 charger solves this frustration by <strong>consolidating everything into a single 65-watt, three-port wall charger</strong> that’s compact enough to toss in your bag without thinking twice.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/">just dropped it to an all-time low of $25 (down from $39)</a>, and at this price, you can finally retire that collection of mismatched charging bricks cluttering your nightstand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Three Ports and 65 Watts Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The 65-watt output makes the difference because it’s the optimal level for powering current laptops full-speed. A MacBook Pro 13-inch takes just 61 watts for best-possible charging speed and this charger provides it with headroom to go around when you’re only using a single outlet. Most cell phone chargers only go 20 watts and lower-end multi-port chargers frequently only go 30-45 total watts which makes you decide between <strong>charging your laptop fast and powering other devices.</strong></p>
<p>When you plug three devices at once, the <strong>power distribution system of the charger automatically distributes wattage intelligently</strong> according to the requirement of each device. Plug in your laptop, smartphone, and tablet, and the charger automatically varies the output of each port, favoring the device capable of accepting the highest power but still making the rest charge at decent rates.</p>



<p>Addition of PPS support is just one of the technical features that significantly boosts charging efficiency and compatibility. PPS enables the charger to exchange information directly with your device and make real-time adjustments to voltage as opposed to fixed voltage steps. This translates into fewer heat emissions, higher charging speeds and better long-term battery life. Devices such as Galaxy smartphones and the latest iPhones fully benefit from PPS to reach their claimed fast-charging speeds, and you would be limited to lower charging rates even with the higher-wattage charger without it.</p>
<p>GaN II technology is what allows this <strong>charger to pack 65 watts into a package roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case</strong>. Traditional silicon-based chargers require much larger components to handle high wattage without overheating. Gallium nitride operates at higher frequencies and temperatures with better efficiency, meaning the components can be smaller and packed more densely without thermal issues. The second generation of GaN technology in this charger improves upon the original by increasing operating frequency by 100%.</p>



<p>The three-port configuration <strong>includes two USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong> and covers both newer and legacy devices. Most modern laptops, tablets, and phones use USB-C, but plenty of accessories like wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and older devices still rely on USB-A. Having that USB-A port available means you don’t need to carry adapters or separate chargers for those holdout devices that haven’t made the USB-C transition yet.</p>
<p>At $25, this charger is cheaper than purchasing two standard phone chargers individually, but it replaces your laptop charger, phone charger, and tablet charger with the same device.</p>
