		<p>Yacht Club Games has announced that it is delaying Mina The Hollower, with the developer stating that the game will not be ready to release by October 31st. The delay is not expected to be too long, but Yacht Club Games is not going to commit to a new release date until it has been submitted to platforms and gone through all the necessary steps.</p>

<p>In a statement, Yacht Club Games wrote,<em>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine. With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</em></p>
<p><em>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line. The game is&nbsp;so&nbsp;close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Finalizing design, art, and sound</em></li>
<li><em>Overall game balancing</em></li>
<li><em>Implementing localization</em></li>
<li><em>Eating cheese</em></li>
<li><em>Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thank you for your understanding and patience.”</em></p>

<p>Mina The Hollower was announced three years ago and is an action adventure game that has used the Game Boy 8 bit aesthetic as inspiration. Mina is a mouse, a whip-wielding inventor that uses this signature weapon for attacking enemies, and to whip walls and items in the world to destroy and manipulate them. The game is expected to release for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, XS, Xbox One, Switch and Switch 2.</p>

With the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-missions-and-rewards-october-2025-dk-bananza-dlc-mario-galaxy-mario-party-3-marios-super-picross">Nintendo Switch Online Missions &amp; Rewards Program</a>, you can nab some rather unique icons for your Switch profile.</p>
<p>Now, you <em>could</em> grab some icons for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party_3">Mario Party 3</a> — and they're quite nice, too — but have you seen those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a> icons? No? Well just look at them! (Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/IconsNSO/status/1975373237623418889">NSO Icon Alerts</a> for highlighting them!)</p>
<p>These icons, shown below, are part of the monthly Play &amp; Redeem scheme for NSO members. All you have to do is boot up Mario's Super Picross on the SNES app and then you can purchase those icon elements using Platinum Points.</p>
<p>It doesn't even take 10 seconds if you have the SNES app downloaded already, so if you like 'em and you have the points... What's stopping you?</p>
<figure data-uuid="4311ccd07c8f1"><a title="Mario's Super Picross NSO Icons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4311ccd07c8f1/marios-super-picross-nso-icons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario's Super Picross was added to the Nintendo Classics service (formerly Nintendo Switch Online) back in 2020. Acting as a direct sequel to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/marios_picross">Game Boy original</a>, this one is largely the same, except once you beat the first level, you'll have access to Wario's version of the game, where you have additional rules to consider.</p>
<p>The game only launched in Japan on the Super Famicom, though it did launch on the PAL Wii and Wii U Virtual Console stores in 2007 and 2013 respectively.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Switch Online release is available to everyone. Plus, If you have a Switch 2 (or a USB mouse) you can actually play it with mouse controls, too!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While it initially sounded absurd to release the third title in a trilogy before the first two, thematically and chronologically, it makes perfect sense. If Dragon Quest III was a tale of the most famous Erdrick of the trilogy, Dragon Quest I and II both take up the helm generations after the fact and continue the work initially started to protect Alefgard from catastrophe. What we got to play at Tokyo Game Show 2025 was just a small taste of the opening hours of both titles that encompass the Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake, which rounds off the trilogy. </p>



<p>Both of the first two Dragon Quest titles take a different approach to the hero's journey. For the first and inaugural Dragon Quest title, it's literally one man versus the world as the nameless Hero must acquire Wrdrick's legendary equipment to best the big bad Dragonlord before they can take over the world. In the second Dragon Quest title (and last in the trilogy chronologically, taking place roughly a century after the first game), it's up to a small party of Luminairies and family members to do the deed. Perhaps Square-Enix will fix some of the gear issues and give the Prince of Cannock something better to wear than a coffin all the time.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, Square-Enix and Armor Studio have given Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake the same overhaul that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the third title received last year</a>. This has the unfortunate side effect of making all three titles feel relatively homogenized compared to how the original trilogy both looked and played on the original NES. Dragon Quest I remains the largest outlier of the trilogy, with both a singular protagonist and a shorter runtime, but it still captures the same joy of JRPGs as the other two.</p>



<p>The original NES release of Dragon Quest, or Dragon Warrior in the West, was a very short adventure by modern standards. Even with the added necessity to groom in the US release of Dragon Warrior, players could expect to finish the adventure in roughly ten hours with only a few major plot points and dungeons along the way. Square-Enix has remedied that by including new story scenarios neatly into the gameplay in places that feel natural. For the first title, a new scenario was added to retrieve the Thief's Key from a merchant, only to have it be stolen by Robbin' 'Ood before the player can get to it. This leads to a small side quest in a dungeon that was originally optional in the adventure (Craggy Cave) and an encounter with the thief himself, one that players would recognize from the HD-2D Remake of Dragon Quest III and many other subsequent titles in the series.</p>



<p>Similarly, Dragon Quest II received a substantial amount of new content, with the majority that I was able to play in my short demo being that of an underwater map to recover Lorelai's Harp as well as a small lottery minigame. Dragon Quest II frequently was at the bottom of ranking lists across the entire series and was the most in need of a proper overhaul, so I'm glad to see that it's receiving all sorts of new content this time around, beyond just the fresh coat of paint. </p>



<p>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake will be out soon, with a release date set for October 30th, 2025 across PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 1 and 2, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. With less than four weeks to go before release, that's the perfect time to jump into Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake and explore the foundations of the trilogy before diving into the next two titles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Aloft Bloom & Blight Update Set to Bring Big Improvements in November]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-bloom-and-blight-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aloft-bloom-blight-update-set-to-bring-big-improvements-in-november.1318627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Funcom and developer Astrolabe Interactive have announced the Bloom &amp; Blight update for cozy survival adventure&nbsp;<i>Aloft</i>, and it's set to bring big improvements to the game next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update will arrive on November 4th, and the two studios are talking a big game for the update; it's apparently set to improve "almost every facet" of the game.</p>

<p>According to Funcom and Astrolabe, Bloom &amp; Blight will "revamp and improve almost every aspect of [<em>Aloft</em>], including world generation, tech tree progression, exploration and travel, ecosystem restoration, and combat", so this is a pretty ambitious undertaking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=kwigv55z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=_Jing2EI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>is getting a very big update indeed soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the changes coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update were outlined in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/517473930105061675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">developer blog</a> back in late September, and it does indeed look like the developers are pulling out all of the stops with this one.</p>

<p>Progression will be overhauled to be less confusing and directionless, and ecosystem restoration will be redesigned so that it feels more "engaging" and less "likely simply ticking items off a checklist".</p>

<p>It's not just content within the game that will be getting changes, however;&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s developers are also working on the technical side of things, with the save data system getting a complete overhaul to "achieve long-term stability".</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Aloft </em>since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">January Early Access release</a>, or even if you're new to the game, you should hopefully find a significantly improved and expanded version of the survival adventure after Bloom &amp; Blight lands.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s latest major update comes just a couple of days after publisher Funcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarked on a spate of layoffs</a>, with&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> as a result of these staff cuts.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that sci-fi survival sim<i>&nbsp;Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</i>proved to be the company's most successful release yet, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">a million sales within just two weeks of its launch</a> back in June this year.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and you can remind yourself what our very own Isaac thought of the game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview" rel="nofollow">reading his preview from January</a>.</p>

              <p>We’re fairly used to Nintendo making strange or iconoclastic decisions, whether it’s releasing folding two-screen portable gaming devices or announcing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch-classics-2000625301">Virtual Boy peripheral for the Switch 2</a>, but even now the Japanese games company is capable of surprises. It has just uploaded to its various worldwide YouTube channels a stunning four-minute animated short called <em>Close to You</em>, about a baby learning to take their first steps, and there’s no explanation for why. Is it a Princess Peach origin story? Something to do with Rosalina? Is it something to do with <em>Pikmin</em> of all things?</p> <p>It is a truly wonderful cartoon. Evoking Pixar in almost every possible way (complete with&nbsp;<em>Incredibles</em>-like faces), the short shows the mother of a baby just popping out of the room, after which the baby’s toys begin to become animated. Wooden blocks hop about and a rattle rolls itself to the baby’s foot. While enjoying the rattle, the kid’s pacifier falls out of their mouth, and that too comes to life, playfully moving around and evading the baby’s attempts to grab it back. In the end, it gets wedged in a mobile dangling above the baby’s crib, giving the tyke the motivation to reach higher and attempt their first steps.</p>

  <p>There’s obviously no way to know if this baby is a boy or a girl, let alone the child form of a particular character. Given the kid’s white with blonde hair, it could be either Zelda or Link, or Samus, or pretty much any gaming character bar Mario or Toad. Hell, my hair was that blonde as a baby, maybe it&nbsp;<em>is</em> Mario. (It isn’t.)</p>

 <p>Someone has claimed that there’s a Red Pikmin appearing in the video at 1:40. Um, I paused it there, and here it is! But there are musical nods to the&nbsp;<em>Pikmin</em> series in here, and they’re certainly the sorts of mischievous creatures who would move toys around a room.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632540"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632540">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The only credit at any point is “<b><span>© </span></b>Nintendo” at the bottom right at the end of the video, with no mention of Illumination, the animation house behind&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> and its forthcoming <em>Mario Galaxy </em>sequel. It’d make some sense if it were related to that, perhaps depicting a moment from Princess Peach’s childhood? She’s fairly magical, and the pink of the pacifier points in that direction. Then again, the blue of the onesie implies Rosalina. Actually, that’d make sense, given the next movie is set in the <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> universe, and that’s the game in which she first appeared. Let’s go with that! Starting over…</p> <hr> <h2>Nintendo Reveals Rosalina’s Origin Story In Animated Short</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000632541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632541"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632541">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nintendo today has posted a four-minute animated short to its YouTube channels, revealing the beginnings of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> character Rosalina, to coincide with the upcoming <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> sequel,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. Rosalina, the resident of the Comet Observatory and mother figure to the game’s star-shaped Lumas, will obviously play a central role in the forthcoming film, so it only makes sense to see her being highlighted here…</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-has-surprised-everyone-the-kindle-is-practically-a-gift-if-youre-a-prime-member-2000632519</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-surprised-everyone-the-kindle-is-practically-a-gift-if-you%E2%80%99re-a-prime-member.1318615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to finally grab a Kindle, that moment just arrived. Amazon rarely discounts its e-readers, especially the base model that consistently tops the bestseller lists. Summer is peak reading season so the retailer typically holds prices steady through the July Prime Day when demand is already high.</p>
<p>But this Prime Big Deal Days event has brought an unexpected surprise for Prime members: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4586/">the newest Kindle model is down to $84, reduced from $109</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low on the lightest and most compact Kindle</strong> Amazon has ever made, and it solves one of the biggest frustrations readers face: lugging around heavy books or scrolling through distracting phone screens when you’re trying to lose yourself in a story.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4586/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Have to Choose This Kindle</h2>
<p>This latest generation Kindle (2024) eliminates the little irritations that previously made e-readers <strong>slow to react or more difficult to read</strong> under certain circumstances. The <strong>front light is also increased by 25%</strong> at its highest setting over its predecessor so you are free to read comfortably even in direct sunlight without eye strain or having to shift position to prevent glare. The <strong>6-inch display is also purely glare-proof</strong>&nbsp;so being outdoors by the pool or on a park bench becomes just as comfortable a place to read as being indoors. There is <strong>also a dark mode setting</strong> whereby the text and background are reversed and gives white text on a black display for midnight reading sessions.</p>



<p><strong>Page turns are significantly quicker now</strong> which may sound like a trivial thing but becomes a real distinction when you’re engrossed in a thriller and whizzing through pages rapidly. The increased contrast ratio causes text to seem sharper and darker against the background and better replicates the sensation of reading ink on paper than before.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is six weeks between charges</strong> if we assume a reading of about 30 minutes per day by shutting off wireless and setting the light to a luminous 13. If you read longer hours or leave wireless on so your reading stays current among multiple devices, a few weeks of life remain until it’s necessary to charge it.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB of capacity stores thousands of books</strong>, a number far greater than most individuals will want to keep current at a single moment. Even if your downloads are a delicate balancing act between text-heavy novels and graphics-intensive comics or magazines, you’ll have quite a bit of capacity left for other titles. The reader itself <strong>is Amazon’s thinnest and lightest Kindle</strong>, weighing a mere 5.56 ounces.</p>
<p>One of the greatest benefits of reading a book on a Kindle rather than a phone or a tablet is total lack of distraction: There are <strong>no text messages flashing, no urge to see what’s new by email, no social media scrolling</strong> and no other programs demanding your focus. You turn on the thing, resume where you left off, and read. That’s it.</p>
<p>This is a members-only deal for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and it’s also a record-low price for this model, at $84. If it’s been on your mind to pick up an e-reader, or it’s been a couple of years since you’ve picked up a Kindle, it’s your turn yet.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s associate creative director has explained why the timeline doesn’t allow for Wall Runs.</p>



<p>Activision’s latest Call of Duty installment, Black Ops 7, is all set to arrive on November 14, 2025, with the developers conducting open beta testing until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-has-been-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 9</a>. Ahead of the game’s release, the devs have provided players with an insight into BO7’s movement features, explaining why Wall Jumps can transition into Wall Runs. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-doesn-t-have-wall-runs-as-the-timeline-doesn-t-allow-it">Black Ops 7 Doesn’t Have Wall Runs As the Timeline Doesn’t Allow It</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-say-that-you-can-blame-the-black-ops-timeline-for-the-wall-jump-not-being-a-wall-run-black-ops-2-really-gave-us-a-foundation-for-the-technology-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie revealed why Wall Runs weren’t included in the game. Leslie first explains that when they began developing BO7, they “wanted to pick up threads from Black Ops 2.” Which is why all the technology available in the game is from that era. Leslie explained that the team is very precious to their canon and they have to respect that. </p>



<p>Leslie added that they couldn’t have Thrust Jump as the tech didn’t exist until 2035. Similar to that, Wall Run would have made sense if the game were set more in the future; however, as the tech did not exist in the Black Ops 2 era, “so it made sense not to do it.” </p>



<p>Black Ops 7 does have Wall Jumps, which allow players to gain some height by chaining three jumps. Leslie also spoke about how players can get much higher with the new feature, and they “took a lot of learnings from everything we did on Black Ops 3 – it was really important that we kept the combat in-frame.” </p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, October 7, 2025. Below, we look back at Sega's uneven attempt to revive the classic 2D franchise, and how it ultimately fizzled.</em></p><p dir="ltr">There's no denying the glaring flaws of Sonic the Hedgehog 4--the wonky physics, the blatant remixing (or one might even say "rehashing") of classic levels and bosses from the first two Sonic games, and the soundtrack's questionable and often derided soundfont being chief among them. But despite its problems, even 15 years later, I still find myself occasionally coming back to replay both episodes. Not only that, but dare I say, I enjoy myself.</p><p dir="ltr">The game certainly had its shining spots. I appreciate how, instead of every zone having the same hazards and obstacles scattered throughout, each act of each zone had its own distinct gimmick to help one stand out. For example, Casino Street Act 1 featured your standard pinball flippers, bumpers, and slot machine gimmicks. Act 2 shifted the focus to a new mechanic entirely: flipping around and racing across playing cards that act as platforms. The third act brings in colorful cannons that you can manually aim to shoot Sonic across the level. The game was darn pretty to look at, capturing the colorful aesthetic of the classic games with a modern sheen. And even though longtime Sonic composer Jun Senoue went a little too hard with the Genesis/Mega Drive synths for the music, it was still catchy as heck.</p><p dir="ltr">There were signs that Sega was taking feedback to heart. Many of the flaws that plagued Episode 1 were significantly reduced for Episode 2. Zones like White Park and Oil Desert offered more originality than those in the first episode. Instead of being a mindless sidekick who simply follows Sonic around and runs into everything, Tails was given new utility, able to carry Sonic across chasms, blast through water and snow at high speed, and even destroy every enemy on screen with a powerful team blast. Players who owned both Episodes 1 and 2 could replay Episode 1's levels as Sonic's metallic rival, Metal Sonic, complete with new story elements that run parallel to the original game, harkening back to the lock-on technology of Sonic 3/Sonic &amp; Knuckles in the '90s.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png" data-ref-id="1300-4580715" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png" data-ref-id="1300-4580715"></a><figcaption>Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bringing Metal Sonic into a prominent role was a franchise rarity, marking his chronological return to the series after being destroyed in Sonic CD. Aside from Sonic Heroes, the character had more or less been relegated to minor appearances in almost every Sonic game before or since, simply showing up for a boss fight with little to no fanfare, getting blown up, and never being seen again. In Episode 2, his presence is felt throughout the entire story, appearing every handful of levels to duke it out with Sonic in multiple boss encounters. Whereas up to that point Sonic CD had sort of been an outlier among classic Sonic games, Sonic 4 did a great job of giving it a stronger connection to them. In a similar vein, bringing back Little Planet, the setting in which Sonic CD took place, and turning it into a planet-sized power source for a new Death Egg was another unique callback that I can't help but feel could have been explored further.</p><p dir="ltr">That's why Sonic 4 remains equal parts fascinating and frustrating. It had some cool ideas to bring in underutilized classic Sonic elements in new ways, but took way too long to introduce them. Episode 1 felt like a glorified remix of Sonic 1 and 2 with the occasional twist thrown in. Episode 2 showcased more ambition and originality, but by the time you were invested in what they were setting up, the game was over. And Episode 3…well…</p><p dir="ltr">For years, there was no indication that an Episode 3 was ever in production. Most fans assumed that Episode 2 simply didn't sell well enough to warrant a third episode being greenlit. However, several years after Episode 2's release, former Sonic 4 brand manager Ken Balough stated in an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230208104748/https:/www.sonicstadium.org/2015/01/sonic-4-episode-3-was-planned-then-cancelled/" rel="nofollow ">that the game was planned to be a trilogy,</a> only to be cut short for undisclosed reasons. This statement was given further credence just this year when a beta of Episode 2 was discovered, revealing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnSsIwqBbZ8&amp;pp=ygUdc29uaWMgNCBlcGlzb2RlIDIgYmV0YSBlbmRpbmc%3D">a cut sequel hook</a> showcasing the Death Egg powering up with the help of the Master Emerald--and Knuckles.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to providing tangible evidence of Episode 3's planned existence, the scene implied that Knuckles would have played a prominent role, likely as a playable character. Would he have been able to retroactively explore levels from Episodes 1 and 2 on his own like Metal Sonic, or would he have been a "sidekick" character who Sonic could team up with during gameplay like Tails? Would Episode 3 have linked up with Episodes 1 and 2, effectively creating a "complete" Sonic 4, like how Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles became the complete Sonic 3? All we can really do is speculate.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnSsIwqBbZ8" data-width="640" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YnSsIwqBbZ8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">And nothing screams "missed potential" quite like the reveal that there were talks for Episode 3 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230208104748/https:/www.sonicstadium.org/2015/01/sonic-4-episode-3-was-planned-then-cancelled/" rel="nofollow ">to be developed by Christian Whitehead</a>, the lead developer behind the later universally praised Sonic Mania. Imagine an Episode 3 with pitch-perfect classic physics coupled with the Mania Team's impeccable level designs. Even better, imagine if they incorporated tweaked physics for Episodes 1 and 2 to bring them more in line with the classic games. Granted, we did get Mania several years later, but hey, I like the thought of the Sonic 4 saga being allowed to go out on a high note.</p><p dir="ltr">While I know Sonic the Hedgehog 4 was never going to be a masterpiece by any stretch--much less a worthy successor to one of the greatest gaming trilogies of all time--I can't help but be fascinated by the massive potential it had to be something great, if it had been allowed to conclude as Sega originally intended. For what we ended up with, the discourse around it remains more or less unchanged since it was first released 15 years ago. It's still an enjoyable if not uninspired sidescrolling Sonic adventure that could have been so much more.</p>

During the Valley of Memory reveal stream, it was disclosed that this DLC will add around six hours of gameplay and story as Basim discovers that his father may still be alive.

The developer will publish the full patch notes later, but for now, the company released highlights, including that player movement will feel "more responsive" and that recoil has been rebalanced. Additionally, maps have seen some tweaks for the Rush and Breakthrough modes to help them have "better balance."</p><p>On top of all this, the Operation Firestorm map got some updates to improve performance, while Siege of Cairo's spawn-killing and out-of-bounds exploits will be fixed with the day-one update.</p><p>Battlefield 6's UI and HUD elements should also become "clearer" with the day-one update, while audio has been improved, too, to help sounds become "sharper." What's more, Battlefield Studios made improvements to Battlefield 6's networking to reduce desync and to help make time-to-death feel more fair.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Battlefield Studios said it's heard the calls from fans that they want naval warfare, suggesting that's coming in a future update. Additionally, the studio said it's aware that people want to see "a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more."</p><p>"With Season 1 and our roadmap ahead, we're excited to continue to build a Battlefield that reflects what players want. We'll continue reading and listening to community channels, and we cannot wait to share more with you, so keep the feedback coming," the developer said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1</a> begins on October 28 as part of a multi-phase rollout that continues through December 9.

In other news, EA just recently put out a new live-action trailer for the game that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-live-action-trailer-pokes-fun-at-call-of-duty/1100-6535075/" data-ref-id="1100-6535075">pokes fun at the franchise's main rival, Call of Duty.</a> Battlefield 6 has considerable pre-release hype and momentum, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">experts do not believe it will beat Call of Duty this year, at least not in terms of sales.</a></p>

He says the pivot from 2D to 3D wasn't exactly a "walk in the park" and took longer than expected, not least because the team couldn't effectively assess how macro gameplay elements were taking shape until they had fleshed out a good portion of the playspace.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted this to truly be an open world that players could explore in any direction they wanted. It’s a technically challenging genre to work in, you don’t really get a sense of the macro gameplay until you've built quite a lot of stuff. We had a variety of strategies to edit things in rough broad strokes or edit localized areas at a time," says Essen.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/baby-steps-has-me-questioning-my-entire-existence" target="_self" data-discover="true">Baby Steps has me questioning my entire existence</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Nailing the average bike speed was something we tried to get early on, because it impacted the distances between everything in the game, which also factored into the pacing. We did use some tricks like making the bike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> faster using FOV (field of view) and camera angles. The kph gauge has a multiplier on it so that it was still in the realm of how fast a real bike can go."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Essen says Messhof spent a huge amount of time reshaping the landscape to ensure that objectives and collectibles appeared at correct intervals. With so many moving parts, however, making even small tweaks became increasingly expensive. Spend too much time tinkering with an open world project and you might start unraveling the very fabric of your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how Messhof sought to gently steer players through their island realm, which can largely be explored at will (although that might present some challenges players aren't equipped for), Essen explains the core narrative—which requires players to outrace bike-riding bosses to collect sacred bike parts—provide some semblance of structure without feeling too on rails.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/read-up-on-new-guidance-for-implementing-accessibility-tags-in-storefronts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Read the ESA's new guidance for storefront accessibility tags</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-WUWFguRqY?si=kix-X18zjuV6YogR" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additional bike parts can also be found scattered across the landscape, which pushes players to keep moving in search of shiny new components that can be used to trick out their cherished two-wheeler for specific events.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We encouraged players to explore quickly, but story beats naturally guide you to easier races in the Farmlands first—where you can also face the first boss. Velo City is the toughest area, with tight turns, aggressive AI, and heavy traffic, so we gated it with 'bike snobs' who won't let you in until you've upgraded all five bike parts," continues Essen.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Beyond that, we left room for player strategy. The BMX track, for example, might be easier with a high-handling, high-power bike for sharp turns and quick acceleration, but you could also choose a drift build that grants boost on slides, or use the Cucaracha frame to jump rolling bumps. We made sure tracks varied in elevation, turns, obstacles, and surfaces so different builds felt viable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Messhof's ultimate aim was to craft unique and diverse open world that actually rewards exploration. "We wanted a large open world with towns, countryside, and lots to explore. The style had to be achievable by a small art team and feel like a cohesive, believable place—not something thrown together from stock assets," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-story-changes-were-made-to-sustain-player-interest-over-time" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth story changes were made to sustain player interest over time</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The game's world is an alternate universe where life and death revolve around bicycles. Visual inspirations included old Tour de France posters and early 20th-century travel posters—thick, hand-drawn outlines and bold shapes. We also looked at comics including Moebius, John Singer Sargent's landscapes, David Hockney, and Pop Art in general. And of course other games too like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jet Set Radio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a lofty goal considering the studio's art team oscillated between two and three people throughout production, but I think it's reasonable to say Messhof delivered on that promise. There's plenty of fun to be had in hurling your haunted bicycle through breakneck races but, during my time with the title, I found nothing quite compared to simply taking in the sights under </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wheel World's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> gleaming topaz skies.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Nintendo has posted a new animated short film on its Nintendo Today app and YouTube channel, so far completely devoid of context.</p>
<p>Called Close to You, the Pixar-esque film shows a baby following its toys around the room, seemingly moved by invisible creatures, all accompanied by a playful piano soundtrack.</p>
<p>The film has been posted purely with the name and no description, so it's not initially clear what project (if any) this might relate to, be that a game or a film.</p>

<p>While the company doesn't state which production studio created the film, some have speculated this is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-launches-its-nintendo-pictures-animation-studio">work of Nintendo Pictures</a> - its Tokyo-based animation studio that launched back in 2022, formerly known as Dynamo Pictures.</p>
<p>What's more, the music references the main <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> theme tune at the start, while the focus on items being carried certainly alludes to the little plant creatures. And if you check under the bed at 1'41, a little red creature can be seen scurrying around.</p>

<p>Could this be hinting at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a>? That game does include levels themed around a child's bedroom. But why go to the trouble of a new animated short?</p>
<p>At the very least, it's a beautifully animated film and extremely cute.</p>
<p>What do you think Nintendo is hinting at?</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2%E2%80%99s-story-doesn%E2%80%99t-change-the-status-quo.1318582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Hades II</em>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-iHDj3EwdI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a>, Melinoë says: “Wait for me, Father, I’ll be there soon.” At first glance, this seems like a straightforward subversion; where Zagreus fought up out of the underworld to escape his father, the titular Hades, Melinoë fights down into it to rescue Hades from his own father, the titan Chronos.&nbsp;</p><p>But flipping this goal isn’t so simple. The Hades of <em>Hades I</em> is an abusive patriarch and part of a terrible system of godly royalty. As Zagreus finds his path out from underneath Hades’ grasp, he also helps nearly every other character with the injustices they’ve suffered at the hands of the divine pantheon.</p><p>But the Hades of <em>Hades II</em> is a figure of, well, mythological worship for Melinoë, who was taken from her family as a baby and only has stories of him to work from – stories told by the other gods who want their own rulership back. Hades is presented as a family man, doting on his new daughter; the abuse of the previous game is never mentioned. And even as the gods’ capricious whims are detailed by&nbsp; various characters, the game does nothing to subvert the idea that you should put those gods back on their ‘rightful’ thrones.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>This piece contains spoilers for the whole of </em></strong><strong>Hades II</strong><strong><em>, including the post-credits quests and multiple late-game side stories</em></strong>.</p><p>Every time <em>Hades II </em>got a new early access update that unearthed more of its overarching story, I waited for Supergiant to introduce a twist into Melinoë’s propagandized drive to re-establish the godly totalitarianism spearheaded by the villain of the first game. But 1.0 has come and gone, and Melinoë’s task never changes. While there are throwaway hints that the age of the gods won’t last forever,&nbsp; Melinoë never learns of Hades’ abuse of Zagreus, and she does nothing for the many people she calls friends who suffer under the system she has fought so hard to uphold.</p><p>There is one clear moment in the game’s ending where Supergiant explores breaking the cycle. Melinoë can’t beat Chronos without Zagreus’ help, in a timewarping plot that is supposed to have Chronos killed before he ever comes to power. But Zagreus doesn’t kill Chronos; instead he offers him mercy. In isolation, this moment lands. But it lands as a cap on <em>Hades I</em>, which was a character study in Zag’s bottomless compassion. As the ending to <em>Hades II</em>, it only serves to spotlight the differences between Zagreus’ journey and Melinoë’s.&nbsp;</p><p>At every turn, Zagreus improves the lives of those around him. We are shown character after character who has had their life ruined by the tyranny of the gods, and who, with Zagreus’ help, manages to improve their lot while still acknowledging that they live within an order that is unfair and cruel. In <em>Hades I</em>, Achilles and Patroclus, separated for who knows how long after their deaths, are able to finally reunite. So are Orpheus and Euridice. Despite the inherently Sisyphean nature of the roguelite, Zagreus even manages to free the actual Sisyphus from his plight. In all these cases, what was done to these characters is recognised as an injustice of divine power, and those injustices are at least partially rectified.</p><p>Compare this to <em>Hades II</em>’s plotline for Narcissus and Echo. Echo was first cursed by Hera to only repeat back what was said to her, and then, after spurning Echo, Narcissus was cursed by Nemesis to fall in love with himself. Narcissus can be found staring at himself in the waters of Oceanus; Echo now exists listlessly in the Fields of Mourning. Melinoë can get them to briefly reunite, and point out to Nemesis that this act of retribution did nothing to help Echo. But Melinoë doesn’t do anything for her either; Narcissus will visit and they will talk, and we’re told this gives them both some kind of closure, but as it happens offscreen, it’s hard to understand what this is.&nbsp;</p><p>After they’re briefly reunited, Melinoë can restore Narcissus’ waters so that he can continue to stare at himself. “As for you,” she says to Echo, “I sense that you don’t ever want to change.” By maxing her bond, you’ll unlock a conversation in Echo’s own voice where she refuses any more help, because she helps others “by reflecting their feelings and thoughts.” At no point are either of their lives meaningfully improved, nor is the fault of Hera or Nemesis explored. This storyline echoes <em>Hades I</em>, but lacks the resonance and change that made those earlier stories work.&nbsp;</p><p>Another character deeply wronged by the gods is Arachne, who was turned into a spider for beating Athena in a weaving contest. She speaks often of her resentment for not only Athena but the entire pantheon who turned a blind eye to the injustice done to her. Later, Melinoë and Arachne learn it was Hecate’s poison that was used in the transformation; Hecate says her allegiance “forcibly is with the gods, not with arrogant mortals.” Melinoë intercedes, but Arachne refuses to grovel in front of Athena, saying she’d rather be a spider than apologise. And she’s right! Athena’s retribution was unfounded and petty; Arachne has nothing to be sorry for.&nbsp;</p><p>But, like Hecate, I’m forced to side with the gods rather than the innocent Arachne. Her refusal to apologize is the end of the story; Melinoë won’t push back any further against Athena or find a different solution to ease Arachne’s suffering. As in <em>Hades I</em>, I can’t change the system, but unlike <em>Hades I</em>, there’s no respite I can provide within it. Instead, I just keep helping Athena to win her war. Arachne suggests that the gods are facing the consequences of their own pride in a mirror of her story, but Melinoë does nothing throughout the game except ensure that they are not.</p><p>In another example, the witch Circe briefly speaks to Odysseus in his quest where he reunites with his family. She thanks Melinoë for putting that “shade to rest.” As for Odysseus, that reunion happens offscreen; there’s no pathos to it, nor any challenge to Poseidon for cursing him in the first place.</p><p>Overall, the endings of side characters’ plotlines mostly exist to hammer home a theme of acceptance and closure. But accepting what’s been done to these characters is unsatisfying. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the character of Prometheus, a character from mythology who is inherently sympathetic given that he was punished for providing fire to humanity, and who also talks candidly in the game about the unfairness of having his liver eaten daily in retribution. He speaks of fighting for mortals, whilst the gods fight only for themselves. Many people, myself included, thought that Prometheus' inarguably correct lines about the nature of power and the injustice of the punishments doled out to those who oppose it would lead to some kind of twist. And yet he’s unchangeably a boss to be defeated. Melinoë offers no counterargument except further violence. Even after Zagreus offers mercy to Chronos, it’s impossible to change Prometheus' fate.&nbsp;</p><p>The game does state in the ending that after having their right to rule reinstated, the gods suddenly begin to treat mortals better. Moreover, in the post-game quest immediately following, the Fates, characters who have been missing and who are supposed to give everyone their lot in life, abdicate their responsibility. This is perhaps hinting that Prometheus, titan of foresight, was aiming for this outcome all along and that this will result in mortals being able to make their own way in the world free from divine meddling. But we’re not actually shown any evidence of that actually being the case. And none of the characters we do see who have been wronged by the gods get any kind of apology, let alone restitution.&nbsp;</p><p>Though <em>Hades II</em> has one swift ending beat about breaking cycles, there’s no scaffolding for that theme in any of the smaller stories that make up the bulk of the narrative. Worse, where <em>Hades I</em> focused on the unfairness of the gods’ rule and argued that while it might not be changeable, it was subvertable, <em>Hades II</em> simply superficially claims that absolute power turns out okay in the end, and if it was too late for you, well, you just need to make peace with that.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s not a leap I’m not willing to take, not with the real world how it is, and not with how it breaks from <em>Hades I</em>. In 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-early-access-journey-has-been-more-important-than-the-destination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote</a> as <em>Hades I </em>moved from early access to 1.0 that “with so much feeling insurmountable, watching Zagreus try anyway and be rewarded for his efforts lights a similar little fire in the soles of my feet. A better (under)world is possible.” In 2025, watching Melinoë largely prop up kings without meaningfully improving the circumstances of her friends, peers, and those who have been wronged only leaves me feeling hollow.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll"><h3>VTuber Mori Calliope’s Anime Dream Came Full Circle In Creating Gachiakuta’s New Theme Song</h3></a><p>Mori Colliope's longtime love for Gachiakuta’s manga and her close bond with creator Kei Urana helped shape its explosive new song “Let’s Just Crash”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin"><h3>Wayward Is A Queer Exploration Of The Troubled Teen Industry</h3></a><p>Mae Martin's new Netflix show creates a *very* creepy small town</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the most pleasant surprises of the past couple of weeks has been Skate. If you’ve been around gaming for a while – which I, ahem, have – then you’ll know Skate from the days of the Xbox 360 and PS3, where it went board to board with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater by offering a completely different take on the sport and the skateboarding scene. Many had assumed that Skate 3 – released 15 whole years ago – was the end for the series, especially with the shuttering of developer EA Black Box, but just like any skateboarder whose face has felt the cool touch of tarmac, you can’t keep a good game series down. The new version of Skate ten, has just arrived in Early Access, and with the launch of Season One today, the team at Full Circle have announced that the game has already seen 15 million players hitting the sidewalks of San Vansterdam.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Mi9EKoBCSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s a hell of a lot of people. And with good reason too, since the move to Free-To-Play has made this the most accessible skateboarding game we’ve ever had. Even if you only have the most passing interest in skateboarding – perhaps you watched Lords of Dogtown with Heath Ledger in back in the day and thought it was pretty cool – there’s literally no reason not to download the new Skate and check it out. That certainly seems to be what people are doing too, as the player numbers have soared in only three weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve spent some serious time in San Vansterdam already, and really enjoyed this initial foray into Early Access in my review, stating, “I’ve been waiting for Skate. Tony Hawk’s frantic take on the sport is cool, but it doesn’t feel as good as this. The freedom, the variety, and the community are already in place, the only thing missing is you.”</p>
<p><em>Season 1 launches today with all-new skateable areas, Challenges, Tasks, seasonal events, new brand partners, cosmetics, quality of life improvements and more.</em></p>

<p>But what could it mean?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a surprise new short film called '<strong>Close To You</strong>' and it's... not what we expected from the House of Mario.</p>
<p>Initially shared on the Nintendo Today! app before cropping up on YouTube and socials, the short follows a baby that learns to take its first steps via the magic of a sentient dummy (or pacifier, if you'd rather).</p>
<p>It feels very Toy Story, and the animation style has big Pixar energy to boot, but the strangest part of it all is how it feels very... un-Nintendo. There's no Mario to seen, the baby doesn't stumble past some Joy-Con at any point, there's not even a Pikmin cameo.</p>
<p>Or is there? It feels to us like there's something missing in this short. Don't you get the impression that we <em>should</em> be seeing something carrying the dummy or pushing the blocks? Do we spy something moving under the bed in the background <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsufGY5I8jA&amp;t=99s">around 1:38</a>? Doesn't the music sound a little <em>too</em> Pikmin-coded?</p>

<figure data-uuid="d1d7a901a905b"><a title="Nintendo Close To You Zoom" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d1d7a901a905b/nintendo-close-to-you-zoom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The whole thing has a whiff of an invisible Pikmin scheme to us, but hey, that's just a theory. Whether this turns out to be something bigger, well, we're just going to have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this animated short? Do you think it will be part of something larger? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-studios-ea-tease-naval-warfare-on-the-horizon-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-studios-and-ea-tease-that-naval-warfare-is-on-the-horizon-for-battlefield-6.1318558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, Battlefield 6 is days away from launching on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S worldwide. The <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1974127507260510622">global launch times are up</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-1-7-million-pre-orders-predicted-to-sell-5-million-first-week/">estimated 1.7 million players bought in for October 10</a> will be boots on the ground by the end of the week. So naturally, it's time for Battlefield Studios and EA to talk about what's next for Battlefield 6 on October 11, and every day after that.</p>



<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way">Community Update blog post on the Battlefield website</a>, Battlefield Studios laid out a few data points regarding what it has noticed over the course of its Battlefield Labs testing, followed by updates and changes players who participated in that testing and in the Beta this summer will notice when the game launches this coming Friday.</p>



<p>Towards the end of the post, in the section titled, "<em>On the Horizon</em>," the Battlefield Studios team writes, "<em>There is much more to look forward to beyond our Seasons as our team continues reviewing Battlefield Labs data, player feedback, and ideating on completely new ideas for the future, starting with an exciting new Battlefield take on Battle Royale.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Separately, requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favourite little helicopter, platoons, and more</em>.<em> We appreciate all of your suggestions, and want you to know we're listening.</em>"</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">recently revealed Season 1 roadmap </a>doesn't include the introduction of naval warfare, nor does it include the return of Little Bird, the helicopter that is most likely referenced by the phrase "<em>little helicopter</em>." But that doesn't mean those inclusions won't be ready for Season 2, or Season 3, and so on. At least Battlefield Studios has made the point that it is part of the conversation for Battlefield 6's future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Poncle has announced a brand new update for the arcade roguelike, and it'll finally bring the ability to play the game online alongside your friends.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14 is due to arrive sometime this fall, and it's bringing online co-op to the game on both PC and consoles, although it's not clear right now whether the game's multiplayer mode will feature crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, Poncle revealed the news of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' online co-op mode with a characteristically amusing trailer featuring a throwback Windows 95-style operating system, so if, like me, you're hopelessly nostalgic for the days of old-school PC gaming, this one'll appeal to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=VZADLhqn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=S10Mc8B4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh, Poncle, you rogue, you.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer also shows a clip of four players enjoying&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>together, and indeed, the game's online co-op mode will support up to four players, so grab three friends and get ready to fill the screen with an absolutely cosmic amount of projectiles.</p>

<p>As well as online co-op, there are four more major features to be revealed as part of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14, and Poncle is pledging to reveal new cards each week, so we'll learn more about what else is coming as part of this update in...well, in a week, as it happens.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' latest update comes just a couple of months after Poncle announced its second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing" rel="nofollow">foray into the publishing world</a> in the form of brick-breaking roguelike&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kill-the-brickman-poncle-out-now" rel="nofollow">Kill the Brickman</a>&nbsp;</em>(no, not that one).</p>




<p>As for the game that made Poncle's name, if you're somehow unfamiliar with it,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is an action-heavy arcade roguelike in which you must survive hordes of enemies swarming you across a variety of different maps.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll gain access to projectile and melee weapons that fire themselves, so it's up to you to position yourself correctly and try to build the perfect combination of items in order to survive for as long as you possibly can.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/vampire-survivors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-survivors/9pd5bm2z8c4l" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/vampire-survivors-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

<p>Convenience is really prime selling point for a cordless stick vacuum and the Dyson V11 is no exception. This vacuum is easy to move around throughout the home. It’s both lightweight and ergonomic so you can pick it up and clean up high up hard to reach places with ease. Transform the vacuum into a handheld, making it ever easier to maneuver while still not losing any power. That makes it a perfect tool for taking care of the interior of your car before before the next time it’s your turn to drive the friend group.</p>

<h2>Remove Pet Hair From Your Home</h2>
<p>Pet owners wouldn’t give up our furry little friends for the world, but we could sure do without all the hair that falls off of them. It digs into the carpet and can retain that very distinct odor that makes guests who walk in for the first time go, “hey do you have a dog?” Well, the Dyson V11 stick vacuum can help keep your couches and carpets free of fur. The vac comes with a hair screw tool, conical in shape, which can help get hair detangled while you’re going about cleaning your home. The Motorbar cleaner can automatically clear any hair that’s gotten wrapped up around the brush bar.</p>



<p>The vacuum is cordless, so it’s running off of a battery. That battery can last you approximately 100 minutes on a single charge. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">That’s roughly an hour longer than the Dyson V8 can hold up, which is a lot after considering that the V11’s motor spins at 125,000rpm and generates 60% more power than the V8</a>. When the vacuum is not in use, it can be neatly stored against the wall dock, recharging it on its own while its been put away. The LCD screen atop the vacuum shows you exactly how much battery life you have left so you won’t have any unexpected stops while vacuuming because your forgot to charge.</p>

              <p>As the AI plagiarism machines continue to churn out ever-more semi-realistic slop, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">videos of OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman eating a barbecued Pikachu</a>, the harm to any number of industries is incalculable. But there is also the personal harm, and no one has captured it better than actor and director Zelda Williams, daughter of the late Robin Williams, in a recent post on her Instagram.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/zelda-williams-ethers-ai-tributes-to-her-dead-dad-youre-making-disgusting-over-processed-hotdogs-out-of-the-lives-of-human-beings/">reported by&nbsp;<em>PC Gamer</em></a>, Zelda Williams posted an Instagram story (that has since expired) in which she begged her followers to “just stop sending me AI videos of Dad.”</p> <p>Sora, the AI video app from OpenAI, is flooding the internet with macabre depictions of both dead and living celebrities and public figures saying and doing things they’ve never said nor done. Obviously this can be enormously damaging for people’s reputations, with credulous viewers reposting such footage as fact. But what doesn’t always get thought about is how it affects the loved ones of those depicted, especially of those who have died. Such videos don’t need to be outlandish or offensive to achieve this, either—if anything, the more benign a video is, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@stealthlurking/video/7557903802280594702?q=sora%20robin%20williams&amp;t=1759840729478">the more insidious and upsetting it can be</a>.</p>

 <p>“Stop believing I wanna see it or that I’ll understand, I don’t and I won’t,” Williams wrote in her post. “If you’re just trying to troll me, I’ve seen way worse, I’ll restrict and move on. But please, if you’ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It’s dumb, it’s a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it’s NOT what he’d want.”</p>

 <p>As Rich Stanton points out in his&nbsp;<em>PCG</em> article, Robin Williams was famous for not wanting his face and voice used to hawk any old plastic tat, so it’s especially vile to note the constant dripping from the AI sewage pipe that’s putting words into his mouth. As his daughter puts it, “To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to ‘this vaguely looks and sounds like them so that’s enough’, just so other people can churn out horrible TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening.”</p>

 <p>“You’re not making art,” Zelda Williams continues. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings, out of the history of art and music, and then shoving them down someone else’s throat hoping they’ll give you a little thumbs up and like it. Gross.”</p>

 <p>And then, in unimprovable words, the actor sums up everything that’s so grim about it all:</p> <blockquote><p>And for the love of EVERYTHING, stop calling it ‘the future,’ AI is just badly recycling and regurgitating the past to be re-consumed. You are taking in the Human Centipede of content, and from the very very end of the line, all while the folks at the front laugh and laugh, consume and consume.</p></blockquote> <p id="dea0a845-47f5-4786-9ec0-3212f05d3981-2">Even OpenAI is <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">balking</a> at the way the just-launched Sora 2 is being used, with Altman backtracking on its ability to use any copyrighted materials, saying from now on companies will have to opt in. But this offers nothing to protect individuals, or their loved ones, from being depicted in such intrusive and ghoulish ways.</p> <p>Remember when AI was going to do all the boring jobs for us so we could live happier, freer lives? Yeah, turns out all it’s capable of is cheap tricks and making people sad.</p>

            <p>It looks like one of the most disliked characters in the Borderlands series may have been cut from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, according to datamined file names posted online.</p>
<p>As posted by to EpicNNG, a Borderlands content creator and dataminer who previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-borderlands-4-nearly-here-a-community-of-archivists-are-racing-to-revive-a-dead-borderlands-mmo">led an archival effort for the defunct Chinese Borderlands MMO</a>, files exist within Borderlands 4 that explicitly name a character called Ava. This character, introduced during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a>, proved quite divisive when series fans first met her back in 2019.</p>
<p>These Borderlands 4 files, <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674">posted in screenshot form on X by EpicNNG</a>, include assets seemingly tied to her bubble (a Siren ability she was shown to have had in Borderlands 3), as well as moments in the game when she'd be accompanying Zane throughout the story.</p>

<p>These files indicate that Ava may have been totally replaced by another character: Amara. Notably Amara is introduced to the play alongside Hermes (Ava's pet from Borderlands 3), and by the crashed Sanctuary ship from Borderlands 3 no less. So such inferences based on breadcrumbs left in the files aren't baseless.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that these small files datamined from the game are the only evidence available that Ava was at one point part of Borderlands 4. There has been no model discovered, nor audio files.</p>
<p>If Ava was originally intended to be part of Borderlands 4's narrative as these datamined files suggest, then this would mark a fairly substantial U-turn for the game during development. <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1840461497371402481">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford asked the community</a> roughly a year ago what players thought of Ava, and got a passionate response from both those who disliked the character, and those willing to give her a second shot.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-will-let-you-shut-claptraps-claptrap">Gearbox added a Claptrap sound slider to the game</a>, as many fans found the character to be a tad grating to listen to. A smart move, as the option itself is good joke that Borderlands fans could appreciate.
</p>
<p>Ava has yet to be confirmed as a returning character in upcoming DLC at all, so this may very well be the closest she comes to appearing in Borderlands 4. Or maybe she'll make a grand return to the game at a later date. The fact she was considered at all indicates there was some appetite to bring her back a few in-universe years after her grand introduction.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Edifier ES850NB Headphones Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/07/edifier-es850nb-headphones-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/edifier-es850nb-headphones-review.1318507/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The level of competition in the personal audio space is flabbergasting. While the biggest companies – Sony, Bose, et al – manage to stay at the top of the pack, the middle ground and the budget brands continue to rise ever closer to them, as technology improves and components become cheaper and more readily available. Amongst those building a head of steam, Edifier have become one of the most reliable names in audio, and with the snappily-named ES850NB, they’ve taken another step closer to those at the top of the category.</p>
<p><iframe title="ES850NB Active Noise Canceling #Headphones. ???? #edifier" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0KJ-obYho8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ES850NB – seriously, can’t we have sensible names in the headphone space? – is an over-ear, wireless headset that brings a suite of desirable features to bear, starting with Hi-Res audio certification, active noise cancellation, and a mammoth 92-hour battery life (53hrs with ANC). That’s good enough to see you all around the world, and thankfully, the audio is good enough to take you all the way there too.</p>


<p>In the box you’re getting the ES850NB itself, a very nice hard case with the Edifier logo proudly emblazoned on the front, and a USB-A to USB-C charging cable. The ES850NB fold down, which Sony and Bose seem to have forgotten about in recent years, and there’s a surety to popping them in the case and putting them in your bag knowing they’re perfectly protected. Thanks to that fold, the case isn’t going to take up all the room in your bag, either.</p>
<p>The headphones themselves come in black, brown, ivory and pink colourways, with our review unit appearing in the understated black. The sleek lines of the headband culminate in the rounded oblongs of each earpiece, connected via a single curved arm. There’s a debt here to the visual design of the Bowers and Wilkin Px8, but the ES850NB come away with enough visual identity of their own to stand apart.</p>


<p>Some of that comes down to the leather-like texture that covers the earpieces, lending the ES850NB a premium look beyond its mid-range price. It creates an interesting juxtaposition with the clean, smooth lines of the headband, and the understated Edifier logos help to make this a pair of headphones that retain a sense of class.</p>
<p>There are physical controls here, which are definitely preferable to some of the touch controls we often see at this price point. There’s a volume rocker, with a central raised point that provides a third button, and these provide every control you could want, whether power, call handling, volume, or music controls.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s a separate button for Bluetooth, which also controls mode switching for ANC, and changing between music and the low latency gaming mode. Unfortunately, you can’t combine the gaming mode with the LDAC codec, forcing a reset of the headset every time you switch, but if you’re serious about competitive mobile gaming, this is an excellent choice. That’s all quite a lot to remember, but the physical recognition of the buttons certainly helps to give you some surety when making changes, as does the voice assistant. Alternatively, you can switch between modes in the Edifier ConneX phone app.</p>
<p>At 265g, the ES850NB are a smidgen heavier than Sony’s XM6 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra, but not enough to notice a difference in your hand or on your head. Soft leatherette covers both the memory foam of the earpads and the underside of the headband, making this an exceedingly comfortable headset that you can wear all day long.</p>

<p>There was a point where I wondered if the ES850NB sounded as good as my Sony XM5s. They don’t, but the fact that Edifier have made something that sounds good enough that I had to check, speaks volumes. There’s a pleasingly wide soundstage, especially wide for a closed-back pair of headphones, and when combined with Hi-Res music, the ES850NBs sound very good indeed.</p>
<p>I have a fairly horrible taste in music, and the Edifier ES850NB delivered all the loud, grinding Metalcore of Bad Omens and Starset with bags of energy. There’s plenty of bass here, but it’s not overwhelming, and with a Hi-Res source like Apple Music, you can pick out details in tracks you’ve listened to hundreds of times, and still find new elements that you’ve never heard before.</p>
<p>When you combine any input with the ANC – rated for -45db – the ES850NB do a great job of cutting out external noises and background sounds, and they provide a natural-feeling fit without any undue pressure. The ambient sound setting is less natural than the best headsets out there, sounding slightly muddied and subdued, but I did like the hold-to-chat function which allowed you to activate the ambient sound setting by holding the right earpiece.</p>

<p>You can dial in a moderate amount of difference via the customisable EQ in the app, and there’s a limited number of pre-made EQ settings as well, but this is currently where the ES850NB are at their weakest. There simply isn’t the level of control or ability to make incremental changes to the audio settings that you’ll find elsewhere. In the end, I opted for the Bass Boost EQ setting, and there was still plenty of top-end detail with this setup, but if you’re the kind of person who wants to dial in a very specific sound, Edifier have some work to do.</p>
<p>There’s the added oddity that the phone app won’t update your headset’s firmware. Instead, you have to use the Edifier Tempohub on your PC or Mac, which is an unnecessary extra layer of faff, and might even lock some owners out of updating their headphones. When everyone else’s phone app can perform that function, I don’t really understand why Edifier’s doesn’t.</p>
<p>At £149.99, the ES850NB are pretty much the epitome of the mid-range. As another option in this price range, the Skull Candy Crusher ANC offer some serious bass, but they lack the refinement of the ES850NB. If you’re lucky enough to catch them in a sale though, you might want to hold out for Sony’s older XM4’s, which remain one of the best pairs of headphones ever made. They also support that all-important LDAC codec.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/supergiant-games" rel="nofollow">Supergiant Games</a>, the developers for hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/transistor-review-kill-robots-talking-sword" rel="nofollow">Transistor</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/supergiant-games/reviews" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>, never cease to amaze me. Somehow, each game they make is better than the last. So with their latest title<em>&nbsp;Hades 2,&nbsp;</em>I have to wonder how anything could top this. Yes, it's that good. With how incredible&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is, can you&nbsp;<em>imagine</em>&nbsp;what they've got cooking in the future?</p>

<p>But let's focus on the present for now.&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a Game of the Year contender, the same as its predecessor. This <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/roguelite/games" rel="nofollow">roguelite</a> -- filled with mechanical depth and wonderful, complex characters -- continues to give more and more, even after dozens of runs across many hours of gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-hecate.jpg?itok=opPfS3jt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-hecate.jpg?itok=pFLd10Cn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hecate isn't the only one with a grudge.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Hades</em>&nbsp;is Back and Better than Ever</h2>

<p><em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;expands upon what was already a meaty game in&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>. Hailed as one of the greatest in its genre,&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;provided a great deal of content as player character Zagreus fought through an Underworld directly based on Greek myth.</p>

<p>With this title stars Zagreus' sister, Melinoe, who was born after the events of the original and, due to the scheming of the Titan of Time Chronos, she was whisked away from her family at a very young age. Melinoe, along with the titaness Hecate, trained for many years in the ways of witchcraft and combat in order to take down Chronos and save both the Underworld and the other gods of Olympus.</p>

<p>Any good run in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;begins with some prep work, and that's what Hecate's base of operations is for. It's a beautiful, witchy hub where Melinoe can, among other things, conduct incantations at the cauldron to unlock new mechanics. Incantations require materials, which are acquired during your runs, so despite&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s inevitability of failure during a run, you're still making progress towards your end goal.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-incantations.jpg?itok=txCFQvlV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-incantations.jpg?itok=rw41BZmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The iconic witch's cauldron, a very useful tool.</figcaption></figure><p>Because upgrades are introduced at a natural and steady pace, I was never overwhelmed by the breadth of mechanics. There is a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;going on in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, you see, but somehow, Supergiant Games manages to make it less intimidating than it sounds.</p>

<p>You can unlock new weapons, open up new pathways, and add helpful shrines to enhance your run. Conduct the&nbsp;Propensity Toward Gold incantation to allow urns with extra gold to appear, or activate&nbsp;Faith of Familiar Spirits to acquire animal companions.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, incantations are more nuanced than many roguelites' approach to metaprogression. This makes&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>vastly more interesting in terms of gameplay, meaning that every time you unlock the ability to do a new incantation, it's actually quite exciting.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-boon-of-poseidon_0.jpg?itok=0FJcaWym 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-boon-of-poseidon_0.jpg?itok=dGtKzHpm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thank you, Uncle Poseidon.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Gifts of the Gods</h2>

<p>Beyond that, of course, is your standard run through the Underworld in your quest to defeat Chronos. This formula remains true to the original&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;in that you'll fight across a number of zones with hand-crafted rooms arranged in random order. You acquire upgrades and items after completing combat encounters in each room, creating a simple combat loop.</p>

<p>Boons will be the main source of your power here -- these are gifts from the gods that alter your abilities during a run. Like incantations, boons have more nuance to them than your typical roguelite upgrade. You might get stat increases like increased damage or power, but more often than not, boons alter the way your abilities behave.</p>

<p>For every boon you're given three choices, but there are something like two dozen boons for each god, so the possibilities with your builds feel limitless. As an example of what we're working with,&nbsp;I'd get pretty excited every time I saw a boon of Hephaestus waiting for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haphaestus-hades-2.jpg?itok=gWzIJj53 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haphaestus-hades-2.jpg?itok=T8swHtLb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Side note, I love his design.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The God of the Forge would, appropriately, buff your attacks to have blast-like effects, much like a hammer striking hot metal fresh from the forge. These blast effects deal a great amount of damage and refresh after a cooldown. Hephaestus' boons often inflict a debuff called "Glow" on enemies, which allows foes to take an increased percentage of damage.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll likely find your favorite gods and pick which boons work best for you. Personally, I'm still experimenting with possibilities even after 30 hours of playtime, and I definitely haven't seen everything boons have to offer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=64Aizidb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=_1TzNJOY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They look intimidating, but they're no match for Melinoe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Melinoe the Witch</h2>

<p>Where Zagreus felt like more of a brawler in&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, Melinoe is more like a spellcaster. She is a witch, after all, so it only makes sense for her to utilize more spells and ranged-based attacks. Thus, more of her toolkit favors ranged combat, though you're still given a number of close-ranged weapons to choose from.</p>

<p>Though the melee weapons felt way more underpowered compared to the ranged weapons in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. Why get up close and risk getting hit by an enemy when you can attack just as effectively at range? So yes, I vastly preferred keeping foes at bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of weapon variety,&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is similar to its predecessor. You're given a handful of weapons -- called Nocturnal Arms -- to choose from, which will serve as the basis for your kit. From there, these enhance your attacks, dash-strikes, and specials.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-skull.jpg?itok=XGQsqAGB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-skull.jpg?itok=CByzXfuG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using the skull on our skeletal punching bag, Schelemeus.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I preferred the Argent Skull, which is an ammo-based projectile that has a potent, long-range attack that catered to my preferred playstyle. You're given four skulls, and after shooting them, Melinoe must recover them in order to shoot again.</p>

<p>It sounds like a bit of an unconventional way to play, but I like that. Melinoe special dashes forward and grabs those skulls, so the Argent Skull has a great deal of mobility to add onto it. Grab Hephaestus' boons to alter its attacks and specials, and you're going to melt bosses!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-weapons.jpg?itok=sj-QFFFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-weapons.jpg?itok=din5BxJL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Weapons even have variants, so there is so much to unlock and use!</figcaption></figure><p>There's also the cast ability, which you're given regardless of what weapon you choose. This creates a circle on the ground that slows down enemies and can be a very beneficial tool when overwhelmed. Add on a damaging boon, and it serves as a great way to tack on debuffs and damage foes.</p>

<p>Once more adding some complexity and depth to&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s mechanics are Arcana cards, which are permanent unlocks that serve as ways to improve survivability, increase the potency of abilities, and much more. Keepsakes, gifts from gods and other characters, also aid you in&nbsp;this one, as they did in<em>&nbsp;</em>the original. By now, you can probably see what I mean when I say there's a lot going on in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2.&nbsp;</em></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mt.-olympus-hades-2.jpg?itok=IPQ6kARS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mt.-olympus-hades-2.jpg?itok=JHIXZtvn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So this is where the gods live, eh?</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking the Fight to Mt. Olympus</h2>

<p>Truth be told, there's much more to&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>than just traversing through the Underworld.&nbsp;Eventually, Melinoe gains the ability to fight on the surface in an attempt to rescue Mount Olympus from a siege. Here we have even&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>variety&nbsp;in gameplay as it introduces new level layouts, an entirely different&nbsp;set of enemies, bosses, and characters to meet as well.</p>

<p>This is where I realized that&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is more special than I initially thought. The surface is where Supergiant Games' strengths are truly leveraged. Gameplay is, as usual, wonderful, but where they truly excel is with art and sound direction, and strong character writing.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is gorgeous, and the zones are so varied. In the Underworld, Chronos' version of Tartarus has this opulent, clockwork aesthetic. Go to the surface, and you'll eventually reach the snow-capped cliffs of Mt. Olympus, which are magical in their own right, despite their beauty being marred by Chronos' attacking army.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this title brings its characters to life with some of the best character design in the business, as well as strong voice performances by its wonderful cast,&nbsp;including everyone's favorite Ben Starr as Prometheus.</p>

<p>I do want to make a point with Prometheus for a second. If you're familiar with his myth, he was essentially damned to a hellish eternity of being chained to a mountaintop while an eagle devours his innards. I didn't realize it at first, but Prometheus has a bandage around his belly along with a giant scar. As a boss, he has an eagle companion as a weapon and also uses fire (the fire makes sense, as he was the one who gave fire to humanity).</p>

<p>This is just one example of strong visual design conveying a lot about a character, but you'll see this in just about every encounter. You don't really need to know much, if anything, about Greek mythology to enjoy the writing&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;offers, though. It's well-written enough that you can intuit a character's backstory based on what they say.</p>

There's the cunning and wily Odysseus, who now acts as a tactician for Hecate. We fight Scylla, a sea monster that had a run-in with Odysseus in the past, as well as the cyclops Polyphemus, who still hasn't forgotten how Odysseus outwitted him that one time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This really scratches the surface when it comes to writing, but I'm continually amazed by how much dialogue is offered in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. There are dozens upon dozens of lines for each character, reacting to different things like how your run went, what items you have on, and the like. It's marvelous work.</p>

<p>Really, writing is very strong up until the end. I expected more of an emotional response, but I wasn't fully satisfied with how things ended. This, I realize, is a common complaint among the fandom, but there's a lot of truth to it. I won't divulge details, but I expected something more, I don't know,<em>&nbsp;</em>compelling or thought-provoking, given how strong the rest of the narrative was.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fields-hades-2.jpg?itok=z6jPCCpR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fields-hades-2.jpg?itok=1R7-zTCE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Where to go from here?</figcaption></figure><h2>Hades 2 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I know it's in a roguelites nature to be repetitive, but one additional issue I had with&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;was its boss battles. I felt the same way I did in the original, but they're just so repetitive to a point that I don't look forward to fighting them anymore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in order to roll credits, you're tasked with getting to the end of both the Underworld and the surface quite a few times, so you'll be repeating this cycle a lot. There's no simple solution to fixing this. It's a quirk from roguelites I don't really prefer, so I'd lose excitement when I knew a boss was in the next room.</p>

<p>Despite this,&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is by far the most compelling roguelite ever made. Possibly even the best, and I'm not being hyperbolic. Seriously, it's no wonder other developers try to emulate the formula, only to create something less than the inspiration. Well, with a second stab at&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, Supergiant Games one-ups itself with an even better version of the game that shook up the genre.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shovel-knight-devs-mina-the-hollower-delayed-indefinitely.1318501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shovel Knight&nbsp;</em>developer Yacht Club Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, its upcoming retro-style top-down action-adventure game, has been delayed indefinitely.</p>

<p>Announcing the delay in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Yacht Club says that despite "working tirelessly day and night to finish"&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">intended October 31st release date</a>, the development team is "just not quite there yet".</p>

<p>According to the studio, the delay in question won't be "major"; it'll simply be an opportunity to "apply some final polish and balancing" to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is ready for primetime when it releases. However, no new release date was revealed, so we don't know when the game will actually be arriving.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mina-the-hollower-delayed-gameplay.jpg?itok=Wm58zpnJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mina-the-hollower-delayed-gameplay.jpg?itok=ucqr7VGp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>isn't going to launch in time for Halloween, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club says it doesn't want to announce a new release date until&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>has been submitted for approval across all of the platforms on which it's intended to appear, beseeching fans to "hang tight as we reach the finish line".</p>

<p>As for what's actually being done during the final hours of development, Yacht Club says the team is currently working on issues like finalizing design and art, game balance, and implementing localization, as well as "eating cheese". Well, that's a noble reason for a delay in my books.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is, it's the next title developed by&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight&nbsp;</em>outfit Yacht Club Games, which has also branched out into publishing with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yacht-club-games-announce-8-bit-platformer-cyber-shadow" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Cyber Shadow</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game revolves around the titular Mina, who must traverse Tenebrous Isle in order to rescue it from a curse. It utilizes deliberately retro-style graphics, just like&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight</em>, but this time, the vibe is much more&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>than&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>.</p>




<p>We don't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it's set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875580/Mina_the_Hollower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Mina-the-Hollower-2887867.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Mina-the-Hollower-2887790.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.

            <p>I was rubbing along pretty well in House Of Necrosis before I hurled a vial of unidentified black serum at a squashy purple Devourer. I was hoping the serum would be some kind of poison - I mean, come on, an unidentified black serum? You wouldn't pour that on your chips. It turned out to be an XP potion, which transformed the Devourer into a Foul Devourer - still squashy, still purple, but with much sturdier defence.</p>
<p>I managed to recover some of the accidentally donated XP by lobbing a cheeky hex, but not enough to boost the stopping power of my homely pawnshop knife and pistol. So down I went in a pool of that special red serum the billionaires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/13/rich-men-longevity-history">like to drink</a> when they're feeling mortal.</p><!--more-->
<p>Imagine if this had happened while you were playing the original Resident Evil on PS1. Imagine hurling a bottle of unspecified weirdness into the blindspot immediately after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ntFBVXqPg">the Hunter's first appearance</a>, and hearing a cheery level-up chime. You'd have ripped the power cable out of the wall. You'd have sworn to track down Shinji Mikami and make him eat his own socks. Unless, that is, you'd already played a few Mystery Dungeon games, which do this kind of nonsense all the time.</p>

<p>I described House Of Necrosis as "OG Resident Evil but turn-based" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-battlefield-6-fends-off-an-onslaught-of-cool-indie-rpgs-strategy-games-horror-games-and-piss-simulators">the latest Mawmouth</a>, which isn't inaccurate but (as reader SeekerX pointed out) omits plenty. This neato <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is a tribute to both Capcom and Spike Chunsoft. It sees you exploring a zombie mansion made up of grid-based floor layouts full of randomly distributed enemies, treasures and traps. You've got to find the next floor while sprucing your stats and gathering items. </p><p>It's a game of pleasurable/maddening occult surprises. For example, I was spared death at the claws of an AOE-slopping boss monster by a teleport trap, which whisked me off to a room stocked with green herbs. Thankfully, these do exactly what you're expecting. For people who can't get enough of that old-timey survival horror, there's also a hub environment with proper tank controls.</p>
<p>House Of Necrosis is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005870/House_of_Necrosis/">out now on Steam</a>, still has a demo at the time of writing, and seems jolly, going by the early user reviews. I did enjoy my brief time with the Foul Devourer, though I feel like the game's devout 32-bit murkiness may wear out its welcome, next to the crisper anime stylings of regular Mystery Dungeon. Shame it doesn't appear to be Steam Deck Verified - this feels like it would make a fine portable play. You can also find developer Warkus on <a href="https://warrrkus.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> - they're certainly fond of fifth generation consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-the-iphone%E2%80%AF17-amazon-is-offloading-the-new-pixel%E2%80%AF10-for-2x-cheaper-this-prime-day.1318492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The new Google Pixel 10 just landed, and if you’ve been eyeing a phone that can keep up with your daily chaos while delivering pro-level photos without the pro-level hassle, this deal is hard to ignore. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/">just dropped the price of the 128GB model to $649 for Prime members, down from $799</a>. That’s a rare discount on a flagship device that literally came out weeks ago and is already going toe-to-toe with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4585/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Pixel 10 is Different</h2>
<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Actua display is a major strength</strong>: With a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, you actually get to see what’s on your display when you’re outdoors under direct sunlight, no longer squinting or covering the phone with your hand to view a text message. The display is covered by Corning’s scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the phone boasts an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>The camera system is where Google shows off: That improved triple rear camera array now boasts a 5x telephoto lens, driving its Super Res Zoom to a whopping 20x, so you can snap clear, sharp shots of your child’s soccer goal from across the sideline, for example, or of that street musician across the courtyard without your picture ending up a grainy mess. Night Sight, meanwhile, still wows by delivering clean, clear images even when lighting is awful, say, indoors at a poorly lit restaurant or after a sunset walk. A new feature called <em>Camera Coach</em> also provides real-time advice to assist with nailing your composition and exposures so it’s not a guessing game of being on manual mode nor pure auto mode.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life sits at 24-plus hours</strong> on a single charge with fast-charging support, so you’re not tethered to an outlet by mid-afternoon. This is an unlocked Android phone, giving you full freedom to switch carriers whenever you want and choose your own data plan. It works seamlessly with Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and other major carriers, so you’re not locked into one ecosystem or stuck with a device that only plays nice with a single network.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini AI integration is where the Pixel 10 moves ahead of the pack</strong>. Instead of having to type out every question or task, you’re free to speak naturally via Gemini Live. Point your camera at something interesting, like an unknown plant on a hike or a sea creature at the aquarium, and Gemini will identify it and give you context. You’re also free to chat with Gemini to brainstorm ideas, compose an email, schedule your day, or have things done across multiple apps without having to manually switch between each one. It’s an assistant kind of feature that is useful as opposed to gimmicky.</p>
<p>This obsidian version of the 128GB model is just offered at this market for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and as new as the Pixel 10 is, a discount like this is rare. Make sure you don’t miss it.</p>
