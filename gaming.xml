			<p>Xbox president and chief executive officer, Sarah Bond, has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-is-100-percent-looking-at-making-things-in-the-future-says-president/">put down any notions from players wondering if Xbox is still making consoles and hardware</a>. A next-gen Xbox is on the way; there's seemingly no question about it. Questions about <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">what will be packed into that new box and what it'll look like</a>, however, won't be answered anytime soon. Though, according to Bond in a new interview, we can expect it to be three things: a "<em>very premium, very high-end, curated experience</em>." It's also worth noting that those three probably also mean a fourth thing: very expensive.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8&amp;t=377s">interview with Mashable</a>, discussing the ROG Xbox Ally X handheld that ASUS created in collaboration with Xbox and Microsoft, Mashable asks Bond if they could say anything about next-gen Xbox hardware, and if they can comment on rumours floating around that Microsoft is looking to make the next-genertion of Xbox hardware some kind of inbetween a console and a PC.</p>



<p>Essentially, taking the experience you get on an ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X handheld, where you can play your Steam, GOG, BattleNet, EA Play, etc., games, and your Xbox games on one device. That's the rumour, anyway, that Mashable refers to.</p>

<iframe title="ROG Xbox Ally X Hands-On Interview with Xbox CEO, Sarah Bond" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=377&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The beginning of Bond's response is a comment on what Mashable had already said about the next-gen hardware, saying, "<em>Well, I can tell you you're right, that the next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end, curated experience.</em>"</p>



<p>Then, while gesturing to the ROG Xbox Ally X sitting between her and Mashable's tech editor, Bond continues, "<em>You're starting to see some of the thinking that we have in this handheld, but I don't want to give it all away</em>."</p>



<p>On the one hand, this is simply an executive hyping up her company's next major product. Of course she'll say it'll a "<em>premium, very high-end</em>" experience. On the other hand, her short comment regarding how we're already starting to see where Microsoft and Xbox are thinking of moving its hardware forward in the ROG Xbox Ally X, is arguably the most interesting part of this. </p>



<p>An Xbox console where you can access and play all the games in your PC gaming library across multiple PC launchers and digital storefronts, that delivers a console experience for your PC games, does sound like exactly the kind of thing that could make Xbox consoles interesting again.</p>



<p>If the rumours are to be believed, we'll see if that'll be reality sometime around 2027. In other Xbox hardware news, after Microsoft raised the prices of the consoles players buy in stores, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">it also raised the price of Xbox development kits for game developers</a>. If you're looking for more on the ROG Xbox Ally X, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">you can check out my review of the device</a>, as well as my <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">interview with two ASUS executives who confirm that the ROG Xbox Ally line of handhelds is the way forward for ASUS and its ROG handheld devices</a>. </p>

The bull riding simulator was reviewed poorly at the few sites that actually covered it, and the late PS2 release was quickly forgotten. Just another bad game. But one copy of this long-forgotten game is sitting in a Walmart in Delaware, still wrapped in plastic and waiting to find a home.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ps2/comments/1o8qh14/surprised_to_see_a_ps2_game_at_walmart/">Reddit user KingTRoss shared on the PS2 subreddit</a> that they had discovered an unsold copy of <em>PBR: Out of the Chute</em> at Walmart. It was still in shrink wrap, sported an old Walmart price tag of $15 that was starting to peel off, and was hidden among newer PS5 and PS4 games like a little Easter egg from the past waiting to be found.</p></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/unsold-ps2-game-walmart-reddit-pbr-bull-riding-weird-reddit-2000637727]]></content:encoded>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Did you know that Steam has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong">snazzy-looking Deck-focused landing pages</a> for games that are “Verified” on the device? The pages have existed since at least 2023 but, as <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/games-getting-brand-new-steam-deck-verified-pages/"><i>Steam Deck HQ </i>notes</a>, Valve may be ramping up the degree to which they encourage developers to promote them. Before a game even gets one, though, it needs to secure that coveted “Verified” rating. Valve actually has four criteria to determine whether or not a game should earn the badge. A game should: have no issues with middleware (such as anti-cheat software), launch without trouble or compatibility warnings, be fully playable via a gamepad, and, lastly, should “have good default settings, and text should be legible.”</p> <p>What defines “good default settings” is probably open to some level of interpretation, but any way you slice it, for all their sleek visual appeal, these pages are misleading. The problem is that these landing pages feature the trailers for their respective games embedded into an image of a Steam Deck, which in my opinion gives a really false impression of how some games run. Sure, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/datablob.studio/post/3m3ozg4vs4c2t">as developer datablob notes on BlueSky</a>, in theory this gives a decent impression of how a game might look on the Deck, but just observe <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH"><i>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</i>’s Steam Deck Verified landing page</a>.</p>

 <p>The page plays the default trailer from the Steam Page which is clearly running on a much more powerful PC than the Steam Deck. Yes, there’s a tiny disclaimer at the bottom that says the footage was “Captured on PC” and not Steam Deck, but still, the context makes it easy to imagine the game running at such high fidelity and framerate on the Deck.</p>

 <p>To be sure, I double-checked and spun up <i>Rebirth</i> on my Steam Deck and, nope, it still doesn’t look that great. And <i>Rebirth</i> isn’t the only game guilty of this. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2457220/Avowed"><i>Avowed</i>’s Steam Deck landing page</a> also shows the game performing at a level of fidelity that it simply cannot on the Deck.</p> <div id="gallery-1"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000637696"> 				© Screenshot: Square Enix / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000637695"> 				© Screenshot: Square Enix / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>The recently released <i>Ninja Gaiden 4</i> also has this problem, and the subtitle text in the game isn’t what I’d consider legible enough on the Deck’s smaller screen. It does run at a respectable framerate, but it definitely doesn’t look as sharp on the Deck as it does in this simulated experience on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4">the game’s landing page</a>.</p> <div id="gallery-2"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000637746"> 				© Team Ninja / PlatinumGames / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000637745"> 				© Team Ninja / PlatinumGames / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>I’m sure in the future, when the Deck gets its inevitable upgrade, it may run these specific games in a way that matches how they’re portrayed on their landing pages. But at that point, will there be new GPU-melting games that are beyond its capabilities, that are earning these badges and being featured in misleading ways on advertising pages? The Steam Deck deserves far more honesty.</p>

                <p>Despite what you might hear online, Microsoft is indeed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">working on a next-generation Xbox</a>. While it's far too early for the Xbox team to share anything concrete about this upcoming machine, Xbox President Sarah Bond teased some vague details about what to expect.</p><p>Speaking to Mashable in a video interview, Bond addressed rumors that the next Xbox will function similarly to a gaming PC, saying that "the next-gen console is gonna be a very premium, very high-end curated experience."</p><p>Bond added that with the recently released handheld ROG Xbox Ally, we're "starting to see some of the thinking that [the Xbox team has], but I don't want to give it all away."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="377">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=377" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Even with Xbox Series X|S struggling in sales numbers compared to PlayStation 5, it would be shocking if the next console from Microsoft were anything but a "premium" and "high-end" device. But Bond's comment about a "curated experience" should inspire speculation, as she didn't directly address murmurs of the next Xbox being PC-like.</p><p>Executives on the Xbox team have previously stated that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">company is focused on building dedicated devices</a> with optimized gaming experiences, with the ROG Xbox Ally being a big part of that initiative. The new handheld emphasizes the Xbox full-screen-experience UI, which also allows users to access games from other PC storefronts, such as Steam. Bringing this interface and functionality to a console would mark a wholly different approach from the competition.</p><p>Of course, based on what we've seen of the Xbox full-screen experience, the software needs a lot more work. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">impressions of the ROG Xbox Ally</a> described the operating system as "undoubtedly frustrating" to use.</p><p>No matter how flexible or functional the next Xbox console might be, Xbox still needs to win back some goodwill from consumers after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">price hikes for the Xbox Series X|S consoles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has acquired another board game IP. Specifically, the tabletop publishing giant has acquired the rights to the cosmic horror board game <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em> from the struggling tabletop studio CMON. This may hint that Asmodee is investing in crowdfunding.</p>

<h2>Asmodee's Acquisition of <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em></h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/10/20/asmodee-continues-push-into-crowdfunding-by-buying-cthulhu-death-may-die-series-from-struggling-cmon/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, Asmodee has bought the rights to <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em> from CMON for an undisclosed amount of money. As part of this acquisition, Asmodee will fulfill the Gamefound campaign for the latest expansion for the board game, <em>Forbidden Reaches</em>, which raised more than $3.9 million last December.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cthulhu-death-may-die-game-board.jpg?itok=zgf4RBTc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cthulhu-death-may-die-game-board.jpg?itok=lMorj_ib 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em> is the second of CMON's IPs that Asmodee has acquired, following the co-op zombie game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a>. This is due to CMON's ongoing financial struggles as a result of reckless, disruptive trade tariffs devastating the industry.</p>

<p>The resulting trade and production chaos has led to the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reducing staff</a>, adding extra charges for certain backers, and selling off other IP such as <em>Rising Sun</em> and <em>Blood Rage</em>.</p>

<p>Notably, a lot of CMON's board game library were a result of crowdfunding. Given the recent acquisitions and the hiring of CMON former COO David Preti to Asmodee's new crowdfunding and miniatures operation, it is a strong possibility the tabletop giant may be looking to crowdfunding platforms for certain future projects.</p>

<p>As a result of these financial issues, CMON has announced it will be moving away from large box, miniature-focused board game experiences. Instead, tey will be pivoting to small box games released directly to retail.</p>

<p>Cthulhu: Death May Die was originally developed in 2018 via Kickstarter campaign. Since then, the board game has received critical acclaim and several crowdfunded expansions such as Fear of the Unknown and R'lyeh Rising. The game was designed by Rob Davlau (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pendemic-legacy-season-2-review-infectious" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic Legacy</em></a>, <em>Unmatched: Cobble and Fog</em>) and Eric Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect: The Board Game</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>)</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea.1330852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) and Battlefield Studios have pushed out an update that nerfs XP bot farming in Battlefield 6 portal lobbies.</p>



<p>While portal lobbies will give players a 150% match completion bonus, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1980703722800886102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they no longer</a> offer Mastery XP or challenge completions. This nerf only impacts those lobbies that have bots enabled.</p>



<p>When Battlefield 6 launched, many players used bot-filled lobbies within the portal to quickly rank up their weapons and complete challenges. That resulted in debate among players on social media about whether it was something that should be allowed. Then, a week after the game’s release, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put out a statement</a> saying that a review of data found that <strong>“a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.”</strong></p>



<p>While they “completely understand” why these lobbies were made, EA said that it made it “noticeably harder” for players to play in lobbies that offered a genuine Battlefield 6 experience. This led the company to announce plans to make adjustments to the portal that would limit the number of XP farms that used available server space.</p>



<p>“Whether that’s Hardcore Conquest, All-Out Warfare, longer matches, or your favorite community-created experience, we want you to be able to find and enjoy it easily with your friends as you play your way together,” EA said at the time.</p>







<p>As expected with a major change like this, the reactions have been a bit mixed. While the overall feedback on social has been generally positive, with players calling the update “excellent news” and “as it should be”, there are those who aren’t happy about it.</p>



<p>The chief complaint among those upset involves the <a href="https://x.com/Jaidenatoor11/status/1980709454145536371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty and length of time</a> it takes to complete various weapon challenges and unlock attachments. EA has said, however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-progression-issues-and-xp-leveling-will-be-addressed-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that updates to progression</a> are coming as early as this week. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Double Dragon Revive Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/double-dragon-revive-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/double-dragon-revive-review.1330849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of Ninja Gaiden's own 2D revival with the excellent Ragebound, Double Dragon Revive comes off more like a tribute band for the series rather than a proper reunion tour. It doesn't play the hits how you remember it, instead putting its own spin on things – from how it looks, to how it sounds, to how it plays. All of those aspects not only fail to live up to my admittedly mild expectations for a new Double Dragon, but after hours of its out of tune meandering, started to cement the idea that maybe we should put a little more distance between attempts to revitalize this series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I've been playing these games for most of my life it's sort of jarring how straightforward Double Dragon Revive is. Side scrollers of this arcadey, "belt scroll" variety have found a lot of ways to spice up the “punch your way to the right” recipe, and Revive seems interested in keeping as much of that new seasoning away from its plate as possible. It's a basic protein packed with eight non-branching levels, accompanied by starchy combat that's filling but has barely any sauce.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up any of the four playable characters is simple and intuitive, with normal attack strings that can be mashed out on one button alongside special attacks and hyper blows that can be used to punctuate these combos, or in some instances extend your offense into wall bouncing juggles. All of these actions are unique to each fighter. Well, Billy and Jimmy Lee have distinctions that don't translate into mechanical differences, but former damsel-turned-headkicker Marian and ninja frenemy Ranzo have attacks that are a little more flashy and utilitarian. I rarely felt it necessary to use more than basic combo loops on Normal difficulty, though. As long as an enemy didn't have an annoying shield or hyper armor protecting them as they wound up a big attack (something ubiquitous in the later levels), they were reliably vulnerable to a good old fashioned fist to the face. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are limited options for those who do want to attempt to style on these street thugs, but they all rely on bouncing enemies off of walls to keep them in the air long enough to string more hits together as they come down. It often felt like enemies kind of just went wherever they wanted after a launch or a throw as opposed to where you directed them to go, making a laborious task out of trying to set up simple combo extensions, jamming enemies into background environmental hazards that take them out of the fight instantly, or taking advantage of the super powerful wall strike and wall crash options. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It rarely felt necessary to use more than basic combo loops on Normal difficulty.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no air combos to be had either, so chasing a launched bad guy skyward only allows you a single, disappointing smash down to earth so you can wait for them to stand up and let you hit them again. Everyone can get a free hit on downed enemies, if you can finagle the finicky button prompt to do so that is unresponsive and unreliable. If there's the right kind of wall around – the right kind being the one they decide is right based on no reliable context clues – you can do a super sized air dropping attack, but even getting the wall kick off that's required to get the requisite height is a dice roll. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone has powerful, screen clearing finishing blow attacks that are charged up by all the fisticuffs, with boosts given when you make a timely dodge, counter an enemy’s big attack, or grow your combo meter. But no playable character, not even with Ranzo's cool explosive kunai or Marian’s charging knee, can make Revive’s combat feel special, or even interesting, across long stretches of time. It took me around three hours to finish my first playthrough, and I lost interest well before then, with three more playthroughs after that, one for each playable character.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Double Dragon Revive Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, enemy variety is at least diverse and effective at making you use the small menu of options you have. As levels progress, old bad guys show up to mingle with the newer ones to form a sort of street thug gumbo that can get a little spicy towards the end of your run. It’s largely a numbers game, with you often getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of incoming blows from all angles. I liked the little brain puzzle of having to identify the most dangerous threat to take out first, or needing to figure out the most efficient way to wrangle as many folks as possible into a big attack, but it wasn’t beguiling enough for me to forget that the process of breaking these dudes down was still rather dull. Even the array of limited use weapons, though strong tools usually worth the effort to grab if things get hairy, are your standard fare knives, two-by-fours, sledgehammers, etc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the challenge escalates, some of Revive’s jank becomes an enemy of its own. Small things, like the direction of your character sometimes defaulting to the opposite direction inexplicably, stops being a quirk to work around and starts being the reason you drop a combo or get punished.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemy variety is at least diverse, but breaking dudes down is still rather dull.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bosses break the monotony up a little bit, introducing slightly more engaging stage hazards and pattern mechanics, like Linda, who you need to shake off of the pillars she’s hiding on top off before you can attack her directly. These get pretty brutal towards the end, though, specifically the chapter seven boss, which has to be the most aggravating fight I’ve maybe ever played in one of these games – truly a test of endurance against a ceaseless onslaught of the most cheating cheaters the game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s not a lot of flash visually, either. Most character models look good, but the fire, wind, and dragon effects that come from their limbs when channeling their chi looks a step behind in quality. Camera work and sound design come together adequately to make big hits feel good and all that jazz. The sound track is decent, with a handful original riffy rockouts and remixes of old series jams that sound good in the moment but sort of leave your head immediately after they end. Overall, Double Dragon Revive lacks the visual identity that the 16-bit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-review">Double Dragon Gaiden</a> and even pastel-punk Double Dragon Neon have, let alone its peers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-review">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> from this year. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett’s Favorite Beat-Em-Ups</h3><p>The obviously definitive list of games where violence is the answer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The stages you bash your way through run a much broader gamut. A colorful Japanese pagoda-style tower with a fun little perspective shift mid-way through is simple but much more stirring than a non-descript highway level, even if there is a wrestling ring at the end of it. Some of these zones require some platforming that I was never happy to see but in mercifully short bursts. It’s a bit of an eye-roll that most of these stages are just takes on series staple locations without much novel flair added this time around, but it’s truly disappointing how many of these locations are just bland and lifeless.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And not to be one of those “the story in this beat 'em up sucks” sort of freaks, but I mean, it does. It's less that the plot is nonsense, the characters are bland, and the writing is lousy and more that Revive lacks the confident and chaotic energy that is necessary to sell this sort of thing to begin with. The post-apocalyptic villain of Neon was a gang-leading demon knight straight out of a heavy metal album cover named Skullmaggedon. The gang struggles in Gaiden made that version of New York City feel like Gotham City, complete with goons color-coded and themed after their outlandish bosses. By comparison, Revive is just a completely tame and underwhelming take on returning villains Willy and Raymond, who used black magic and the military industrial complex to experiment on people and make the Sousetsuken kid’s lives worse. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Double Dragon Revive feels less like a return to glory that its title might suggest, and more like a police sketch of someone trying to describe what the series they loved looked like from memory. There’s the important details you’d need to identify it by – simple combat with big super attacks, peacocking bad guys of all shapes and sizes, the subway, casino, and elevator stages required by law to be in games like this – but none of it feels distinct or special, and the parts in which it's passable get held back by wonky, unresponsive controls and maddening difficulty spikes. Revival suggests reinvigoration, but this feels more like exhuming a shambling corpse.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/double-dragon-revive-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/classic-fps-painkiller-returns-with-a-modern-reimagining.1330843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gothic first-person shooter Painkiller first graced our screens in 2004, and it built a cult following thanks to its fast pace, dark atmosphere, weapon arsenal, and intense combat. Now it’s back with a modern reimagining with the same name from developer Anshar Studios and publisher 3D Realms that’s out now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with Painkiller, the central concept is you play as someone trapped in Purgatory because of your previous transgressions, but you get a mission to redeem yourself and earn your way into Heaven. In this reimagined version, that mission is simple: stop the fallen angel Azazel and his three children, the Nephilim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that’s the explanation for the setting, this isn’t a narrative-focused game. It’s all about action, all the time. So really, your mission can be summed up in even simpler terms: kill as many demons and horrors as you can, in whatever brutal way you choose.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/facing-the-horde-1760549932297.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll always have a three-person team, which you can form by teaming up with people in online co-op or by playing offline with bot teammates. Between missions (called raids here) you’ll return to a hub area called Purgatory’s Crossing, where you’ll choose your loadout before jumping into the next raid. That starts with picking one of four characters: Ink, Void, Sol, or Roch, each of whom has a unique perk. Ink has better health restoration, Void does more weapon damage, Sol has higher ammo capacity, and Roch has increased max health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of who you choose, speed, agility, and weaponry are the primary focus of combat. You’ll start the game with the classic Painkiller weapon, which will be a permanent part of your loadout on every raid. Its alt fire mode, called the Shredder, can shred enemies (hence the name) and also acts as a grappling hook. You can use it on designated grappling points to traverse biomes quickly, or you can use it directly on enemies. Be careful of using it on tougher enemies though, they’ll retaliate if they’re not stunned first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the permanent Painkiller weapon, you can take two other weapons with you on every raid, which you can switch out in the hub area. You’ll get your first two weapons automatically during the prologue, while the rest can be unlocked in the order you choose. There are six selectable weapons in total (not counting the Painkiller), each of which has a main firing mode and two alt fire modes that you can swap between before each raid.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/dark-chains-1760549973072.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So that’s 18 firing modes, and you can unlock upgrades for each weapon that modify how it works, bringing that total up to 72 different attack types. You unlock things by gathering ancient souls from finishing raids, which can then be spent in the hub area. You can use them to unlock new weapons, alternate shots, or upgrades, so your loadout will consistently evolve as the game goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Painkiller weapon isn’t the only one that fans of the series will recognize. The Stakegun and Electrodriver also make their return, and they’re the two starting weapons you’ll unlock in the prologue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stakegun can impale enemies and launch different types of grenades as alternate shots, and just like in the original game, you can combine these two capabilities if you’re skilled enough to pull it off. The range of the primary stake shot is longer than the grenades, so you can fire a grenade and then hit it with the stake in mid-air to carry the grenade farther.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Electrodriver is for dealing with larger groups. It has electric shock attacks that stun enemies, and it can fire a set of bouncing shuriken that can ricochet around corners or past enemy shields. Combo those two together, and you have a recipe for clearing out hordes of enemies quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/electric-attack-1760549993116.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all of the weapons are returning classics. The new Handcannon is a powerful handgun focused on hitscan precision. If your aim is on point, it has very high DPS potential. You can also modify it with a scope to turn it into a sniper-style weapon if you so choose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of weapon modifications and alt fire options, you can also customize gameplay with tarot cards that enhance your abilities. You use gold collected in raids to unlock new cards in the Tarot Lottery in the hub area, and you can select cards to activate before you start a new raid. That card’s benefits will stay active for the entire next raid, then be used up, but you can use ancient souls to replenish one if you want to reuse it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are currently 44 tarot cards, and they can have a wide range of effects. Some are passive and always active, others react to particular enemies, and others require certain conditions to activate. For example, Angel’s Torment allows you to one-shot kill any regular enemy that’s thrown in the air. Demon’s Payload spawns explosive barrels when you kill a large demon. Crimson Cadence gradually heals you as long as you keep your combo count above a certain threshold.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/giant-enemy-1760550016212.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Other tarot cards affect your teammates, so you and your allies can try to find synergies that combine together well. For example, Harmonic Torment allows you to share your health with allies and Revenant’s Veil causes enemies to ignore you while you’re reviving downed teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just a taste of the different types of weapons, modifications, and tarot cards available. The rest you’ll have to discover for yourself. Painkiller is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Netflix is making various films and TV series based on Catan, the world-renowned multiplayer board game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Catan, players take on the roles of settlers who try to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. It carries the tagline: “Trade. Build. Settle.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/catan-movies-tv-series-netflix-1236557703/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Netflix has secured the global rights to Catan, and plans to release various projects in both live-action and animation. There’s talk of film and scripted and unscripted TV. All projects will be produced by Darren Kyman from Asmodee (which recently split from Embracer), Pete Fenlon of Catan Studios, and Guido and Benjamin Teuber, the sons of Catan inventor Klaus Teuber.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teuber first published The Settlers of Catan in Germany in 1995. It would go on to become one of the biggest board games ever, selling over 40 million copies. He died aged 70 in 2023.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/21/gettyimages-2203024999-1761065144441.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Netflix is all-in on Catan. Photo by Marijan Murat/picture alliance via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Benjamin and Guido Teuber, co-CEOs of Catan GmbH, offered the following comment: “When our father Klaus Teuber first introduced Catan 30 years ago, he imagined an aspirational world where people would gather by trading, building and settling together — both at the table and beyond it. This collaboration with Netflix marks an exciting new chapter in that journey. For three decades, Catan has connected families and friends around the world. Now, we’re thrilled to see it inspire storytelling on a global stage — staying true to our father’s vision of creativity, strategy and human connection.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no release window for any Catan projects, nor any details on what those projects will be. But it’s clear Netflix sees huge value in projects based on board games and video games, following a string of successes. Indeed, Netflix struck a deal for the rights to Monopoly from Hasbro Entertainment earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Marijan Murat/picture alliance via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes finding the correct box set for your Strike Team in Star Wars: Shatterpoint can be hard. But don't worry because we have you covered on that front, with a series of expansions that you should be keeping your eyes on to help you dominate the galaxy (or table). I just r<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-shatterpoint-fall-2025-expansions-elegant-weapon-for-more-civilized-0" rel="nofollow">eviewed some newer releases from the line</a>, and now Asmodee USA sent me review copies of all the expansions mentioned below, so let's take a quick look!</p>

<h2>Plans And Preparations</h2>

<p>Admittedly, one of the main reasons that lured me towards this box was that it had Clone Commandos attached. This more or less worked in my favor because one of the main factions I'm trying to stick with is the Galactic Republic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=GproN-PH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=Z501NKsD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of plans.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the keywords for the characters in this unit buff other Galactic Republic/Jedi characters. If you already have the Hello There or This Party's Over box, you can easily pair them together for real damage. If you want to get creative with it, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli works well with virtually anyone in the Galactic Republic without trying too hard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=Ndmh7iA0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=hcRH5bkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of preparation.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps the thing I appreciated about this set was how dynamic the Clone minis were. They're posed extremely well, and one even comes with some slight cover to help make it feel more alive. Little details like that really help bring the whole set together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=ipzF1Nkn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=fVgUdLpd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Best boys.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches of Dathomir</h2>

<p>The Witches of Dathomir is a really interesting one, because they don't have a lot of synergy with many other troops, and the only one with the Separatist Alliance keyword is Savage Orpress.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=zzAmPxMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=gX7TzRrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just in time for spooky season.</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, it's not all doom and gloom because everyone in this set does share the Force User keyword, so you can pair them up with others who buff characters with the same trait. With all of that said, though, I still couldn't think of a more fun unit to play. Mother Talzin has a lot of incredible abilities that buff other characters with the Dathomiran keyword, one of which allows them to heal right after a character has been injured. While Savage Opress is about getting up close and personal, the Nightsister Acolytes can support from afar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=dRXPipsV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=yXPbSZu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get this guy up close for some serious damage.</figcaption></figure><p>This set, in particular, caters to many different play styles while encouraging you to try something new. Even if you're not entirely sold on them, each character in this unit can pack a serious punch in combat, and they are all some of the best models in the game. And I had the most fun when it came to painting these.</p>



<p>If I'm being perfectly honest, I had no business getting this set at all. The reason why I got this was 100% based on the rule of cool. Because if having a squad full of Ewoks fighting Vader and friends doesn't sound like a good time, I don't know what does.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=9jWTjk75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=AGudJd4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Yubs.</figcaption></figure><p>What's unique about this set is that it comes with five models, but the trade-off is that each doesn't have a lot of health, so you have to be smart about how you use them. Thankfully, each character in this team is stacked to the brim with all sorts of abilities, and it does a great job at capturing the guerilla warfare vibes we see them do in the film.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=rqBk4szT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=fodno0Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Nubs.</figcaption></figure><p>To make things even better, they have a Battle Tactic card centered on trapping your opponent in one way or another. The only downside to this squad is that most of the synergy is based around other Ewoks, so if you pair them up with anything else, you won't get a lot of mileage out of them.</p>

<h2>High Ground Terrain Pack</h2>

<p>Terrain is one of those things that you can never have too much of, and the High Ground is a perfect addition for any game. As the name suggests, it offers a lot of elevated areas for your strike team to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=MRfUKqdV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=_EvrtvZJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They said the thing!</figcaption></figure><p>The one thing I especially enjoy about this set is the four bridges it comes with, because it adds an extra layer to a fight when the objective marker is right below you. The great thing with Shatterpoint Terrain is that each pack can be perfectly paired with the other. They all fit together more or less like a puzzle piece, so you never really have to worry about one set being out of place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=r0fpMagl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=XxQDRpV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is great for having a lot of elevated fights.</figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully, this tiny list made things a bit easier for you when deciding what to purchase in Star Wars: Shatterpoint. Many of these units can be used in various ways and offer unique play styles that encourage you to try new things. As I previously said, you can never go wrong with terrain because each offers something unique that adds flavor to the fight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The galaxy is under threat from the brutal aliens known as the Komplex, and humanity's only hope are the pilots of the Forge, an elite squadron of ships with interchangeable parts that allow them to adapt to any situation, known as Snap Ships. In this article, we'll check out the <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> Starter Box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-2.jpg?itok=wGAkaFS4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-2.jpg?itok=j38D-XMX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> Starter Box contains 2 ships, 1 for each faction, that can be built in a variety of ways.</figcaption></figure><h2>Ships That Snap?</h2>

<p>Before there was <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>, there were <em>Snap Ships</em>, customisable ships that players could build from the multitude of options available. These ships, like other building-style toys, have instructions to build fixed builds, or players are able to create their own freestyle ideas.</p>

<p>The starter set contains 2 ships, 1 from each of the 2 factions (Komplex and Forge), with over 100 individual parts and 8 possible builds (4 for each). The different elements of the ships fit together very cleanly, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-6.jpg?itok=5cCjN_gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-6.jpg?itok=5ECgtg7T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each part card has a corresponding physical part for which to build your Snap Ship.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Much Tactics?</h2>

<p><em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> is a tabletop wargame ruleset that allows you to pit your creations against others. At a glance, it feels very much like a lite version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow">Star Wars X-Wing</a>, but with much larger ships, and more choices for each ship each turn, because the interchangeable parts for the ships aren't just cosmetic. Each part also has a card that gives part actions you can perform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-7.jpg?itok=705IBcic 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-7.jpg?itok=VrD4AWWE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>To preform the C6-3 Gatling Gun attack, you need to put 2 power and 1 heat on the part, which then allows you to roll 6 attack dice.</figcaption></figure><p>Each turn in <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>, when you activate a ship, you complete the chassis actions for that ship, fixed actions such as venting to remove power and heat cubes from a part card, or the fixed minimum movement for your ship. You can then perform part actions, which have a power/heat cost for which cubes of the corresponding type are added to the part card when used. Each chassis has a fixed number of power cubes, and you can complete as many actions as you have power cubes for. A part with any type of cube on it can't be used, so you need to plan each turn when venting cubes from cards.</p>

<p>Multiple types of actions can be performed each turn, depending on your part cards, from extra movement, attacks, repair, evade, ramming, reactions (played in your opponent's turn in response to their action) and launch actions, such as firing missiles, which take longer to hit than standard attacks, and allows you opponent time to take anti-missile actions in their turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-3.jpg?itok=T-zcyfUz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-3.jpg?itok=Kg_qS3Q6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> movement tool has a short and long movement part, and notches to align turning.</figcaption></figure><p>The movement and attack mechanics are kept simple using custom dice and all the required details on the part cards. Attacks use custom D10s, with the to-hit number and number of dice detailed by the attack card, which is usually modified by your opponent's evasion value. Movement happens using a custom movement tool with handy clicks for rotation and short and long movement lengths that the ship's bases fit into.</p>

<p>The game itself is pretty fun, and the turn flow works well, with plenty of choices for actions depending on your ship's build. The ships feel massive compared to other dog-fight style wargames, which is fine in the 1 vs 1 of the starter set, but it probably limits the number of ships you'll be able to play with by the size of the surface you have to play on. It's also worth noting that in a 1 vs 1 game, it's almost entirely decided by which ship can complete the tightest turn after the first pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-5.jpg?itok=VdUomkOb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-5.jpg?itok=QOlmxV0_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The cards above detail 2 possible build options for the KLAW Interceptor in <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>Customization!</h2>

<p>Out of the starter set, there are a few options for different builds. Both ships have 4 core chassis, which don't change the ship's core stats, but instead offer a different passive ability, like the default Sabre XF-23 Fighter, which allows you to choose which part is disabled on the first critical hit, or the Sabre XR-01 Fast Recon, which can rotate for free after you complete a long move.</p>

<p>The real customisation comes from the part cards, of which each ship gets 14. The cockpit for both is fixed, but there are 2 thrusters and 2 wing choices for both fighters, and 9 system parts to fill out the final 3 part cards. The systems cards are your weapons, armor, and fins for extra maneuverability, allowing you to choose to fully kit out your ship with 2 weapons and missiles, or a single weapon and 2 sets of fins in order to guarantee your target is always within your firing arc. Or a balanced mix of armor, fins, and weapons, or some other combination, including other options like the KLAW's BZ2 Booster for extra speed, or the KX Power Cycle vent to allow you to use a part twice a turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-4.jpg?itok=B9HxErLO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-4.jpg?itok=WJAGpA7I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> starter box includes 4 different chassis cards and builds for the Sabre.</figcaption></figure><h2>Snap Ship Tactics Starter Box Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>&nbsp;Starter Box is a fun little set. The core rules are simple and easy to follow, with the variety of gameplay coming from the different build options. The 2 different ships, with chassis and part options, do provide a lot of variety, and the 1 vs 1 game can be fun, but it usually does come down to maneuverability, and there isn't a lot of variety in this set for that, so further expansion is required to get the full tactical experience. The ships do feel quite large coming out of other wargames, but there is a very satisfying aspect to physically clipping on your parts as you build your ship.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everybody loves it when someone inevitably breaks out <i>Catan</i> at a party. And by everybody, I mean those who love getting locked into a board game that’ll take you about four hours to figure out how to best trade some supplies to expand your settlements. Joking aside, <i>Catan</i> can be a good time. But can it make for good TV? Netflix sure thinks so. It just acquired the rights to adapt it for the streaming screen.</p> <p>Announced via <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/catan-board-game-netflix-adaptations">a post on <i>Tudum</i></a>, Netflix is gearing up to bring the 1995 tabletop game centered on the thrills of bartering and colonizing to film and TV via a partnership with tabletop publisher Asmodee. The streaming service isn’t just investing in a single project, but rather “a slate of scripted and unscripted projects inspired by the hit board game.” On the partnership Jinny Howe, the head of scripted series at Netflix US and Canada, said:</p> <blockquote><p>We knew landing this deal would be as game-changing as a well-placed settlement, so we decided to pool our resources across series, features, animation, and games and show Asmodee the full power of Netflix when we work together. Hardcore “Settlers” are going to lose their minds, and new fans will finally learn just how important a sheep trade can be.</p></blockquote> <p>Honestly, if they just make a fancy animated manual for the board game, I’ll be happy. And I do mean that, as someone for whom it takes at least several rounds of a board game before the rules really click in my head. And this game has so many damn pieces and cards and rules. Ugh. Make it simple for me, Netflix. I’ll also take a <i>Catan</i>-based cottage core lesbian romance centered around some sheep farmers and their Australian Shepherd named Pepper. Assuming such a thing isn’t illegal to make anymore, that is.</p>

                <p>If you're familiar with the legendary Ninja Gaiden series you'll know that it is known for high-octane, jaw-dropping action and superhuman feats of strength and agility. While those are executed in-game by trained ninjas, in the real world there are precious few that can manage feats as impressive. One of those that can, however, is Emmanuel "Master" Rodrigues, a professional gamer that is capable of playing games at the highest level under extreme conditions.</p><p>To celebrate the launch of Ninja Gaiden 4, a brand-new entry in the iconic franchise developed by Team Ninja and Platinum Games, we took the action to the skies by playing the game on a helicopter soaring over Miami. And to make things even trickier, the 20-foot screen Master is playing on is also flying over city. Needless to say, it takes some serious skill to pull something like that off, let alone do it as well as he does. It's an impressive achievement, and you can watch it happen in the video below.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="55988515" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

have escaped toxic floodwaters by building skyscraper districts that tower above the ruined city below. The stunt was achieved using advanced sports broadcasting technology that was utilized to stream live gameplay from Emmanuel's helicopter to flying screen.</p><p>The stunt also represents the same precision, skill, and pushing limits that is required from Ninja Gaiden 4's two protagonists, Yakumo and Ryu Hayabusa. Ninja Gaiden 4 launches October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, Xbox Play Anywhere. It is also also available on Steam and PlayStation 5. Those that have Game Pass can also play it there.</p><p>The Deluxe Edition of Ninja Gaiden 4 includes future gameplay content "The Two Masters," along with additional character skins, weapon skins, and in-game items. Pre-order either the Standard Edition or the Deluxe Edition to get the Dark Dragon Descendent Yakumo skin at launch.</p><p>Check out some cool behind-the-scenes images from the stunt shoot below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588794-f.png" data-ref-id="1300-4588794" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588794-f.png" data-ref-id="1300-4588794"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588794-f.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588795-c.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588796-d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588797-e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588795,1300-4588796,1300-4588797" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4588795-c.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4588796-d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4588797-e.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588795-c.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588796-d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588797-e.jpg"></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p dir="ltr">The Outlast Trials has a new game mode, with the addition of Invasion in today’s update. This permanent new game mode brings PvP to the multiplayer horror game for the first time, arriving alongside the return of the time-limited Program Geister catalogue of outfits for Halloween.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outlast Trials | Geister Limited-Time Event &amp; Invasion Update Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QCCMkEwIsGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Invasion Mode allows players to either play as Reagents or invade games as an Imposter. Only a limited set of Imposters can invade a particular trial, appearing as a knife wielding maniac, but those waiting be the eyes and ears for their teammate until it’s their turn. While observing, they can ping targets and help strategise, keeping the active Imposters informed. Those Imposters will appear armed with a knife, in either a Slash or Stab variety, with the former dealing damage and the latter needing to charge up for an instant kill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An Imposter only has a limited time to take down a target, being forced to head back to the nearest Insertion Gate or be electrocuted for being naughty, naughty players. They can also punished with death, which leads to a time penalty for their next spawn. They do have some key advantages, being able to see the noise made by Reagents, as well as being immune to psychosis gas and Prime Asset effects, though they won’t be able to pick up items.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the end of a match, Imposters will be evaluated for inflicting damage, slaying Reagents, and managing to survive their turn.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It’s all a rather interesting twist on the typical asymmetrical horror multiplayer game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, there’s two new MK Challenges:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Beguile the Children</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The television screen is the retina of the mind’s eye, where anything is true and everything is possible, especially when the audience cannot see the tools that are shaping their mind. Take control of the broadcast, reshape the subliminal message, and we will let you out.</em></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Investigate the Minotaur</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Corporate power and dynastic wealth are the cornerstone of free societies, but only so long as extracurricular activities can be kept quiet. Once private hobbies become public scandals, the guilty must be exposed and destroyed so more tedious dynasties can be put in place. Find the evidence of the Buffalo Minotaur’s crimes, bring it to the press, and we will let you out.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">And the Geister limited time event is on for Halloween, earning you tokens for completing Trials and Geister Tasks, will suffering through Geister Variators. The event runs from today through to 18th November, with even tokens earned unlocking exclusive cosmetics. Spend ’em while you have ’em!</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers">The Verge</a> reveals that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">following the price hike</a> of Xbox Series X/S consoles in the US (the second one in the US in 2025), <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">raising the price of Xbox Game Pass</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">release of a very expensive Xbox-branded, ASUS-made handheld</a>, it's not just the average Xbox fan and consumer who's paying more for Xbox and Xbox-branded hardware. Game developers also have to pay more now for Xbox development kits.</p>



<p>Sources speaking to The Verge claim that the price for an Xbox development kit has jumped 33%, from its old $1,500 price tag to its new <strong>$2,000 USD</strong> price tag. Just like when Microsoft announced the price hike for Series X/S consoles, the increase "<em>reflects macroeconomic developments</em>." However, unlike the recent price increase in the US for the Series X/S, this price hike goes for anyone across the globe looking to grab a development kit.</p>



<p>It's worth noting here that development kit versions of consoles are inherently far more expensive than their consumer-facing counterparts. They come loaded with additional hardware and power that's designed to make them capable of testing various unfinished and unoptimized versions of games, and that's before even getting to the different suite of software options available to developers when they plug their games into these development kits to test them for a commercial release.</p>



<p>That's all to say that the initial $1,500 price tag is definitely expensive, but it's not out of the question that a development kit costs at least four figures to acquire. It's also worth noting that the price of development kits is often a difficult thing to pin down, since that's usually the sort of detail only shared under NDAs between game developers and manufacturers like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.</p>



<p>What's notable about this price increase is that it comes at a time when Microsoft has decidedly shirked off any notion that it is the home of 'the best deal in gaming' anymore and is now 'the most expensive deal in gaming' between the cost of an Xbox console and its premium subscription service, along with the fact that, just like the price increase of the Series X/S consoles, the price of development kits seems to be going up, at least in part, due to tariffs implemented by the current United States administration.</p>



<p>Despite several major successes, the video game industry, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/50-of-games-industry-layoffs-have-taken-place-in-california">particularly in the United States</a>, has remained in dire straits for the last few years. Raising the barrier to entry for developers who are potentially looking to put their games on Xbox makes it feel like Microsoft is trying to catch flies with vinegar rather than honey. Why would a studio that's already concerned about making the money they spend on making their game back go with a platform that has made it more expensive to be a part of from the jump?</p>



<p>Even considering that you can technically turn any Series X/S console you buy into a development kit by digging into the settings and paying a fee to Microsoft to get it up and running properly, due to the significant hardware limitations between what you get in a Series X versus the development kit, that's likely not an option for many developers. Of course, it all depends on the kind of game you're making, but the point stands that just using consumer-grade Series consoles is not a solid solution to getting around this price hike.</p>



<p>At least it lines up with what seems to be Microsoft's new approach to make Xbox the most expensive deal in gaming, whether you're playing the games, or making them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, developer Free Range Games and publisher North Beach Games announced the launch date of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-durins-folk-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durin's Folk DLC</a> for the survival game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.</p>



<p>This first expansion will be released on November 18 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. According to the developers, it will expand the game with more than 20 hours of added content (plus repeatable cooperative events set in randomized dungeons).</p>



<p>Durin's Folk will introduce new endgame content, including an additional story chapter rich with expanded lore, mysterious and challenging areas beyond the mountain’s caverns, thoughtful new gameplay mechanics, and more. </p>



<p>Players will now be able to rescue and recruit NPCs (non-player characters) meet in the mines of Moria, and these recruits will join your settlement and assume useful roles like blacksmith, miner, brewmaster, and guard. Over time, players may even build great works called Monuments with help from the aforementioned NPCs. Through the story, they will uncover the mystery of Durin's Tower, explore the area outside the mountain for the first time, and build massive bases in the large new play area. New materials, items, and recipes will provide more stuff to craft for the dwarven player characters. Lastly, Durin's Folk randomized endgame expeditions that players can repeatedly dive into to get juicy loot.</p>

<p>While the game did not set any sales charts on fire, it did well enough to warrant two years of support and now this Durin's Folk DLC. On Steam, it has a 'Very Positive' rating of user reviews, and estimates indicate it may have sold around half a million units on the platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been four years since </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psychonauts-2-the-kotaku-review-1847533536">Psychonauts 2</a>, </span></i><span>the last new Double Fine game. The studio’s off-kilter sensibilities have always appealed to me, and they’ve helped it create some really great and memorable games, so I was excited to finally have a new release from them in </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>. And while this unusual adventure about a lighthouse and a bird is shorter than I expected, what is here is a gorgeous, well-crafted, and incredibly creative game that pulls off an emotional story without a single word.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, out now on Xbox and PC, is the first Double Fine game to be completely developed and released since the studio was bought by Xbox. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-buys-psychonauts-2-developer-double-fine-prod-1835359067">And if you were worried that acquisition</a> would mean that Double Fine might no longer be free to get weird, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>will quickly assuage your fears. This is a game that, at least at the start, revolves around a sentient, walking lighthouse that befriends a cartoon bird, and the two of them embark on a long journey through a post-apocalyptic world devoid of humanity, but full of colorful and bizarre plants and critters.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Weird stuff, right? But while </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>is an odd game, it ain’t an ugly one. This might be Double Fine’s best-looking game, with a wide color palette and a sometimes surreal and abstract art style that lives between hand-drawn and sculpted. Over the course of the game’s three- to four-hour runtime, I was always excited to see what the next area would look like, and…oh yeah, uhh, the game is very short.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s no getting around that fact. This is a $30 video game that most people will complete in just about three hours. There aren’t many puzzles, and few of them really pushed me to think all that much. There’s also no combat or skill trees. </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>isn’t a mechanically deep game or a complicated thing to play. Instead, Double Fine wants you to just vibe out with it for like three hours. Enjoy all the pretty colors, the weird shit, and hopefully, by the end, feel something.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And to </span><i><span>Keeper’s </span></i><span>credit, by the time credits rolled, I did indeed feel something. It’s wild to think that a story about a lighthouse and a bird with no dialogue could make me tear up a bit at the very end, but that’s exactly what happened. I didn’t expect it, but the conclusion was a wonderful way to end this epic journey.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“You’ll never look at lighthouses the same way again.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Double Fine</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Single-player adventure game with some puzzles and lots of vibes.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous art, wonderful music, perfect ending, not too long, very creative.  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>A few performance hiccups, might be too short for some, lacks memorable puzzles.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S (played), PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>October 17, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Just over three hours and finished the game.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>In fact, I really didn’t expect most of what happens in </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>. You’ve seen trailers for the game and likely assume it’s one thing, and it is that for a while. But similar to EA’s </span><i><span>Split Fiction, Keeper</span></i><span> is a game that relishes in throwing curveballs at you. Every 30 minutes or so, Double Fine’s latest adventure zigs or zags in unexpected ways, and by the end, I was shocked that the game I was playing was the same one I’d started playing a few hours before.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>You may have noticed that I haven’t gone into detail about the specifics that make </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>so surprising, and that’s because, well, I don’t want to ruin any of the surprise. If you intend to play </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, I urge you to avoid videos of it and just hop in. You can easily knock this thing out in a single sitting, and despite a few performance hiccups, I did that and had a great experience. These are the kinds of games I want Xbox to fill Game Pass with, not new </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> titles that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">make the service more expensive</a> and fill up my hard drive with 4k textures of assault rifles. Give me more silly, strange, and heartfelt experiences that I can finish in a single sitting.</span></p> <p><span>If you were concerned about how Xbox’s ownership of the Double Fine might change it, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>is here to remind us all that the former indie studio is still doing its own thing. And while I don’t have insight into the daily operations of Double Fine or what’s happening behind the scenes, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>seems to indicate that even under Xbox, the studio behind</span><i><span> Brutal Legend</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Costume Ques</span></i><span>t will continue to make weird games filled with heart and not designed to maximize sales. And that fact, like </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, makes me really, really happy. </span></p>

Scronce announced that player feedback was considered, and Dexterity will no longer be needed to ADS while sliding or diving. Players can still equip the perk to speed up those specific actions, but it's no longer required to perform the movement.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980680538773213197" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We've got some BIG updates to MP coming out of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> Beta in our latest Dev Talk:<br>✅ ADS &amp; Dexterity changes<br>✅ Aim assist adjustments<br>✅ Louder footsteps<br>✅ New slide tuning<br>✅ Perk distribution updates<br>✅ New Perk combinations<br>✅ Faster mantle speeds<br>➕ more to come! <a href="https://t.co/2BVcHUXnu0" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/2BVcHUXnu0</a></p>  — Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1980680538773213197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Adjustments are also made to the game's sliding and the mantling movements. The slide speed is lowered and distance has been reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">"It still feels great. It still feels fluid," Scronce said when discussing the slide tuning. "But we want to make sure that's not the only way you can enter an engagement."</p><p dir="ltr">For mantling, the developer agreed with feedback that some of the mantling speeds felt too slow. Scrone said the team is going through every mantle in the game to make sure they all have consistent speed and everything feels fast and fluid.</p><p dir="ltr">Perk changes were also announced. Some perks were moved to different categories, and unpopular perks were combined to make more powerful options. One complaint from the beta was that so many powerful perks were stacked in the slot 1 category, so some of the perks are now shifted around to allow players to choose better perk combinations. This includes Tac Mask being moved from slot 1 to slot 2, Tac Sprinter from slot 3 to slot 1, and Cold-Blooded from slot 1 to slot 3.</p><p dir="ltr">As for combined perks, Black Ops 7's Shadow perk is being combined with the Engineer perk. This will allow players to not only see enemy traps but also move past them without triggering any effects. For melee players, Bruiser is now combined with the Close Shave perk. This will allow increased health regen and score for melee kills.</p><p dir="ltr">Aim-assist changes are also confirmed. The developer revealed that data collected from the beta revealed controller players were winning close-range fights, while mouse-and-keyboard players were winning longer-range fights. Because of this, Treyarch is making changes to rotational aim assist, including requiring the right thumbstick to be moving in the direction of a target for aim assist to start.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has received a few other major changes since its initial reveal. Catering to community feedback, Activision revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Call of Duty's Carry Forward program was canceled</a>. Black Ops 6 weapons, operators skins, and cosmetic items will no longer transfer over to Black Ops 7, with the only exception being some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/">Zombies-related content</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher also revealed that Black Ops 7 would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-multiplayer-will-be-non-sbmm-by-default-at-launch/1100-6535334/">launch with little or no SBMM</a>, making the game's matchmaking feel more like the classic system used in older Call of Duty games. This matchmaking change is something a portion of the community has been requesting for years.</p>

                <p>NFL football, and Madden by extension, isn't all about touchdowns, physical toughness, and Taylor Swift after all. EA wants you to care about kickers, too, and not just when they miss game-deciding kicks.</p><p>The latest Madden 26 update increases the maximum distance that talented kickers with a 99 KPW, also known as Kick Power Attribute, can now kick--up to 70-yard field goals.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EA Sports Madden 26 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"As part of our ongoing commitment to authenticity, we’ve incorporated this record-setting event from the real NFL into the game," a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-october-22-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">development blog</a> detailing the update reads. "The historic 70-yard field goal was an extraordinary achievement that pushed the boundaries of what’s possible on the field. We brought this into Madden, giving players the chance to recreate this iconic moment themselves."</p><p>Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little set this record during the 2025 NFL preseason in an August matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers--quite the impressive accomplishment considering it was the first game of the preseason for both teams. It surpassed the previous NFL regular-season record of 66 yards.</p><p>“Can’t lie, there was probably a little bit of doubt," Little told ESPN in an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45934622/jaguars-kicker-cam-little-nails-70-yard-field-goal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>. "But I mean, we attempted a lot of long field goals in training camp. Had some 60, probably 65-pluses before [in practice]. And so, you know, I really wanted to just go out there and see what it would do.”</p><p>The jersey and shoe Little wore during the kick are now on display in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, although the kick does not count toward official NFL record books since it took place in the preseason.</p>

<p>Pop Up, Superstar!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="0ab8c7f0d20ff"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ab8c7f0d20ff/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>This week, London will be treated to its very first pop-up Nintendo Store, making all of us UK Mario fans clutch our wallets in fear.</p>
<p>The shop opens to the public tomorrow (<strong>22nd October</strong>) in the Shepherd's Bush <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london" rel="noopener">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a>, where it will be stocking its sweet merch until <strong>16th November</strong>. Those hoping to visit before 26th Oct will need to <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events/10540">book a ticket</a> to attend, but you'll be able to rock up as usual after this date — just expect some good old-fashioned queuing!</p>
<p>Before the doors <em>officially</em> open, we have been lucky enough to get a sneak peek at the store and see some of the wonderful goodies within. Keen to give all those hoping to attend in the coming weeks a heads up on what you can expect, we've assembled the following merch gallery, so you can start to prep those wishlists.</p>
<p>You might recognise some of the following pieces if you've spent much time browsing the Japanese Nintendo stock online, but this gives us a good chance to get our hands on it <em>without</em> booking a flight to Tokyo...</p>
<p>Let's start with some clothing, perfect for DK enthusiasts and Nintendo all-rounders alike:</p>

<p>There's home decor featuring the likes of Pikmin and Splatoon:</p>

<p>It couldn't be a Nintendo Store without plushies galore:</p>

<p>Some particularly neat figures of the statues found in the flagship Nintendo Stores in the US and Japan:</p>
<figure data-uuid="6d5774430139e"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6d5774430139e/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plenty of Switch 2 merch and amiibo — you know, for those who <em>haven't</em> seen one yet...</p>

<p>And finally, the checkout, where bank balances weep into their exclusive pop-up store London tote bags</p>
<figure data-uuid="1f3737adccea0"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f3737adccea0/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We should note that there's no guarantee all of this merchandise will be on the shelves if you visit the pop-up later in its run — if there's one thing we've learnt about exclusive merch, it's that it sells out <em>fast</em>. That said, the store will be sticking around for a good while, so there's still plenty of time to visit if you find yourself in the big city.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-pc-demo-bloober-team/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-in-time-for-halloween-cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-a-free-demo-on-pc.1330717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team's latest release, Cronos: The New Dawn, now has a demo available for players on PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, to coincide with the game also being on sale on both storefronts just in time for the Halloween season.</p>



<p>The new demo is 30 minutes long, and it's not for nothing, since if you decide to pick up the game after playing the demo, your progress from the demo carries over into the full version of the game, so you can continue playing without skipping a beat.</p>



<p>Console players are left out of the fun, unfortunately for them, but if you have a capable PC, you'll be able to try out Bloober Team's latest release after its stunning Silent Hill 2 Remake. You can also check out a trailer for the demo below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | PC Demo Available Now | STEAM &amp; EPIC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muJlwDnk9Dk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The demo covers the game's first mission, giving you an overview and introduction to the combat, how the creatures you'll face merge into bigger, more terrifying monsters, and give you a taste for two of the game's weapons. Also, even though console players are left out of getting a free demo, they're included with regard to Cronos: The New Dawn being on sale, since it is 15% off on Steam, the Epic Games Store, the PlayStation Store (beginning on Oct.22), the Microsoft Store, the Nintendo eShop, and GOG.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed</a> Cronos: The New Dawn last month, he gave it an 8/10 and praised its setting, story, and level design paired with the new merge mechanic. "<em>With its by-the-books survival horror experience, its first few hours feeling more frustrating than fun due to clunky combat and average enemy design, Cronos: The Dawn seemed to be nothing more than an unremarkable survival horror heavily inspired by the Dead Space series. Push past the around two hours mark, however, and the game blossoms into one of Bloober Team's best titles to date, thanks to its quirky mechanics, solid level design, unique setting and mystery-filled story.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Current-gen Xbox dev kits used to cost $1,500. They’ll now be $2,000 for any game studio who wants to make a game for Xbox Series X/S and doesn’t already have one.</p> <p>That’s according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers">The Verge</a></em> which says developers received the updated pricing in a recent email from Microsoft. “The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,” the email to game development partners apparently reads. “We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.”</p> <p>Microsoft has been blaming “macroeconomic” conditions for all of its recent price hikes without explicitly blaming President Trump’s 30-percent tariffs on Chinese imports as part of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">administration’s ongoing trade war</a>. The 33-percent price hike on dev kits comes after similar increases to the price of the Xbox consoles players can buy online and in stores, as well as a 50-percent spike in Game Pass Ultimate membership fees this month.</p>

 <p>While the tariffs explain the new barriers to making games for Xbox, the price increase <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ally-x-price-next-gen-hardware-console-2000637280">won’t help perceptions</a> that Microsoft is deprioritizing its hardware amid a new multiplatform publishing push and reported mandates from the tech giant’s c-suite to boost profit wherever possible. Game Pass has been a boon to some of the indie developers who get deals with it, but there are also plenty of smaller third-party games that now seem to skip Xbox at launch.</p> <p>Even Moon Studios, maker of the hit Xbox platformer <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em>, recently suggested the console port of its top-down Soulslike <em>No Rest for the</em> <em>Wicked</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-no-rest-wicked-console-port-souls-rpg-xbox-ps5-1851786659">would skip Xbox</a> at launch because the investment wasn’t worth the payoff right now. Nevertheless, Microsoft says its still developing next-gen hardware, and did just launch the new Asus-made Xbox Ally PC gaming handhelds. A developer could get two $1,000 Xbox Ally Xs for the price of a new dev kit.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-forerunner-55-now-cheaper-than-a-regular-watch-amazon-dumps-stock-at-record-low-2000637674</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/garmin-forerunner-55-now-cheaper-than-a-regular-watch-amazon-dumps-stock-at-record-low.1330711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t need to be training for the New York Marathon to benefit from a GPS running watch that understands your fitness level. Most people just want to run a few miles without guessing their pace, track progress over time and maybe figure out why some runs feel easier than others. The Garmin Forerunner 55 handles all of that without the overwhelming feature bloat of flagship models, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $169, down from its usual $199 price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The core appeal lies in how this watch removes the mental load from running: You lace up, press start and the GPS tracks your route while the optical heart rate sensor monitors your effort level. After the run, you get clear feedback on distance covered, average pace per mile, heart rate zones throughout the workout, and total elevation gain if you tackled any hills. This data accumulates over weeks and months and reveals patterns that help you understand what’s actually improving versus what just feels different on any given day.</p>
<h2>Two Weeks Battery Life</h2>
<p>Smartwatch battery life usually means charging every night or every other day, and turn your fitness tracker into another device competing for outlet space. The <strong>Forerunner 55 runs for two full weeks in normal smartwatch mode</strong>, displaying time, notifications and daily stats without needing a charge. Switch to GPS mode for tracking runs and you get 20 hours of continuous recording which is enough for multiple marathons back-to-back if you were so inclined.</p>
<p><em>PacePro</em> is worthy of coverage because it answers a common race-morning headache for runners. It can be set with a desired finish time for a certain distance, after which it works out precisely what your pace through every part of a course must be. If it’s a hilly course, it even makes automatic adjustments for you, urging you to ease off on ascents and accelerate on downhills in order to reach your total time target.</p>



<p>Each day’s recommendations come on to the watch screen in the morning from Garmin’s algorithms based on your last few sessions of training, your current level of fitness, and your recovery condition. It’s not boilerplate “run 3 miles today” recommendations. The system may suggest interval sessions if you’ve been running continuously through the week, for example, or recommend a gentle recovery jog if yesterday’s tempo run was especially strenuous. Each recommendation includes bespoke aims for duration, pace, and heart rate ranges, which is basically like your own coach that is tailored to how your body is reacting to training.</p>



<p>The activity library goes well beyond running: <strong>There is cycling, track running, virtual treadmill run, pool swim, Pilates, HIIT, breathwork</strong> with specific tracking modes that retain suitable metrics for that specific type of activity. <strong>Pool swim mode automatically tracks</strong> strokes and number of laps while HIIT tracks work as well as intervals of rest. The watch can therefore be worn through the whole calendar year even as running becomes secondary through seasons or when cross-training is dictated due to injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness features run continuously in the background and tracks stress levels through heart rate variability, monitoring respiration rate throughout the day, and calculates your fitness age based on activity patterns and VO2 max estimates. The Body Battery metric deserves special mention because it quantifies energy levels on a 0-100 scale, helping you understand when you’re actually recovered enough for hard training versus when you should take it easy.</p>
<p>The <em>Connect IQ Store</em> opens up customization so that you can switch up the watch face, add data fields that expose exactly the measurements you are concerned with when running, and third-party apps that increase functionality. You can add a weather app, load training plans from specific coaches, or load in data pages that are optimized for triathlon training in case your interests are elsewhere than running.</p>
<p>At $169, that’s cheaper than most fashion smartwatches with a fraction of the fitness tracking ability.</p>
