            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>TV show has become the Prime Video platform's second show to reach 100 million viewers, and you'll never guess what the first show to achieve this accolade was.</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/falloutonprime/status/1841579635647381864" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Amazon announced the 100 million milestone with the rather pithy summary "achievement unlocked". The accompanying artwork proclaims that&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>has "100 million viewers worldwide".</p>
<p>The first show to achieve this milestone, <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-videos-ithe-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-p-7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Amazon itself</a>, was the first season of&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;show&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>, which should go some way towards telling you just how successful the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show has been.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-tv-show-ghoul.jpg?itok=uTFMrVEa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-tv-show-ghoul.jpg?itok=JVOaRGwP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>TV show has racked up some impressive numbers.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Amazon doesn't go into detail regarding the 100 million figure, so while it sounds impressive on the face of it, there's no guarantee all 100 million of those people stuck around to watch every episode.</p>
<p>It's also possible that a significant portion of the viewership Amazon cites only watched for a few minutes; without any more in-depth information, it's impossible to know how engaged the 100 million people who watched&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>really were.</p>
<p>Still, reviews of the show's first season were <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s01" rel="noopener" target="_blank">extremely positive</a> from both the critical and audience perspectives, and our own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-season-one-review-welcome-to-apocalypse">reviewer Tyler was a big fan of the show as well</a>, so I'd be willing to bet that a good chunk of those 100 million people stayed until the series' finale.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>TV show, it's an adaptation of the long-running RPG series&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, and it's set around 130 years after the first game in the series.</p>
<p>The show follows Vault Dweller Lucy, who leaves the safety of Vault 33 to explore the wasteland in order to search for her father. It stars&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed">Arcane</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Yellowjackets&nbsp;</em>alumnus Ella Purnell in the main role, with support coming from the likes of Kyle MacLachlan and Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>You can check out the first series of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>right now on Prime Video. If you're an Amazon Prime member already, the service is included in your membership, although you will have to fork out some extra cash to get rid of adverts.</p>

<p>Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition can no longer be purchased on the Epic Games Store, with the Remastered edition releasing later this month, October 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/horizon-zero-dawn-delisted-on-epic-games-store-ahead-of-remastered-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, if you head to Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition’s Epic Games Store page, the game appears as ‘Unavailable’ to purchase in certain regions. In other regions, players are redirected to the store page of Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered Edition.</p>



<p>Epic Games Store hasn’t provided an official reason for delisting Horizon Zero Dawn, but it is speculated that this move would lead players to buy the Remastered Edition directly instead of purchasing the Complete Edition and then upgrading for $9.99. For context, the Complete Edition and Remastered Edition cost the same, $49.99.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PlayStation Store <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-after-remaster-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has done something similar</a> to prepare for the release of Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered Edition. However, instead of delisting the game, they have increased its price. For more than six years, the game was priced at $19.99/£15.99 in the store, and just a few days after the announcement of the Remastered Edition, the original game’s price was increased to $39.99/£34.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-50-enhanced-titles-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony is looking to have between 40 and 50 PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced titles at launch, according to SIE Global Product Planning Department Senior Principal Product Manager Toshimasa Aoki.</p>
<p>Speaking with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/990/G999027/20240925066/">4Gamer </a>during this year's edition of the Tokyo Game Show, Aoki-san talked about the upcoming mid-generation refresh system, confirming that SIE's current plan is to have about 40 to 50 PS5 Pro enhanced titles at launch, including both first-party and third-party titles. The high number of launch supported titles, Aoki-san added, indicates the great opinion developers have for the PlayStation 5 Pro and its capacity to deliver great visuals at 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>In the interview, Toshimasa Aoki also reiterated that even games that aren't going to be PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced will still see improvements on the console if they feature variable framerates and dynamic resolution thanks to Game Boost mode. Games with locked framerates, however, won't see any performance improvements unless the developer unlocks the framerate. PlayStation 4 games with variable framerates will also see improvements, and the Image Quality Boost function will provide simple upscaling without PSSR. PSVR 2 games will also benefit from the console's increased specs over the base model, offering a more stable performance which is crucial for any VR game. In addition, Sony is thinking about using the PSSR upscaler to further enhance the experience in VR games</p>
<p>As for which games running on PlayStation 5 Pro Toshimasa Aoki has been impressed the most, he mentioned Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is setting out to be the game that will showcase the console's capabilities the best at launch. Aoki-san also mentioned Marvel's Spider-Man 2 as an impressive showcase of what the console can do, appreciating being able to see the game's visuals at 4K resolution while retaining the smoothness of the base console's Performance Mode.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-armory</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-arrives-with-the-armory-update.999399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-armory<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been itching for the chance to purchase a new&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>battle pass, then now's your chance. A new update titled The Armory has arrived, bringing a purchasable pass with tons of cosmetics to unlock, plus more.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/armory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Steam announcement post</a>, Valve says you can purchase an Armory Pass if you've got a Prime Status account, and doing so gets you access to more than 100 items, including three weapon collections, a new Weapons Case, and a new type of cosmetic as well.</p>
<p>Said new cosmetics take the form of Charms, which are little figurines you can attach to your gun. You can put the charm anywhere you like on your gun, too, so you can display it on the barrel, on the grip, or even on the trigger if you want.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-the-armory-preview.jpg?itok=OIyzzafn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-the-armory-preview.jpg?itok=-uBcdjEz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has a new battle pass for you to buy.</figcaption></figure><p>If you buy an Armory Pass, you'll start earning credits through play, and you can then use those credits to buy charms, new weapon collections featuring different art styles for your guns, and a new case full of "community-designed weapon finishes".</p>
<p>You'll also be able to unlock two sticker collections that "encourage you to mix, match, and craft your own art on your favorite weapon".</p>
<p>Armory Passes are agnostic when it comes to boosted and reduced XP, too; you'll earn the same amount towards your Armory Pass no matter what. Each pass offers 40 credits, and the first one will be earned straight away. You'll then have to unlock the remaining 39 as you play.</p>
<p>Up to five passes can be active at once, if you happen to be made of money, and you can't buy the credits independently of the pass; the only way to get them is to earn XP through the pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-the-armory-firing-gun.jpg?itok=GZEGO4y2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-the-armory-firing-gun.jpg?itok=sqdyq9Jf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to show off some new and exciting&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>guns to your friends? Check out the game's new Armory Pass.</figcaption></figure><p>This update also includes a number of changes and fixes for&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, including improved slope poses, better pinning and unpinning to prevent the "MJ lean", and more.</p>
<p>It comes after a year that's apparently been a pretty successful one for the game; back in August, it was reported that&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-600m-revenue-report">already made more than $600 million</a> at that point in the year, and this pass is only likely to increase that amount.</p>
<p>That same month, Valve also introduced an update that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-snap-tap-automation">banned automation across the board,</a>&nbsp;likely making owners of Razer's Huntsman V3 Pro keyboard pretty upset.</p>
<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for free right now on PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24260534/epic-games-store-pc-social-features-suck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic’s game store is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">finally on mobile</a>. Next up, the company plans to add features that make people want to use it — on both mobile <em>and</em> PC.</p><p>A key thing Epic Games wants to introduce is what store boss Steve Allison calls a “social framework” — think the types of social and chat features you see on consoles or Steam.</p><p>“Our social features on PC suck,” Allison says in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “Let’s call it what it is.” Social features are the “battery that powers <em>Fortnite</em>,” Allison says, and Epic wants to “take that battle-tested social framework and move it up from <em>Fortnite</em> up to the store level.” The idea is that you’ll be able to party up and chat with your Epic Games friends across devices, theoretically meaning that friends on Android, iOS, and PC could all hang out through the Epic Games platform (not just <em>Fortnite</em>).</p><p>We might be waiting a while to try the social features out, though, as Allison says they won’t arrive until at least after summer 2025.</p><p>More immediately, Epic is planning to bring its free games program to mobile sometime in the fourth quarter (which, if you’re watching the calendar, is this quarter!). Unlike on PC, free mobile games may not be offered weekly to start, though they’ll probably move to weekly<strong> </strong>once Epic launches tools to self-publish on its mobile store. (That feature will probably launch in the first half of 2025, Allison said in a Tuesday panel at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258466/unreal-fest-seattle-2024-fortnite-uefn-engine">Unreal Fest</a>.) Some free games might only be available on Android because of Apple’s core technology fee, which could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225634/apple-epic-games-store-ios-developers">sting developers</a> with costs they may not be able to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>Third-party games are set to appear in the mobile Epic Games Store in the fourth quarter as well (Allison has previously pegged the launch for December). During the Unreal Fest panel, Allison said that Epic aims to have 10 to 50 games available at launch. Yes, that’s a broad range, and Allison tells <em>The Verge</em> that the big “gating factor” is implementing payments. Since most mobile developers rely on Google or Apple’s payment processing platforms, they have to evaluate using Epic’s payment processing platforms or others. During the Unreal Fest keynote, though, Epic shared one game coming to its mobile stores: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/10/1/24259091/a-new-game-for-the-epic-games-store-on-ios"><em>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition</em></a>.</p><p>Epic seems to be seeing forward momentum with the store overall, announcing during the keynote that it hit a record <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259476/epic-games-store-hit-a-record-70-million-monthly-active-users-in-september">70 million monthly active users</a> in September. However, given the roadblocks Apple and Android phone makers put up to installing third-party stores on their mobile platforms, Epic isn’t seeing the volume of mobile store installs it had hoped.</p><p>At the launch of the mobile stores <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">in August</a>, Allison said that Epic was aiming for 100 million net new Epic Games Store mobile installations by the end of the year, but Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">said recently</a> that there have only been 10 million mobile installs. Allison believes that the new features coming in the fourth quarter could encourage more users to push through the friction. But he adds that, with the friction, getting to that 100 million installs by the end of the year “is likely impossible.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>For a game that's still technically in pre-release early access, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-crowdfunding-reaches-500-million-after-a-decade/1100-6507704/" data-ref-id="1100-6507704">Star Citizen</a> has amassed a large following and its own annual convention, CitizenCon. But even though the full release isn't on the horizon, Star Citizen's developer, Cloud Imperium Games, is reportedly forcing its employees to work seven days a week through CitizenCon.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> shared excerpts from an apparent internal email at Cloud Imperium Games that in no uncertain terms tells its employees that they have to work every day leading up to CitizenCon, even through the two weekends beforehand. Work from home will only be an option on the Sunday before CitizenCon, although Cloud Imperium Games noted its preference for employees to come in that day as well.</p><p>The stated goals of this crunch time are to finish Star Citizen patch 3.24.2 and "the Squadron 42 demo showcase for Chapter 1." The report also notes that employees were pre-approved for 12 hours of TOIL (time off in lieu) per week, but only if the workers are still employed by Cloud Imperium Games when Squadron 42 ships. If any employees leave ahead of time, they will not be able to take their accumulated TOIL.</p><p>CitizenCon will take place in Manchester, England on October 19-20. In a follow-up email to employees, Cloud City Games is said to have offered Monday, October 21 as a free day to take off. For now, there's still no word about when Star Citizen will move on from early access and into a full release, but it's been 12 years and counting.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Miyamoto has been involved with the Zelda franchise since its inception, but the 71-year-old has slowly stepped away from development over the years to work on some of Nintendo's non-game-related projects. As far back as 2011, Miyamoto said he liked to remove himself from development a little so the studio's younger developers would step up their involvement.</p><p>Earlier this year, Miyamoto said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-has-no-plans-to-retire-but-is-thinking-about-it-in-case-something-does-happen/1100-6520073/" data-ref-id="1100-6520073">he still has no plans to retire</a>, but has been making succession plans for his role within Nintendo "in case something does happen." His current title at Nintendo is Representative Director and Fellow, and he still often acts as a spokesperson for the company and its upcoming projects.</p><p>Regardless of his actual level of involvement in the game, Miyamoto's absence from the Echoes of Wisdom credits is curious as the person who created the Legend of Zelda series, its setting, and many of its mainstay characters. Also conspicuously absent from the credits is Takashi Tezuka, another Nintendo mainstay who has been credited on all Zelda titles aside from Zelda 2 and Tears of the Kingdom.</p>

                <p>The ongoing wave of layoffs in the video game industry continues with Hi-Rez Studios, the developer of the Smite games, announcing it will be letting go of an unspecified number of employees. The layoffs come shortly after Hi-Rez released MOBA sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smite-2-revealed-will-run-alongside-the-first-game/1100-6520306/" data-ref-id="1100-6520306">Smite 2</a> in paid early access.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/smite-developer-hi-rez-studios-lays-off-employees-to-ensure-long-term-success/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Hi-Rez hasn't specified how many people will be impacted by the layoffs, but said that they will affect all parts of the company. "This will disproportionately impact those in marketing and publishing roles, as well as some from our Evil Mojo, G&amp;A, and Titan Forge divisions," Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on X</a>. Only small teams will be left to support Smite and Paladins, while the company shifts its major focus to Smite 2.</p><p>"The game team roles impacted disproportionally affect our team working on cosmetic skin content and system features." Chisam said, adding that development on Smite 2 will focus on gameplay over new cosmetics. "We are almost exclusively prioritizing gameplay development in the near term--such as new modes and gods--as well as quality improvements--over some cosmetic and monetization features previously planned in the run-up to the game's free-to-play launch next year."</p><p>Chisam notes that there is still a large team working on Smite 2 despite the layoffs, saying that the dev team is larger than the one that worked on the original Smite through most of its life cycle. "Our goal for Smite 2 in the near term is to create the best possible game experience for our community and a game that provides joy to players and can sustain itself long into the 2030s."</p><p>"This news has a real human impact at a tough time for workers in this industry," Chisam said in his post. "Each impacted individual is a talented and dedicated professional who has poured their heart and soul into our games. Letting them go is a heartbreaking decision, reflects a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability."</p><p>The last year has been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">difficult one for workers in the games industry</a>, with tens of thousands of layoffs reported across 2023 and 2024, and they don't seem to be slowing down.

			<p>A new update for a Cyberpunk 2077 mod that was released online this week makes playing the game with a modded third-person view better than ever by introducing some significant improvements.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, modder Tylerrrrr released the 5.0 version of their Every Animation Redone TPP Third Person mode, which improves V's animations while using a modded third-person view. Among the improvements over previous versions of the mod are proper effects when bumping against any NPC, fixes for vaulting and climbing animations, leaning and orientation, improvements for melee combat, and updated animations for male V. You can download the mod for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/16858?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the end of development, CD Projekt Red is still supporting Cyberpunk 2077 with new features. Last month, a new update introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-amd-fsr-3-bad-visual-quality/">AMD FSR 3 support</a>, which brings performance improvements but still leaves something to be desired in regard to visual quality. This is caused by the fact that CDPR did not implement the latest version of AMD's upscaler, which delivers much better visual quality compared to version 3.0.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion, released last year, is only available on PC and current-generation consoles.</p>

            <p>Edwin and I have a sort of running 'joke', in that whenever we've got him down to review something, the game gets delayed. Sometimes, it gets delayed multiple times. We've taken to calling it "The Curse", such is its power to utterly obliterate video game development, by virtue of it being a phantom that floats into PC vents and fries motherboards. I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>… but Edwin <em>had</em> played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an in-character post on Xwitter, the devs said that the game would arrive in "Q1 2025", as opposed to sometime later this year. Essentially, they want to "polish each phase of the project" and "ensure that every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible".</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Dear Mr. Dolski,</p><p>We regret to inform you that, after thorough review, your upcoming mission in search of Rapidium has been postponed from [REDACTED] to Q1 2025.</p><p>While we understand this delay may not be the news you were expecting, rest assured that we are using this extended… <a href="https://t.co/ALFaeTxG1G">pic.twitter.com/ALFaeTxG1G</a></p></div>— The Alters (@altersgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/altersgame/status/1841464246355345720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>When Edwin did get his mitts on The Alters earlier this year, it stirred the Gears Of War-liker within him - despite the fact it's about an offworld miner creating new versions of himself from branches of his past, then living with those alternate clones. He thought The Alters' opening salvo was similar to Cliffy B's magnum opus, despite the fact The Alters isn't so much about carving alien meatheads into pieces with a chainsaw gun, but more third-person adventure with a management focus. </p><p>"The encompassing level design harkens back to yer Uncharteds", Edwin said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-opening-hour-of-the-alters-feels-like-11-bits-first-third-person-narrative-action-game">his preview</a>, before he touches on the game's crafting and building focus. "There's still a War-Of-Miney side-scrolling management layer at the heart of it all… there are crafting and building menus to wrangle with, and resource counters to stay on top of."</p>
<p>And if you, dear reader, are wondering whether the offworld miner can have sex with himself. Edwin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">interview piece</a> on the topic covers that (fourth) base.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As members of RPS’s "nutritious", "life altering" and "it cured my oddly-shaped bottom!" supporters program (not actual reviews) will get to read about this Friday, I’ve recently done a 180 in my opinions of scrappy ‘nid stomper <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-shows-off-10-minutes-of-stomping-chainswording-and-a-chaos-tease-for-the-warhammer-40k-sequel-in-extended-gameplay">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. That’s mainly down the<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc"> multiplayer</a> Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a>, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> mission.</p>

<p>The new Operations - 3 player co-op with several distinct classes and a pleasingly fleshed-out progression system - will land this month. Here’s how Saber describe it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tyranid invasion of Kadaku is ending. The planet’s organic material is being transformed into biomass, and Tyranid Capillary Towers stretch high into the skies above, where the Hive Ships wait to taste their victory. The Cadian forces have made a valiant attempt to push back against the Tyranids. A team of Space Marines arrives on Kadaku with a simple mission: help the Cadians destroy the towers. The Tyranids may win the planet, but the Imperium will make it as painful as possible for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>This’ll be the first of several planned additions to Operations mode this year, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fair-play-to-saber-space-marine-2s-roadmap-has-all-the-juicy-bits-for-free-although-sprucing-up-your-blueberry-mates-will-cost-you">per the roadmap</a>. Also set to arrive soon is a new "Lethal" difficulty, alongside a new pistol. It’s a 'neo- volkite', which sounds like a souped-up thermal sidearm. Saber also some bugs they’re planning to target with incoming patches, following a<a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/90-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-26-09-24"> fix released last week</a>.</p><p>They’ll also be some new enemies coming next year. Genestealers, please? I imagine they’re still in development, although we might find out what they are sooner than expected. As spotted by ours brothers-in-ziff IGN, dataminers recently found a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-datamine-reveals-unannounced-armor-pieces-including-the-beaky-helmet">few new armour pieces in the game files</a>, including the much-requested (and much cooler) beaky helmet.</p>
<p>
Lastly, the community post asks players to please treat each other respectfully. "You can never know how old the other players may be, how their day is going, how sensitive they may be. Overall, you never know who your brothers and sisters are. It could even be Henry Cavill. You don’t want to insult Henry Cavill, brother, no you don’t."</p>
<p>Who says I don’t, eh? Oi. Cavill. Your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watching-henry-cavill-build-a-pc-gave-me-a-heart-attack">PC build disturbed Katharine Castle</a> so much she literally moved to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a> several years later. Still, it’s always nice to see developers encouraging a healthy player environment. A lovely moral lesson if ever I saw one. Wait....morals?! Ugh! Quick, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-wont-say-whether-their-ceo-wrote-this-highly-baity-comment-about-games-imposing-morality-on-gamers">get daddy Karch on the phone</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Shattered Space, Bethesda's first major expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, released a few days ago, but has unfortunately been met with middling PC player numbers and lukewarm reviews.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1716740/charts/">SteamDB</a>, Starfield currently has a 24-hour peak concurrent player count of 17,074, and a current player count of 9,740. In contrast, Bethesda's much older release <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/489830/charts/">The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Special Edition</a> has a 24-hour player peak of 21,494, with 13,772 of us currently making our way through the fantasy world.</p>

</figure>
<p>Shattered Space's Steam reviews, meanwhile, currently sit with a "mostly negative" average. Many of these reviews claim the expansion is not worth its price tag, with several accusing the developer of being "lazy" with the storytelling and overall content.</p>
<p>"They say less is more, and with Shattered Space it's true. Bethesda's giving you less while asking for more money," reads one Steam review.</p>
<p>"Incredibly mediocre," another adds. "Was willing to give Starfield a lot of grace due to it being a new IP but now I've seen what they're doing to build on it, it's not worth it."</p>
<p>One positive review, meanwhile, is a very clearly backhanded compliment: "The story is boring af. Would recommend if you have insomnia and need to work the next day."</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/starfield-shattered-space/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x">Metacritic</a>, the expansion sits with a 'Mixed or Average' average critic score of 54, with a current total of seven reviews. Of these seven, two are positive, three are mixed and two are negative.</p>
<p>Some players are enjoying Shattered Space, however. "This DLC is more Starfield which, if you liked Starfield to begin with, means you will likely find it worthwhile," one Steam reviewer reasoned.</p>
<p>"If you normally enjoy the base game, it’s worth it, and, obviously, if you dislike the base game, then just stay away," another wrote.</p>

<p>As for the future, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> recently confirmed there will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">at least one more Starfield expansion</a> after Shattered Space, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-points-to-future-starfield-expansion-fans-believe">trademark for "Starborn" registered by Bethesda parent company Zenimax</a> then got tongues wagging about what any future DLC may include. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Legacy Style will mimic the original game with a top-down view and traditional controls, while the New Style will switch to a third-person perspective with modernised controls.</p>
<p>However, the development team found the difficulty level drastically changed depending on the chosen style - in particular the New Style has a wider field of view and allows Snake to shoot while moving, which made the game much easier to play.</p><p>As such, the two styles of play will be distinct as Konami alters the difficulty of each separately. Legacy Style will match the original, while New Style is being tweaked from scratch (presumably to match the difficulty, albeit with modernised controls). It means once players choose a control style, they'll have to stick with it throughout.</p>
<p>Other new additions include hidden collectibles alongside the original's kerotan frogs, and a quick function for camouflage for ease of use.</p>
<p>The game will also feature a visual filter to recreate the look of the original game - Konami previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-deltas-classic-visual-filter-usable-with-either-control-style-konami-confirms">confirmed to Eurogamer this can be applied to either control style</a>.</p>
<p>Still, when asked about a release date the pair remained silent. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">PlayStation blog post at the start of the year suggested a 2024 release</a>, but the producers told Famitsu while the game is technically playable to the end, they want to ensure the game doesn't disappoint fans upon release.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-a-doggedly-faithful-remake-but-new-controls-have-new-consequences">hands-on with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> back in August, describing it as "a doggedly faithful remake" though the new controls could prove contentious.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I don't keep family photo albums to avoid the exact scenario described in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/corporeal">Corporeal</a>, a just-announced mystery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game in which you piece together a haunted family photo album. Navigating "a series of immersive retro analog interfaces", you will complete "tactile, minimalist puzzles" so as to combine eldritch snapshots and reveal new scenes. You know the kind of thing: that isn't a freshly-baked muffin cooling on a second floor window ledge, it's the Slender Man. That isn't a dressing gown, it's your great-uncle Percival, back from the beyond to haunt you for undercooking the fish during the great salmonella outbreak of Xmas 1993.</p><!--more-->
<p>"As the sole survivor of unexplained events in the 1990s, search for answers in an archive of photos rescued from the ruins of your childhood home, manipulate the past, encounter specters &amp; map your cursed family history," explains the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255140/CORPOREAL/">Steam page</a>. I, too, am a survivor of unexplained events in the 1990s. In my case, though, I'm talking about the Pog "phenomenon" and wearing T-shirts over long-sleeved tops. Whereas Corporeal, I sense, is all about murders, specifically murders in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It looks pretty nifty - at once chilled and chilling. The pictures must be dragged and dropped into the album manually, with descriptive text appearing alongside. I don't get the sense it's this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/immortality">Immortality</a> - which many journos considered GOAT material, though our Alice B (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/immortality-review">a little steelier in her verdict</a> - but I've always enjoyed the bits in horror films where somebody combs through archive footage and wait, that isn't great-uncle Percival at all, it's Aunt Maguire. You remember Aunt Maguire? She lived down Salem way, in that house behind the tarpits with all the ravens.</p>
<p>If you don't like cursed family albums, may I recommend Pip's (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/proteus-screenshots">album of Proteus snapshots</a>. If you do like cursed family albums, what would you put in yours?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Vessel of Hatred, Diablo 4's first expansion, officially goes live alongside Season 6 on October 7 at 4pm PDT globally.</p><p>During a pre-launch livestream, developers from Blizzard outlined the post-patch 2.0 Public Test Realm (PTR) changes, which touch on everything from progression and itemization to class balance and Runewords. Character level adjustments include Paragon Point increases, Torment difficulty updates, and Glyph upgrade changes.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/d4-1727945508088.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Realmwalker in Diablo 4. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Season of Hatred Rising sees the introduction of Realmwalkers (Diablo 3 players will be familiar), gargantuan heralds of Hell bearing sanguine-eyed portals on their backs dotted about Sanctuary. Here's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140803/conquer-colossal-foes-in-season-of-hatred-rising" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blizzard on the Realmwalkers</a>:</p><blockquote>Realmwalkers can threaten an entire Region at once, spewing out nightmares born of hatred from the portal fused into their bodies. By Mephisto’s will, a Realmwalker will spawn in a Region, and after charging up, it will begin to lumber about the Region in search of sacred ground. Realmwalkers are invulnerable during this phase, but fearsome Bloodbound Guardians will rush to protect the Realmwalker while it wanders. Eliminate them to remove chunks of the Realmwalker’s health.</blockquote><blockquote>When the Realmwalker arrives at the ritual site, it’ll slam into the ground, creating three Hatred Spires around it. Dismantle these spires quickly and render the Realmwalker vulnerable before it acquires too much power.</blockquote><blockquote>Once the Hatred Spires have fallen, you can finish the job. Put the demonic behemoth to rest! After the beast has fallen and glory claimed in your name, the truest test of your mettle begins: you may now enter the portal it leaves behind.</blockquote><p>As well as Season 6 details, Blizzard also ran though Vessel of Hatred itself, including information on new class the Spiritborn, an overview of the Kurast Undercity and Dark Citadel game modes, and a rundown of the new Mercenaries system.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1841538706747899908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Digging into the detail of class balance, Diablo 4 players are already saying Blizzard has nerfed the popular Lightning Spear Sorcerer build so hard as to be unviable, but of course fans won’t know the nature of the meta until Season 6 is in the wild.</p><h2>Diablo 4 update 2.0.2 patch notes:</h2><h2>Game Updates</h2><h3>Balance Updates</h3>All Classes<p>Legendary aspect affix values now have a separate cap between Ancestral and Non-Ancestral items.

As part of this fix, Classes will no longer be able to equip items with Tempering or Legendary affixes that are Class-specific for another Class.</li></ul><p><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>We found an issue where Classes could sometimes unintentionally benefit from Affixes and Legendary Powers that are Class-specific for other Classes. An example of this would be a Sorcerer benefitting from War Cry legendary items that belong to Barbarians. We find the design space interesting, particularly with Runewords being added to the game, and may explore these kinds of synergies in the future. Currently, we do not believe it is healthy for players to farm items and Affixes on one Class to benefit a different one.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Various performance, UI, visual, and stability improvements.</li></ul><h2>Diablo 4 update 2.0.1 patch notes:</h2><h2>Key Updates From PTR</h2><h3>Game Updates</h3>Masterworking<ul data-cy="list"><li>The Gold cost for Masterworking Ranks 5-12 has been reduced by approximately one third.</li><li>Masterworking materials now drop from more sources inside Nightmare Dungeons, including:<ul data-cy="list"><li>Resplendent chests</li><li>Normal chests</li><li>Miscellaneous Interactive Objects, such as ambient corpses</li><li>Breakable Objects</li><li>The Butcher</li><li>Treasure Goblins</li><li>Local events</li></ul></li><li>Non-Ancestral Legendary items can now be Masterworked up to 8 times and have two Tempering Affixes.</li><li>Material costs for Masterworking at lower Ranks have been adjusted.</li></ul>The Pit<ul data-cy="list"><li>50 additional Pit Tiers have been introduced, totaling 150.</li><li>Bonus tier unlocks for fast clears have increased from 3 to 5 tiers.</li></ul>Loot Updates<ul data-cy="list"><li>Lower-level monsters will now drop more items, and less crafting materials.</li><li>Overall loot quality dropped by Hellborne has been increased.<ul data-cy="list"><li>There is now a higher chance to receive at least One Legendary item, with an additional chance to receive 1-2 more.</li></ul></li><li>Overall loot quality dropped by Treasure Goblins and The Butcher has been improved.<ul data-cy="list"><li>The Butcher will always drop at least 1 legendary item.</li><li>The Butcher will always drop the Butcher's Cleaver Unique weapon.</li><li>Treasure Goblins will always drop at least 1 Legendary item.</li></ul></li><li>World Boss loot now scales with higher torment tiers.</li><li>Adjusted the drop rates of Mythic Unique items from Ladder Bosses to compensate for being guaranteed Ancestral quality.</li><li>Duriel and Andariel do not guarantee a Mythic item drop but their chance to drop a Mythic item is twice as high as other Tormented bosses.</li><li>The chance for Uniques to roll as Ancestral has been significantly increased.</li><li>Starting in Torment Difficulty I, only Legendary and Unique items can drop.

Now, the gap in power between rarity tiers for Runes of Invocation and Runes of Ritual will be much smaller, and Runes that provide utility will be more potent than Runes that only provide damage across all rarity tiers.<br>Additionally, to make sub power Runes competitive, the Rune type will deal more than other types found in Diablo IV depending on the amount of utility they provide.</em></p><p>Lith (Don't walk or evade)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Previous: Stand still for 0.3 seconds.</li><li>Now: Stand still while fighting for 0.3 seconds.</li></ul><p>Feo (Become Crowd Controlled or Injured)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduce cooldown to 10 seconds.</li></ul><p>Vex (+3 to all Skills)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Offering increased from 400 to 1000.</li></ul><p>Kry (Spiritborn Vortex)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced from 500 to 300 Offering.</li></ul><p>Ner (Rogue Concealment)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced from 700 to 600 Offering.</li></ul><p>Jah (Sorcerer Teleport)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Offering reduced from 500 to 400.</li></ul><p>Qua (Movement Speed and Evade refresh)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Evade refresh removed.</li><li>Offering reduced from 400 to 50.</li></ul><p>Que (Enhanced Earthen Bulwark)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Changed to Base Earthen Bulwark.</li><li>Offering reduced from 800 to 300.</li></ul><p>Yom (Petrify)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Note: Petrify no longer gives Critical Strike Damage and instead grants 100 Resource.</li></ul><p>Ohm (Warcry)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Offering increased from 500 to 600.</li><li>Now uses base Warcry instead of Enhanced Warcry.</li></ul><p>Teb (Abhorrent Iron Maiden)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rune version now deals 300% of base damage.</li></ul><p>Tun (Stun Grenades)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rune version damage increased from 20% to 260%.</li></ul><p>Tal (Spiritborn Pestilent Swarm)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rune version damage increased from 100% to 150%.</li></ul><p>Xan (Critical Overpower)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Offering increased from 700 to 900.</li></ul><p>Eom (Generic Cooldown Reduction)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cooldown Reduction reduced from 0.25 to 0.1.</li></ul><p>Cah (Spiritwolves)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Enhanced the Spiritwolf AI allowing it to engage in combat faster.</li><li>Increased the Attack damage from 14% to 30%.</li><li>Increased the Leap damage from 14% to 50%.</li></ul><p>Zec (Ultimate Cooldown Reduction)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cooldown Reduction reduced from 4 to 2 seconds.</li></ul><p>Lac (Barbarian Challenging Shout)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduce rune version duration from 6 to 3 seconds.</li><li>Reduce offering from 800 to 400.</li></ul><p>Runes removed:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ur</li><li>Ono</li><li>Met</li><li>Kaa</li></ul><p>The following runes have had their icons updated to match their Diablo II predecessors.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ohm</li><li>Thul</li><li>Vex</li><li>Lum</li><li>Jah</li><li>Tal</li></ul><p>Updates for adding sockets to items:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Jeweler is now accessible at Level 1 instead of at Level 15.</li><li>Chipped Gems can now be crafted at Level 1 instead of Level 15.</li><li>Gem Fragments now start dropping at Level 5.</li><li>Socketing costs only require Scattered Prisms for Ancestral items.

		<p>On A Journey, a new turn-based RPG currently being developed by Mowlo Silk, is set in a world that has elements of the medieval era combined with lashings of steampunk. On A Journey’s demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2639150?snr=1_7_15__13">available now</a> as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/turnbased_rpg">Steam Turn-Based RPG Fest</a> – drops you right in the middle of the story with a small group of revolutionaries on a mission to destroy cargo on a train, and derail it before it reaches the Capital City. The reason for this is twofold. First, it is to stop the transportation of Emerald Wood, a magic infused wood that helps prop up the power of the Queen, and second to destroy a prototype enemy mech weapon.</p>
<p><iframe title="On a Journey RPG (Game Trailer)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eq_Ex2kaUXU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We joing Uther and Tristan as they jump on to the target train from a bridge as it heads towards the city. The scenario begins with you controlling Tristan as he makes his way across the carriage rooftops, a sequence that leads up to QTEs for certain actions. Failing a QTE can dump you into a bad situation, for example, mistiming the button press to push a couple of enemy Ya’al knights out of a train carriage ended up in a combat scenario instead.</p>


<p>Combat is a classic turn-based system with an ATB bar filling up for each character until it’s their turn to act. In addition to the standard weapon attacks and magic abilities, there’s also a fury bar, which grants a special attack to deal high damage with – Uther’s Fury is a storm which fires a lot of icicles at enemies, for example. Some enemies are weak to certain types of magic, which you’ll want to learn to exploit.&nbsp;Uther also has an additional&nbsp;Summon option, costing 200 MP and 50 Fury points, but it is worth it as it brings in a giant rabbit called Roger that rolls towards enemies causing area damage.</p>


<p>Building a well-rounded party to cover the various magic elements will be a key to success, and exploring the character menus shows that Mowlo Silk has plans for a lot of magic and Fury powers in the final game. You’ll also be able to augment them with accessories that can provide bonuses and buffs.</p>
<p>As you explore you will come across other interactive elements in the world, an exclamation mark appearing over your character’s head as you find them, giving you the chance to speak to characters, find collectables and more. On some of these, a struggle bar is a variation on the QTE theme, needing to be filled by pressing the correct buttons to do so, and sometimes with a timer to avoid failure.</p>
<p>On A Journey’s sound and visual design is a bit of a mixed bag right now. Character models come across as disproportionate due to their large heads, approaching chibi-style proportions, but not quite. Those are the main ones you’ll see as you explore the world, but battles switch to more properly proportioned characters with a lot more detail from their clothing to expressions. There’s an anime look about them which makes sense since the cutscenes are in an anime style.</p>
<p>The stage designs are very good with each having lots of details within them – passengers in the train carriages all looked unique, for example – and hopefully that amount of detail and variety will continue throughout On A Journey. Whether you will meet any of these characters again is unknown, since the mission you were tasked with at the start was to derail the train. That could be setting up an overarching theme of whether the ends justify the means, or I could be reading too much into it.</p>

<p>The main part of the demo ends with a boss fight against the mech prototype, with the outcome of the characters unknown after the battle concludes. The real end of the demo takes us back to before the events of the train, and to Sturdy Oaks village, which is famous for its lumber and baking. We find ourselves as a teenager names Lance, being woken up by his mum as he is supposed to go hunting with his dad. Uther, it turns out, is Lance’s dad, and Lance will no doubt head out on a quest to find out what happened on the train.</p>

            <p>The developer of Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 has said it will take action to prevent in-game toxic behaviour, playing on beloved superfan actor Henry Cavill.</p>
<p>In the game's <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/93-september-community-update">latest community update</a>, Saber Interactive outlined the game's roadmap for the next year, and promised more bug fixes and tweaks are on the way.</p>
<p>Further, the developer asked players to be respectful to one another when playing online, following reports of toxicity.</p>

</figure>
<p>"It has been reported that some players were displaying hurtful behaviours or comments in-game. We do not tolerate that and will take action to prevent it," the update reads.</p>
<p>"First and foremost, we kindly ask you to remain respectful, mature and mannerly with your fellow Space Marines. You can never know how old the other players may be, how their day is going, how sensitive they may be… overall, you never know who your brothers and sisters are... It could even be  😏 ... you don't want to insult Henry Cavill, brother, no you don't."</p>
<p>The update then includes an Instagram post from Henry Cavill, who's been busy playing the game and described it as "the mutt's...".</p>
<p>"Loving the PvP and am really looking forward to it growing and expanding - it has real potential to be absolutely awesome," he said.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

            <p>
Leeds-based studio XR Games looks set to lay off nearly all of its staff, following the poorly-received release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a> VR: Reloaded.
</p>
<p>
72 people - out of the studio's 84 staff total - were told they were at risk of redundancy this week, according to a LinkedIn post by XR Games' former head of production on LinkedIn (thanks, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/hitman-vr-studio-xr-games-layoffs/">RoadtoVR</a>). Just 12 employees are likely to remain.
</p>
<p>
"This goes beyond restructuring," the staff member wrote. "I'll keep my thoughts and observations to myself. Today, my focus is on helping those affected."

<p>
Positions marked for redundancy look to include numerous development disciplines across the studio, including artists, programmers, project management, production, game design and IT.
</p>
<p>
XR Games is yet to announce the redundancies, and it's as-yet unclear whether the studio is planning to continue work on its other VR projects, such as Zombie Army VR and Starship Troopers: Continuum. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted XR Games for comment.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-thought-hitman-3-vr-was-bad-on-pc-just-wait-until-you-see-hitman-3-vr-reloaded-in-action">took a look at Hitman 3 VR Reloaded at launch</a> and found the game in a disappointing state, with poor visual quality, VR gameplay implementation and the removal of story scenes.

            <p>
Whenever I read the words "The Rocky Horror Show", I am swept into a time warp back to the fan screening I attended in 2005. Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.</p>
<p>Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC1E8yVJIS4">seek shelter in a castle</a> run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Anyway, the key thing, the important thing is: during the movie, there's a bit where the castle takes off and flies away. During the 2005 screening, the crowd all shouted "it's just a model!" at this point. I responded "shhhh!", and the hot girl sitting behind me sighed and said "tssk" and flicked me gently on the back of the head, much as you'd reprove a cat that is eyeing up your lunch. But here's the thing, lost lady of my youth: I wasn't actually trying to shush people! I was doing some clever cross-media humour! 
</p>
<p>
You see, there's a bit in Monty Python And The Holy Grail when King Arthur reaches Camelot, and somebody says "It's just a model" and is shushed by the other knights. That's what I was referencing, bygone attractive woman! I wasn't just trying to silence the Rocky Horror fans. The flying castle scene is right at the end of the dang movie - why would I have waited that long to intervene? Please, forgotten damsel with minimal respect for my personal space - please acknowledge that I am not a Brad or Janet. I am part of the clique. Please, if you're reading this, leave a comment and belatedly accept my adroit mingling of cues. That exchange has poisoned my soul for years. 
</p><p>
Oh hey! I've just noticed that Rocky Horror Picture Show is getting another video game adaptation. It's being made by FreakZone Games, a posse of retroheads whose works include the well-regarded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1300100/Spectacular_Sparky/">Spectacular Sparky</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/350780/MANOS_The_Hands_of_Fate__Directors_Cut/">Manos: The Hands Of Fate</a>. I originally wrote this post in my mood journal, but now I can publish it and profit from my long-petrified feelings of shame and injustice. Here's the trailer...

"Experience the strange journey of Brad and Janet like never before in this wild and wacky retro platform game adaptation of Richard O'Brien's legendary rock'n'roll musical," reads the blurb. "Jump to the left and dodge to the right in classic platforming action, along to 8-bit chiptune renditions of Rocky Horror's legendary songs." There's no store page yet that I can find. Will it have a flying castle scene? Will I ever be free of my sense of low-key humiliation and regret? You will learn the answer to at least one of these questions when the game releases, later this month. Alternatively, dig out your Speccy and fire up <a href="https://worldofspectrum.net/item/0004217/">the previous 1980s adaptation</a>.

            <p>In not quite six months since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> first burst its unapologetically bloody way onto our screens, the show has passed an impressive milestone.</p>
<p>As shared on the Fallout social media account, Amazon's adaptation has now been watched by 100 million viewers worldwide.</p>
<p>To put this figure into more perspective, Fallout is the only other show on Amazon Prime to cross the 100 million viewer threshold, the other being Rings of Power. The first season of The Rings of Power has, at the time of writing, reached over <a href="https://collider.com/rings-of-power-viewership-numbers-prime-video/">150 million viewers worldwide</a> since its debut, but with a much larger production budget.</p>

<p>On its release in April, Fallout quickly became a hit for Amazon, with scores of praise across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">Our own Fallout review</a> called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise", while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain had nothing but praise for the adaptation</a>.</p><p>The first season of Fallout saw<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks"> 65 million viewers</a> tuning in over its first 16 days of release.

<p>The show subsequently went on to receive several Emmy nominations, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">ultimately winning two</a>.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode-in-development-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Ubisoft is working on a co-op mode for the delayed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, a new report has claimed. 
</p>
<p>
Already in development before the delay and currently planned as a post-launch addition, Ubisoft is said to be creating the co-op mode as an optional extra.
</p>
<p>
That's according to the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/">Insider Gaming</a> report on Shadows' development, which makes clear the co-op mode wasn't the cause of Ubisoft's recent decision to hold the game's release until 2025. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft has publicly made no mention of a co-op offering for Shadows, which features two protagonists - the shinobi Naoe and the samurai Yasuke. The suggestion here, though, is that two players will be able to take charge of both characters and play side-by-side.
</p><p>
This would not be the first time Assassin's Creed has dabbled with a co-op option, but it would be the first in over a decade - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-unity-review">since the technically-challenged French revolution-set Assassin's Creed Unity</a> featured the option to play as four assassins side-by-side back in 2014. 
</p>
<p>
But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">the fallout from Unity's broken launch</a> tanked the Assassin's Creed series' reputation and sales figures, leading to a soft reboot of the franchise and a firm focus on it as a single-player series ever since. 
</p>
<p>
That said, we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-teases-past-assassins-creed-heroes-may-return-in-multiplayer-game-codename-invictus">Ubisoft is experimenting with multiplayer possibilities for Assassin's Creed once again</a>. Speaking to Eurogamer in 2022 about the franchise's future, Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté discussed Codename Invictus, a multiplayer-focused entry in the series that will hark back to the franchise's former multiplayer modes and likely feature various returning characters. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-staff-reportedly-pushed-ubisoft-to-delay-game-for-months">another report alleged that Assassin's Creed Shadows staff reportedly pushed Ubisoft to delay Shadows for months</a> to address concerns around game polish, feature tuning and narrative content.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Ubisoft for comment.

<p>Via Insider Gaming, the memo contained a mandate to "double down over the next 18 days to make sure that once again we create an amazing experience for our community. This means for the next two weekends we will be mandating extra time for all those working on deliverables for Citcon."</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>All staff are to be in the office on Friday, October 4th and Friday, October 11th (typically a work-at-home day)</p>
<p>All staff are to be in the office on Saturday, October 5th, and Saturday, October 12th (for these days, the company will provide breakfast and lunch, with staff receiving company TOIL (time off in lieu) which can be stored and used for time off at a later date</p>
<p>All staff are to work on Sunday, October 6th, and Sunday, October 13th (this can be a work-at-home day, but the company "encourages" people to be in the office. For these days and for those in the office, the company will provide breakfast and lunch, with staff receiving company TOIL, which can be stored and used for time off at a later date.</p></blockquote>
<p>IG describe the mandate as "latest in a slew of ridiculous requirements" arising from "mismanagement". Where this gets especially dodgy is that, as per another memo obtained by IG, said TOIL - effectively working overtime for the promise of commensurate time off in the future - will only be made available after the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squadron-42">Squadron 42</a>. The single player component of Star Citizen was apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-sim-squadron-42-is-feature-complete-and-gunning-for-starfields-lunch-with-massive-new-video">feature-complete as of last year’s Citizencon</a>, but no release date has currently been confirmed. Star Citizen as a whole has been in production since 2011 - game development is an uneven process, but requiring staff to crunch at this stage seems borderline insulting.</p><p>The additional kick in belly is that "employees must still be employed with the company by the time the game ships, or the TOIL "will be forfeited." Cloud Imperium staff were <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games-confirms-layoffs-as-former-staff-hit-out-at-relocation-plan">hit with layoffs this February</a> coinciding with an internally controversial relocation, including game director Todd Papy and lead designer Dane Kubicka. Back in July, Edwin reported on a senior programmer awarded £27,748 by a UK employment tribunal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-devs-cloud-imperium-fined-for-discriminating-against-autistic-programmer-over-work-from-home-request">in a discrimination case</a>. Paul Ah-Thion, who is autistic, was let go in 2022 after his work from home requests were denied.</p>
<p>As of this May, Star Citizen has raised over $700 million in crowd-funding. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wing-commander-3-heart-tiger">Wing Commander 3: Heart Of The Tiger</a> is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">under a fiver on GOG</a>, and you get to fly the spaceships and everything.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Arco is about consequences. In it’s unique setting of the Mesoamerican frontier at the turn of the century, small choices can cause huge aftershocks. Some of that manifests in the story-telling, as you follow a dour journey of revenge, regret, and colonisation’s cruel effects on a native population. In other ways, those consequences manifest through combat, exploration, and seemingly simple conversations with other NPCs. All those elements come together to create not only a mechanically sound and well designed game experience, but an evocative one that challenged not only my tactics prowess, but my moral compass too.</p>

<p>Arco is a western revenge story, but told from the perspective of the native peoples who so rarely get the spotlight in traditional spaghetti westerns and cowboy fantasies. Over five acts, you play as different characters with roots in various native tribes spread across the the land. You initially control a young Iyo boy named Tecolotl, who’s part of a family making their pilgrimage to The Sacred Tree to leave offerings. As the family makes their journey and goes about their usual habits of running errands and dealing with wildlife, though, mysterious people with ill intentions begin to appear near The Sacred Tree. As the tension these Newcomers bring simmers and boils before coming to a head, the story changes focus to a new character, but that undercurrent of a growing invasive threat remains throughout the duration of the game.</p>


<p>As act two opens, your perspective shifts to that of Tizo, a grizzled wanderer seeking out an old friend for some work. That one innocent job quickly escalates into a blood-soaked investigation into Newcomers who have been razing and looting native tribes all over – and Tizo takes up the task to deal with them permanently. Other protagonists follow in the next couple of acts, each with their own origins and goals. Each story that Arco tells is equally poetic and well-written, but each one establishes very different kinds of characters going on very different journeys. This makes it all the more rewarding when all of those journeys come together in the final act, and the way these various story threads link and feed into each other is so satisfying to see.</p>


<p>Across each of these acts in <em>Arco, </em>you’ll be digging into a blend of point-and-click exploration, dialogue-choice interactions, and incredibly unique real-time turn-based combat encounters. Each screen you explore in <em>Arco </em>is beautifully rendered in rich minimalist pixel-art, but those pixels can hide unexpected encounters and secret items depending on where you click. Some of these encounters will involve interacting with other characters, and the choices you make in these moments can have a lot of results – from losing HP after failing to de-escalate a confrontation to unlocking a hidden fight after getting a little too nosy about an overturned cart full of food. In some cases, having additional characters in your crew can even contribute to how well you do in these moments – in Act Two, I had a well-traveled hunter in my party who immediately recognized the tribe that some mysterious figures approaching us belonged to, and sternly instructed me not to wave to them, saving us from an unnecessary culture-offense and difficult battle.</p>
<p>Often, though, battles are inevitable. And frequently, they are incredibly difficult. Fights in <em>Arco </em>are a blend of fast-paced bullet-dodging and tactical decision making that will never give you an easy way out. Your goal in combat is to use your time while the action is frozen to predict where enemy attacks will land, position yourself to avoid them, and dish out attacks of your own based on where you think the enemies will be once the next turn plays out. Once your decisions are locked in, time resumes for a few moments as every character moves and attacks and you get to see how accurate your predictions were. It’s kind of a bite-sized strategy game where positioning is your ultimate resource and your biggest threat – some stages have hazards or traps, and ghosts will frequently come at you while you’re making mid-turn choices to deal damage to you if you take too long.</p>

<p>Almost every battle in <em>Arco </em>will have your brain firing on all cylinders to not only get through it alive, but with enough HP and resources remaining to ensure you’re capable of surviving the <em>next </em>battle that’s just around the corner. Resource management is just as much of a struggle as the battles themselves, and the scarcity of health and supplies really smartly feeds into the storytelling of a Mesoamerican people struggling to survive on the changing landscape of their once-familiar frontier. Arco so smartly blends all of these parts together, and the struggles of a difficult combat encounter or a punishing dialogue decision feel intertwined with the narrative struggles of your protagonists. It’s a strategically sad game, and punishing in all the right ways.</p>
