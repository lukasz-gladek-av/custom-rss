      <div><p>A new <em>Catan</em> Kickstarter campaign has gone live. Fanroll LLC's new <em>Catan Masterpiece</em> campaign isn't for a revised board game edition but for a series of artisanal, bespoke game components in the vein of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-3d-expansion-and-dawn-of-humankind-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan 3D</em></a>. The campaign was fully funded in an hour.</p>

<h2>The Catan Masterpiece Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the Kickstarter page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ultimatecatan/catan-masterpiece-series/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan Masterpiece</em></a> campaign started as a premium dice set. This escalated to the studio wanting to reimagine every element of the beloved board game. Those reimagined elements include game pieces made of wood, metal, resin, and cut gemstones.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/catan-masterpiece-ancient-civilization-pieces.jpg?itok=bgJO1-GM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/catan-masterpiece-ancient-civilization-pieces.jpg?itok=cQUfq52_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That is what you are backing with this Kickstarter. Not a premium version of the <em>Catan</em> board game, but individual components made with pristine materials. Backers have tons of options from resin or painted wooden dice to metallic or resin Robber pieces to gemstone hex tiles. There are even three sets of player pieces: Metal Classic, Plastic Civilizations, and Metal Civilizations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CATAN Masterpiece Series is a tribute to the game that has brought joy and camaraderie to so many. It's a celebration of the countless memories made around the table, the friendships forged through friendly competition, and the sheer excitement of watching your settlements and cities come to life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the Catan Masterpiece series are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Explorer for $25: Your choice of two plastic Ancient Civilization pieces and one of eight plastic pins</li>
	<li>Harbormaster for $69: Everything in the Explorer tier, a full set of nine Ports, a wooden dice set, and your choice of resin Robber and two of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Traditionalist for $99: Everything in the Harbormaster tier, a set of Classic Metal player pieces, a set of Sharp-edge Dice, your choice of Metal Robber, and three of eight pins</li>
	<li>Architect for $149: Your choice of four plastic Ancient Civilizations, one Metal Ancient Civilization, a set of Nine Ports, a set of Sharp-edge Dice, a Gemstone Robber, and four of eight pins</li>
	<li>Woodcutter for $299: A set of wood hexes, wood sea frames, Acryllic number discs, everything in Architect tier, and five of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Artisan for $499. A set of Sparkle Resin hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, everything in the Architect tier, and six of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Stonecutter for $749: A set of gemstone hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, everything in the Architect tier, and seven of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Noble for $999: a set of gemstone hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, all Ancient Civilizations, a set of Metal Classic Player Pieces, a set of Nine Ports, a set of Painted Wood and Sharp-edge dice, a Resin Robber, a Metal Robber, a Resin Robber, and all eight pins.</li>
</ul><p>For those wanting a more specialized bundle, the individual pieces can be purchased as separate add-ons once you have backed the project.</p>

<p>At time of writing the <em>Catan Masterpiece</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;$286,318, more than five times its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign concludes on March 21.</p>

After a messy run with Zack Snyder, the new plan was to reboot the DC film franchise, connect the shows and movies to it, and give creators more freedom to make varied projects in different genres. And the two said that the goal is to create a universe that feels interconnected, but with films that still feel separate and standalone. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As covered by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span><em>,</em> who attended the recent DC Studios press event, Gunn doesn’t want people to feel like they need to do homework and watch a bunch of past content before they see the next big DC show or film. </p><p> “We remain steadfast that each of these projects work as a standalone project,” said Gunn. “So you can see <em>Superman</em>, you can watch <em>Lanterns</em>, without having to see both of them. Although if you can, there will be special things in there for people who have seen both.” </p><p> And this is all part of a larger six-year plan, which the duo confirmed will culminate in an <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>-like crossover movie. Neither exec had any more details to share about this big movie, which is not likely to hit theaters until 2030, but Gunn has experience producing these kinds of superhero event films, having served as an executive producer on Marvel and Disney’s <em>Endgame </em>in 2019. </p><p>To reach the point where such a project is viable in the new DC universe, Gunn and Safran laid out a plan that calls for a lot of content. According to the DC Studio bosses, the company will produce two-live action movies, two live-action shows, and two animated shows every year, some of which will be created exclusively for WB Discovery’s Max. </p><p>It’s an ambitious plan and I worry that it might be too much, too fast, but Gunn and Safran are committed to making sure every movie has a solid script before production begins. Likewise, they admitted they are flexible and will change the plan as needed. </p><p>For example, in 2023, they had no intentions of making a movie about Batman villain Clayface. But then Mike Flanagan, the filmmaker behind works such as <em>Doctor Sleep </em>and <em>Midnight Mass</em>, pitched them one and wrote a script they both loved and it got greenlit. Of course, I’ve not seen <em>Clayface</em>, but it at least sounds like Gunn isn’t too worried about changing plans or fiddling with canon if it means getting a cool movie. That might be the key to defeating superhero fatigue and competing with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913">Marvel’s massive MCU</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the nearly 23 years since its release, Neverwinter Nights has remained popular with players who have supported the title with fan-made mods. Now, there's a new expansion for Neverwinter Nights called Doom of Icewind Dale, and it's officially authorized by Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>Doom of Icewind Dale was developed by Luke Scull, a game developer who got his start as a modder for Neverwinter Nights before joining Ossian Studios and working on the official expansion for Neverwinter Nights 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neverwinter-nights-2-mysteries-of-westgate-review/1900-6209264/" data-ref-id="1900-6209264">Mysteries of Westgate</a>.

From there, players have to reclaim their identity, figure out why they were abducted, and "uncover a sinister plot to unleash a rage-filled godling upon the North."</p><p>The base game is required to play the expansion, but Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is currently on sale on Fanatical.

It has approximately 10-15 hours of gameplay that lets players explore some of the 10 towns of Icewind Dale, as well as other locations including Icewind Pass, the Dwarven Valley, and the Reghed Glacier. It also includes new monsters and original music created for the expansion.</p><p>Like several of D&amp;D's adaptations, Neverwinter Nights and Doom of Icewind Dale are set in The Forgotten Realms. That setting is also going to be used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-developing-a-live-action-dungeons-dragons-series-set-in-the-forgotten-realms-report/1100-6529513/" data-ref-id="1100-6529513">the Dungeons &amp; Dragons live-action series</a> that is currently in development.</p><p><em>GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t release until March 20, but that hasn’t stopped some players from getting their hands on a copy of the game. Ubisoft knows about the situation and has, in turn, released a statement to players about Assassin’s Creed Shadows getting out to the public early and the leaks that have followed.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1894135156312617339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledges that players have</a> “accessed Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its official release”. Ubisoft says that players, if they see the gameplay, should know that there is still some work being done to prepare for the day one experience.</p>



<p>“The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game,” Ubisoft said.</p>

<p>The studio also called the leaks “unfortunate” and “can diminish the excitement for players”. To that point, they suggest those with the game avoid publishing anything to avoid spoiling it for those who are waiting until the game launches.</p>



<p>“We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others,” they said. “Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.</p>



<p>“Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game’s launch comes after multiple delays from its original fall 2024 release.</p>

			<p>It's been <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that DC Studios</a> is in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm for any upcoming DC video games. This was mentioned during a visit that brought the press out for a studio update on their upcoming films, shows, and games. Typically, games aren't included in these sorts of meetings, but after James Gunn was announced as co-head of DC Studios, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-boss-reveals-plans-to-expand-arkham-universe-beyond-suicide-squad/">announced a plan</a> to include games in an interconnected DC universe.</p>
<p>During this meeting, James Gunn confirmed that the heads of DC Studios have been meeting with WB Games Division Head JB Perrette, where they then meet with members of NetherRealm and Rocksteady.</p>
<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "it's really the first time its ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Gunn says that there are designs for the projects "in their very earliest stages," when he then goes on to talk about what the story could be for the character or the game's overall theme. However, when asked about when people will begin to see hints of video games coming in the DCU, James Gunn said that it will be a "couple years" from now.</p>
<p>There's also been no hints as to what kind of games will be in development. It's well-known and well-documented as to what fans would like. Fans have been waiting for Injustice 3 for nearly a decade. However, fans instead received Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. These are two games that did not perform well at all, with the support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ending last month.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO left</a> the company thanks to the major failure of the Suicide Squad game and MultiVersus. It's always been known that Marvel is more popular than DC in nearly every avenue, but especially when it comes to DC games. They are known for being hit or miss. However, with new Batman games reportedly in development, there is hope that these games will be as successful as the other Batman games that were released.</p>
<p>What DC games would you want to see from NetherRealm and Rocksteady? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

Three years later, the game has been brought over the finish line by the rest of the team at Indonesian studio Pikselnesia, with a result that feels unavoidably prescient. Though <em>Afterlove EP </em>isn’t without its flaws, its meditation on the mundane ways grief distorts us, and the unglamorous journey of finding our way back to the light, offers an understated catharsis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>follows Rama, an indie band frontman who loses a part of himself when his partner Cinta unexpectedly passes away. He spends a year in self-inflicted isolation, and by the time he’s ready to crawl out of his apartment and try to be a person again, he’s surprised to see how much of the world has moved on without him. Or, at least, tried to. His bandmates have felt trapped in his indecision, so they’ve been looking for lifeboats off a sinking ship with new projects and career paths. Rama expected everything to be where he left it a year ago. <em>Afterlove EP </em>spends much of its time underlining that while grief deserves sympathy, it doesn’t become a free pass to treat people however you want.</p><p>Grief requires some grace. No one handles the loss of a loved one “perfectly,” and a story that criticizes someone going through that pain can be a tough sell, and easy to fuck up if its characters come off as irredeemable or its approach feels insensitive. <em>Afterlove EP </em>starts out with Rama hearing the disembodied voice of Cinta encouraging him to get back out there and perform again, but as the game goes on, it becomes clear it’s less an echo of a lost loved one and more a manifestation of Rama’s inner monologue. Cinta is defensive and accusatory, and puts Rama’s feelings above everyone else’s. As I lived out Rama’s life, I gradually became frustrated when Cinta would weigh in. This wasn’t the compassionate person her grieving friends described, it was someone who almost always defaulted to Rama’s point of view, siding with him even when his friends had grievances that were more than reasonable.</p><figure id="" data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If that disconnect between player and protagonist sounds frustrating, it is, but it makes Rama’s growth and the story’s pay-off so much sweeter. Rama starts off sympathetic. He’s grieving the loss of someone who was clearly close to him, but the longer I played <em>Afterlove EP</em>, the more it became clear he was myopically obsessed with his own pain and ignoring how others were affected by his absence. The identification I felt with him gradually gave way to alienation as I stood by and watched his relationships unravel, like I was a friend powerless to stop someone I care about from falling further down into despair. <em>Afterlove EP </em>gave me plenty of opportunities to argue with my friends who felt abandoned by me, but for most of the game, I couldn’t find dialogue options that resembled an apology for my absence, my belligerent musician’s ego, or the selfish way I talked about my grief as if it was more important than anyone else’s. I spent hours of <em>Afterlove EP </em>watching people who cared about each other nearly lose one another because Rama couldn’t see past his own pain. Every time I met up with bandmates trying to pick up where things left off, it felt like the ties between them were one wrong word away from snapping as he insisted on his own vision of the music and the band’s future, and was indifferent to his friends’ pain after they lost a friend, too. Rama can be a frustrating character to pilot in a dialogue-based game, and Cinta’s inability to challenge him made me skeptical of her from the beginning, but <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s commitment to its damaged hero and his dysfunctional friend group is a crucial piece of the story it’s telling.</p><p>There’s a fine line between a sympathetic protagonist and a selfish one, and <em>Afterlove EP</em> balances on it so well that by the time I was hours into Rama’s story—watching him be so fixated on his own shit that he was hurting those closest to him—I only felt sorry for him. He couldn’t see the forest for the trees, even in the face of so many possibilities for forming new connections and repairing old ones.</p><figure id="" data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>plays like a <em>Persona </em>game in which you manage relationships and work each day, deciding whether to spend your limited time seeing friends, busking for money, going to therapy to unpack all the discord within your social circles, or possibly building a relationship with a new suitor. I spent most days hanging out with Satria, a record store shopkeeper who knew exactly how to push Rama’s buttons. He’s part of a queer community that plays music in the local park. Rama hasn’t explored this side of himself, and that kind of self-discovery isn’t made easier by having the disembodied voice of your ex talking to you while you try to form new connections. However, <em>Afterlove EP </em>doesn’t reach for the low-hanging fruit I expected it to when it comes to Rama finding new love. Given Cinta’s hold on him, I feared that Rama moving on to a new partner might see the game create a toxic love triangle in his mind, but instead, things play out quite differently. It was a welcome change after Rama’s mourning had gotten in the way of him moving forward for most of the game. Grief is the foundation <em>Afterlove EP </em>is built on, but its waxings on the topic aren’t the only thing it has to say.</p><p>The thread connecting all these relationships is the indie rock music Rama plays. When you’re not chatting with friends and potential lovers, <em>Afterlove EP </em>is a rhythm game with some really catchy tracks that capture the spirit and gusto of young performers who want a life for themselves outside of the bars and kitchens they work at now. Even if I can’t understand the Indonesian lyrics, I feel the pain and yearning in Rama’s voice and the heavy riffs underneath.</p><figure id="" data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That being said, <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s rhythm game segments are exceptionally hard to read. Each note you play runs down a sheet music-like track, prompting you to press one of the four directional buttons when it reaches the center of the screen. The way it’s presented can be disorienting and frustrating—its use of directional inputs comes with a muscle memory expectation that some of the movement you’re seeing should correlate to which button you’re pressing. Instead, I tripped up a fair bit as notes came from the right side of the screen but required me to press up or down. Rhythm games, like playing a real instrument, are meant to be instinctual. You train yourself on something long enough and it becomes muscle memory embedded in your fingertips. <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s UI design is minimalistic, and doesn’t communicate its mechanics well, so it never quite reaches that level of intuitive rhythm you need to get lost in the music.</p><p>Like Rama’s music, <em>Afterlove EP </em>balances the thorny and heartwarming parts of love and loss. Given what the Pikselnesia team went through to make it happen, it’s not surprising that it understands all the ugly and beautiful parts of losing someone you care about. A lot of <em>Afterlove EP </em>guides you by the hand through the mundane parts of becoming a person again. When you lose parts of yourself, finding something new, good, and healthy to fill that void isn’t always glamorous or fun. It can be awkward and uncomfortable, and require talking to people who see through your bullshit and call you out on it when you can’t see past it yourself. <em>Afterlove EP </em>is sympathetic to the fact that none of us handle grief in a way that is easy to swallow for everyone around us, but its best moments come when it’s willing to slap you across the face and tell you to do better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Phoenix Labs is officially shutting down its free-to-play action RPG Dauntless this spring. In a post on Steam and social media, the studio kept the announcement pretty short and sweet.</p>



<p>“Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement reads</a>. “Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates. The game will no longer be available to play on May 29, 2025.”</p>



<p>They closed the social media post, specifically, saying, “Thanks to all for being a part of the Dauntless journey.”</p>



<p>Dauntless’ shutdown comes nearly six years after it first launched in September 2019 for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. The game had since been released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

<p>The movealso comes during a tumultuous time for Phoenix Labs as a studio. </p>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming learned</a> that roughly 50 people were let go at the company. There was a belief among those let go at the time that Phoenix Labs as a whole was set to be closed. </p>



<p>As of writing, parent company Forte has yet to make an announcement on the status of the studio. Insider Gaming has reached out, however, to attempt to get clarity on the situation.</p>



<p>At its peak, Phoenix Labs said that Dauntless had seen over 6 million players.</p>

Dungeon parties consist of four players: a tank, healer, and two damage dealers. Players can choose from several different heroes in each role, all of which embody classic fantasy archetypes like warrior, paladin, monk, mage, barbarian, and druid.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fellowship | Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Just like in WoW's Mythic+ system, players will have a limited amount of time to slay a dungeon's bosses as well as clear out a certain percentage of enemies. Higher difficulty dungeons will have additional modifiers, but will reward better loot upon a successful run, thus enabling players to push even higher difficulty dungeons in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who has run a WoW dungeon in the last decade will feel right at home. However, what's impressive about Fellowship is how it's taken WoW's Mythic+ system but distilled it down to its core, without 20 years of outdated UI elements, need for player-made add-ons to play optimally, or lengthy grinding to level-up new characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Its interface is clean and customizable and enemy attacks are easy to read and react to. Many of the add-ons players need to download in WoW in order to play well, like a threat meter, a way to track party interrupts, or a detailed dungeon map so players can plan effective routes, are baked into Fellowship by default. That makes it far easier for players who may have always been interested in playing WoW's dungeon-heavy endgame, but found the entire thing too confusing and unapproachable, to jump in and understand what's happening at a glance.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether there is a huge audience for a standalone MMO endgame experience minus the whole MMO part is still an open question, but Fellowship looks like it has a lot of the essential pieces in place. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fellowship's open Steam Next Fest playtest</a> will run from February 24 through March 3, with six different heroes for players to choose from. It does not currently have a release date.

Many of these games look great—like Blendo Games’ new FPS <em>Skin Deep,</em> which is set in a giant spaceship—but only one of them has 2025's song of the year and that’s<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbE1uRDdHYUV0b25WaVVtYU9WaXE2UVhDckNfUXxBQ3Jtc0tsOVcxX0ozaUVkS3U4VGdzMzAxWDBka2dveDR1QmpDTzRrU01LU19BazdKMGhXTU5EQ2h4ZFZqaUIwODA4dDhNSEtkWkJtYlVZaV90Q3gtMW9QN0hKYzVydWQyaXRpRTJZck1ENkdRVks5TzFFWkZ6SQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1875320%2Fto_a_T%2F&amp;v=E-QlrrC4vFk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbE1uRDdHYUV0b25WaVVtYU9WaXE2UVhDckNfUXxBQ3Jtc0tsOVcxX0ozaUVkS3U4VGdzMzAxWDBka2dveDR1QmpDTzRrU01LU19BazdKMGhXTU5EQ2h4ZFZqaUIwODA4dDhNSEtkWkJtYlVZaV90Q3gtMW9QN0hKYzVydWQyaXRpRTJZck1ENkdRVks5TzFFWkZ6SQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1875320%2Fto_a_T%2F&amp;v=E-QlrrC4vFk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>To a T, </em>which is coming out this May</a></span>. </p><p>Let’s watch the trailer and enjoy:</p><p>So what is <em>To a T</em>? Good question, because as cute and wonderful as this trailer and its song might be, I wasn’t sure what the game actually was. Its really confusing that at the end there is a note mentioning that this new game isn’t actually <em>about </em>food or cooking despite the giraffe’s catchy song. </p><p>According to Annapurna Interactive, <em>To a T</em> is being developed by <em>Katamari Damacy </em>creator  Keita Takahashi and is described as a “colorful” “narrative adventure” game. Here’s the official description: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>To a T </em>is a charming, colorful adventure game about a teen navigating life in a small town with their cute dog companion. While their body is stuck in a T-pose, they do their best to make the most of it. </p></blockquote><p>I’m down to play this. I mean I was in the moment I heard “The Giraffe Song” by Rebecca Sugar (<em>Steven Universe</em>).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pgl-ceo-says-there-have-been-concerted-efforts-to-stop-company-from-hosting-cs2-events/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The CEO of esports tournament organizer PGL says there have been “concerted efforts from multiple parties to stop” running CS2 events. The most recent PGL event at Cluj-Napoca sold out tickets, despite many teams backing out of the tournament at the last minute.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pgl-ceo-says-anyone-trying-to-monopolize-cs2-will-simply-fail">PGL CEO Says Anyone Trying to Monopolize CS2 “Will Simply Fail”</h2>



<p>Following the conclusive grand finals of PGL Cluj-Napoca, where MOUZ defeated Falcons 3-1, PGL CEO Silviu Stroie <a href="https://x.com/ssilviu/status/1893928028591251706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X </a>(formerly known as Twitter) to celebrate. While celebrating the event, Stroie also spoke against the alleged efforts to thwart PGL, and called out those looking to monopolize the CS2 tournament circuit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Cluj Napoca, this is Romania!!! We finally decided to run an event with audience in our home country and we were all blown away! By far one of our best events ever. We will continue to run CS2 events despite concerted efforts from multiple parties to stop us. Counter-Strike is a global phenomenon and any single company that will try to monopolize it will simply fail. Our next arena event is in May in Astana, where we expect another sold out arena full of [Counter-Strike] fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But who are the parties trying to stop PGL? Stroie’s comment about monopolization suggest he’s referring to the larger competing organizers in ESL and BLAST. Prior to 2025, ESL and BLAST’s primary Counter-Strike leagues featured partnered organizations, which incentivized those teams to prioritize those events over any other ones, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">save for Majors</a>. Not only did those teams prioritize ESL and BLAST events, put the partner programs restricted the number of non-partnered teams that could qualify for those events.</p>



<p>These programs were effectively dashed by Valve changes made in 2023 that went into effect at the start of 2025. These changes banned partnership programs between team and organizer, forced all events to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-vrs-in-cs2-valve-regional-standings-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use Valve rankings</a> or open qualifiers for qualification, and forced organizers to make compensation public. In an attempt to get teams to re-prioritize their events, both ESL and BLAST have publicized new revenue share models. According to HLTV’s Milan “Striker” Švejda, the lack of revenue share <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/57777/striker-reveals-why-several-teams-skipped-pgl-cluj-napoca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly led</a> to some of the top teams choosing to skip PGL Cluj-Napoca.</p>



<p>While PGL has not pursued a revenue share model, their Cluj-Napoca event drew praise for its format. Namely, fans were overall pleased to see a meaningful 3rd place match adopted, upping the stakes with an improved result in the Valve rankings and a big prize pool bump.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/acquire-60th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review.1117704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/acquire-60th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">1964 was a busy year. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, The Beatles made their way to New York City, and the Olympics were held in Tokyo. But for our purposes, it also marked the wide release of the board game Acquire. Now, more than 60 years and multiple editions later, Renegade Games has the reins on this historic hotel-building powerhouse, releasing both a premium 60th Anniversary Edition in 2024 and its retail counterpart in 2023. While these new versions may have a fresh coat of paint, they still maintain the same wonderful gameplay that has kept it around for six decades and landed it on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">best classic board games</a>.</p><div id="215711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="578d7190-f9d3-4f11-9bcb-7e0a0d6f6c4e"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acquire 60th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="578d7190-f9d3-4f11-9bcb-7e0a0d6f6c4e" id="159919"><div id="159919" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acquire</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Acquire plays with two to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games">six players</a>, where everyone lays tiles, establishes hotel chains, and purchases shares of stock – all with the hopes of getting big returns on their investments. While the theme may not sound the most enthralling compared to other games on your local game store’s shelves, there’s a reason Acquire has been around for more than 60 years. It’s easy to teach and has a deceptive amount of strategy involved – so much so that it was even featured at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rdQlj9BVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>World Series of Board Gaming</u></a> tournament last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On your turn, players will pull a tile – each with a grid coordinate printed on it – and place it on the board in its corresponding spot. When a tile is placed and creates a minimum of two adjacently connected ones, a hotel is formed, and its founder gets a share of its stock. The larger a hotel chain grows, the more expensive each share of stock becomes, but also, the greater the payout when that hotel gets acquired and absorbed into a bigger hotel. So, buying low and selling high is the name of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These latest versions from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/renegade">Renegade Games</a> offer a new variant rule known as Tycoon Mode, which makes it easier for players who aren’t in the lead to stage a comeback. In the traditional Classic Mode, only the first- and second-place owners of a hotel chain – the two who own the most stock – get the payout when it’s acquired. Tycoon Mode expands this benefit to the third player as well. While I prefer the classic option, I appreciate this variant’s inclusion to help ease new players into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique to the 60th Anniversary Edition are a set of special power cards that tweak the gameplay further. These cards provide powerful bonuses, such as playing four tiles at once or buying three stocks for free. While these cards dramatically change the game, I found them to be too powerful and game-altering for my tastes. After a single playthrough with them, I haven’t gone back and have no real desire to. However, like Tycoon Mode, they are optional, so they're worth trying out to see if they suit your style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the differences between the main retail release and the 60th Anniversary Edition, the $50 price difference comes with enough tweaks and adjustments to make the premium edition worth considering. Gameplay and core components (tiles, board, and cards) remain the same – with the exception of the power cards – so the main differences lie in the components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three main upgrades in the premium version that make the investment worthwhile: a drawstring bag for tile selection, a removable insert for organizing share cards and hotel miniatures, and replacing paper money with sturdy poker chips.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, these may not seem like major upgrades – or worth the additional cost – but the improved organizer and drawstring bag significantly enhance the experience. Storing and blindly grabbing tiles from a bag eliminates the need to manually flip over tiles during setup, making the game flow much smoother. If you opt for the base edition, I highly recommend finding a bag to use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another helpful addition exclusive to the Anniversary Edition is the redesigned plastic organizer, which stores share cards in their own separate container with a plastic lid. This allows the cards, which are held upright in grooves alongside their corresponding hotel miniatures, to be placed more conveniently. In contrast, the base edition’s organizer is the size of the entire game box, which, while functional, takes up more table space. Most players would likely prefer having the cards placed separately on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last exclusive upgrade is purely cosmetic: replacing paper money with poker chips. Personally, I detest paper money in board games and believe it should have stayed in the 1960s. A significant portion of the Anniversary Edition’s increased price comes from this component upgrade, but what an upgrade it is. The chips have a nice weight to them, are neatly stored in their own container, and help keep the game organized. Plus, they’re simply more satisfying to handle than flimsy paper bills – there’s just something about that clinky sound.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Acquire: 60th Anniversary Edition (MSRP $99.99)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4Xqe?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D7MSX6PR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3ReLK?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Empire</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXYp4?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Standard Edition (MSRP $49.99)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/7XxGD?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKO4n8?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Empire</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/znXYgx?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">See More Strategy Board Games:</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 24, 2025 7:25 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Acquire is one of those games I can always fall back on for game nights, knowing it will be a great time. We even have it on our list of the best classic board games. The Renegade releases were my first foray into the game, but it quickly became apparent why it has endured for so long. It’s easy to learn, quick to set up (especially with the Anniversary Edition), and offers a low barrier to entry while maintaining a high skill ceiling. This is especially true thanks to the new Tycoon Mode and power cards, which make it more accessible for younger and newer players.
Whether you get the base version or the more expensive Anniversary Edition, Acquire is an easy recommendation for any board game collection.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-ship-preview-its-sea-of-thieves-meets-left-4-dead-and-its-even-more-polished-and-fun-than-last-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was almost exactly one year ago that I walked into a meeting during the Game Developer’s Conference and first got introduced to Jump Ship, a four-player sci-fi PvE shooter that blends mechanics from Sea of Thieves, Left 4 Dead, and FTL into something I thought was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-ship-plays-like-a-mix-of-sea-of-thieves-left-4-dead-and-ftl">extremely special</a>. I recently had a chance to play the latest build with a few of the developers, and let’s just say that if any indie game can break out big in what’s already an absolutely stacked year of releases, I’d bet my money on Jump Ship. As it heads towards an Early Access launch this Summer, it’s more polished and more fun than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren’t familiar with Jump Ship already, it’s a non-grindy space romp for up to four players — and I specifically didn’t say multiplayer because the team at Keepsake Games told me they’re responding to feedback and building on what they hope will be a clever way for solo players to enjoy Jump Ship. In short, if you want to treat it like a single-player game, there will be narratively constructed AI assistants to help you man the ship. You get a taste of this in the Prologue, which serves as one part tutorial — introducing you to gameplay mechanics like shooting, flying in your space suit, manning and piloting the ship, and ship combat — and one part lore-builder. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Jump Ship - Closed Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Jump Ship now has a much-appreciated story behind its core PvE gameplay. A malicious virus has infected machines throughout the galaxy, and it’s up to you and your fellow Atirans to get to the root of it at the heart of the galaxy and stop it. You’ll run through procedurally generated chains of missions in each sector in order to get there. Some take 10 minutes, others might take an hour. You’ll know roughly what to expect going in, as each one of your branching choices on the Jump Map is color-coded to let you know how much danger you’re voluntarily wading into. But of course, the greater the danger, the greater the reward… </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jump Ship now has a much-appreciated story behind its core PvE gameplay.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aiding you is a non-infected AI you discover in the Prologue called Iris, who acts as something of a narrator on your missions. It’s a welcome bit of structure around the solid foundation of gameplay Jump Ship brings to the table. As is the Hangar, which is the sort-of base of operations from which you can cash in your in-game currency to buy and customize your outfits, look at the greater Galaxy Map, and even engage in a bit of soccer in your downtime. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But back to that core four-player gameplay. Boy oh boy is it fun! As you embark on your mission, things naturally won’t always go according to plan. Your ship will get attacked en route to your destination, requiring one of you to pilot the ship and fire the meager pilot’s chair weapons, while another sits down at the ship’s proper weapon station to wield the 360-degree-pivoting cannon at any annoying targets. Meanwhile, the other two of you might be mag-booted to the ship’s hull outside, taking shots at passing ships. That is, until an enemy vessel damages your ship, requiring one or more of you to run inside, grab a fire extinguisher, crawl into a vent, and put out the flames. After all, you’ve gotta keep that pineapple pizza-maker in full working order!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you do get where you’re going, all four of you disembark and make your way on foot inside the structure that houses the loot you’re after. These evil, infected robots will keep coming and they won’t play nice, so teamwork is essential at each step of the mission. Your grappling hook helps zip you around areas both on the ground and in outer space much quicker, and once you’ve got the big loot, one of you has got to get it back aboard the ship while the others protect your defenseless, arms-full self.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both my demo last year and my latest one just the other day were short. On the one hand, it proves that Jump Ship is a blast in short bursts, and thus you don’t have to quit your job in order to keep up with it. On the other hand, though, I haven’t seen enough of the larger mission structure and the procedurally generated variety to know if it will deliver on its endlessly replayable promise. But everything I’ve seen so far absolutely screams potential hit. Jump Ship has all the right ingredients to become something special, and I can’t wait to play a lot more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <title><![CDATA[Mecha Break: The Final Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-the-final-preview.1117689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming free-to-play online shooter Mecha Break really does well to evoke the exciting, breakneck sense of action from classic Japanese anime like Gundam Wing or Macross Plus. Focusing on the dizzying combat and thrills of piloting giant robots tearing through environments and enemy steel, it so far looks to deliver on its potential of over-the-top mechs duking it out in stylish fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the open beta, I got to dive into several hours of a near-final build of Mecha Break, seeing its opening storyline set on a post-cataclysmic Earth and a suite of multiplayer skirmishes that range from familiar match types to a surprisingly ambitious take on a squad-based Mecha extraction shooter on a large-scale map. So far, Mecha Break offers an impressive suite of mechs and modes for its upcoming debut.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mecha BREAK Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in a far future where an ecological disaster has torn Earth apart, you play as a pilot in an organization known as S.H.A.D.O.W., which fights rival mech pilots and works to stop the spread of a crystalline virus that infects both organic life and even mechs. By engaging in strike missions and amassing more resources to upgrade and unlock new mecha, you can help the war effort and improve humanity's chances of survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For anyone who's watched any mecha action series or tried their hand at building Gunpla over the last 30 years, Mecha Break's influences are obvious – and the lead developer was clear about what type of game he wanted. During our chat at the preview session, Kris Kwok, CEO of Amazing Seasun Games and executive producer of Mecha Break, stated that the team aimed to capture the experience of watching a classic mecha anime with giant robots weaving through missile fire and landing a slick finishing shot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've had a wonderful childhood experience watching a TV station in Hong Kong, which introduced me to Japanese anime. My favorites were Gundam and Macross, and they are my biggest influences on Mecha Break," said the CEO of Amazing Seasun Games. "I've always wanted to make a multiplayer game like this, and I drew upon a lot of military tactics to offer different types of experiences for players – you have strikers with light or heavy armor, and you have a sniper role, or mechs that fly and move swiftly through the environment. Our core design philosophy was to have a roster of mechs that all capture the experience of piloting giant machines of war, regardless of your role in a match."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening missions are the most story-driven moments of Mecha Break, but considering there are no present plans for a dedicated campaign, it was a little disappointing to see it's not much of a focus. However, the existing plot did well in framing the multiplayer engagements, and you'll even be able to have your custom pilot explore the massive hangar to talk with other characters and observe your mechs. The heart of the gameplay is the multiplayer engagements, and as seen in last year's beta, Mecha Break features the traditional 6v6 multiplayer match types such as territory control, guiding payloads, and a twist on capture the flag, which involves delivering fuel to a rocket ship while avoiding enemy fire.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what elevates these engagements is the awesome suite of mechs that lean into the hero-style archetypes. Aquila is the long-range heavy sniper that can hover in mid-air to time a shot, Falcon is the agile, flight-focused mech that can rain down missiles, and Tricera is the heavily armored mech that can tear through enemies with its twin Gatling guns. I was impressed by how well-designed and visually striking each mech was, and I had some fun decking out the robots with custom decals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mecha Break is gorgeous to see in action, and I was very pleasantly surprised with the current state of its level of craft and polish. Since last year's beta, the developers have taken in feedback to fine-tune the player interface and balance between mechanisms. Considering how fast and exciting the matches can get, seeing how well-layered they are is impressive. It's also a multiplayer game that's not focused on racking up kills, but on helping the team achieve objectives and offering support. Still, I definitely had my moments where I became an absolute menace in the air as Falcon, only for the team's sniper to adapt to my tricks and pick me off from afar.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The pacing of Mecha Break is incredibly fast, and yet I sometimes found myself forgetting about capturing objectives because I was so swept up in the action and the dizzying pace. In some cases, I spent so much time focusing on enemy movements and attacks that I missed clear opportunities to help the team's larger goals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One mode that was more recently added is Mashmak, which is Mecha Break's take on an extraction shooter. In this large-scale mode with several other players, a squad of 3 will hot drop onto a random spot on the map and take out AI mechs and elite foes to collect forces, all the while facing off against other players and even the environment as tornadoes and deadly swells rip through the environment. By upgrading your mech with mods and other gear – such as a glider that I missed out on using – your team will have been able to boost up and eventually provide you coordinate and pick your battles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an impressive concept for sure, and I appreciate just how expansive the mode is – especially when piloting mechs – but given that it's a much slower-paced mode, it felt at times felt like the matches took a little while to properly get going, even with the AI mechs to battle. I also felt generally underpowered when facing some battalions of enemies, which prompted my team to move on to other places to avoid wasting time. Still, I see the potential of this mode, and storms in game really do well shake up the match and instill some tension.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took some time for the developers to properly get Mashmak into shape, but they stated they found a nice balance for the experience by offering variety.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It took some trial and error to get this right, as we were never happy with how it initially turned out – our first prototype was not that positive," Kwok recalled. "So we had to rework everything, and sometime later we had a better version of it, but it still was not there. So after iterations, we finally brought Mashmak together and it was very important to offer variety within these matches. The auxiliary weapon systems you can collect, the [hazardous weather] storms, and the boss enemies you can find really do add a lot to these matches, especially on a large map to explore with a team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Mecha Break's fast action and stellar selection of mechs present a fun and thrilling package for its online multiplayer. As a live service game, it'll definitely offer a lot of options right out of the gate, but I do have some lingering worries about how the in-game store will be set up, which is a normal worry to have these days. Mecha Break's combat and style is in great shape, and it'll certainly make for a solid option for fans looking to get their next mecha action game fix.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-devs-discuss-the-creation-of-its-new-campaign-black-hawk-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play first-person shooter Delta Force recently launched a co-op campaign mode called Black Hawk Down, which is inspired by the film of the same name and reimagines the campaign of 2003’s Delta Force: Black Hawk Down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, the campaign takes you through the streets of Mogadishu with a level of immersion that wasn’t possible in the original 22 years ago. It’s also designed to present a legitimate challenge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can technically beat it solo, but it will be very difficult — you won’t face fewer enemies or easier firefights. The developers recommend building a squad of four with a good spread of character classes, relying on teamwork to successfully fight your way through the campaign’s seven chapters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more details on the campaign, you can read <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-launches-its-new-campaign-black-hawk-down">this article</a>. To celebrate its release, we got a chance to talk to studio head Leo Yao and game director Shadow Guo about the decision to reboot the classic campaign, why they’re not charging any money for it, and more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>First things first: Why did you want to reboot the classic Delta Force campaign? What excited you about this opportunity? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> Delta Force was a childhood favorite for me and many developers from Team Jade – the 2003 Delta Force game was just so iconic. We also love the 2001 movie so much, and both have been huge inspirations for us. The opportunity to revisit such a beloved story and bring it to today’s audience was something we couldn’t pass up. It wasn’t just about recreating the nostalgia, though; it was about expanding on it with love and respect. With today’s technology and tools, we felt like we could breathe new life into the experience while paying homage to the original. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Were there other options for setting or time period that you considered, or was the Mogadishu operation always the focus? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> It was love at first sight with the OG Black Hawk Down game for me, and our team has always been drawn to the Mogadishu operation. So we never seriously considered other options because we felt Black Hawk Down aligned perfectly with our vision for rebooting the Delta Force campaign. It’s a story that combines high-stakes drama, tactical depth, and a display of resilience, which are core to the Delta Force identity. It’s an iconic setting that not only respects the roots of the franchise but also provides a rich canvas for the gameplay experience we want to deliver to players. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Was there ever a time you considered not having a campaign at all? Why is it important to offer this to players? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> We were on the fence before Gamescom 2023, where we revealed the game to the world. During the event, we had the chance to meet a lot of players who shared their memories and hopes for the franchise. Their passion really moved us, and it became clear just how much a campaign meant to them. While we always wanted to include a campaign, their enthusiasm gave us the final push we needed to commit fully. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>It’s clear that a lot of time and effort went into creating this campaign. What made you decide to offer it for free? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> That is exactly why — we poured our hearts and souls into this campaign, and we want players to enjoy it without any barriers. It’s also about building goodwill with the community and showing our commitment to providing value and respect for their support. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> The campaign’s difficulty means it’s not for everyone, but we want to give the choice to players. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>With the campaign itself being free, will there be a battle pass or microtransactions?</strong> </h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> No, there won't be any battle pass or any microtransactions in the campaign. Our goal is to offer a free and accessible experience to all players. For those who would like to support the game further, we will offer a selection of optional campaign-related bundles that players can purchase and use in the game’s multiplayer mode. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Obviously, technology has developed considerably in the 22 years since the original game was released. What were you able to do now that wouldn’t have been possible back in 2003? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> It’s quite amazing to think that the OG Black Hawk Down is already 22 years old. One of the biggest improvements is in the graphics. We were able to create a living, dynamic Mogadishu with tons of details for players to explore and immerse into. We’ve also implemented a class system that adds more strategic depth to the game, giving players more freedom in how they approach missions. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You’ve recommended that players form a squad of four to complete the campaign in co-op. It’s playable solo, but very difficult. What went into that decision?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> From the very start of development, we knew we wanted to stay true to the spirit of both Black Hawk Down classics, where teamwork and camaraderie played a huge role. We didn’t want the game to feel like just another shooter where you go in guns blazing as a lone wolf. The campaign is designed around the idea of brotherhood and working together to overcome challenges just like how Delta Force was challenged in 1993. We strongly believe that the best experience is one where players coordinate as a team, supporting one another through difficult missions. Playing solo is certainly possible, but it’s much more challenging, and we wanted to encourage players to collaborate in co-op for a more rewarding experience. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Are there rewards that players can expect for completing the campaign? If so, what are they?</strong> </h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo</strong>: Yes, we wanted to make sure that players feel a real sense of accomplishment after completing the campaign, hence the difficulty. In addition to the fun and satisfaction of finishing challenging missions, there will be some cosmetic rewards available. These items can be used in multiplayer modes and reflect your performance and progress throughout the campaign. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How did you approach the chapter structure of the campaign, and how important was it that you diversify gameplay between those chapters? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow:</strong> Just like in the original Delta Force games, we wanted to create a campaign structure that feels dynamic and keeps players engaged throughout. We’ve designed a variety of mission types, each emphasizing different aspects of gameplay. Without spoiling too much — one mission may involve escorting vehicles, where you’ll need to protect and navigate through hostile areas while exploring maze-like indoor areas to identify and eliminate threats; another could be a last-man-standing-style defense scenario, where you have to hold a position against waves of enemies. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What goes into balancing the different character classes and how they interact with each other? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow</strong>: The class system in Delta Force is key to fostering teamwork and providing players with varied gameplay options. We wanted to create distinct roles for each class, making sure they complement each other during missions. For example, the Sniper class is perfect for long-range engagements, making use of sniper rifles and providing intel for the team. The Assault class is more frontline-oriented, excelling in close-quarter combat and heavy fire support. The Support class is essential for keeping the team alive with medical supplies and equipment. Each class has its strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important that players work together to cover each other’s gaps. The interaction between these roles is what makes teamwork so critical to success. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How important do you think narrative and storytelling are to a campaign mode in a shooter? How do you go about including that storytelling while still keeping the action intense and pace fast? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> Storytelling is essential to giving the player a deeper connection to the game and making the action feel more meaningful. The good news is that we already have a great story to work with. As for narration: We use a combination of cinematics and gameplay to tell the story. For cinematics, about 60% of the cinematics are faithful remakes from the original, while the remaining 40% introduce original scenes inspired by historical events. But we don’t just rely on cutscenes — we also use the gameplay itself as a way to tell the story. For example, as you progress through the missions, you’ll encounter challenges that showcase the weight of war. This allows us to keep the action fast-paced while still delivering an emotional and immersive story that resonates with players. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Are there any other things you’d like to say to players?</strong> </h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Leo:</strong> We’re really excited for players to try the game! This is our first attempt at a new Delta Force campaign, and we’ve put a lot of work into making it as engaging and fun as possible. We hope that you’ll enjoy the experience as much as we’ve enjoyed creating it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shadow</strong>: Absolutely! We’re really grateful for the support from the community and encourage players to share their thoughts with us. We’re always looking to improve, and your feedback will help us make the game better for everyone. We hope you enjoy the game, and we look forward to hearing what you think.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-flying-heroes-are-terrorizing-players-after-mid-season-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games rolled out its Season 1 mid-season update for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> last week, and with it has come a reign of terror from the hero shooter’s growing list of flying heroes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the popular competitive multiplayer game hopped in to check out the update after it went live Friday, February 21. It came with headlines such as new characters The Thing and Human Torch, alongside a new Central Park map, an army of balance tweaks, and more to keep fans of the Marvel spinoff game entertained while work on Season 2 continues. Players have found plenty to love so far, but for every change the community welcomes, there is one thing hogging all of the attention: the sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals matches for players of all skill levels have been plagued with flying heroes, specifically the likes of Iron Man, Storm, and Human Torch, since the update went live a few days ago. Characters previously seen as minor aerial annoyances have graduated into all-around menaces thanks to a few new key elements. The emergence of a legion of aerial hero experts is far from enough to break the experience, but it has seen players diverting their attention from objectives as they work to deal with this new trend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s one obvious culprit behind the community’s newfound fear of flying heroes: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-players-are-already-worried-human-torch-is-op-days-before-mid-season-update">Human Torch</a>. As with any major content drop, new heroes are going to attract attention from those looking to try out new content for themselves. Marvel Rivals’ mid-season update adds a whopping two new heroes into the mix, so it’s no surprise to see one of each on either team in both casual and competitive modes. In the case of Fantastic Four’s Johnny Storm, that means almost always having to worry about one friendly and one enemy Human Torch for every match. It's a lot on its own, but Marvel Rivals has more than just one hothead to worry about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week’s update also <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250213/41667_1211717.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>introduced buffs</u></a> to the already popular Iron Man and his Unibeam ability. These are nothing to scoff at, as NetEase moved to increase its damage from 120/s to 140/s, while also pumping up its Armor Overdrive damage by 10/s. Iron Man lives in the air regardless of map choice, and with buffs enticing players to hop into matches as Tony Stark more often, it’s leaving those on the ground with no choice but to counter-pick or start praying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Storm, meanwhile, was hit with several small nerfs to her kit but remains a secret weapon for players with the skill to effectively use her in battle. She’s been slowly crawling her way up Marvel Rivals’ Hero Hot List following balance tweaks earlier in Season 1, meaning players are still being pulled in by the X-Men hero’s weather-based abilities.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, your average 12v12 Marvel Rivals game could have all three of these heroes pop up on both teams, giving players six flying characters to watch out for. Toss in those with flying abilities like Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange as well as high mobility names like Spider-Man and matches can quickly become a nightmare for anyone unable to land their shots. It's making for an especially brutal time for melee heroes like Wolverine as they do their best to find opportunities to sneak in a few swings. Those who favor Marvel Rivals' Strategist support role are running into their own issues as they aim at their teammates in need of healing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As NetEase continues to roll out more updates and playable heroes from across Marvel canon, the balance between the land and sky will surely shift. Still, players are looking for new strategies to combat their fear of flying characters, including picking hit-scan heroes like Punisher and Hela. Another thing keeping fans grounded during these trying times are copious amounts of memes about their struggles.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A team of melee heroes fighting off a horde of flying heroes <a href="https://t.co/X9xo8rIhjy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/X9xo8rIhjy</a></p>— Lucas Evan Fryman (@LucasFryman) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucasFryman/status/1893178482374406245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/qe8QvwoeXC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qe8QvwoeXC</a></p>— MarvelPlays (@PlaysMarvel) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaysMarvel/status/1893105609915990060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is no one talking abt how hard it is as a support to heal them😭 esp with sue… maybe we buff her range soon😭🙏</p>— Su 🤍 🇹🇷 (@marieannfred1) <a href="https://twitter.com/marieannfred1/status/1893110722394988922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched in December and instantely became <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days">a huge hit</a> for Marvel and NetEase.
