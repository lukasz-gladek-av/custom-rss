 <blockquote><p><span>Please don’t post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We really want everyone to enjoy the game’s story and experience as much as possible.

<p>Game Freak brings Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green into 2026 to show generations what they missed out on two decades ago. In the middle of the reveal, some confusion arose concerning Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green’s platforms, such as the Nintendo Switch, and where to play them.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> community went into a frenzy when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green</a> were finally announced after the rumors. If you are one of those many Poké Maniacs, check out how to actually play either remake!</p>

<p><strong>The first thing the reveal trailer made clear is that you can play both Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on the original Nintendo Switch console.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>It’s easy to see why there’s been a question mark over the games’ platforms. The first trailer had an interesting iron-clad fact: You can play both games “on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> system.”</p>



<p>The video also shows a Game Boy Advance, but doesn’t show or mention the Switch 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>You can also play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on the Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>We can’t honestly fathom the reasoning behind not advertising the Switch 2. Either Nintendo assumed people would know, or it was another reason entirely.</p>



<p>Either way, if you check the game’s eShop listing, it says this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pokémon FireRed Version&nbsp;is a remake of&nbsp;Pokémon Red Version, one of the first two titles in the Pokémon video game series. This Game Boy Advance game was originally released in 2004. Now you can enjoy this classic Pokémon adventure on Nintendo Switch and&nbsp;<strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So stop panicking and make sure you’ve got some space clear on your Nintendo Switch 2 to ensure you can begin a journey to be the very best—you know the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-on-playstation-xbox-or-pc">Can You Play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green On PlayStation, Xbox, or PC?</h2>



<p><strong>As you might have guessed, you can’t play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on a PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, Capcom has teamed up with a company known for its shopping channel-style infomercials, to release a bizarre and extremely limited edition of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> that includes exercise equipment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Limited to only 50 sets and priced at 19,800yen ($127), the Terrifying Nightmare Set made in collaboration with e-commerce/talent management Yume Group sold out completely in less than 5 hours, as fans reached for their credit cards faster than they ever ran from Mr. X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem's Terrifying Nightmare Set includes a copy of Resident Evil Requiem on either PS5 or Switch 2 and a full-sized pull-up bar for exercising. Yes, you read it right. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— バイオハザード(カプコン)公式 (@BIO_OFFICIAL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/2024620585528283618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, Yume Group (Dream Group) is known for its catchphrase "make it cheaper!" and for selling all sorts of shopping channel-style products via their website and through commercials. Naturally, the Resident Evil Requiem Terrifying Nightmare Set has its own tongue-in-cheek commercial — which you can watch above — in which Yume Group president Shigehiro Ishida and affiliated singer Yuri Hoshina promote the game in their signature style, with Ishida introducing the selling points and Hoshina exclaiming enthusiastically in response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brilliantly, the commercial even features Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi, who makes a rather deadpan cameo wearing industrial workwear and an unconvincing wig. Nakanishi mentions Requiem’s dual protagonists Grace and Leon, and the game’s mix of horror and action, while these keywords flash boldly on screen.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what's with the pull-up bar? The idea here is apparently so that gamers can use this piece of freestanding exercise equipment — dubbed the "Dream Hanging Health Device" — to release tension after fighting off zombies and getting perplexed by puzzles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you’re tired from gaming, hang on tight. It'll loosen up your back and shoulders stiff from fright!" advises the product's <a href="https://yumeg.com/view/item/000000011379?cptokusetsu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>store page</u></a>. The accompanying tongue-in-cheek infomercial advertises the pull-up bar while showing shots of a terrified Grace Ashcroft hanging upside down from the game's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POz1-EmLsTY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reveal trailer</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other moments from the commercial include Hoshina cheerfully exclaiming that the game is "easy for even beginners to start playing," while the 'You are Dead' game over screen plays in the background, and an apparent claim that the exercise equipment is also good for drying laundry on a rainy day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When official Resident Evil accounts in Japan suddenly started posting a Yume Group infomercial on the morning of February 20th, some users thought it was simply a parody. "I started watching it with a smirk, laughing at the image of Grace hanging upside down on the device but then went dead serious when the detailed purchase rules and phone number came up 'Huh? They’re actually selling this?!'" a user <a href="https://x.com/yamaken183/status/2024622925635342696?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> in Japanese on X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, just five hours later the Terrifying Nightmare Set was sold out. Perhaps some Resident Evil fans aspire to get chainsaw-wielding worthy biceps like Leon S. Kennedy’s, whose <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leon-kennedys-new-look-for-resident-evil-requiem-makes-him-a-hot-uncle-heartthrob-among-japanese-fans"><u>new look has won him a bit of a fan following</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Leon and unexpected Resident Evil special editions, who can forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/11/1240-resident-evil-6-platinum-edition">Resident Evil 6’s Leather Jacket Edition which came with a replica of Leon’s coat</a> and retailed for 109,000 yen ($1,300) back in 2012?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West. She has also written about Japanese culture and movies for various publications.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-has-a-bizarre-ultra-limited-edition-with-exercise-equipment-in-japan-and-it-sold-out-almost-instantly]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1442011</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>This piece originally appeared 2/12/26 at </em><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/rest-in-peace-bayonetta/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Mothership</em></a>, <em>a worker-owned outlet providing gaming coverage for her, for them, and yes, for him. If you like what you see, consider </em><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/?ref=aftermath.site#/portal" rel="noreferrer"><em>subscribing</em></a><em>!</em></p><p>I've spent the four years since&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s release wanting to write more about it<em>.</em>&nbsp;A big reason why I haven’t is that a lot of people hurt my feelings way back when I reviewed it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23421409/bayonetta-3-review-platinumgames-nintendo-switch/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>upon release in 2022</u></a>. I was still on Twitter back then, and despite that I’ve been harassed online many times for writing about video games, I was shocked by the amount of homophobic slurs I received in response to my review. That experience was deeply upsetting. What was also surprising, and a lot more interesting to talk about, was the response to the game from queer and women writers, who, like me, had a lot to say about the game’s themes and writing decisions. I couldn’t spoil the game in my review, nor could other critics, so I never fully expounded on why the game’s story fell flat for me and so many others. The time has come.</p><p>By the time&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;came out, the title heroine had very much&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23417059/bayonetta-3-lgbtq-gay-queer-icon-fandom/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>become a queer icon</u></a>. This was the lens through which a lot of queer fans fans saw the character. It’s easy to see why if you look at her character design. She has heavily exaggerated feminine features — extraordinarily long hair, for example, and a Barbie doll body with mega-long legs. If you create a character, any character, with extremely exaggerated feminine features (like Bayonetta, or Lara Croft) — or exaggerated masculine features (like Duke Nukem) — it’s likely that character is going to be claimed by the queer community. Thus, Bayonetta is both a sex symbol for straight men, and a drag icon. This is also why Duke Nukem can be both a hyper-masculine ideal for straight men as well as a drag king.</p><p>This creates a complicated dynamic in the world of video games, where so many characters are exaggerated in this fashion. (The same thing happens with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/04/16/303652716/drag-is-raw-wrestlers-queens-and-gender-as-performance-art?ref=mothership.blog"><u>pro wrestling</u></a>, by the way.) Straight male fans often do not understand this dynamic, if they see it at all. The ones who are bigoted get scared when queer fans claim characters in this way, because it forces them to confront their own insecurities about sexuality and identity. A person who is afraid of confronting any of that is probably also very freaked out at the idea that there’s anything queer about Bayonetta, whom they see as a sexy lady meant for straight men only. Hence the response to my review of&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But Bayonetta wasn’t just a queer icon; many queer fans saw her as actually queer, in a romantic relationship with her fellow witch Jeanne. This was never actually confirmed in any game, but hopeful fans would cite examples like&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>series creator Hideki Kamiya posting a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/707200257403146240?s=20&amp;ref=mothership.blog"><u>poll on Twitter in 2016 asking fans to vote on the “best couple,”</u></a>&nbsp;while listing Bayonetta and Jeanne as one of the options (they won).</p><p>It would have been cool if Bayonetta and Jeanne had ever been confirmed as a couple, even if it was something as small as “they kissed one time years ago,” but I need to be clear that I never actually expected&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;to do something like that. I’m a jaded millennial; I’ve lived through too many queerbaiting scandals to count. Furthermore, this is a big-budget game that was released globally, including in countries with very&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mothership.blog/queer-nigerian-gamers-playing-online-hidden-avatars/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>strict laws about queer expression</u></a>. The best case scenario was that&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;would continue to leave the entire question unresolved, with Bayonetta remaining the perpetually single, unattainable queen who steps on her admirers’ fingers with her gun-adorned high heels.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;actually did end up surprising me — with how straight it is, especially when compared to previous entries. I’m not even talking about the relationships in the game; I’m talking about the heteronormative themes on display. This is a game that ends by referring to Bayonetta and her male love interest as very literally being Adam and Eve. It doesn’t get straighter than that, nor does it get more toxic when it comes to patriarchal gender norms. These norms actually date back to that ancient Biblical story, which has been used as a tool to oppress women for centuries. It’s surprising that a series like&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>, whose previous entrants subverted Christian allegory by depicting damned characters as heroes, does away with that in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;by presenting Adam and Eve as an idealized love story. The Biblical story of Adam and Eve frames women as inherently sinful betrayers, and associating Bayonetta with the Eve archetype is a depressing rebuke of her character up to this point.</p><p>[<strong>Editor's note</strong>: Spoilers for&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;follow after this point.]<a href="https://www.mothership.blog/content/images/2026/02/image.png?ref=aftermath.site"></a></p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>, like previous entries in the series, introduces a lot of metaphysical lore. Here’s a brief rundown: Bayonetta is a witch who exists in a world where heaven, hell, and purgatory are very real physical locations with their own leaders, alliances, and long-held grievances. Sort of like in the world of the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>games, the characters who hail from heaven aren’t necessarily “good guys,” especially because our heroine is a witch. Bayonetta is facing an eventual fate of eternal damnation, but if anything, that’s presented as a point of pride for her and her similarly damned friends. (It’s no wonder that queer fans related to that; all of us are supposedly damned, too.)</p><p>It wouldn’t be entirely accurate to describe Bayonetta as a fully realized character. She’s more of a larger-than-life persona who speaks in one-liners and can do more backflips than any Olympic athlete. This is part of why it’s hard to imagine her actually being in a couple with somebody, even Jeanne (although at least Jeanne is also a larger-than-life witch who has similar qualities). This is also why&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;is so confusing for me, because it ends up throwing her together with a secondary character named Luka — a human man, introduced in the first game as a journalist who mistakenly thinks Bayonetta killed his father and is investigating her. He realizes Bayonetta is innocent of that crime, and then Luka falls into the position that almost anyone would be in with Bayonetta: he worships her and lusts after her. In the first two games, Luka is presented as comic relief — or at least, that’s how I perceived it, because he hardly shows up other than those comedic moments of him begging at Bayonetta’s feet.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;introduces the concept of the multiverse (it was 2022, this was an unavoidable trope for some reason) and a character named Viola, who turns out to be the daughter of Bayonetta and Luka from another universe. This always could have made sense; it’s not unbelievable to imagine that, in some other world, Bayonetta and Luka might have had far more chemistry with one another than they do in the universe players know them from. Unfortunately, though, that’s not how&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;presents their love story. Instead, after introducing the multiverse and allowing Bayonetta to meet other versions of herself in these many other worlds, the player soon learns that apparently Bayonetta and Luka are destined to be together in every single one of these worlds. This is a strange status to thrust onto Luka, as he didn’t really seem to be Bayonetta’s one true love in any previous game, nor even in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;could have done the work to introduce Luka in this fashion. That would have helped. Instead, the game’s writing does a massive disservice to Luka — one that I’m shocked more fans didn’t see as outright offensive. In this game and this game only, Luka gets cursed to transform into a magical werewolf, and he spends most of the game in wolf form. Bayonetta and their daughter Viola don’t recognize him in this form; for the majority of the game, he is very literally trying to kill Bayonetta and his own daughter, unable to control his werewolf strength. Eventually, it’s revealed that this werewolf creature is Luka, and he admits to Bayonetta and Viola that he can’t control the transformations and can’t help his extreme violence towards them. This is a classic gender stereotype that casts men as violent predators unable to control their impulses; wolf imagery in particular is so overused as to be a cliché. (Take, for example, the moment in the&nbsp;<em>Twilight&nbsp;</em>book&nbsp;<em>Eclipse&nbsp;</em>when Jacob the werewolf&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goalcast.com/twilight-toxic-edward-jacob/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>forces a kiss on Bella</u></a>, who can’t fight him off due to his wolf-like strength.)</p><p>It’s shocking to me that Luka’s confession of violent impulses is part of the couple's romantic arc, and that Bayonetta ends up in turn professing her true love for Luka. To say this is a harmful representation of romance would be an understatement. All of this is leading up to the climax of the game, in which the explanation for Bayonetta and Luka falling in love in every timeline is that they are metaphysical representations of Adam and Eve. This ancient religious story is one that famously frames Eve as the sinner who dooms humanity, a framework that makes Luka seem like the good guy and Bayonetta the temptress he can’t resist. By juxtaposing this with the storyline of Luka as a wolf-like animal who can’t resist attacking her (and his daughter), this message is not just subtextual: men cannot resist their baser instincts, and women are at fault for tempting them into this… and yet women must love and forgive men for these animalistic urges, somehow.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The worst part, though, is the game’s treatment of Jeanne. She’s relegated to a series of side missions that are notably simplistic compared to the rest of the game, and she ends up getting killed in a scene that doesn’t even involve Bayonetta. She’s killed so unceremoniously that it’s hard to interpret her death as anything other than a quiet fuck-you to the fans who thought her relationship to Bayonetta might have been something more — especially given that for the entirety of the game, the once-strong and resilient Bayonetta is swooning over a werewolf man who keeps trying to kill her and her teenage daughter.</p><p>Viola, meanwhile, gets short shrift as a character as well. She’s supposed to be introduced as a new witch in training, but her combat design is so different from Bayonetta’s that playing as her is quite difficult. I ended up liking her combat design, but I had to really put in the work to learn how to use her moves, and by making her so different, the designers all but guaranteed that players would resent her. It doesn’t help that she’s a teenage girl who talks a lot, which is a character archetype that often gets maligned as annoying, even when that’s not true. I actually like Viola, but&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3&nbsp;</em>does not make it easy. Allowing her fighting style to be more similar to her mother would have gone a long way towards helping players see her value as a new character.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;ultimately ends with both Bayonetta and Luka dying in one another’s arms and descending into hell together, as Viola promises to take on the new mantle of Bayonetta. It feels like the ultimate punishment not just to those queer fans but to all&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>&nbsp;fans: kill off the main character and leave behind a character so different from the protagonist. It’s also a bizarre message from a feminist perspective to suggest that, by becoming a wife and mother, Bayonetta needs to figuratively lay down her sword and retire. Why can’t she keep on fighting alongside her daughter? Why, exactly, did she and Luka have to die?</p><figure></figure><figure><figcaption><p><span>Images: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t expect Bayonetta (or Luka, or Jeanne) to stay in hell forever; this series takes place in a metaphysical world, after all, where escaping from a place like hell is actually viable. I think it’s pretty likely that Viola will go on a quest to save her family from their fate in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;(a game that was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-teases-bayonetta-4-already-in-the-works?ref=mothership.blog"><u>already in the works</u></a>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;came out). But now that I know Luka and Bayonetta are apparently destined to be together forever, despite how toxic their relationship seems to me, it’s a lot less exciting to see how the rest of that story would play out.</p><p>Apparently, for series creator Hideki Kamiya, this was always how the story was going to go, and I just missed the signs. Kamiya described the backlash to&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;as "<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kamiya-says-perplexing-fan-response-to-bayonetta-3-impacted-how-he-is-approaching-his-okami-sequel/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>a perplexing experience</u></a>," although I’m just as perplexed that he and the rest of the writers thought fans would be OK with seeing Bayonetta die and Viola suddenly get thrust into the spotlight. The series is called&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>, after all.</p><p>No matter what, though,&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;is going to be a very different game, because&nbsp;<a href="https://nintendowire.com/news/2025/02/05/several-directors-confirmed-to-have-left-platinumgames-in-video-shared-by-hideki-kamiya/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>Kamiya and many other designers quit PlatinumGames</u></a>&nbsp;last year. Kamiya founded a new studio, Clovers Inc., with several of those folks; they’re working on the new&nbsp;<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>game. If there is a&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>, it will be the first game to happen without Kamiya at the head of it.</p><p>As a huge fan of the first two&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>games, it’s hard to feel hopeful for what comes next, even if a completely different creative team is in charge. I don’t see a great way to retcon the Adam-and-Eve framework for Luka and Bayonetta, and it’s something that’s hard for me to get past. Although I’ve always seen Bayonetta as more of an untouchable and unattainable single lady, if she were to end up with a love interest (of any gender), I would have much preferred to see a healthier relationship dynamic than the one that&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;presents. (When it comes to the male characters, I'd say she has a lot more chemistry with weapons dealer Rodin than she ever did with Luka.)</p><p>There were much better ways to write the story of&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;— I’m partial to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bayonetta/comments/yjf2hj/my_try_at_playing_bayonetta_3_script_doctor/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>this rewrite done by Reddit user CourierEight</u></a>, as an example — but instead, we’re stuck with the one we got. All I can say is, I wish good luck to anybody trying to clean up that mess and make&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;a decent story for a heroine who always deserved better and still does.</p><div data-layout="immersive">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Retail tracking firm Circana shared the top five most-played PlayStation games in the U.S. in 2026. The list is the same as it was last year, with <em>Fortnite</em> at the top. And looking back at 2023 and 2022, you’ll notice that the most popular titles haven’t changed much at all since then, either. That’s bad news for developers trying to release new multiplayer games, and for fans hoping for more innovation.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfb74qkg3s2p">Circana senior director Mat Piscatella shared</a> the top PlayStation games ranked by total U.S. players. <em>Fortnite</em> topping the list doesn’t tell the whole story. In actuality, 56 percent of all active PS5 players hopped into Epic’s battle royale shooter at least once during the year. Yeah, more than half of the people who own a PS5 have played or are still playing <em>Fortnite</em>. And more wild than that is the fact that 2025’s version of this list matches up perfectly with 2024’s.</p>

 <p><strong>2025 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Roblox</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p><strong>2024 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Roblox</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p>I pinged Piscatella for the 2023 and 2022 lists of most-played PlayStation games, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcfpfc77s2k">he quickly replied</a>. You’ll notice that almost all of the games on this list, with the exception of <em>Apex Legends</em> in 2022, are the same games seen on the most recent list. (<em>Call of Duty</em> is an odd duck as its launcher on console and PC contains <em>Warzone</em> and other past entries.)</p> <p><strong>2023 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty HQ</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p><strong>2022 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Fortnite </em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em></li> <li><em>Apex Legends</em></li> </ol> <p>In a follow-up post, Piscatella explained that only two new games broke through to make the extended list of the 10 most-played games in 2025: <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and <em>Skate.&nbsp;</em>One of those was the best-selling game for the whole year. The other is free-to-play.</p>

 <p>“The behemoths are locked in and have black hole levels of gravity,” wrote Piscatella. “Competing with these games is critical. Competing with these games is beyond challenging, even for platform holders.”</p> <p>In 2026, we’ve already seen one high-profile multiplayer game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em>,</a> struggle to break through and find an audience. <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474">This data (and past data)</a> shows that a big part of the problem is that a large chunk of the video game audience just isn’t budging from the games they already like. And in the case of <em>Fortnite, Roblox, and Warzone,</em> players don’t even have to spend a single penny to enjoy these games if they don’t want to.</p>

 <p>Why would the average person plunk down $70 or more on a new game when all of their friends are playing one of these five games that they already own or that are free to play? So far, the gaming industry is struggling to produce a compelling answer to that question.</p>

              <p>Will The Pokémon Company ever get a handle on insatiable demand for new cards? We’re almost certainly getting <em>Nioh 4</em> now. And Ubisoft just can’t catch a break. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. It’s back after a brief two-day hiatus. It’s been a busy week! We’re still <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xeecee.bsky.social/post/3mfb5tqvm7k2e">trying to find Tuvok’s lungs</a>.</p> <p>We used to have honest-to-god commercials in this country. Including live-action ones for video games. Which company will be brave enough <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sharkabytes.bsky.social/post/3mf6alilycc2c">to bring them back</a>?</p> <h2>Ubisoft studio evacuated over potential bomb threat</h2> <p>500 staff at Ubisoft’s Montpellier had to leave the office on February 19 after a bomb threat was sent to the local police station, <a href="https://www.midilibre.fr/2026/02/19/alerte-a-la-bombe-a-ubisoft-montpellier-pres-de-800-salaries-du-secteur-evacues-par-mesure-de-precaution-13234922.php"><em>Midi Libre</em> reports</a>. The email claimed there was an explosive device at the studio where developers have been working on<a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><em> Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> and a <a href="https://kotaku.com/rayman-legends-remake-ubisoft-prince-persia-lost-crown-1851679621">new <em>Rayman</em> game</a>. Dozens of police responded, created a perimeter around the building, and searched for anything suspicious-looking but ultimately couldn’t find anything. Was it just a random hoax or an unfortunate “prank” by a disgruntled employee or gamer?</p>

 <p>“After investigation, authorities have confirmed there is no credible threat to our Montpellier studio,” a spokesperson for the company told Kotaku in an emailed statement. “As a precaution, we evacuated the building and worked with local authorities in accordance with our safety protocols. All employees are safe, and operations are resuming.”</p> <p>Ubisoft has been dealing with <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-strike-assassins-creed-delay-cancel-rto-layoffs-2000667820">frustrations from staff</a> over the company’s ongoing cuts and a new return-to-office policy as well as perennially being the target of unhinged rants by some people online, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587">including individual shareholders</a>, over culture war grievances.</p>

 <h2>Pokémon buys a new U.S. card distributor</h2> <p>“This reflects our long-term commitment to supporting the Pokémon community and the broader trading card ecosystem,” Pokémon Company president Kenji Okubo said in a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/The-Pokemon-Company-International-to-Acquire-Excell-Brands">press release this week</a>. “Excell Brands has built a strong reputation as a trusted distributor and category management partner for their customers with deep insight into the needs of Pokémon fans.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that mean I’ll finally be able to buy booster packs without having to stake out restock days?</p>

 <h2><em>Bioshock 4</em> and the <em>Bioshock </em>movie are in a staring contest to see who can take the longest to come out</h2> <p>Director Francis Lawrence is attached to the cinematic adaptation of <em>Bioshock</em>, but work on other projects has kept him from getting to it. “We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being <em>The Long Walk</em> and the other being the <em>Hunger Games</em> prequel, which comes out this December,” producer Roy Lee <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">told <em>Collider</em></a>. “We’re just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he’s going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it. I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.”</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> is great and it’s selling very well</h2> <p>The latest sequel is already the fastest-selling entry in the masocore action-RPG series, hitting over 1 million copies sold in its first month. The franchise as a whole is now at 10 million, Koei Tecmo <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/us/news/20260220.html">announced this week</a>.</p>

 <h2>The biggest fighting game tournament is now fully owned by Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>NODWIN Gaming <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2026-business-update">has exited its co-ownership stake in Evo,</a> leaving&nbsp;<span lang="EN">Qiddiya</span> City-owned RTS, which is ultimately a subsidiary controlled by Saudi Arabia, in full control.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/finji-tiktok-racist-genai-ads-usual-june-report-support-2000672007</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Finji, the company responsible for publishing games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-the-kotaku-review-1792726026"><i><span>Night in the Woods</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tunic-xbox-game-pass-zelda-dark-souls-fez-indie-impress-1848668747"><i><span>Tunic</span></i></a><span>, and the upcoming </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, has been locked in a bizarre battle against TikTok, which the company says has been creating and posting AI-generated ads using its characters without its permission.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tunic-night-in-the-woods-publisher-says-tiktok-is-creating-and-running-racist-genai-ads-for-its-games-without-permission"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> has an extensive report on the situation, which started gaining attention earlier this month when Finji CEO and co-founder Rebekah Saltsman posted on </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bexsaltsman.bsky.social/post/3me4ybayhf226"><span>Bluesky</span></a><span> asking anyone who saw Finji ads on social media that that were “UN-Finji-like” to reach out with screenshots of the offending ads. As </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s story lays out, Finji had been using TikTok to promote its games, including the upcoming paranormal adventure game </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, and had turned off all the app’s supposedly optional genAI permissions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>However, after a flood of social media comments from concerned viewers, the company was clued into what appear to be AI-generated ads on TikTok that look as if they came directly from Finji. According to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> which viewed screenshots of the ads in question, one included an altered image of June, the protagonist of </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, “with a bikini bottom, impossibly large hips and thighs, and boots that rise up over her knees,” which is a far cry from the character’s actual appearance and, given that she is a Black woman, plays into racist stereotypes. Finji says it had no option to view or edit these AI ads.</span></p> <p><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s story documents the back and forth between Finji and TikTok, but the gist of what happened here is that the short form video app’s customer support has given the company the runaround, at one point even claiming it saw no indication of AI-generated assets in the offending ads and asserting that Finji must have uploaded the image of June itself.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After Finji escalated the issue, TikTok backed down and said that it was no longer disputing the publisher’s claim that it was making unauthorized alterations to Finji’s ads with the use of AI. Instead, TikTok said the company’s campaign had included an ad that used a “catalog ads format designed to demonstrate the performance benefits of combining carousel and video assets in Sales campaigns,” for which an opt-out was not guaranteed. The response in no way addressed Finji’s larger concerns about the racist and sexualized changes made to the company’s imagery. When Finji pushed to escalate the issue, TikTok said it would “re-escalate the issue internally,” but Finji has not heard back from the company since. TikTok declined to comment on the record when </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>reached out.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This is just simply embarrassing but not for me as an individual,” Saltsman told </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>. “For me—I am just super pissed off. This is my work, my team’s work and mine and my company’s reputation—which I have spent over a decade building. My expectation was a proper apology, systemic changes in how they use this technology for paying clients and a hard look at why their technology is so obviously racist and sexist. I am obviously not holding my breath for any of the above.”</span></p> <p><span>What a shitshow. But given that genAI evangelists are </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/microsoft-ceo-warns-that-we-must-do-something-useful-with-ai-or-theyll-lose-social-permission-to-burn-electricity-on-it/"><span>scrambling to invent an actual use case for the technology</span></a><span> to stop the slop accusations, it’s not too surprising that companies are shoving it into places without permission. It’s not like any company worth a damn is going to use this tech to “enhance” its ads when they’d rather those ads reflect what they’re actually selling.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>While the multiplayer Switch Online Game Boy Advance games all support wireless multiplayer in place of physical Game Link Cables, it’s particularly important for these games because they were the first&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> titles to support any kind of wireless multiplayer, even before the Nintendo DS made built-in Wi-Fi connectivity a standard console feature.</p>
<p><em>FireRed</em> and&nbsp;<em>LeafGreen</em> were two of just a few dozen GBA games to support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Wireless_Adapter">Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter</a>, a bulky, standalone accessory that latched to the top of the system and plugged in to its Link Cable port. The initial releases of the games actually included the wireless adapter as a pack-in accessory, which had to be supported by the game you were playing and couldn’t just work as a stand-in for a physical Link Cable in older games.</p>
<p>With the wireless adapter plugged in, up to 30 players could congregate in the game’s “Union Room” to do battles and trades—but given that Nintendo also recommended players stand within 10 feet of each other for the best experience, a 30-person Union Room would have gotten pretty crowded in real life.</p>
<p><em>FireRed&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>LeafGreen</em> are adaptations of the original 1996&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> games for the old black-and-white Game Boy. The names reference the original Japanese releases,&nbsp;<em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em>. A third version of the game with updated graphics and other changes, called&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Blue</em>, was released in Japan in late 1996, and this was the version that was localized and released in the US as&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Blue</em> in 1998.</p>
<p>A final version of the base game,&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Yellow</em>, was released in Japan in 1998 and in the US in 1999, with some changes that tracked the plotline of the <em>Pokémon </em>anime (most prominently, mandating that players select an un-evolve-able Pikachu as their starter Pokémon). Most of the changes specific to this version of the game weren’t included in the <em>FireRed</em> and&nbsp;<em>LeafGreen</em> remakes.</p>

Midsummer Studios announced their existence in May 2024 with a promise to “revitalise the life sim genre”, but now, they’re closing down. Co-founder and former XCOM developer Jake Solomon confirmed the news on social media this week, saying goodbye with some brief pre-alpha footage of Burbank - a build-your-own-TV-series project with a lot of generative AI in it.
</p>
<p>
“We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both,” Solomon writes. “Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-xcom-and-civilization-devs-team-up-to-launch-a-next-gen-lifesim-inspired-by-stephen-king-and-gilmore-girls">Everything I knew</a> up to this point about Midsummer’s activities came from Katharine Castle’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">write-up for Eurogamer in May 2024</a>. Back then, the studio’s debut project was billed as a small town life sim with inspirations ranging from Stephen King to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gilmore-girls">Gilmore Girls</a>. You’d have been able to create a character and choose a story theme, like seducing the local hottie. The town itself was billed as an endlessly evolving simulation, with new scenarios arising over time.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure whether they’re the same game, but Burbank appears to have sprung from similar narrative sandbox ambitions.  In his social media post, Solomon describes Burbank as “’Life Sims + The Truman Show’, but it’s more than that”.
</p>
<p>
“I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up,” he continues in that post. “Burbank let's you do that [sic]. We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special. What you're about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s an embed of Solomon's post with the Burbank clip. Apologies, Xitter haters - I can't find it on another platform.
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both.

</span></p><p>
As you can probably tell from the Wonkaverse voice-acting, the game’s characters were to “use AI for memory, reasoning and speech”, though Solomon doesn’t explain what form of generative AI or machine learning the game would have called upon. “That’s what let's you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write,” he goes on. “But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI.” 
</p><p>
Except for the writers and performers you presumably didn’t hire to create stories and dialogue, I guess? I’d like Solomon to go into more depth here. I’d also like to hear more about why exactly Midsummer are going under, and whether Burbank will live on in some guise, as Solomon's present-tense framing sort of suggests it might.</p>
<p>The studio launched with $6 million in funding raised by Krafton, TV and film company Day Zero Productions, and a brace of venture capitalist firms - Transcend Fund, Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, and F4 Fund. $6 million is a lot of money to me, but I am not a Money Scientist, and I don’t understand the workings of venture capital beyond a general sense that VCs are leopard seals in humanskin suits.</p>
<p>As of writing, Midsummer have 12 members of staff listed on LinkedIn, including Solomon himself. Best of luck to all affected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Day is right around the corner, and a flood of news is expected to mark the 30th anniversary of the franchise, so there’s a long line of things on our wishlist.</p>



<p>Taking place on February 27, 30 years since the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Red and Green in Japan, a special Pokémon Day Presents showcase is being aired. While the precise contents are unknown, there’s plenty that could be on the agenda.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has curated a wishlist of the biggest things we want to see announced on Pokémon Day, which you can see below.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-things-we-want-to-see-at-pokemon-day-2026">7 Things We Want to See at Pokémon Day 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-gen-10-teaser">Gen 10 Teaser</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Successor. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Undoubtedly, the biggest drop that could be revealed on Pokémon Day is the full reveal, or first teaser, for the 10th generation of the franchise.</p>



<p>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were initially released in November 2022, so it’s already been longer than the standard three-year cycle between Pokémon generations. As such, there is a huge expectation that Gen 10 will be officially teased or revealed during Pokémon Day.</p>



<p>Even a short teaser would set the internet alight, and a likely release window of Fall 2026 means there’s still ample time for a detailed reveal later this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-dlc">Pokopia DLC</h3>



<p>Pokopia is the newest game released by Pokémon, landing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/" id="177262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, and there’s plenty to be excited about as the franchise delves into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-simulation</a> genre for the first time.</p>



<p>There has already been a host of reveals for Pokopia, but the game is surely set to appear in the presentation in some capacity. It could well be just more details of what to expect, but there could be a reveal of DLC or a post-launch update.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia Hands-On Preview</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Pokopia has the potential to launch an entirely new series of games for Pokémon, so there is plenty that could shine.</p>



<h3 id="h-johto-love">Johto Love</h3>



<p>Last year marked the 25th anniversary of Pokémon Gold and Silver, but the anniversary was largely overlooked, apart from Chikorita and Totodile being starter choices in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>



<p>A relaunch of Heart Gold and Soul Silver would be the dream, but is unlikely to follow on from the Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green announcements; there are other options, however. For the past few years, persistent speculation has surrounded a potential sequel to Pokémon Let’s Go.</p>



<p>Whether it’s a new game or a big feature in an existing game, Johto deserves some love and shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>



<h3 id="h-black-white-remake">Black/White Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Return? Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Pokémon remake schedule was hit hard by the disappointment of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, but remakes haven’t been wiped from the schedule entirely.</p>



<p>Gen 5 is the next in line for a remake, and there is a chance that a teaser for remakes of Black and White appear. Though it would be a surprise to see the titles squeezed in before Gen 10 releases, it’s not entirely out of the question.</p>



<p>Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl were released in November 2021, just two months before the drop of Pokémon Legends: Arceus and a year before Scarlet and Violet, so there’s certainly room in the schedule.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-spin-off-game">New Spin-Off Game</h3>



<p>Pokémon already has one spin-off title on the schedule with Pokopia, but there could be more to appear before Gen 10, and there are some options.</p>



<p>Pokémon Champions’ release date announcement is surely inevitable, with the World Championships in August being competed on the title, but there could be something else. Over the years, the likes of Pokémon Snap have appeared, and there’s a long line of fan favourites that could be revived.</p>

</ul>



<p>It might be too early for a new Mystery Dungeon title, but I’m not giving up hope just yet.</p>



<h3 id="h-30th-anniversary-tcg-set">30th Anniversary TCG Set</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Big reveals. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 30th anniversary TCG set is a certainty this year and the first reveal should take place on Pokémon Day. As usual, expect it to be released in Japan first, before then seeing an international year.</p>



<p>The Japanese TCG schedule is now set until June, with Abyss Eye in May and Storm Emeralda in July, which leaves the perfect spot for an anniversary release. Trademarks for Celebration Collection have already been uncovered, and a full reveal on Pokémon Day makes too much sense.</p>



<h3 id="h-netflix-live-action-news">Netflix Live Action News</h3>



<p>A live-action Netflix series has been reported for years, first emerging in 2021, and it’s surely time for the first teaser or official confirmation to be shown.</p>



<p>Pokémon has expanded much deeper into TV series in recent years, with the likes of Pokémon Concierge released, and the live-action series would be an instant hint for fans. Partnering with Netflix is also a smart move, opening the doors to an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>There are murmurs of a Detective Pikachu sequel, which would be great, but a live-action Netflix series would certainly be better.</p>

<p>Pokémon collecting will never die from now until forever, whether it’s cards, games, movies, or novelty Gengar slippers. Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green are coming back, but there are questions over physical copies and how much these modern-day remakes will cost.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green</a> are re-releasing in 2026, and it’s a good year to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> fan—to be fair, it normally is. </p>



<p>If you’re already wishlisting either game, you need to know if they’re digital-only and how many Nuggets you need to sell to buy them.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At launch, the 2026 Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green games will be available online-only as a Nintendo eShop digital purchase.</strong></p>



<p>You can’t have it all, sadly. If you love collecting Pokémon games, then (for now at least) Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green will need to be in your intangible collection, as neither <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> nor The Pokémon Company has revealed a physical edition.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>They were both on Game Boy Advance cartridges when they came out in 2004—we feel your pain if you’re a 90s kid. This time around, the purchase is tied to a digital download with no physical media.</p>



<p>The official Pokémon site had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These classic remakes of&nbsp;Pokémon Red&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pokémon Green&nbsp;will be available to download from&nbsp;Nintendo eShop&nbsp;after the conclusion of the Pokémon Presents.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo is exceptional when it comes to business, which is why you shouldn’t rule out a physical edition. Many publishers opt to go digital first and then release a physical copy later on. That could easily be the case for Pokémon Fire Red or Pokémon Leaf Green, and there might come a time when you can catch ’em all AND a case!</p>



<p>As always, Insider Gaming will update you if this proves to be the…case.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-pokemon-fire-red-amp-pokemon-leaf-green-cost">How Much Does Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Pokémon Leaf Green cost $19.99 or £16.99 each, and there’s currently no bundle to buy them together, or promotion to reduce the price.</strong></p>



<p>As we said, Nintendo is a smart business company, and people are going to flock to these releases like Pidgeys to a Caterpie, regardless of the $20 price tag.</p>

</ul>



<p>Should both games have been released as freebies for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers as part of the Game Boy Advance library offering? That’s a debate for another day, and it’s sure to go on.</p>



<p>Is this a fair price for what is an updated port? Should it have been included with Nintendo Switch Online?

            <p>Ubisoft has not one, but two Far Cry games currently in development.</p>
<p>That's coming from Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot, who was interviewed by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> about various goings on at the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">such as its recent 'restructuring'</a> which will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">including the already launched subsidiary with Tencent known as Vantage Studios</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Here, the publication asked Guillemot if this new company model will see development on its biggest franchises such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed speed up, to which the exec replied:</p>
<p>"We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios. Under the Assassin's Creed brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year.</p>
<p>"On Far Cry, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development."</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Ubisoft had two new Far Cry releases on the way, but this is now official confirmation that this indeed the case. As for those previous reports, it has been said that one release - codenamed Project Blackbird - will be the next mainline Far Cry entry. This chap will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-will-reportedly-see-players-attempting-to-rescue-their-kidnapped-family-against-the-clock">allegedly feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family</a>, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.</p><p>The second game previously reported to be in the works is a standalone Far Cry multiplayer game, known as Project Maverick. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft">sources claimed Maverick would be an extraction-based shooter pitched as being based in "the Alaskan wilderness"</a>. At this time, it was said Maverick would allegedly include "mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more". The "and more" here could likely refer to lootable chests and extraction zones.</p>

<figcaption>The latest mainline Far Cry entry - Far Cry 6 - took players to the fictional Caribbean island of Yara. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Assassin's Creed, we already know about some of its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">such as Project Hexe</a> and of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">its Black Flag remake</a>. However, a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">Insider Gaming</a> has said that as part of Ubisoft's recent restructuring, two upcoming Assassin's Creed titles were cancelled, including one said to be called Assassin's Creed Singularity.</p>
<p>According to the publication's sources, Singularity was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration, and it would have been released across PC and mobile platforms. While I do have my - ahem - thoughts about what Ubisoft has done to its studios and games over the past few months, this is one game I don't feel especially sad to see gone.</p>
<figure>

<p>Elsewhere at the company, as well as these two Far Cry games, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-anthology-series-in-the-works-with-always-sunny-in-philadelphias-rob-mac">anthology series is also in the works with Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob Mac (née McElhenney) and Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley</a>. In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>
<p>As for Ubisoft more generally, earlier today it was announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">company was laying off 40 developers at the studio working on its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the game itself remains in production.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Started 2026 as January’s Best-Selling Game in the US, While Subscriptions Drove 3% Spending Growth]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-best-selling-game-in-us-january-2026/</link>
            <guid>1441873</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Circana</strong> executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> has shared his first monthly sales report of 2026 for video game sales in the US, and it's <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong> taking the top spot on the premium sales charts for January 2026. Overall spending in the video game industry in the US was up <strong>3%</strong> compared to last year, with subscription services and hardware sales driving that growth.</p>



<p>It's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's second month in a row sitting atop the US premium game sales charts, though finishing 2025 as the best-selling game of December was not enough to beat <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>, which was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game of 2025 in the US.</a> That said, the lack of content coming to Battlefield 6 (its second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-now-live-drives-highest-steam-concurrent-count-this-month/">only arrived earlier this week</a>) did not help its January 2026 sales, as the game fell out of the top three to <strong>fifth</strong> place on the sales charts.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <strong>NBA 2K26</strong> kept its second-place spot, <strong>Minecraft</strong> moved up to fourth place from eighth, and <strong>Madden NFL 26</strong> went from fourth to third. Overall, not a whole lot of shuffle in the top five, but in the top ten, there was one very notable entry that moved up from <strong>225th</strong> place all the way to <strong>ninth</strong> place. </p>



<p>That game was <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong>, which made its massive jump into the top ten thanks to its release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> last month.</a> Technically, even though <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> sits between FFVII and the only new release on the charts, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/">Code Vein 2</a></strong>, it's probable that Code Vein 2 missed the top ten because of FFVII Remake.</p>



<p>That said, at least when looking solely at PC game sales in the US, Code Vein 2 sat at the top of the charts.</p>







<p>The only other game included in the top 20 for January 2026 that wasn't already one of the top 30 best-selling games in the US for December 2025 was <strong>Fallout 4</strong>, which just eeks in at the number 20 spot after being in <strong>68th</strong> place in December 2025. </p>



<p>As we move deeper into the year, it'll be interesting to see how long Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 can hold a spot above Battlefield 6 in the charts, and which upcoming games are able to keep both of them out of first place.</p>



<p>Moving away from the sales charts, while January isn't known for being a major period in the year for players spending a lot on games, especially since it arrives just after the holiday craze, overall spending in the US video games industry was up <strong>3% </strong>compared to January 2025, driven by hardware and subscription spending. </p>







<p>A sign that people were probably using their monetary holiday gifts to grab a new console, specifically the <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which were the number one and two best-selling hardware units for January 2026. Looking at hardware spending alone, January 2026 was a <strong>16% increase</strong> compared to January 2025.</p>



<p>With the January 2026 report in the books, it'll be interesting to see where the charts line up for February 2026, especially since there are more than a few major releases from this month, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-sells-1m-copies-fastest-selling-game-series/">one-million unit seller <strong>Nioh 3</strong></a> and the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong>.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <guid>1441864</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana has just launched its 11th new set, Winterspell, and there's a whole lot to like about it already. The new frost-themed card art is sublime, and it's undeniably a particularly cosy expansion before we look ahead to the highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-full-release-schedule-2026">Wilds Unknown expansion in May</a>, featuring fan favorite Pixar characters for the first time.</p><p id="winterspells-10-top-chase-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Winterspell's 10 Top Chase Cards">Lorcana: Winterspell - 10 Best Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But enough on that, let's take a look at what's really rocking for single card collectors in Winterspell, including two brand new iconic rares that are already demanding a mighty high price (we're talking thousands of dollars), and unsurprisingly, feature some of the finest art I've ever seen in a trading card game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56qVx?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">data from our friends at TCGplayer</a>, here are the 10 most valuable Disney Lorcana cards to come out of the new Winterspell expansion.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">10 - Tod - Knows All the Tricks (Enchanted)</h3><div id="235529"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235529" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tod - Knows All the Tricks (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another absolutely adorable card that I can't get enough of from Winterspell, is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLp3k0?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tod - Knows All the Tricks</a>. The Enchanted variant is looking fairly valuable as well, currently sitting at around $190 market price, while its <a href="https://zdcs.link/QW6qMl?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary is fetching around $6-$8 right now as well</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ability to ready up again twice per turn when chosen for an action or an item's ability seems fairly good to me as well, with a high ceiling for shenanigans, from my initial impressions at least. I'm certainly going to be chasing after Tod, and I suspect plenty of fans will be as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9 - The Cold Never Bothered Me (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Cold Never Bothered Me (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course we're getting some delightful Frozen themed cards in the Winterspell set, it would be crime not to. And, 'The Cold Never Bothered Me' (anyway?) is one for collectors to absolutely keep a sharp eye out for, especially its delightful Enchanted version. Market price highs are reaching around $171.49 right now, and I've got a funny feeling this valuation will continue to rise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It features some incredible card art of Elsa, funnily enough from an artist also named Elsa (Elsa Chang, to be exact). It reads: "Look at the top 4 cards of your deck. You may reveal a location card and put it into your hand. Put the rest into your discard. You pay 3 Ink less for the next location you play this turn."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8 - Raging Storm (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235530"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235530" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Raging Storm (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Enchanted card demanding a high price is Raging Storm, featuring Nani, Lilo, and Stitch with some wonderful card art from Jane Pica.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's demanding a fairly high price right now at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPj7O?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$126.26 at TCGplayer</a>, but if you really want this card, you can also just pick up its <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoJxlL?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Super Rare variant for around $4</a> instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, it's another Winterspell card that Collectors are bound to be all over, and chasing as for it as hard as they can. Keep an eye on this one, as I think it's got a whole lot of value potential even further into the future as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7 - Eeyore - In the Way (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235525"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235525" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Eeyore - In the Way (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This might be one of my favorite ever cards to come out of Disney Lorcana. This full card art of Eeyore - In the Way, by Gabby Zapata, is absolutely stunning, and worth the high price of the card alone. If I get lucky and manage to pull this sweetheart, then even better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running for around $130 at market on TCGplayer right now, this is still a hot card to come by, even if it just misses out on a top ten ranking by value. And while it doesn't reach the eye watering values of the rest of the cards coming up on this list, at $130+, it's still a unbelievably good pull if you manage to score it. It's a card I'm absolutely on the look out for right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6 - Belle - Snowfield Strategist (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235566"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235566" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Belle - Snowfield Strategist (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring some wonderful art from Jane Pica, this enchanted variant of Beauty and the Beast's "Belle - Snowfield Strategist" has got all the makings of an increasingly valuable card, in the short and long term. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It reads: "[Winter Stockpile] Whenever one of your characters is banished, you may put that card from your discard into your inkwell facedown and exerted."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $145.48 on TCGplayer right now, I can only seeing it going up in value over the next few months. Let's wait and see.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"> 5 - Angel - Experiment 624 (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235565"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235565" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Angel - Experiment 624 (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Angel - Experiment 624 is just an incredible well rounded card, and a great addition to the Winterspell expansion, so I'm not surprised that it's fetching a tidy price at launch. The Legendary card is sitting at around $24.76 right now on TCGplayer, while the stunning Enchanted variant is at $177.84, and there's no surprise why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Community sentiment around Angel, who features heavily on Winterspell key art across its marketing and sealed product selection, has been incredibly positive so far. Prices could come down a little bit as we get further away from launch, but I've got a funny feeling it's going to hold out for a while longer. If you manage to find this one, I'd avoid selling and hold on, at least that's what I'll be doing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4 - Ohana Means Family (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235528"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235528" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ohana Means Family (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring both Lilo and Stitch, this Enchanted action card is already hovering just shy of the $200 market mark, and it boasts some genuinely charming artwork from Kei Yotsuba. Its Legendary card version has decent value right now as well, sitting at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN3xky?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$27.19 at TCGplayer's market price</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanically, it is more or less a rework of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l8nqr?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rapunzel - Gifted with Healing from The First Chapter</a>, carrying almost the exact same effect, but as an action card, and being potentially slightly less flexible in real play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than capping the effect, like Rapunzel did at three damage, Ohana Means Family instead removes all damage from one of your characters and lets you draw a card for each point healed in the process. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">3 - Anna - Soothing Sister (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235517"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235517" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anna - Soothing Sister (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Frozen-themed card from Winterspell, this time focusing on Anna. Soothing Sister's Enchanted card art is another beautiful example from the new set. It's currently worth just over $200 at TCGplayer, and it's easy to see why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see this as another card from the latest set that will continue to rise in value over the next few weeks. If you manage to pull it, hold on for a bit longer. And if you fancy a solid investment, well look no further.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2 - Pocahontas - Peacekeeper (Iconic)</h3></div><div id="235526"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235526" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pocahontas - Peacekeeper (Iconic)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of two Iconics from the Winterspell expansion, and I can already see why this is going to be a huge chase card for both players and collectors. Sitting at just over $400, I'm hardly surprised that Pocahontas - Peacekeeper is demanding such a high price already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, there's a whole lot of potential in the card itself, even if you want to just opt for the equally as beautiful, if a little less expensive, <a href="https://zdcs.link/ae8PWw?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary variant (which is valued at just under $6 right now)</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Easily paired with <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3OvWM?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pocahontas - Following the Wind</a>, also featured in Winterspell, this puts you on a one way train to locking down the board for a full turn and completely shutting off your opponent's ability to challenge. That is not a small effect, and just the tiniest bit mad, all things considered. I love it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1 - Moana - Curious Explorer (Iconic)</h3></div><div id="235527"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235527" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Moana - Curious Explorer (Iconic)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The demand on this card is honestly mind-boggling. But, I can also get behind it. The card art by Leslie Strock is to die for, and it's probably one of my favorite designs I've ever seen in a trading card game, let alone Lorcana itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, <em>the price</em> is eye-wateringly high. There's something to be said about never having to ink a card from your hand again, which is why the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPj1P?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary variant</a> we mentioned earlier is also spiking at decent value since launch (sitting at around $26), but the Iconic rare is just on another planet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like, come on, $550 - that's nuts? That's playing ball with some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-top-10-most-valuable-cards-from-last-year-2025">rarest Pokémon</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-most-valuable-cards-2025-updated">Magic: The Gathering cards</a>. Let's go, Lorcana, I guess, making its very own economy with every release is as impressive as it sounds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm skeptical that it can maintain such a high demand going forward, but since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-fabled-most-expensive-cards">Fabled introduced Iconic</a> rarity, it has certainly introduced the perfect height of card chasing for what is a TCG somewhat still in its infancy. Best to just see where things go next, cross your fingers, and then throw an enormous party if you manage to pull such a rare card when ripping packs. </p></div><p id="where-to-buy-winterspell"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to Buy - Winterspell">Where to Buy - Disney Lorcana: Winterspell</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some quick honorable mentions before I finished up, as it's also worth keeping an eye on several other Winterspell cards that look like they have plenty of potential. That includes <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7RbLE?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lilo - Rock Star</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8VvV?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Darkwing Duck - Cool Under Pressure</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBGrR?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mulan - Resourceful Recruit</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to find any of these cards, rather than buying them outright as singles, then you'll want to pick up some Winterspell boosters ASAP. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-winterspell-where-to-buy">Winterspell is now available to buy</a> at most major retailers, but I'd recommend at least picking up the Booster Display Pack for $144 at Amazon to really get you started with the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The booster display comes with 24 packs, with each booster packs setting you up with 12 cards, including six Common cards, three Uncommon cards, two cards of either Rare, Super Rare, or Legendary rarity, and one random foil card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a little bit of everything, I'd recommend checking out the Illumineer's Trove for $50, which comes with a card storage box, six card dividers, eight booster packs, six damage-counter dice, and a lore counter.
