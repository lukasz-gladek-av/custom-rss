            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humanoid Origin, the studio started by ex-BioWare staffer Casey Hudson, has closed down, citing "an unexpected shortfall of funding" that left the studio "unable to sustain operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a>, Humanoid Origin says that the closure happened despite its "efforts to shield the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">broader challenges in the industry</a>", and that the company is "heartbroken" it won't be able to complete its debut project.</p>

<p>The project in question was set to take place in a "new science-fiction universe", and while Hudson and Humanoid Origin never revealed what kind of game it would be, the studio's <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>&nbsp;describes it as a "multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative". Sounds very familiar indeed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closure-mass-effect.jpg?itok=4I2uaIGN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closure-mass-effect.jpg?itok=sGPLRKBe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Casey Hudson is perhaps best known for his work as a director on the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Humanoid Origin says that it's "committed to supporting [its team] in their transition to new employment", and that during the team's time together, it "achieved incredible progress", fostering "a culture of fun and creativity".</p>

<p>The studio is right when it points to the current time as one of tumult and difficulty for the gaming industry (or certain sections of it, at the very least).</p>

<p>Major studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> have laid off hundreds of staff members in recent times, and some studios, like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a> and&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">Piranha Bytes</a>, have been outright shut down.</p>

<p>Many game projects are being canceled as well; in recent months, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff Project T</a>, online action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">unannounced&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS</a> canceled (at least in the West, in <em>Blue Protocol</em>'s case), among others.</p>

We'll just have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

Among these, <em>Hunting Simulator 3</em> introduces an all-new dynamic system, “SimFauna,” which faithfully reproduces animal behavior, allowing players’ actions to have a real impact on animals and the environment.</p><p>In addition to improved hunting dog behavior and sound design, and the addition of vehicles, the game features realistic, natural open-world environments thanks to Unreal Engine 5. Players can hunt over 40 species of animal, using hunting equipment from renowned brands such as Beretta, Winchester, Browning, and many others.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>'s next season is named Dual Destiny, and will kick off next week on Tuesday 3rd December. 
</p>
<p>
Its logo features obvious black and white-themed branding, which should perhaps not be a surprise considering Pokémon Black and White region Unova is next on the docket to be featured in the game's Go Tour event series. Dual Destiny finishes on 4th March, around the time we'd expected Go Tour Unova to be held.
</p>
<p>
So, why "Dual Destiny"? In a press briefing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> said the name was designed to reflect "opposites coming together to strengthen one another and celebrate two sides of a whole", which is nice.
</p>
<p>
In terms of content, much of what is to come will be announced over the coming days, but perhaps the headline for now is the early introduction of teacup Pokémon Sinistea. This fits the Dual Destiny branding as it has two different types - Antique and Phony - depending on whether it comes with a stamp of authenticity. (Maybe it should have been called Authencitea?)
</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Sinistea - a Ghost-type Pokémon that debuted in Pokémon Sword and Shield - it looks like a small chipped teacup. Its Pokédex entry describes it thus: "The soul of someone who died alone possessed some leftover tea." It evolves into Polteageist: "The tea that composes Polteageist's body has a distinct and enjoyable flavor. Drinking too much, however, can be fatal."</p>
<p>
From the start of the season, Red and Blue-striped Basculin will now be Shiny-possible and available in 7km eggs. Oddly, though, the form you obtain will relate to where the gift is <em>hatched</em>, not from where it was sent. (Here in the UK, you'll obtain Blue Basculin while on the West side of the Prime Meridian line, and Red Basculin on the East.)
</p>
<p>
Gigantamax Lapras will also make its debut in Max Battles, while Go Battle League will feature avatar items based on Unova Elite Four member Grimsley. Dragalge, Bibarel, Glliscor, Starmie and others will receive additional moves.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rift-of-the-necrodancer-pc-release-date-revealed-alongside-delay.1045482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rift-of-necrodancer-pc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Klei and developers Brace Yourself and Tic Toc have announced the&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>release date, although it's probably a little later than you might have expected or hoped for.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073250/view/4489618994289967161" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on February 5th, but Brace Yourself says it's "decoupling" the Steam launch from the game's console release, which will now happen "at a later date" that's yet to be determined.</p>

<p>According to Brace Yourself, the delay is down to the team not wanting to cut any of&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s features to make a 2024 release, and the console delay is so that the team has "a little more time" to polish the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rift-of-the-necrodancer-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=9jLY_Dyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rift-of-the-necrodancer-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=QCN9ve0E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as announcing the new release date (and, by extension, the delay), Brace Yourself also reveals what it's been working on in the last year or so, with many of the features mentioned seemingly contributing to the game's delay.</p>

<p>These features include an extra "Impossible" difficulty level, as well as more Rhythm Rift beat maps, additional readability for monsters that land off the beat, and tools to implement custom music.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to enjoy a Remix Mode that "throws a fresh chart your way every playthrough", as well as better tutorials and practice mode gameplay, more animation clarity, and a revamp of the story mode. In short,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s devs are using the extra time wisely, it seems.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>, it's a&nbsp;rhythm spinoff of Brace Yourself's roguelike&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crypt-of-necrodancer" rel="nofollow"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a>. Though the game will feature many of the same characters as&nbsp;<em>Crypt</em>, it has its own gameplay style that's more indebted to games like Harmonix's&nbsp;<em>Frequency&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Amplitude</em>.</p>

<p>The game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073250/Rift_of_the_NecroDancer/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on February 5th, with a console release to follow sometime after.</p>

            <p>Video games in general have a surplus of weapons. It's gotten to the point that if I had any freelance budget, I'd commission somebody to count them up. Just give me an approximate running total for the industry at large, so that whenever next a shiny-eyed producer regales me with the prospect of enchanted lazurite rapiers at a preview event, I can quietly ask how many enchanted lazurite rapiers we're talking about, then open my laptop and generate a scrolling image akin to those <a href="https://mr21.github.io/space-object-comparison/#earth,moon">comparison pages for stars and planets</a> - a cosmic mountain of points and pommels, with the new game's armoury forming a pixel-wide foothill in the bottom left corner. "Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers," I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.</p><!--more-->
<p>In the absence of an artform-wide disarmament project, with shame-faced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adventurers handing over their runic heirlooms to local constables, games could at least teach their players to think more about each individual weapon: its design and history, how it fits into some on-going story. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bladesong">Bladesong</a> seems helpful on that front. It's a blacksmithing game where you make swords to play out the tale of a mighty fortress, "one of mankind's last remaining bastions after the gods have banished themselves".</p>

<p>It doesn't <em>look</em> a lot like blacksmithing, mind you. It's a spotlit model-editing garage that burgeons with icons, fields and sliders for things like "distal taper" and "flamboyance". There is minimal hammering, as far as I can see. No actual in-game singing either, despite the title. I feel like there genuinely are blacksmiths who sing to their creations, to regulate the rhythm of their strokes. I guess you can always sing at the screen if it helps with your APM.</p><p> If you dislike crafting screens in video games, this is your worst nightmare. But I'm already enjoying both the nerdy extravagance of options, and the accompanying requirement to meet specific buyer requests that factor into the aforesaid narrative. Somebody needs a lightweight training sword - perhaps they're a juvenile Chosen One embarking on that very first tutorial rat hunt. Somebody else wants a blade that's hefty and not too long, so that they can slash with it in tight spaces - perhaps this particular individual is a city guard who patrols a lot of narrow alleyways. Somebody else just wants a shitload of pretentious glowing sigils. He's likely a witcher.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if we had the option of deliberately failing commissions and saddling people we dislike with minimally hardened or heat-treated swords. A few days later, there's a story in the papers about some git noble splintering his bejewelled katana against a peasant's scythe while trying to collect taxes. </p>
<p>Sadly, the Steam page doesn't give much sense of the story and how much control you have over it. The morsels I sponge from the trailer suggest that there's a lot of text, but it's tersely phrased. Makes sense - there's no room for roundabout adjectives when you're commissioning weapons. It would be like making a rapier out of lazurite. Lazurite, incidentally, is a tectosilicate mineral often used in painting. I don't speak from any experience, but you probably shouldn't try to make a sword out of the stuff.</p>
<p>Bladesong will have a public playtest from 4th-13th December. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305640/Bladesong/">You can sign up on the Steam page</a>. In the shorter term, I welcome any recommendations for other games in which you largely just make weapons for people. I know there are a few.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Improvements to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> are still not ready, despite Remedy today releasing a new update for the game across all platforms.</p>
<p>As with a handful of games, playing Alan Wake 2 on Sony's more powerful console results in performance issues, which players are waiting to be patched.</p>
<p>"The PlayStation 5 update (1.200.005) does not contain anything PlayStation 5 Pro specific, but we wanted to acknowledge that we are seeing your feedback," wrote Remedy in a post on X. "We are still researching a few things on the Pro when it comes to improved performance. We'll keep you posted. As PS5 Pro support was a work of many months, it will take the team longer than a few weeks for changes and improvements. Thank you for understanding!"</p>

<p>Still, the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">new patch</a> does include a number of improvements and fixes. For instance, Alan's hair now gets messier and when using the Classic Outfit it gets "properly soaked". He also now wears his wedding ring - bit awkward that.</p><p>Other changes include collectibles from DLC The Lake House appearing in Saga's Mind Place; the Night Springs theme is available in the Writer's Room after finishing any Night Springs chapter in the main campaign; gyro controls have been improved; and the "Thrower" enemies are less frustrating thanks to less frequent movement and teleportation.</p>

<p>Ahead of the PS5 Pro's release, Remedy released a detailed blog post explaining all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">improvements the Enhanced label would bring</a>. That included a 30fps and 4K Quality Mode with added ray tracing, and a 4K Performance Mode at 60fps.</p>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> with several bugs and issues, which GSC Game World, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating</a> the million units sold milestone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-team-outlines-next-fixes-crashes-bugs-weapon-price-adjustments-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to resolve.</p>
<p>One of the main features that need care is the so-called A-Life AI and spawn system. While we wait to see if the developer will be able to fix it with an official patch, modder ConnerRia <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a mod called The Roadside Panic that aims to greatly improve the lively feeling of the Zone - although it might just kill your game's frame rate in the process. Here's the official overview from the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>This mod restores the chaotic dynamism of the old STALKER games. It also murders your frame rate, so you can enjoy the authentic 30fps 2007 Shadow Of Chernobyl gameplay experience.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unleashes the full potential of online A-Life</em></li>
<li><em>Heavily mitigates cases of enemies appearing out of thin air right behind you, like in that Reddit clip of the military base everyone keeps talking about</em></li>
<li><em>Significant extension of the A-Life range. NPC and NPC interactions can be seen and heard from afar.</em></li>
<li><em>Different factions will fight for territory at POIs.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>How Did You Fix "A-Life"?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Duct-tape. The AI director in STALKER 2 is actually very complex internally, however its function is gimped because of severe bugs compounding each other. I troubleshooted the present bugs to the extent of my ability and duct-taped a solution to coax the A-Life system into working around its own field of anomalies, so to speak. However, a couple of other issues with the A-Life system are breaking it and causing not only janky behavior but also flat-out non-existent A-Life simulation.</em></p>
<p><em>This mod should prevent or at least mitigate abrupt spawns and it will also deliver immersive A-Life interactions such as NPC-NPC firefights, of course.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What's The Catch?</em></strong><br>
<em><strong>Performance.</strong> This mod will slaughter your frames in an already unoptimized game. A top-of-the-line CPU is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Persisting Spawn Issues.</strong> As said before, the director is broken, and all a-life cfg tweaks are doing is finding brute-force methods to circumvent said issues to get more spawns and world events.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Roadside Panic - Stalker 2 A-Life Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e472boNXfIs?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With this mod, you can pick between three download options. The first, Roadside Panic, works at a radius of 800 meters but keeps the squad density of STALKER 2 as-is. The second, called Roadside Panic Lite, works in a 250-meter radius to mitigate bugs. If you're feeling really brave, though, the option for you is Roadside Panic, which works in an 800-meter radius but also cranks up the spawns a lot.</p>
<p>If you opt to try Roadside Panic, let us know in the comments about your experience.</p>

			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition-footage-system-requirements/">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition</a> mod is almost complete, and the unofficial remaster should be released before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Together with launching a new story-focused trailer, which doesn't feature interior lighting that will be added to the final version of the mod, Revolution Team confirmed that development is 95% complete and is now at the final testing stage. The developer discovered some unforeseen bugs that require fixing, so the mod's release may slip to January 2025, as they want to release the most functional version of the mod possible. Still, they are doing everything they can to get the Nextgen Edition of one of the best entries in the series out before the end of the year.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition | Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ9NHFuafDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition mod has been in the works for some time, so it's definitely good to hear that development is almost over, as it is setting out to be one of the best ways to experience the classic open-world game developed by Rockstar Games complete with visuals and gameplay enhancements.</p>
<p>Those who cannot play Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition are still able to experience a remastered version of the game with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition remasters. The compilation was updated <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">earlier this month</a> with some enhancements only available for the mobile version of the compilation up until this month that address some of the issues of the PC and console release. You can learn more about it and the issues that plagued it at launch in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>

In light of the fact that this is substantively be the same Andretti bid that F1’s leadership rejected before, it’s worth wondering whether the value of the GM and Cadillac badges was the decisive factor for F1 leadership, or if it was removing the liability of the Andretti connection.</p><p>The argument from F1’s chieftains has always been that, if the sport was going to grant a highly-coveted new spot on its grid to a new team, the team needed to come in as a serious contender and bring real value to the sport. They wanted a high-quality “works” team, one that has the technical and manufacturing wherewithal to produce an entire Formula 1 machine from end-to-end, especially the complicated and ruinously expensive power units. The fact that Andretti’s bid was bolstered by a promise to partner with GM wasn’t sufficient for the opposition that had gathered to Andretti’s efforts. The Andretti F1 car would be sourcing its engine from another supplier (at least at the outset), like most of the current F1 grid, and there was wariness about how seriously GM was in its intentions to take an active role in its partnership with Andretti.</p><figure></figure><p>Behind that reasoning was a blatant distaste toward Andretti Autosport, and particularly toward the Andrettis themselves. Mario Andretti might be a living legend who won races with just about every kind of machinery he ever touched, but he is not quite as beloved figure in F1 as he in the United States… and his son Michael’s reputation in the sport <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a25684703/michael-andretti-f1-1993/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was marred by his grim stint at McLaren</u></a> prior to being replaced by Mika Hakkinen. Yet it was the way he came across as owner and executive at his motorsports company that truly turned the sport against him.</p><p>Something about the way Michael Andretti <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/why-f1-and-teams-are-still-not-impressed-by-andrettis-new-team-plans/10418580/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>lobbied to secure support for his team’s bid</u></a> was off-putting to the leadership of the F1 grid. In many ways, the response to Andretti was anachronistic, like the Andrettis were <em>nouveau riche </em>Americans of the 19th century, hunting for a place in European society.&nbsp;</p><p>Except it might not be quite as easy to reduce it to a simple matter of bluff, assertive Americans repelling the reserved Europeans they set out to charm. Zak Brown has led McLaren for a decade, Otmar Szafnauer was a well-regarded team principle (though I have always suspected his stock was likewise diminished by his very midwestern lack of pretension, which seems like it was not what board room “alpha” wannabes like Lawrence Stroll and Laurent Rossi wanted from a direct report). Rather than coming across as respectful or considerate, Andretti's attempts to persuade other team owners to welcome his efforts to join the F1 grid, he seems to have struck his peers as presumptuous and manipulative.</p><p>More important than Andretti’s initial unctuousness was the way the organization was also desperately bargain-hunting. Andretti was willing to pay <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/200m-andretti-plans-f1-entry/10303590/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an anti-dilution fee</u></a> of $200M to the other teams on the F1 grid to make up for the fact a ten way revenue split would become an eleven way split, but the fee was seen as too small in light of the current value of a spot on the F1 grid (the fact that owner Liberty Media’s takes half the sport’s revenue off the top and teams would end up losing money if the sport’s health and popularity draws more entrants is another topic for another day).&nbsp;</p><p>Andretti may also have erred critically by soliciting, or maybe just having the misfortune receive, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/12979350/andretti-fia-president-mohammed-ben-sulayem-confident-formula-1-will-approve-new-team?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the blessing of the FIA and its increasingly unpopular chairman</u></a> Mohamed Ben Sulayem. After a misfiring charm offensive, it would not be surprising if F1’s leadership was thoroughly alienated by Andretti’s efforts with the FIA and then with the press to paint the other F1 teams as acting out of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/andretti-says-greed-is-behind-f1-negativity-of-entry-plans/10419099/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>pure greed and bad faith</u></a>, a charge which attracted warnings of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republican-jim-jordan-f1-investigation-andretti-us-rcna151103?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an anti-trust investigation</u></a> from Congress.</p>

<p>The bulk of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s marketing features The Replacer. The bearded character appears in various BLOPS 6 trailers and spoofs, but his origins are confusing to many—so let’s tell you everything you need to know about The Replacer.</p>



<p>Treyarch brought back the iconic character for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>—marking the first time The Replacer has been seen since Black Ops 4. The character has been used in various pre-release trailers, depicted as a replacement for real people in everyday life.</p>



<p>The Replacer’s face has become synonymous with CoD, and I’m here to dive into who he is, the actor behind the role, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-the-replacer-character-in-black-ops-6">Who is The Replacer Character in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Irreplaceable. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Replacer is a fictional character created specifically for the Call of Duty universe and was first seen in Black Ops 2.</strong></p>



<p>With CoD’s reputation continuing to grow and its popularity soaring at an unfathomable rate, The Replacer debuted in a marketing trailer to hype up new BLOPS 2 content. In the video, The Replacer steps into the shoes of normal people going about their day to “replace” them, allowing the person to enjoy Black Ops 2 instead.</p>



<p>The hot reception for The Replacer resulted in the persona returning for Black Ops 3, and Black Ops 4, and they have returned for 2024’s Black Ops 6. Again, following the same ideology; players desperate to play Black Ops 6 can call upon his services to step in and fulfill their day-to-day duties.</p>



<p>If only The Replacer was real, he could be here writing this while I kick back and camp Hardpoints!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-replacer-in-black-ops-6">How to Unlock The Replacer in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p><strong>You unlock The Replacer in Black Ops 6 by purchasing the Tracer Pack: The Replacer Bundle from the BLOPS 6 Store.</strong></p>



<p>The bundle costs <strong>2,400 CoD Points</strong> and includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Replacer Operator Skin</li>



<li>Blueprints</li>



<li>Finishing Move</li>



<li>Charm</li>



<li>Calling Card</li>



<li>Sticker</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-who-is-peter-stormare-in-black-ops-6">Who is Peter Stormare in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Peter Stormare is a Swedish-born actor playing the role of The Replacer in the Call of Duty: Black Ops series.</strong></p>



<p>The actor’s legendary portfolio of acting credits—thanks to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001780/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB</a>—stretches across TV, movies, and video games. Focusing on the latter, as well as The Replacer in Call of Duty, Peter Stormare has had voice roles in <strong>The Elder Scrolls: Online</strong> as King Joruun, <strong>Destiny 2</strong> as Arach Jalaal, and <strong>Until Dawn</strong> as Dr. Hill.</p>

            <p>
PlayStation is celebrating its upcoming 30th Anniversary by letting you sit on its logo while riding the Victoria Line.
</p>
<p>
The marketing stunt is the first time in over 25 years that Transport for London has allowed a brand to advertise on its Tube seats. It's also probably the first time in over 25 years that TFL has actually put in new Tube seats.
</p>
<p>
Sony's design includes the classic Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle buttons emblazoned across the Tube's usual moquette seat cushions. (Today I learned that the correct name for this type of fabric is indeed "moquette". Impress your friends.)
</p>
<p>
Here's how it all looks:
</p> <div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Somewhat oddly, PlayStation has also suggested people should kiss while sat on these seats. I will continue staring at the ground trying to ignore everyone else as normal, but thank you anyway Sony.

<p>
Keen to spot the PlayStation Tube branding for yourself? You might find it more difficult than it first appears. Reading further, it seems like just one carriage on the Victoria Line has been given the PlayStation spruce-up. With 36 trains operating per hour, that might take a while to find.
</p><p>
This isn't the first time PlayStation has teamed up with TFL. Back in 2020, Sony took over the Tube signs outside Oxford Circus by replacing those with the Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle designs to promote the launch of PS5. Finding these signs was easier than finding an actual PS5 at the time.

And before that, PlayStation memorably stuck its favourite buttons up on London's Oxo Tower back in 2013, to celebrate the launch of PS4.

PlayStation celebrates its 30th anniversary next week, on Tuesday 3rd December, when it will have been three decades since the launch of the original PS1 in Japan. Eurogamer will be marking the occaison here too - stay in your PlayStation-branded seats for much more.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is quietly prepping plans to re-enter the handheld gaming market with a portable PS5</a> that's set to rival <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Callisto Protocol PS5 Pro patch greatly enhanced image quality and performance while also introducing an 8K resolution mode that delivers a visual experience without compromise, according to a new analysis of the patch.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vez2JZxDYSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly podcast</a>, Digital Foundry provided their own analysis of the PS5 Pro patch released for Striking Distance's game, highlighting how the patch improves Performance Mode considerably by adding the ray tracing features only available in Quality Mode on the base model while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. This is seemingly achieved by lowering the resolution, as on the mid-generation console, the pixel count hits 1440p and 1296p in areas where it is higher on the base model's Performance mode, although the image is definitely sharper on the new system. In addition, the game also achieves better performance on the new PlayStation 5 model by using TAAU instead of AMD FSR 2 or PSSR, as the artifacts that indicate that either are being used are nowhere to be seen. As such, it is not clear if Striking Distance simply used the additional GPU power of the system to brute force these improvements in some ways or had access to the PS5 Po exclusive features that can only be used with more recent SDK versions.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also examined the 8K mode introduced in The Callisto Protocol with the PS5 Pro patch. This mode is not as impressive as the No Man's Sky 8K mode, as it features a slightly sharper image than the 4K resolution mode and not much else. As such, Digital Foundry theorizes that this mode employs a dynamic resolution range that hits up to 6K and then upscales the image to 8K.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-x-s.1045413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft will shutdown its Xbox Avatar Editor app on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 9th January due to "low engagement", the company has said. 
</p>
<p>
This means you'll no longer be able to access or edit your Xbox Avatar, and you'll lose any purchased cosmetic items for them. Any money spent on avatar items will be refunded.
</p>
<p>
After 9th January, Xbox Avatars will disappear from profile pages, Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/xbox-avatar-editor-app-faq">said</a>. So, if you want to snap one last Gamerpic using your digital self, now's the time. 
</p>
<p>
The good news here is this solely refers to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-the-revamped-and-diverse-new-xbox-avatars-look-like">newer Xbox Avatars, launched in 2018 for the Xbox One era</a>. Microsoft's entirely separate and confusingly distinct Xbox Original Avatars are unaffected.
</p>
<p>
If you still remember (or use!) your Xbox 360, you'll remember having an avatar there, too. These avatars are what Microsoft now calls Xbox Original Avatars, and they were far more ingrained within Xbox 360's ecosystem. Some Xbox 360 games let you play as your avatar, for example, while others offered cosmetic avatar rewards via a system akin to Achievements.
</p>
<p>
Again, the Xbox 360-era Original Avatars are not going anywhere - hopefully because switching them off would be more of a headache when it comes to game preservation and back compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Back during the troubled times of the Xbox One, Microsoft pivoted back to using avatars and spent time creating an all-new system that offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-avatars-just-got-a-lot-more-diverse">far more diverse range of options and deeper customisation</a>. This included support for prosthetics, wheelchairs and gender neutral clothing, plus colour combinations for that can stretch to "almost eighty octillion", Microsoft said at the time.
</p><p>
"Microsoft is dedicated to delivering great experiences for players, including a variety of options to personalise their gaming experience with Xbox," Microsoft said in a statement now. "Due to low engagement and our shift in focus towards delivering other player experiences, the Xbox Avatar Editor app will no longer be available starting on 9th January, 2025.
</p>
<p>"Players can still personalise their gaming experience with dynamic backgrounds and profile colours on Xbox consoles, and with Xbox Original Avatars, profile themes, and gamerpics on Xbox consoles and PCs."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Steam and Epic Games Store versions of BioShock Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-2">BioShock 2</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a> and 6, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a>, XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad and Marvel's Midnight Suns will now run without the 2K Launcher opening first.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9Z24V9Q3426C558WRC173K">blog post</a> on the changes, 2K said its launcher had now been removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam. Last night, an update was sent out to 2K games on Steam to ensure its removal - in case you wondered why BioShock was patched again.
</p>
<p>
From 2K's notes on the subject, the whole thing sounds like it should be pretty seamless. If you're still seeing the 2K Launcher now, be sure you've updated your games and rebooted Steam. 
</p>
<p>
Access to your games, as well as your save files, should continue uninterrupted, 2K says in a Q&amp;A on the subject. 
</p>
<p>
"Can I still use the 2K Launcher if I want to?" a final question asks. "We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest," is the response.
</p>
<p>
2K's next games include Civilization 7 and BioShock creator Ken Levine's mysterious Judas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">whenever that finally materialises</a>. When it does do so, however, it will be without the 2K Launcher.

            <p>Nintendo has added <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> to the official series timeline.</p>
<p>The adorable top-down game is part of the 'Hero is defeated' timeline, slotting in behind Tri-Force Heroes and the original The Legend of Zelda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html">timeline</a> links (pun intended) all the games together, famously splitting after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> depending on whether the hero is successful or not at saving the world.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for Echoes of Wisdom? I'm yet to finish it myself, though in all honesty we all know the timeline is incredibly loose and somewhat meaningless.</p>
<p>Worryingly, though, after Echoes of Wisdom Nintendo specifies a "Decline of Hyrule Kingdom". What happened? What did you do Zelda?</p>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-places-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-outside-series-established-timeline">Nintendo officially listed both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom outside of the established timeline</a>, with no relation to previous games.</p>
<p>Further, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/11/12/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-eiji-aonuma/">The Washington Post</a>, series producer Eiji Aonuma stated Zelda games are developed from a gameplay perspective first, with story formed later. So how much does the timeline really matter?</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom was released on Switch back in September, and is the first game in the series to feature the titular princess as the playable protagonist.</p>
<p>Zelda voice actor Patricia Summersett told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/after-echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-actor-says-having-the-princess-as-the-playable-character-in-a-breath-of-the-wild-style-open-world-game-would-be-amazing/">GamesRadar</a> it would be "amazing" to see the princess as protagonist in an open world Zelda too. "I'm so happy for the fandom that they got Echoes of Wisdom, of course, but I mean, yeah, there can always be more playable Zelda as far as I'm concerned," she said.</p>
<p>"Thanks to playful puzzles and an imaginative reinvention of Hyrule's historic iconography, Echoes of Wisdom emerges as a bold and creative new chapter in Zelda's legend," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present">Echoes of Wisdom review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In philosophy there are several thought experiments to test how you might respond to complex moral conundrums. Perhaps the most famous of these is the trolley problem – if forced to choose, would you choose to sacrifice one life to save many? This initial question seems simple at first glance, but once more information is layered in (the single person is a doctor who might find the cure for cancer, the many are convicted criminals etc.) we find that our decision can change. Threshold feels like a gaming equivalent of this kind of thought experiment, and its atmosphere and moral ambiguity has stayed with me since I finished it the first of several times.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRESHOLD – Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jAqq9qqq5XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Threshold is the brainchild of solo developer, Julien Eveillé, and is the latest in a series of fantastic indie games published by Critical Reflex, hot on the heels of the viral <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQMCO84f03Y">Mouthwashing</a>. Threshold more than holds its own in such lauded company and is one of the most thought provoking and troubling games I’ve played this year.</p>


<p>The game starts with you seeming to be buried and put in the position of choosing a new name – the catch being that you only have two letters to fill. This small detail immediately prevents you from fully identifying with the character you will play as (unless you happen to have a particularly short name or nickname, I guess). To further the sense of defamiliarisation &nbsp;there is not just a simple difficulty select option available here either. You can choose between focused and distracted modes which make environmental clues harder or easier to spot, but the actual difficulty is set by choosing a country’s flag. There is no indication as to the effect of this choice and I look forward to the inevitable long form video essays delving into the various effects.</p>


<p>Once you start the game proper you are given a very basic overview of your duties in your new job. There is a mysterious train forever moving forward across the threshold station you control, entering a tunnel through an intimidating concrete wall. To ensure the train’s safe passage, you must blow a whistle through a foghorn style amplifier to speed it up when it slows down. You’re not told what the train is carrying or why it must maintain a certain speed, just that it is your job to control it. The moral quandary starts to unravel as you discover clues and notes that suggest that all is not quite what it seems.</p>
<p>Graphically, Threshold makes effective use of the lo-fi PS1 style that is increasingly popular at the moment. The sharp edges and blocky polygons help to give everything an uncanny feel, and the drab palette perfectly suits the mood of daily drudgery. The piercing alarm that sounds when the train is not at its optimal speed is the most pressing reminder of your duties, an alarm that is made even more effective by the relative silence of the game. The background rumble of the train is your main companion, as even your co-worker relays information purely through written notes.</p>

<p>The in-game reasoning for the lack of voice acting is an ingenious part of the world building. The station you are manning is high up and therefore the oxygen levels are very low. This lack of oxygen becomes a key mechanic as simply moving around the map leaves you breathless, and blowing the all important whistle takes a lot of oxygen each time. To combat your breathlessness you must collect and use oxygen canisters, but even this aspect only serves to deepen the feeling of dread and despair.</p>
<p>Rather than conventional gas canisters, the oxygen you collect comes in the form of gas tubes that you must bite into in order to release the air within. The effects of this mechanic are reflected in the constant graphic of your mouth on screen, a mouth that becomes increasingly bloodied and disfigured as you use more air. This perpetual reminder of the ill effects of your job is open to all sorts of interpretation about the alienating process of capitalist systems, and/or just a cool bit of body horror.</p>
<p>Saying much more about the way the game develops is especially difficult as it is an experience that really needs you to go in as uninformed as possible.&nbsp;Any further discussion of mechanics or plot developments risks spoiling the game, an issue perhaps exacerbated by the relatively short time it takes to play it through. If you explore thoroughly and look for as many clues as you can then it’ll take you about 90 minutes for a playthrough, and there are several different endings to unlock. A short run time is always a risky choice given the way the refund system on Steam works, but I would urge you to try out different approaches to get the full effect of the game’s complex meditation on choice and consequences.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Threshold is a game that deserves to find an audience that will truly appreciate its provocative and philosophical approach and represents another excellent title in Critical Reflex’s library. The opening credits claim that it is a true story and this detail in particular has lead me to speculate on possible metaphorical interpretations ranging from the highly personal to the global political. It is rare for a game to make you think quite this much and that is meant as high praise.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Activision and developer Treyarch have proudly <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1861092582257807478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the biggest entry in the already massive franchise one month after its release. That's counting figures like total players, hours played, and total matches. Interestingly, the actual numbers were not shared, but they must be massive, given the IP.</p>
<p>The news is not surprising, given the great <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start</a> in the game's first week. Black Ops 6 also registered new records for <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet traffic in the UK</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-witnesses-52-of-total-us-xbox-players-checking-it-out-a-new-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Xbox players</a> checking out the game, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-games-consumer-spending-up-by-10-after-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drove US spending on games up by 10%</a>. Certainly, the fact that this is the first time a new Call of Duty game has launched on Game Pass helped a lot with setting new total player, hour played, and total match records.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 received Wccftech's seal of approval from Kai Tatsumoto's review, too. Here's what he had to say about the latest entry in the shooter series:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</em></p>
<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>
<p>What do you think about the new Call of Duty? Are you enjoying it? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>When and where did the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2711290/New_Life/">Steam demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-life">New Life</a> first find its way to me? When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. "For who is madder?!" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. "The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!"</p>
<p>And if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I no longer wish to play the demo for New Life, if indeed I ever did. I find its presence ugly in ways that transcend how naturally ugly it is, which is the very thing I think made me want to play it in the first place. I find its description deeply unnerving in its unadorned simplicity. "A creepy story about a guy," it begins. Immediately, I am beset by visions of Poe. Of Shelley. Of Lovecraft. Of Chambers. Of scholarly ink spilled in wasteful abandon, of frenzied efforts to elucidate and quantify the terror the dwells in every human heart. "What folly!" I spit between mouthfuls of Tesco brand choco hoops, helplessly watching the murky impostor milk dribble down my juddering chin, coagulating with my tears of enraged bafflement. "What utter madness!".</p>
<p>For what is all horror if not, in some small way, a creepy story about a guy?</p>
<p>"Immerse yourself in the dark adventure of a guy who suffers from depression and feels guilty. He never takes off his hood and always keeps his hands in his pockets," it continues. "Michael became disillusioned with life and decided to try to start his life over. To do this, he left the metropolis and a successful career, sold the house he inherited, and moved to the other side of the country to forget the mistakes made in the past. But is it possible to escape from your past?"</p><p>Is it possible indeed? Day after day, I set myself the task of clearing the clutter from my library. A demo I’ve played and do not wish to play again. A demo that has tempted me to buy the full game. A demo I have poured my heart into writing about to extol its virtues, burning with ecstatic fire as words tumble unbidden to the page, only for the sole piece of evidence that I did not imagine the entire affair to be a single RPS comment that says “looks shit M8”. And then, there is the demo for New Life. Haunting me like all unfulfilled aspirations must eventually: relentlessly. Viciously. Eternally.</p>
<p>I move the cursor. I right click and hover over the ‘uninstall’ button. I have no wish to return here, to this place between play and un-play, as long as I live. But still, I cannot leave. "What if?" I ask. "What then?". The demo is too small to concern myself with the space it takes, and yet, too monumental in its shrieking insistence to ignore. And in this place between oblivion and absolution, I scrape out a wretched existence, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>(I will probs just leave it there tbf it’s a very small demo)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-2k-launcher-is-no-more-you-can-now-launch-2ks-pc-games-directly-in-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2K Games has pulled its launcher from all its PC games as part of a “complete sunset” of the software, which means PC gamers can now launch all 2K games directly in Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2K Launcher was forced upon players of the company’s PC games, including Firaxis’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a>, Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xcom-2">XCOM 2</a>. Following an update this month, the 2K Launcher is removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam. 2K also removed the 2K Launcher Beta, a completely separate launcher, from Civilization 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will now all launch directly into the game as soon as you click Play. The Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Steam and the Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Epic each have slightly different paths to getting into the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 6 on Steam had the launcher removed earlier this year, so no additional steps are needed. But for Civilization 6 for Epic, it now directly opens into the game when launched from Epic. Civilization 5, meanwhile, now uses the Steam Launch options to open the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">XCOM 2 for Steam is a special case, 2K said, <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34883894563347--XCOM-2-2K-Launcher-Sunset-and-Removal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the launcher included Mod support functionality</a>. Of note, these changes will let you enable mods on the Steam Deck. XCOM 2 on Epic will now open the Original XCOM 2 Mod Launcher. <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34884258027411--XCOM-Chimera-Squad-2K-Launcher-Sunset-and-Removal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XCOM: Chimera Squad also has the Mod launcher as optional</a>, with a secondary option available to directly launch the game. Mods are also available on Steam Deck for Chimera Squad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9YZ0QXK5J6CQVJXJ8P73H9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, 2K said it had replaced the 2KLauncher folder with a text file called 2kLauncherRemoved.txt, which can be safely deleted. But there may be more for you to do — 2K said to be sure the launcher is gone for good, close and reopen Steam then reboot your PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've done the heavy lifting, but to take it all the way home there might be one step left for you,” 2K explained. “First thing is to try closing and reopening Steam - that means completely closing and not just using the X to minimize the platform. Rebooting your PC is a good way to be sure it happened. For Epic, just make sure you've downloaded the most recent update for the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saved games shouldn’t be impacted, and you won’t lose access to any of your games, as long as you bought them on Steam or Epic. And, for those (probably very few!) PC gamers who miss the 2K Launcher for some reason and want to continue using it, unfortunately it’s not coming back. “We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest,” 2K said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of the 2K Launcher comes ahead of the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> in February 2025. Civilization is usually one of the most popular PC games around, so fans can rest assured they’ll be able to launch it directly in Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers have long criticized publisher launchers, including Ubisoft and EA’s, that force themselves upon players before they can get into the game. It seems unlikely the end of the 2K Launcher will spark a mass removal of PC launchers, however, given they’re often used for cloud saves or storefronts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Is the next big video game company acquisition on the cards?</p>
<p>Last week, news broke that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony was in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>. A day later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged that takeover interest</a>. Should it be accepted, this would likely be the biggest video game acquisition since Microsoft bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> and Sony itself bought Destiny-maker Bungie.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is of course known for its Souls games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, and already has an established relationship with Sony due to exclusives like Bloodborne and Demon's Souls. Yet Kadokawa not only owns other developers, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> developer Acquire, it's a major name in anime and manga too - an area Sony already has considerable claim to with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-set-to-buy-crunchyroll-for-nearly-usd1bn">acquisition of Crunchyroll</a>.</p>
<p>So what's the likelihood of this acquisition being accepted? What does Kadokawa - and by extension FromSoftware - stand to gain from Sony ownership? And does this mean Bloodborne fans will finally get the re-release they so desperately crave?</p>
<p>Joining me to discuss the possible consequences of this acquisition on this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a> are news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake.</p>
