			<p>If you've been looking for a way to jump into Delta Force, the game will be getting a PC Open Beta Test on December 5, 2024.&nbsp; The game was well received during Steam Next Fest, and Team Jade has announced that the tactical shooter will be launching its PC Open Beta Test on December 5. To celebrate the release of the Global PC Open Beta, Team Jade has released a Cinematic Trailer, where you can watch just over four minutes of content to get excited about the title.</p>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force | PC Global Open Beta Cinematic Trailer: Genesis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YY6mxdHdHNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PC Open Beta Test, previously known as Early Access, will bring expanded content to the game, allowing players to experiment with new weapons and operators, as well as new maps, missions, and much more. As the game was so well received during Steam Next Fest, Shadow Guo, Game Director of Delta Force, made a statement about what's next for the title.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to wrap up Steam Next Fest with a bang! On behalf of the entire team, we want to say a huge thank you! Given the feedback and the game's current state on PC, we've decided to release the multiplayer component for PC players ahead of schedule. We're excited to bring a plethora of new content to players, and we hope they enjoy every moment."</p>
<p>While this is an exciting moment for PC players, those on console and mobile will have to wait a little while longer, with Shadow Guo saying that news will be coming early next year. Delta Force is shaping up to be a highly anticipated game, as the title has reached over two million wishlists on Steam alone, making it the 4th <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-reaches-one-million-steam-wishlists/">most wishlisted title</a> on the platform currently. In addition to that, Delta Force topped all three of the official Steam Next Fest charts, with the game being in the top spot on the Trending Upcoming, Popular Upcoming, and Top Demos title lists.</p>
<p>The single-player campaign for Delta Force doesn't have an official release date yet, but it's probable that it will be released sometime during 2025, as that was originally when the multiplayer mode of Delta Force was going to be released.</p>
<p>This is a huge accomplishment for<a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Team Jade</a>, as they previously worked on games such as Call of Duty: Mobile and Assault Fire. Assault Fire has been the most popular Chinese shooter game on PC for the past decade. Delta Force is a major franchise, with the first game being released in 1998.&nbsp; The last title was released in 2009, with the upcoming Delta Force title coming to PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, iOS, and Android.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-black-ops-6-campaign/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the last few years, Call of Duty’s campaigns have been woefully short. In 2023, Modern Warfare III was released with a story mode that could be completed in just <strong>three hours</strong>, which always leaves users feeling short-changed. With that in mind, many people are asking the obvious question: ‘How long is the Black Ops 6 campaign?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-black-ops-6">How Long is Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Let’s be honest, everyone cares about multiplayer when it comes to Call of Duty, and <strong>that’s </strong>endless. This time around there’s also a stacked COD Zombies offering, which only serves to increase the number of hours you’ll spend shooting things and exploring this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>But what about the campaign? How long is Black Ops 6’s story?</p>



<p>Here’s what we know.</p>



<p>Treyarch explained that the Black Ops 6 campaign is a) ‘the kind of length of a classic Call of Duty campaign’, and b) ‘slightly longer than Cold War (2020).’</p>



<p>When it was released, Black Ops Cold War boasted one of the shortest Call of Duty campaigns ever, coming in at around five hours. With that in mind, it seems obvious that Black Ops 6 will have a <strong>longer </strong>story for players to explore.</p>







<p>In terms of the average, it’s usually expected that a standard COD campaign will take players around 6 – 7 hours to finish, but it has been wildly varied in recent years.</p>



<p>There are a few things that might make the Black Ops 6 campaign length seem a little shorter. For instance, the game only has one linear ending, and there’s nothing to gain from replaying it to find alternate endings. </p>



<p>Also, this game is more accessible than ever, and the easiest difficulty setting and all the guidance options are expected to make this game <strong>a breeze </strong>unless you’re playing on a harder difficulty setting.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 will be released on October 25 – we’ll have confirmation then of how long the campaign is.</p>

This battle takes place in the Necropolis where Melchiah chases Raziel down while phasing through gates, making the spectral realm no longer safe. Strategically use the environment to expose Melchiah’s vulnerabilities and use his own devices against him.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—Melchiah received a full texture overhaul with darkened skin and a slimier body-feel. The bones and skeletal mapping are now more realistic and gory and his eye color was adjusted to match the original look.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Zephon</strong></p><p>Fought in a dilapidated cathedral, Zephon has evolved into an insect-like creature, fusing with this towering structure. You’ll need to ascend to the highest chambers and become willingly ensnared to be able to confront him. Search the room for any elemental advantages which could aid you in this endeavor.</p><p><em>—Zephon was too desaturated, so we’ve completely repainted his face.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Rahab</strong></p><p>This battle occurs in a flooded abbey. Rahab is fully immune to water, which is lethal to Raziel. Use Raziel’s agility to avoid Rahab’s deadly close-range and long-range attacks by jumping and make use of your newly gained Telekinetic projectile ability to exploit Rahab’s extreme vulnerability to sunlight.</p><p><em>—Rahab’s head has been remodeled, so the eyes now have a reddish glow which gives him a menacing look. We’ve also altered the fangs to look more vampiric and made his skin color a little more gray.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Dumah</strong></p><p>In a desolated fortress, Dumah awaits reanimation. Just like his other brethren, Dumah is invulnerable to any attacks, so Raziel has to be cunning and lure him to a flame powerful enough to melt even the hardest metal, all while avoiding tremendous earthquakes caused by Dumah’s incredible strength.</p><p><em>—Dumah’s armor is now a lot dirtier and has patches of mold and blood all over it (considering he was impaled for centuries).</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Kain</strong></p><p>Raziel first confronts Kain at the Pillars where he must be swift and strike Kain three times to gain the Soul Reaver. The second encounter takes place in the Chronoplast, where the tiered arena makes evasion even more challenging. Track your target’s movements closely and make haste to strike him with the Soul Reaver. If you cannot reach him in time, use your Telekinetic projectile to stop Kain from using his powerful lightning attack. The encounter is intense and dramatic, but we won’t spoil how it concludes. Pre-order to find out!</p><p><em>—The models for Kain in both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 needed to be completely re-designed to mitigate textural issues. With the increased polygon count we felt it was important to bring his look a lot closer to the Kain we got to see in the original <a title="Genres > FMV [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/fmv">FMV</a>s, which was a lot more detailed and showed more-or-less what the original intent was for the character. The original model in SR1 was especially limited so now both games have a Kain that looks consistent between the two titles.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Map and Compass Details and Gameplay</strong></p><p>In the original versions of the games, players often found themselves wandering the vast, twisting landscapes of Nosgoth, relying heavily on memory and environmental cues to navigate.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>The introduction of the Map and Compass marks a thoughtful enhancement that blends modern gameplay conveniences with the preservation of the explorative experience the original titles were known for. The Compass gently nudges the player in the right direction without giving away specific details of where to go or what to do next and the Map is more of a reference tool than a guide.</p><p>We also included a collection tracker for any Health and Energy power-ups so that you know if you’ve gotten all of the collectibles within each area. All of the major Nosgoth features are present and accurately condensed based on the setting and gameplay. </p><p>For fans who might feel that these additions are a major departure from the original games, we’ve made sure to incorporate a toggle-off function for the compass. </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition to its gameplay utility, the map is also a wonderful art piece that was created in collaboration with our development team, community advisors, artists, and designers at <a title="Companies > Crystal Dynamics [150 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cde-entertainment/crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics</a>. We knew accuracy was paramount, so we worked hard to pull from the original source art, design documents, and clues from game lore. We also incorporated community reviews to ensure nothing had been missed.</p><p>Thanks to these efforts, the map is accurate enough to feature in the new lore reader bonus menu – identifying the location of each lore entry. </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Legacy-of-Kain-1-and-2-Remastered_Bosses_2024_10-22-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>For design direction, Crystal Dynamics designers used a heavily inked approach that sits beautifully with the existing art, creating a stunning new way to visualize the world of Nosgoth. </p><p>The Map and Compass are there to serve as welcome tools for exploration, ensuring that the remastered versions remain both a tribute to the classics and a modernized, more player-friendly experience.</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was an early success for Ubisoft in 2024, or so it seemed anyway. It was the first relatively big game to launch this year and it got rave reviews, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco's 9/10 on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action game features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, sales haven't been nearly as positive, at least compared to Ubisoft's pre-release estimates. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to YouTuber Gautoz</a>, who talked to various members of the Montpellier office, there won't be any sequel and the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team is also practically disbanded.</p>
<p><em>You have to understand that internally, the writing was on the wall a few weeks after the game launched at the beginning of the year. By Spring, it was pretty clear – just a few patches, a DLC, and that was it. The more optimistic folks in the core team repeatedly pitched a sequel project, but then it turned into a struggle to get the green light for two DLCs, hoping to change the bosses' minds. But it was obvious that the decision had been made quickly, especially with the need for help on other projects with better sales potential.</em></p>
<p><em>Ubisoft usually has a sales curve like a blockbuster—big launch, but this time, it started lower than expected. I've heard a justification that honestly drives me crazy as a gamer: if you let them make another one, it’ll eat into the long-term sales of this one. I've always thought the opposite; with a good sale on the first one, you could actually boost sales.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The production of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown wasn't exactly an issue—far from it, actually. For instance, there was crunch, but we're talking about a production with a really strong collective spirit, which is pretty different from how Ubisoft usually makes games with 80 to 100 people fully loaded on development, which is pretty small in comparison.</em></p>
<p><em>It's a classic big Ubisoft project, but it was a blessing to try out different organizational models. Some teams, like the gameplay team for example, were set up almost horizontally with a lot of listening and consultation. People felt like they really had a say in the project's direction. Plus, it's worth mentioning that the Prince of Persia team had often allowed people who were totally burned out due to too much time spent on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Somewhere along the way, it also helped some people get back on their feet after tough times in their careers. So these days, the big office reorganization at Ubisoft Montpellier is kind of wiping away the last traces of that team.</em></p>
<p>It is unfortunate since Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is arguably one of the very few critical successes enjoyed by Ubisoft lately. However, the company is now focused entirely on improving its sales, and it was even willing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows out of its scheduled November 2024 release window to avoid jeopardizing its signature franchise. They're also backing out of the Season Pass model, canceling early access, and returning to Steam in three unprecedented pro-consumer moves.</p>

			<p>Today, the new Xbox Wireless Headset was announced. This headset features the same sleek and classic look as the original Xbox Wireless Headset but comes with some new enhancements to make the headset better and provide a more immersive and seamless experience for those who want that surround sound feeling. For those who are interested in picking up the headset, you can purchase it for $109.99, with this new version of the headset officially replacing the original model. The headset is available for purchase now.</p>
<p>To make sure that players are getting the most immersive gaming experience with this new headset, players will be able to use Dolby Atmos for immersive, spatial audio at no additional cost. Compared to the previous headset, the battery life has now been improved and offers players up to 20 hours of playtime. Additionally, the microphone for the Xbox Wireless Headset has been improved, offering a new enhanced auto-mute and voice isolation system featuring Bluetooth 5.3. The Xbox Wireless Headset is available in all-black, with no current plans to create the headset in other colors.</p>
<p>If Dolby Atmos isn't your style, the Xbox Wireless Headset also comes with built-in support for Windows Sonic and DTS Headphone: X. For those who like to be able to hear every single detail during their gaming experience, this is the perfect audio combination. Just in time for October, the month when everyone is braving some new horror games.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't planning on using this headset for the Xbox, it has Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity for both PC and mobile devices, which means that players using this headset will be able to switch between devices without any issue, and there won't be endless fiddling around with the Bluetooth settings to try and get your devices to sync up. Additionally, there are no dongles or extra pieces of equipment that you'll need to use in order to get your headset working.</p>
<p>The Xbox Wireless Headset comes with <a href="https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-suggests-samsung-and-google-are-developing-a-pair-of-mixed-reality-smart-glasses-instead-of-a-headset/">Qualcomm</a> S5 Gen 2 technology, providing a low-latency wireless connection, allowing for smooth gameplay and perfect communications between teammates.</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/22/xbox-wireless-headset-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a> for the Xbox Wireless headset, it is noted that for those wanting to use DTS Headphone: X, you may have to purchase additional content and apps to be able to use it. Additionally, the battery life of the headset depends on a number of factors, including the distance from the console, additional accessories, usage, and more.</p>

<p>The Wolf Among Us 2 has not been cancelled at Telltale Games. </p>



<p>The confirmation comes after rumors began to circulate over the last 24 hours that the game was almost to a point where Telltale “might have no choice but to shelve it”.</p>



<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wolf-among-us-2-not-cancelled-telltale-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Telltale Games assured fans that the game was still moving forward with development.</p>



<p>As a rule, we don’t comment on rumours and unsubstantiated reddit threads,” the Telltale rep told the outlet. “But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we’re excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right.”</p>



<p>The original poster of the rumor has since deleted the claim.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2017, The Wolf Among Us 2 was first cancelled when Telltale Games had to shut down in 2018. Upon the studio’s revival in 2019, the game’s development was restarted. It was planned for a release in 2023, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-out-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed due to development</a> “requiring more time”. Since then, it’s been silent on when the game could come.</p>



<p>The studio did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/telltale-games-allegedly-fires-most-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoff a significant number</a> of people in 2023, however, according to former cinematic artist Jonah Huang.</p>



<p>What do you think of the state of The Wolf Among Us 2 amid cancellation rumors? Let us know in the comments or the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

Throne and Liberty, recently published globally by Amazon Games <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-hails-success-of-mmo-throne-and-liberty-after-3-million-players-in-a-week">to huge player numbers on Steam</a>, is now its own game studio.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/tl-1729612090545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Throne and Liberty's global launch is a success, Amazon Games has said.</figcaption></figure></output><p>NCSoft is now split into four divisions: NCAI, Studio X, Studio Y, and Studio G. (Studio X is the studio behind Throne and Liberty.) It’s unclear at this stage what NCSoft’s troubles mean for ArenaNet, the Bellevue, Washington-based studio behind Guild Wars. Earlier this year, Guild Wars 3 was said to have been in development, although work continues on Guild Wars 2.</p><p>Some video games will be canceled, howoever, alongside layoffs via a voluntary retirement program, the co-CEOs confirmed. "Major changes are inevitable for the survival and future of the company, and we promise active support and compensation to those affected,” they said.</p><p>Earlier this month, Amazon Games announced that Throne and Liberty had seen more than three million players in just a week following its global launch. Originally billed as a Lineage sequel, Throne and Liberty is an MMO with PvE and PvP set in a dynamic and seamless world. It suffered numerous delays over the course of a development cycle spanning several years.</p><p>Throne and Liberty finally launched on October 1 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and soon proved a hit on Steam with an impressive player concurrent peak of 336,300. Throne and Liberty remains one of the most-played games on Valve’s platform. Neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Judging from comments by a veteran Guerrilla Games developer, don't set expectations for the FPS franchise to return anytime soon. The team "needed" to shake things up after Killzone: Shadow Fall launched in 2013, according to art director Roy Postma.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>, Postma explained why Guerrilla left Killzone behind and set their sights on what became Horizon Zero Dawn.

Did you have a fine old time in Blackreach, the mazy, Dwemer-built underside of Skyrim's sprawling mountain map? Do you like murdering Ents in slow motion? Do you want to see smells? You might be interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-axis-unseen">The Axis Unseen</a>, which has just launched on Steam - it's the work of former Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile, one of the big brains behind Blackreach.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The Axis Unseen isn't an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, nor is it a work of genre fantasy like Elder Scrolls. It's an open world archery hunting sim, set in a "heavy metal horror" universe, with an appropriately loud soundtrack composed by post-metallurgical maestro Clifford Meyer of Red Sparowes fame.
</p>
<p>
The game's monsters can smell you based on the wind direction, and you can track them based on footprints and blood trails. This isn't some pious exercise in realism, however: you also get a sorcerous bow with arrows that can distort time and change the weather. Arrow effects can be combined, Magicka-style, and there are also unlocks that enhance your senses. "See scent particles," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/">the Steam page enthuses</a>. "Feel the warmth left behind on their tracks. See colors that no human has ever seen." I'm not sure my graphics card can handle colours beyond human comprehension, though the system specs don't look too brutal.
</p>
<p>
I played an early build of The Axis Unseen at GDC's Day Of The Devs this year, and swiftly got myself stepped on by Bigfoot. In the 10 minutes or so before I was stepped on by Bigfoot, I particularly enjoyed the game's shamanistic in-world HUD design, with health, power availability and how much noise you're making visible as glowing glyphs on your wrists and equipment. I wasn't especially blown away by the hunting element, but it's hard to form a clear impression of such delicacies when you're surrounded by game developers bellowing about the afterparty. 
</p><p>
The full game is "20 hours long, more if you're a completionist", according to the Steam page. Graham is reviewing this, I think, or at least, putting together some lengthier thoughts about it. He says he's interested because archery is the only good part of Skyrim, but don't mind Graham - he's always saying things like that.

Meaning, thankfully, you won’t be spending the entire month trying to clear this thing.</p><p>But, that leaves a big chunk of spooky month remaining, and needless to say, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is a tough act to follow in terms of that exact horror wavelength.

And, of course, they’re led by Scorsese’s current favorite, Leo DiCaprio.</p><p>Not, there’s no twitchy leg monsters or Pyramid Heads running around, but there is an unnerving misty island asylum, a mystery concerning a murdered wife, a subterranean netherworld where the truly insane taunt our so-called hero, a damaged nurse repentant for her actions, and one hell of a twist that <em>Silent Hill 2</em> fans will genuinely appreciate. Basically, all the wonderfully fucked-up psychological torment, guilt, shame, and fear that a lot of <em>Silent Hill</em> media gets wrong, Scorsese gets right without breaking a sweat.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-recommend-id="image://a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Possession." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Possession." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Gaumont</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-recommend-id="image://a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Possession." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you could somehow distill pure not-from-concentrate Divorced Guy Energy and pour it onto celluloid, you’d get something that vaguely resembled <em>Possession</em>. It takes a particularly fucked up, jilted mind to take a film about a marriage dissolving to where this goes, to say nothing of how disjointed and coldly malevolent it turns out.</p><p>James Sunderland got off light. His wife getting a wasting disease and becoming an angrier, more hostile version of herself is one thing. Sam Neill’s Mark is married to a woman (Isabelle Adjani) who leaves their young child neglected in an apartment for hours on end, has a random collection of dismembered body parts in a fridge in a separate apartment across town, had what can only be described as a full-body miscarriage in a subway station, and is apparently having the most incredible sex of her life with a murderous tentacle creature. Mark responds by getting involved in seething, violent arguments with her that end in murder and hate sex.

It’s a story existing in the surreal, incomprehensible middle-ground between life and death, where angels and demons both try to tell poor tortured Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) something he can’t or won’t understand through increasingly violent means. The drama seems to drag until it all falls into place later in the film, but even then, just like the best moments in the <em>Silent Hill</em> games, it’s a mood unlike anything else.</p><p>Oh, and in case anyone’s wondering, yes, there was a 2019 remake; yes, it was real bad.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-recommend-id="image://69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->New World Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-recommend-id="image://69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you aren’t ready for the nasty European flavor of psychsexual horror on film, don’t worry, David Cronenberg has you covered. Cronenberg’s also got Divorced Guy Energy going on, but his approach at least has a conversation about mental health and a therapist involved. Granted, therapy involves turning negative emotions and experiences into homicidal toddlers who murder whoever you talked about in the last session, but, y’know, still therapy.</p><p>As much as it is definitely A David Cronenberg Movie, there’s a lot of sadness and empathy for the factors that made Oliver Reed’s wife the way she is, but mostly a hell of a lot of anger. If you’re one of those people who thought the Maria ending was the way to go in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, this should be your jam, because this basically has the same idea.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-recommend-id="image://5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shudder</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-recommend-id="image://5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the things that a lot of old-schoolers—even the ones who generally liked the remake—complained about with Bloober Teams approach to <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is that there’s a certain level of jankiness, graininess, and brokenness about the original game that’s just gone by necessity. There’s something that hits different about staring into a hallway, your light barely even penetrating the darkness, bouncing off of a vague abstraction of a lived-in apartment building or abandoned hospital, as opposed to a lovingly crafted, photoreal rendition of the same. Your mind just meets the abstraction halfway, and if it’s got any semblance of an imagination, it’ll craft terrors for you that Hollywood money can’t buy.</p><p><em>Skinamarink</em> is 100 minutes of that feeling. A film taking its sweet time, stripping away every guard rail of typical horror media. The two children at its center wake up one night to find out their parents have disappeared. Then the doors. Then the windows. Then the lights. And then the shadows start moving. And then there are voices calling the kids upstairs. And mom’s upstairs. but something is breaking her bones. But you never actually <em>see</em> any of this in any discernible sense. Now, that does require a lot of buy-in from the viewer, because a mind that can’t really surrender its imagination like that will just see a 100-minute movie about two kids watching cartoons and yawn. But still. Turn out your lights, turn off your phone, watch this sucker in silence. You might be surprised where it takes you.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-recommend-id="image://7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dimension Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-recommend-id="image://7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Is it an obvious choice? Sure. The original novella is the source of the whole conceit of <em>Silent Hill</em> being covered in fog (<em>Half-Life</em> also cribbed its premise from the original novella). It’s also one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever made, if not <em>the</em> best, and ‘tis very much the season for that. It’s also got a slew of great performances across the board, including the late, great Andre Brougher. For the strict gamers, Sam Witwer of <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Days Gone</em> fame has a small but important role here. But more than anything, especially the more we watch real life splinter into weird pseudo-religious fiefdoms dealing with the threat of apocalypse with fear and bloodshed, it’s only become a more powerful and prescient piece of work since it was released. Mrs. Carmody is EVERYWHERE now.</p><p>But yes, on top of all of that, it’s also the only place in non-game media to get your fix of that special feeling <em>SH2</em> gives you right from the start, of following something unidentifiable into the mist, and seeing it get swallowed up by unholy terror by the end. Do yourself a favor: Don’t stream it. Buy it on disc, roll with the black &amp; white cut, it’s a very different ride.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The package includes a remaster of 2011’s <em>Sonic Generations</em> and a brand-new campaign starring Shadow the Hedgehog. Y’all, <em>Shadow Generations </em>is the best <em>Sonic </em>game in the past 20 years, and I spent a good 20 hours running around its open zone finding all the collectibles I could. That means I can give you a few pointers on how best to use your time as you try to reach that coveted 100 percent completion. Here are a few things to know before jumping into <em>Shadow Generations</em>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196055,196646" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h14968"><a id=""></a><strong>Consider playing <em>Sonic Generations </em>first</strong></h2><p>This might seem like a wild thing to suggest, but while <em>Shadow Generations </em>is easily the big selling point of the package, the original <em>Sonic Generations </em>is also here and it feels substantially worse to play. However, part of the reason it felt bad to go back to was because I’d just spent 20 hours in <em>Shadow Generations </em>at that point and gotten used to the tightness of its controls. If you want to play both games, it may be worth hopping into <em>Sonic Generations </em>first, just so you don’t have to go back to something that feels a little dated compared to its counterpart. If you never played the original, it’ll also help contextualize <em>Shadow Generations</em>, as Shadow’s story doesn’t do a whole lot to explain what’s going on with the blue blur and all his friends. It will also explain why you don’t actually fight Sonic in the campaign. Just something to consider.</p><h2 id="h14969"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t try and get a perfect run your first time through</strong></h2><p>Having been a high-score hound in previous <em>Sonic </em>games, I’ve always had a bad habit of trying to get a near-perfect run the first time I play through a level. Don’t be like me. If you fall down a hole or lose all your rings, keep running. It’s always fun when you manage to get an S rank the first go around, but if you’re unwilling to move forward until you make that no damage/no restart run, you’re gonna get stuck and waste time you could be spending seeing new levels and story. Come back to a level later. It’ll be there when you get back.</p><h2 id="h14970"><a id=""></a><strong>If you see a machine part, grab it immediately</strong></h2><p>Some of the many collectibles you’ll find in <em>Shadow Generations </em>are bolts, screws, washers, and other mechanical parts lying around the White Space map. If you see one of these, stop what you’re doing and grab it. Even if you’ve gotta run around the map to find the right bouncer to send you flying to it or floating platform to jump across to get to it, these little fuckers are the biggest pain in the ass to find in all of <em>Shadow Generations</em>. Unlike other collectibles that are either on the map or readily visible, these parts are tucked away in the corners of the map and are tiny enough that you might overlook them even from a birds-eye view. There are 80 of them hidden around the world and by the time you reach those last 15 or so, they make themselves real scarce. Don’t risk forgetting where one is, grab it when you see it.</p><figure id="" data-id="231a48a8c57f68d89b5a62f4690bc01c" data-recommend-id="image://231a48a8c57f68d89b5a62f4690bc01c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow stands with Maria and Gerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow stands with Maria and Gerald." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="231a48a8c57f68d89b5a62f4690bc01c" data-recommend-id="image://231a48a8c57f68d89b5a62f4690bc01c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow stands with Maria and Gerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h14971"><a id=""></a><strong>Take screenshots of chests you can’t open at the moment</strong></h2><p>Throughout <em>Shadow Generations</em> you will unlock treasure chests around the White Space. Most of them are marked on the map; however, I encountered a handful that weren’t labeled for some reason and had to go looking for them. You open these with keys you find in stages and challenge levels, which means you may stumble upon a chest you can’t open until you’ve played a bit further. When this happens, try to screenshot the area or take note of where the chest is in case it’s one that the game, for some reason, doesn’t show on the map.</p><h2 id="h14972"><a id=""></a><strong>Finishing the game will make collecting easier</strong></h2><p>When you’re done with the main story, you’ll still be able to play levels, run around the White Space, and finish filling out your collection. Shadow gains powers throughout the game that let him traverse different parts of the map, and without getting into spoilers, the final ability you acquire is basically an easy mode button for traversal. So while you should absolutely grab items when you see them, just know this power will make collecting items pretty painless.</p><figure id="" data-id="268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-recommend-id="image://268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-recommend-id="image://268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h14973"><a id=""></a><strong>Take the time to read Gerald’s journal</strong></h2><p>One type of collectible you’ll find are pages of Doctor Gerald Robotnik’s journal. This is for the real lore sickos who want a new look at Shadow’s creation, the doctor’s descent into madness, and even a bit of a peek into series antagonist Doctor Eggman’s family drama. You’ll find these pages on balloons floating around the White Space. Shoot them down with a Chaos Spear attack and then you can read them in the collection room accessible from the pause menu.</p><h3 id="h14974"><a id=""></a><strong>Hard mode bosses and challenges count toward the completion percentage</strong></h3><p>As you play through <em>Shadow Generations</em>, you’ll be able to check your completion percentage for all the stages the game has to offer in the Records menu. However, if you notice you’ve done everything but it still doesn’t say you’ve hit 100 percent completion, it might be because the hard mode bosses and challenges count as separate stages from their normal difficulty counterparts. You can fight these bosses by activating Doom Zone from the Black Doom eyeball mechanism across from the Space Colony Ark entrance. </p><hr><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is getting another level later this year based on the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-gerald-trailer-explained-1851632861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-gerald-trailer-explained-1851632861"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>movie</a></span>, with Keanu Reeves set to voice the antihero in the level.

<p>There won’t be a sequel to The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and the team that built the game no longer exists at Ubisoft. According to a new rumor from <a href="https://x.com/gautoz/status/1848742322319548852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">French journalist Gautoz</a>, Ubisoft has disbanded the team behind the game after it failed to reach internal expectations.</p>



<p>A sequel for the game was also pitched, but the company rejected it.</p>







<p>The news was first revealed during Gautoz’s show on the Origami YouTube channel. The show is in French, but a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-disbanded-the-team-behind-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-game-did-not-reach-expectations-and-sequel-was-refused.1016355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user from Reset Era</a> summarized the report.</p>



<p>The report claims that a decision about the future of the game was decided “a few weeks after the release”. It was made clear by Ubisoft that after releasing DLC and cosmetics for the game, support would be done. It was also said that members of the core dev team fought for the aforementioned sequel and even more expansions.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s said that Ubisoft didn’t want another game because those higher up in the company because it could “cannibalize” the potential long term sales of the first title.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to multiple sources on the legitimacy of the rumor. Should any new information come in, this article will be updated accordingly. Until then, please take this information with a grain of salt.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-wolf-among-us-2">The Wolf Among Us 2</a> has not been cancelled, despite recent rumours to the contrary.</p>
<p>Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.glitched.online/the-wolf-among-us-2-reportedly-facing-development-issues-and-possible-cancellation/">whistleblower</a> claimed development of The Wolf Among Us 2 was in peril, and the team at Telltale were at a "critical point where they might have no choice but to shelve it".</p>
<p>Now, in a statement shared with Eurogamer, Telltale has assured us that work on the game continues on.</p>

<p>"As a rule, we don't comment on rumours and unsubstantiated reddit threads,"  a Telltale PR told us. "But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we're excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right."</p>
<p>The Wolf Among Us 2 - again set in the world of Bill Willingham's Fables comics - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/telltale-announces-the-wolf-among-us-season-two-days-after-telling-fans-not-to-get-hopes-up">originally announced back in 2017</a>, but development halted when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-walking-dead-developer-telltale-games-reportedly-lays-off-the-majority-of-its-staff">Telltale Games faced significant lay-offs, and was shuttered in 2018</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft has generally been met with middling reviews since its launch earlier this month, but Tomb Raider 2013 writer Rhianna Pratchett has called out one particular element for praise.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Pratchett said she had not yet watched the show herself, but had been "glad to hear the series has touched upon Lara's PTSD after her experiences". Pratchett noted this "was an area we weren't allowed to explore in the games", despite the narrative team wanting to do so.</p>

</figure>
<p>Pratchett spoke to me about Lara's PTSD journey last year, when she revealed that she and narrative designer John Stafford had actually pitched "playable nightmares" to Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics. "I had the idea that she could have these scenarios from the first game that had got kind of twisted in her mind," Pratchett told me at the time. Crystal ultimately did not go for this idea.</p><p>In the Tomb Raider animated series, Lara experiences flashbacks and nightmares relating to her time on Yamatai, and the resulting fallout of those close to her, such as Sam. And this brings us on to another thing Pratchett said she appreciated about Netflix's show: that it focuses more on Lara's personal life outside of hunting for artefacts in every corner of the earth.</p>
<p>"Lara's personal life and friendships and how she navigates the real world have always been fun areas to explore beyond the games," Pratchett told me.</p>
<p>"These were areas that both Gail [Simone] and I touched a lot upon in our runs on the Dark Horse comics -  creating scenarios like Sam fighting off someone with a close-combat cupcake, and Lara taking on bad guys in the depths of the London Underground whilst dressed as one of the Bennet sisters," Pratchett continued, reflecting on her work on the Tomb Raider comics.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's silly, or irreverent, or just refreshing, but exploring that blurry line where the hero meets the human is always wonderfully fertile ground."</p>

<p>As for the future, Crystal Dynamics is currently working on a new Tomb Raider entry with Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-november-5th/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Metal Slug Tactics has got a release date, and that date is November 5th. Dotemu confirmed the news with a brand new trailer, that also revealed three more playable characters. Those characters are the Ikari Warriors, Clark Still, Ralf Jones, and Leona Heidern. You can check out the new Metal Slug Tactics trailer below, which shows the characters in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYLtBnTjdvk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There has been a bit of a wait for Metal Slug Tactics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/11/metal-slug-tactics-is-a-tactical-rpg-spin-off-from-the-classic-run-and-gun-shooter/">which was first revealed in 2021</a>. In 2022, developer<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/metal-slug-tactics-developer-acquired-by-focus/"> Leikir Studio was acquired by Focus Home Interactive</a>. Later in 2022, there was more news that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/12/metal-slug-tactics-delayed-to-2023/">Metal Slug Tactics was going to be delayed to 202</a>3. Obviously, the game did not release in that year either, but at least it is coming out before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Descriptions for the new characters have been released alongside the trailer too, giving a sense of each one’s playstyle:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><b>Clark Still:</b>&nbsp;Originally hailing from the Ikari Warriors series and previously playable in&nbsp;Metal Slug 6, Clark’s immense strength and wrestling experience allows this tanklike ally to relocate enemies on the map and dish out wide-reaching, status-inflicting damage.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Ralf Jones:</b>&nbsp;Also returning for battle from the Ikari Warriors series and&nbsp;Metal Slug 6, Ralf is a master of short-range combat, packing devastating punches and the ability to charge at enemies head-on like a raging bull.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Leona Heidern:</b>&nbsp;A newer addition to the Ikari Warriors, Leona is a revered fighter capable of replacing fallen enemies with decoy allies; she can distract and overwhelm enemy forces in her distinct approach to dominating the combat zone.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, Metal Slug Tactics is taking things in a bold new direction. It may feature the same heroes, visuals, and imagery of SNKs arcade classics, albeit from a new perspective. We’re suckers for turn-based tactical RPGs here at TheSixthAxis and, beyond the Metal Slug name, we want to see the milieu of customisation and roguelike elements that are at play when Tactics launches on November 5th for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Switch.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shotgun-king-is-roguelike-chess-with-a-shotgun">Shotgun King</a> developers Punkcake Délicieux have quietly rolled out another ticklish oddity in the shape of Build The Sun, a work-in-progress 2D god sim. In Build The Sun you preside over a tribe of alarming yet cute inkblot creatures, who sometimes remind me of Pikmin and sometimes, of that awful 'roided-up panther monster from the opening stretch of Another World. Your objective is, indeed, to build the sun, because there isn't one: the game's pastoral pixelart world is engulfed in darkness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It starts with a single, scurrying inkblot creature, hefting a solitary flame through the shadows. Who lit that first flame? Does this world have a Prometheus? There is no time to ponder, for a helpful arrow ushers you toward a ready-made pile of sticks. 
</p>
<p>
Hold-click on the pile to ignite it (make sure you actually hold till the fire is ablaze, as the current version of the game will crash otherwise). Now, you have a small circle of light that attracts other inkblot creatures. The fire craves growth, as advertised by silhouetted icons for burnable resources when you mouse-over the blaze. These can be obtained by hold-clicking on things like trees and rocks, causing your industrious followers to automatically cluster and nibble the object down to its rudiments.
</p>
<p>
As the fire develops, spilling the light further and further, the game gets more complex. You don't have to burn all the resources you gather; you can use them to construct things like huts and windmills. I'm not sure what these buildings do yet, after 15 minutes with the current build, but I imagine huts increase your population. Everything is left for you to figure out - there's no guidance beyond the silhouetted icons. It appears there's plenty to discover, or at least, that the process of feeding the conflagration is compulsive. Commenters on <a href="https://punkcake.itch.io/build-the-sun">the Itch.io downloads page</a> say they've been tending to their miniature suns for hours.
</p><p>
The current version of Build The Sun is one of many fruits of <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56">Ludum Dare's 56th gamejam</a>. It was made in 72 hours according to the theme "tiny creatures". "We're definitely going to keep working on this one, so you may also consider this version as a very early demo," the devs note. I wish them all the best with it. I have a thing for weird sun-themed games. If you share that fetish, may I also recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dyson-sphere-program">Dyson Sphere Program</a>?
