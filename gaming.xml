		<p>Welcome to the week where I get to pretend I'm not turning 40! (My birthday [deep breath] is on Friday.) Hey, I might still look like an awkward teenager, but somehow I have been waltzing my way through this planet across four decades. It's truly hard to fathom that I've been writing about video games in some form since I was...14? That's 26 years, man. My career in video games can drink and is starting to worry about turning 30! But it looks like I'm not going anywhere? Wild.</p><p>-pk, who will celebrate by, predictably, watching a horror movie</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Sports! </em>– It's me. It's Rob. And...it's Austin "Fly Eagles Fly" Walker. Austin promised to talk sports if his favorite NFL team either made it to the Super Bowl or was eliminated from the playoffs. Well, lucky for Austin, he's headed back to the Super Bowl. Must be nice to root for a good team!</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>HauntedPS1 Demo-Disc: Flipside Frights</em><strong> – </strong>This stream fell through<strong> </strong>the cracks last month, but Cado and I are going to dive back into it.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Steam Vent </em>– We're headed back into the Steam mines again, scrolling through the "new releases" category to see what is often ignored on Steam. Hopefully, I'll get to do this without a call about a sick child this time.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – No more game of the year. What, exactly, are we supposed to do with ourselves? Wait, we <em>still</em> have to record a podcast? </li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series </em>– Perhaps Rob can tell us tales of preparing Remap's tax documents for the upcoming tax season?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

Patch notes reveal everything players can look forward to when they log in, including a selection of units inspired by characters from the One Punch Man anime, such as Tatsumaki, Sonic, Metal Bat, Boros, and, of course, Saitama himself. It breaks down to two Secret units, seven Mythical units, two Legendary units, and one Epic unit, but <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16347800591/OPM-Anime-Royale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anime Royale update 5</a>’s changes don’t stop there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/31/anime-royale-one-punch-1738343679735.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">One Punch Man has come to Anime Royale players on Roblox.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Raid, Story, and Raid Shop, as well as new cosmetics, are also accessible to those who hop into the Roblox experience. The quality-of-life changes mostly focus on tweaking Meruem but also saved some room to deliver balance adjustments to Muzan and Aizen. Additionally, players will notice that the Killua blessing bug has been fixed, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Royale update 5 follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-royale-channels-hunter-x-hunter-with-update-45"><u>the release of update 4.5 last week</u></a>. That patch introduced Hunter x Hunter content for tower defense fans, including even more Mythical, Legendary, and Secret units.

                <p>In 2014, Sony showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/" data-ref-id="1100-6421676">the first look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-canceled/" data-ref-id="5000-306239">Wild</a>, an ambitious open-world PlayStation-exclusive game from the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel. Wild remained in development until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/" data-ref-id="1100-6495395">it was canceled in 2021</a>, almost a year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-retires-but-beyond-good-evil-2-will-go-on/1100-6482347/" data-ref-id="1100-6482347">Ancel retired from the video game industry</a>. Now, former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts about why Wild was canceled.</p><p>"There [were] lots of great ideas [that] didn't really materialize into the actual game structure," explained Yoshida during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax</a>. "It was very open kind of thinking... one of the earliest [pitches] was the map size of the game was the size of Europe."</p><p>As envisioned by Ancel, Wild would have taken place during prehistoric times as players stepped into a the role of a human whose shaman-like powers gave them the ability to influence or control animals. Smaller animals could be used to spy on other tribes, while larger animals could actually be possessed by the player to guide them to accomplish a specific goal or objective. Animals could also support the player in battles against rival tribes.</p><p>Following Ancel's retirement, Ubisoft opened an investigation into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-investigating-retired-rayman-creator-for-alleged-hostile-work-environment/1100-6482636/" data-ref-id="1100-6482636">whether he created a hostile work environment</a> for his employees at the company. Ancel denied the allegations and it doesn't appear that any action was taken against him. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rayman-is-in-development-with-creator-michel-ancel-consulting/1100-6527358/" data-ref-id="1100-6527358">a new Rayman game in development</a>, and Ubisoft rehired Ancel to serve as a consultant on the project. The next Rayman title was announced late in 2024, and it doesn't currently have a release date from Ubisoft.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> upcoming Spring Update will add its first new power weapon since launch, and it's one that will be familiar, yet different, to longtime Halo fans--the Fuel Rod SPNKr.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly the Fuel Rod Cannon first introduced as a usable weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2</a>, but rather a UNSC SPNKr rocket launcher that has been heavily modified by Halo Infinite's enemy faction, the Banished, to fire fuel rods.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZNxv526xa4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YZNxv526xa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the weapon shares many similarities with the franchise's classic Fuel Rod Cannon--like a large magazine and massive green bolts of exploding plasma--it does behave a little differently. Most notably, the Fuel Rod SPNKr's plasma bolts don't bounce off targets, acting more like Halo's traditional rocket launcher.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) is currently on a roll when it comes to adding new weapons to Halo Infinite. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-halo-infinites-dmr-style-m392-bandit-rifle-has-been-leaked/1100-6506883/" data-ref-id="1100-6506883">first new weapon, the Bandit DMR</a>, came three years after launch. However, Halo Studios added a new SMG, the MA5K Avenger, late last year and is now adding the Fuel Rod SPNKr just a few months later. In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/spring-update-2025-halo-infinite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> outlining all the other new additions coming as part of Halo Infinite's 2025 Spring Update on February 4, the developer confirmed it's working on another new weapon in the form of a Banished-themed shotgun. That weapon is slated to arrive as part of Halo Infinite's Summer Update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fuel Rod SPNKr may be the star attraction of the Spring Update, but Halo Studios is also bringing back a classic Halo 2 game mode in the form of the bomb-planting Assault. Other additions coming with the update include a remake of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-5-guardians/" data-ref-id="5000-182008">Halo 5</a> map Coliseum alongside weapon balance changes. The update will additionally overhaul the game's premium Operations Pass, adding more armor set to earn for those who decide to purchase it while making it so armor sets from old passes will be obtainable on The Exchange (Halo Infinite's in-game currency cosmetic shop) the season after they debut.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">multiple new Halo projects</a>, though the developer has not revealed what those projects are. The studio recently shifted to using Unreal Engine 5 to build future games in the series, in the process revealing Project Foundry, a prototype using Unreal Engine meant as a training tool that also shows what the future of Halo may look like. In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the shift (and the studio's new name), it was said the studio rebrand and move to Unreal was the start of a new chapter for the franchise. Given the move to Unreal is still early, a new game in the series was said to not be "imminent."</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors continue to circulate that older Halo games once exclusive to Xbox, as well as a rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-combat-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-2728">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">may release on PlayStation 5</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-is-optimistic-about-xbox-multiplatform-strategy/1100-6529186/" data-ref-id="1100-6529186">Microsoft's new multi-platform game release strategy</a>.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca/news/announcing-battlefield-labs">has announced</a> a new “Battlefield Labs” community testing program to give people the opportunity to test the next <em>Battlefield</em> game. You can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">sign up for the program now</a>, and EA says that the “first phase” of testing will go live in “the coming weeks” for invited players in Europe and North America.</p><p>As I write this, there’s a long queue to attempt to sign up for Battlefield Labs; there are just under 200,000 people ahead of me and my estimated wait time is “more than an hour.” EA <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1886450457800810928">says that</a> “your position in the registration queue does not affect your chances of being invited,” so if you don’t want to deal with the queue, you might want to wait a bit to try to register.</p><div><p>Battlefield Labs follows other early testing initiatives from EA like its work with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">new <em>Skate</em> game</a> and with the <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">Project Rene game in <em>The Sims</em> franchise</a>. But Battlefield Labs is also likely an attempt to avert another <em>Battlefield 2042</em> situation; that game had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">a rough launch</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">didn’t meet EA’s expectations</a>.</p></div><p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=shared">a video</a> accompanying the announcement, EA detailed how its “Battlefield Studios” – Dice (which created the franchise), Criterion (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882537/ea-criterion-battlefield">known for its racing games</a>), Motive (which worked <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review">on <em>Dead Space</em></a> and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23363085/ea-marvel-iron-man-game-motive-studio">making a new <em>Iron Man</em> game</a>), and Ripple Effect (which made <em>2042’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587667/battlefield-2042-portal-custom-game-modes-vehicles-weapons-maps-ea-play">Portal mode</a>) – are teaming up on the development of this next game, which will have single player and multiplayer modes. The series is under the oversight of Respawn Entertainment head Vince Zampella <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">following a shakeup</a> shortly after <em>2042’s</em> launch.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A co-founder of the Call of Duty studio Treyarch recently pleaded guilty to striking a firefighting plane with a drone during the recent LA fires. Under the plea deal, Peter T. Akemann will avoid the potential penalty of a year in prison and will instead perform 150 hours of community service, particularly in the area of Southern California's wildfire relief efforts. The deal also includes a $65,000 fine, the cost of repairing the firefighting plane in question.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plea agreement</a>, Akemann flew a drone over the area of the Palisades Fire while a "Super Scooper" water-dumping plane was conducting operations in the area. His drone struck the plane's wing, causing enough damage that it had to be grounded for a period of time.</p><p dir="ltr">US attorney Joseph McNally, one of the prosecutors on the case, released a statement noting that "flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations." He reiterated that those who do fly drones in those conditions will be arrested and prosecuted just like Akemann.</p><p dir="ltr">Akemann's camp released a statement stating that the co-founder is "deeply sorry" and "accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment." After co-founding Treyarch, Akemann parted way with the company more than 20 years ago. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604527/drone-crashed-into-la-wildfire-plane-plea-deal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge reports</a> that he recently departed his role as the president of Skydance Interactive and that his social media accounts have been scrubbed, including X and LinkedIn.  </p><p dir="ltr">Several major video game publishers have marshaled resources to help fight the LA fires, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-games-starts-in-game-event-to-raise-funds-for-la-fire-victims/1100-6528884/" data-ref-id="1100-6528884">Riot Games</a>, which implemented in-game fundraisers in League of Legends and Valorant.

			<p>A new trailer has been released by Bossa Games and Humble Games for Lost Skies, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-skies-is-an-open-world-co-op-game-based-on-worlds-adrift/">open-world cooperative PvE survival game</a> that takes place among floating islands. This game will be available during February's Steam Next Fest, where players will get to take part in a multiplayer demo. The demo is expansive, offering players the opportunity to play five to six hours of the game. Lost Skies is home to ancient ruins that can be explored, a fully customizable skyship, and intricate puzzles that need to be solved. If this sounds like something you're interested in, you can choose to play the game on your own and go solo, or you can team up with up to six friends. Check out the gameplay trailer below to see what you can expect from Lost Skies.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Skies: Cinematic Trailer | Bossa Studios ☁️" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVgbYFWSOZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of building a base on a planet or island, you have your very own Skyship that you can customize and evolve over time. You get to take your base around the world with you as you explore, helping you explore safely and gather any resources you may need. It will also help keep you safe against the elements and threats in the skies.</p>
<p>Compared to other survival games, Lost Skies is considered a "Survival Lite," allowing you to get to grips with the survival elements of the game without feeling like you're punished for not doing things in a certain order or grinding materials off the bat.</p>
<p>There will be tons to explore, from ruins, ancient civilizations, and colossal creatures that you will have to take down. There will be plenty of variety across the many floating islands in the sky, where you can use a grappling hook to interact with the world around you, also providing you with a way to traverse and soar through the sky.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're interested in, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist the title on Steam now</a> or try out the free-to-play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Island Creator</a>, where you can design your very own floating island that can be played. You can create your own island full of puzzles, traps, and stories. It's entirely up to you how you decorate and create your island, and it can then be released to other players via the Steam Workshop.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking his mind and sharing his opinions lately following his exit from Sony, and now he's discussed his thoughts on the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> reveal.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=ZW7DhH1Gh0st-zxp&amp;v=HtiJlzs0xRE&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax podcast</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-on-switch-2-reveal-i-was-surprised-there-werent-many-surprises/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Yoshida said the Switch 2 reveal event was underwhelming and that the only major surprise was the event's lack of surprises.</p><p>"I was surprised there were not many surprises," Yoshida said. "The only surprise to me was the mice thing that they showed."</p><p>Yoshida is referring to the sequence in the Switch 2 announcement trailer that showed the Switch 2's new Joy-Cons sliding across a surface like a computer mouse would. Yoshida said he hopes Nintendo uses the mouse controls for "some more weird, amazing way" that people won't see coming, as opposed to the control setup being used to play a game like Call of Duty on Switch 2.</p><p>Yoshida said he hopes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo's big Nintendo Direct in April</a> will "reveal something that's still hidden to us about Switch 2." He also addressed the string of leaks that preceded Nintendo's official Switch 2 announcement, saying he felt "very sorry" for Nintendo for the "disappointing" situation. A leak can ruin a good surprise, and Yoshida said he hopes for no further Switch 2 leaks.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that Yoshida said he was a "huge Nintendo fan," but ultimately wished the Switch 2 announcement "could have been a larger reveal."</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a> Yoshida left Sony on January 15, 2025 after more than 30 years with the company.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-set-to-air-later-this-month-report/1100-6529189/" data-ref-id="1100-6529189">next State of Play event could happen very soon.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-acquires-tracabs-advanced-tracking-technology-for-ea-sports-titles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>it's been announced today that Electronic Arts has acquired TRACAB's Advanced Tracking Technology to help provide a more accurate and precise experience in its EA SPORTS titles. The company has reached an agreement to acquire TRACAB Technologies, a leader in advanced sports optical tracking and analysis solutions. This will prove to be highly beneficial for the future EA SPORTS titles, where it plans to leverage the power of TRACAB's technology, where it will be able to utilize advanced AI, machine learning, and real-time sports data to create realistic animation and provide an experience that is lifelike and similar to the real-world action of sports.</p>
<p>"Our EA SPORTS games are becoming living, breathing simulations of sport, and TRACAB's cutting-edge technology and expertise in real-time data capture and analysis will enable us to enhance realism, immersion, and engagement in all our experiences," says Cam Weber, President of EA SPORTS.</p>
<p>While the company has acquired the technologies, EA SPORTS is looking ahead at how it will be able to utilize TRACAB beyond games, looking into the company's vision for the EA SPORTS app to be the leading interactive sports platform in the world. It's been said by Electronic Arts that the acquisition is expected to close in EA's first fiscal quarter of FY26. The company's sports titles have been incredibly popular, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> being an instant hit.</p>
<p>"Joining EA SPORTS marks an exciting new chapter for TRACAB Technologies. Our mission has always been to push the boundaries of sports data and analysis, and with EA SPORTS' vast resources and vision for innovation, we're confident that we can create even more immersive and dynamic experiences for sports fans around the world," says Martin Brogren, GM of TRACAB Technologies.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with TRACAB Technologies, the technology utilized by the company tracks almost everything that is happening on the field or pitch at 60Hz per second. That means it's generating 600 million data points per game, as well as 65 unique data points per player and referee. It does this by capturing live skeleton data from 21 joints on each body on the pitch.</p>
<p>Doing this provides a new sense of realism for the player and can allow for more dynamic animation and real-time simulation, and it will prove to be incredibly beneficial for Electronic Arts when developing its new sports games.</p>
<p>Aside from the games being made by the company, combining the game engine with the work of TRACAB's Technologies aims to provide fans with new opportunities to create highlights and predictive simulations that they can upload on the EA SPORTS App.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-the-ea-sports-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA SPORTS App</a> is only available in Spain, but there are plans to expand it and make it available in other regions across the globe.</p>

And why does it pop up not just once, but <em>twice </em>in the 15-second clip? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106">As announced last February</a></span>, Marvel’s upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766">MCU</a></span> reboot of the Fantastic Four is set to hit theaters this July.

Since that announcement last year, we’ve not seen much else of <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>. But that changed today with a small teaser that also contains a really annoying sound effect. </p><p>On February 3, Marvel teased a trailer because it’s 2025 and that’s just a normal thing we have to deal with now. In the short teaser we see some kids running and laughing as they try to cram themselves in front of an array of TVs in the display window of a 1960's store. The televisions are preparing to show a rocket launch involving Marvel’s famous family. I hope nothing bad happens! We’ll see more in the full trailer tomorrow. </p><p>But instead of enjoying this little teaser for the new <em>Fantastic Four </em>movie, I was distracted immediately by a sound effect I’ve heard oh so many times before. You’ve undoubtedly heard this sound effect, too. It’s a group of kids laughing in a weird, somewhat unnatural way and it’s popped up in games, movies, TV shows, commercials, trailers, and songs. </p><p>This sound effect is known as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Group Kids Laug PE143601</a></span>" and was found on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Premiere Edition Volume 1</a></span> sound effects library produced by Hollywood Edge in 1990. This sound effect, which was originally recorded in 1983 for <em>Indiana Jones and the</em> <em>Temple of Doom</em>, has appeared in a very long list of movies, TV shows, and more since it was added to that sound effect library in the ‘90s. And weirdly, it keeps getting used decades later. Here’s a clip from the Netflix animated show <em>Wonderoos</em> that contains the laughing kids: </p><p>Apparently, this effect (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598">like the Wilhelm Scream</a></span>) has just become a standard option for sound engineers and designers in Hollywood. As someone who instantly recognizes this sound effect the moment it pops up in a movie or game, its continued use in 2025 is annoying. </p><p>And to bring this back to the <em>Fantastic Four</em> teaser, I’m honestly shocked and perplexed that the marketing folks behind it decided to include the effect twice in such a short clip. I’d bet money that in the full movie this sound effect won’t be used twice in such a short timespan (it might not even appear at all) as it’s really distracting and noticeable when it plays back to back like that. </p><p>Anyway, I guess I’ll listen out for this annoying sound effect when<em> Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> arrives in theaters on July 25, 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Grand Theft Auto V actor Ned Luke, who played Michael in the incredibly popular game, has spoken out about his thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. He said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKXTE2S5mM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fall Damage</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1886459125304799531" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Dexerto</a>) that he's confident the game will be "fantastic," going on to say no one ever knows what to expect from Rockstar Games, and that's part of the reason why he's so eager to see what the studio is cooking up.</p><p>"You never know what Rockstar is going to do," he said. "What I tell people is, be patient. It's going to be worth the wait. From what I've seen, it's going to be amazing. They're going to blow our [GTA V] numbers away."</p><p>By "numbers," Luke was referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gtav-generates-800-million-in-24-hours/1100-6414611/" data-ref-id="1100-6414611">$800 million that GTA V earned in its first 24 hours back in 2013.</a> Luke said he expects GTA VI to make $1.3 billion in its first day.</p><p>Before this, DFC Intelligence said it was expecting GTA VI to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">40 million copes and earn $3.2 billion in its first year</a>, including $1 billion from preorder revenue alone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKXTE2S5mM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vUKXTE2S5mM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also in the interview, Luke pointed out how his character, Michael, has never been brought back to GTA Online. GTA V's other two main characters, Trevor (Steven Ogg) and Franklin (Shawn Fonteno), did come to GTA Online. A piece of GTA Online DLC revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-new-dlc-confirms-michael-is-still-alive-after-gta-5-story/1100-6499135/" data-ref-id="1100-6499135">Michael is still alive after the events of GTA V</a>, and this has led many to believe Rockstar might eventually release new GTA Online DLC that focuses on or at least includes Michael.</p><p>If Luke knows the answer, he's not revealing any secrets.</p><p>"If you look at GTA Online, for example, Michael hasn't been back on GTA Online. Maybe he's coming in a final DLC? Maybe he's not. Maybe [Michael, Franklin, and Trevor will be] in GTA 6, like [its online mode]. Maybe. Maybe not. You know Rockstar is not going to tell you anything. And if we say anything, you know they will not be very happy," Luke said.</p><p>Ogg, who played Trevor in GTA V, said previously that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-trevor-actor-wants-a-very-definitive-exit-in-gta-6/1100-6529064/" data-ref-id="1100-6529064">he wants his character to show up in GTA VI and then immediately get killed.</a></p><p>In other news, there is said to be "hope" by some in the video game industry that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA VI will cost as much as $100</a>, with other publishers raising prices as well to help the video game industry rebound. While some might want that, not everyone does, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">one prominent researcher believes the game will be $70.</a></p><p>GTA VI's first trailer was released in December 2023, and since then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">Rockstar has not said a word about the game</a>, while management at parent company Take-Two has only discussed the game at a very high level. That's expected to happen again this week, when Take-Two reports earnings on February 6.</p><p>GTA VI is set for release in Fall 2025, but some believe the game will be delayed to 2026. After all, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar Games release in the past 10 years has been delayed</a>, so it would be a break from tradition if the game is <em>not </em>delayed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-isnt-as-muscular-as-part-2s-because-it-doesnt-play-as-big-of-a-role-in-this-version<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Actor Kaityln Dever did not have to bulk up for her role as Abby in the upcoming second season of The Last of Us, despite her counterpart in Part 2 being known for her muscular physique. </p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/kaitlyn-dever-abby-the-last-of-us-didnt-need-muscles-exclusive-8784835">Entertainment Weekly</a>, The Last of Us showrunner Neil Druckmann noted that Abby in the game was able to maneuver through the world like Joel "in the way she can physically manhandle certain things". This is different from Ellie, who has a smaller and lighter frame. However, this kind of "brute" like manoeuvrability isn't so essential for Abby when it comes to the show. </p>
<p>"There's not as much violent action moment to moment," Druckmann explained. "It's more about the drama. I'm not saying there's no action here. It's just, again, different priorities and how you approach it," he continued, adding "[Dever] has the spirit of the game in her".</p>

</figure>
<p>
The Last of Us team "value performance over anything else", he added, and prioritised capturing "the essence" of a role, rather than just finding someone who looked like a carbon copy of the video game character.</p>
<p>"What I always loved about the idea was that you are going to continually be challenged as you were in season one," Druckmann furthered. "When you try to pick a hero, it's tough because we're human beings, we're not heroes. For every heroic act, there's someone who suffers on the other side who may see you reasonably as a villain. When you look at Kaitlyn, there's just something in her eyes where, even no matter what she's experiencing, you connect.</p><p>"It was important that we found somebody that we could connect to the way we connect to Bella [Ramsey, who plays Ellie]," Druckmann continued, adding the team would have "struggled to find someone as good as Kaitlyn" to play Abby.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, fellow The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin believes the second season will provide an "amazing opportunity... to delve into someone who is perhaps physically more vulnerable than the Abby in the game, but whose spirit is stronger... And then the question is, 'Where does her formidable nature come from and how does it manifest?' That's something that will be explored now and later."</p>

<p><a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-creators-set-stage-dense-episodes-season-2-exclusive-8783868">Elsewhere in the same conversation</a>, The Last of Us' showrunners hinted at how the team will adapt Part 2's story for TV in terms of its narrative structure. </p>
<p>"A big part of the theme of the second game is about perspective, how someone's hero could be someone else's villain and vice versa. It's weird to talk about a story where its structure could be a spoiler," Druckmann said. "I don't even know if it's worth mentioning where we landed because I think that's part of the fun for people familiar with the game to see how we approached that challenge in the show. I will just say that we gave it a lot of thought and tried different things. There are some deviations of where we place things."</p><p>Mazin added: "We certainly are going to mess around with time the way it was in the source material, but as Neil said, we messed around in ways that we felt were appropriate for the show.... When I say 'messed around', I mean scientifically determined in a narrative way what we thought would be most impactful."</p>
<p>This 'messing around' will also include the introduction of new characters, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara's still to be officially named role</a>. And there's another character mentioned who doesn't directly feature in the game who's set to show up during The Last of Us' season two.</p>
<p>"There is a pretty prominent character that is talked a lot about in the game, similar to what we did with Frank [Murray Bartlett] in season one, that is in this season," the showrunners teased. "There's a very, very cool casting that I hope we can talk about soon."</p>
<p>I personally have a theory as to who this will be, which I will post in the comments section below with a spoiler tag.</p>

<p>Immediately I was struck by how gorgeous the environment is and how realistic the people are. Small facial tweaks, wrinkles, and blemishes are present on almost every character you meet no matter their importance. The care in designing a beautiful game is fully apparent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the opening sequence of events, you'll be able to explore the first map to your hearts content. There are a plethora of side quests, tasks, and treasures to find in the great outdoors. On top of that, there are dice to play and shooting competitions to partake in. I easily could have spent 20 or more hours honing my skills before even moving forward in the main storyline. Things get complicated when you do progress in the story, as Capon and Henry are able to meet von Bergow, only to get thrust onto the frontlines of the war raging across the region.</p>

<p>The expansiveness continues into the second map, where the side quests can rival the time spent for the main quests. This region is larger than the first, with bigger settlements and more points of interest. Here, you'll find plenty of action, whether it be defeating enemy soldiers, exploring mining tunnels, high-stakes dice games, or poaching a variety of game.</p>

<p>The main story has you stealing from the king, racing after a member of the church from Rome, and slaughtering all the enemy soldiers you can handle. For those looking for the best bang for their buck, you'll definitely be able to dive into Bohemia for at least 60 hours, getting the most for your money.&nbsp;</p>

The story is consistent, covers multiple plot points across the various characters, and the dialogue is well-developed. Characters have unique personalities, with Dry Devil being a angry drunk, Adder being consistently aroused, Otto von Bergow being a silver-tongued politician, and Katherine being the world-weary woman. Hans Capon shows the most growth throughout the game, starting as a spoiled noble who makes senseless decisions at the cost of others and transforming into a thoughtful noble who cares for those under his wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quality of the story isn't just apparent in the cutscenes and major dialogue, but also woven into the environment of the world. Passing villagers will remark on current events, nobles will discuss political choices you've made around dinner tables, and the town crier will shout out what city was last razed. The information available in the codex reflects the historical research done by the development team and this reflects in the daily life of the people.</p>

<p>The downfall to this relates to the choices you have. While you make different decisions that can affect dialogue or reputation, the impact on the main story is negligible. The largest is whether to burn down a village or not, which can dictate access to side quests later on, but doesn't do anything besides that. For the most part, the choices you're offered only relate to the summary of the actions you receive at the end of the story. From a design perspective, it makes sense, but from a player perspective, I wished the choices had more weight in the story outcome.&nbsp;</p>

There are a few bugs throughout, like missing item names, typos, and glitching through walls. This will affect certain players more than others, especially those with older PC setups. The bugs, however, didn't affect overall gameplay and were more cosmetic than anything else. The most notable issue is when you meet Zizka for the first time as Godwin, as the audio and subtitles do not match. This occurs one other time towards the endgame, but is an easy fix that Warhorse Studios can quickly address.</p><p>
The biggest issue comes with the controls. Both keyboard and mouse and controller don't quite feel 100% smooth. Some things, like general gameplay and horseback riding, are better with a controller. Others, like selecting weapons or items, feel better with a mouse. Both encounter issues with pickpocketing, which can cause you to fail the minigame due to slow reactions and having to consistently use a button to move the selector to the next item. This can also impact potion making, which requires multiple timed stages that can be thrown out of sync due to slow movements.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>&nbsp;is a solid game with tons of content available to play through. This alone makes it worth the purchase, but the stellar narrative work and visual design make it an RPG that fans of the genre should check out, regardless of having experienced the first in the series. Many of the issues with the title can be addressed through future updates, with the controls being the largest problem players may consistently have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a new interview with HBO’s The Last Of Us Season 2 showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, it’s been revealed that the timeline will be slightly different from the games source material.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-creators-set-stage-dense-episodes-season-2-exclusive-8783868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Druckmann said that there’s from “deviations of where we place things” in terms of the shows timeline compared to that of the game because of how a show has its own challenges.</p>



<p>We certainly are going to mess around with time the way it was in the source material, but as Neil said, we messed around in ways that we felt were appropriate for the show,” Mazin continued. </p>



<p>Of course, it’s impossible to know exactly what Mazin and Druckmann are referring to here, but fans familiar with the second game will know that a considerable character death does occur. In theory, it would make sense to keep said character alive for as long as possible, especially because the showrunners want it to continue well past season 3.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>“I think it’s pretty likely that our story will extend past a season 3,” Mazin says. “How far past? I can’t say. And that’s not to say that there are not other stories that could be told, but this story is the one that Neil and I are telling.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-last-of-us-season-2-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Season 2</a> will have seven episodes, with the showrunners promising “high-calorie, dense episodes.” Mazin went on to say that “each one of these episodes packs quite a wallop. You will not be bored.”</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 2 is scheduled to release sometime in April 2025, but no exact release date has yet been given.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the show? What do you think the showrunners did to mess around with the The Last of Us Season 2 timeline?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/battlefield-labs-is-a-community-playtest-collab-for-the-next-battlefield/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has announced Battlefield Labs, a community collaboration project aiming to get direct feedback and shape the development of the next Battlefield by a group of studios that includes Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios – now under the collective name of Battlefield Studios.</p>
<p>The announcement video also gave us a very brief first look at the next Battlefield game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Battlefield Labs testing will go live in the coming weeks and sign ups are now live at<a href="http://battlefield.com/labs"> battlefield.com/labs</a>. Initial tests will be invite only and use players and servers in Europe and North America, before expanding in future waves. Taking part does require signing an NDA, so no public chit-chat will be happening until EA is good and ready to talk about the game some more.</p>
<p>DICE will remain primarily responsible for the game engine and the multiplayer side of the game, while the focus for Criterion has been on the single player – returning for this game after skipping Battlefield 2042. They’re being supported by Motive with multiplayer maps and single player content, while Ripple Effect is working on “an experience that is really going to open Battlefield to a whole group of new players”, but Senior Producer Ryan McArthur.</p>

<p>It’s curious to see how this group has been brought together, as while the Battlefield Studios brand is new, the collaboration between these studios is familiar – all uniting on a single game project is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/03/ea-announced-plans-for-connected-battlefield-universe-in-franchise-leadership-shakeup/">a far cry from the Battlefield universe that was envisioned back in 2021</a>. Criterion has often been brought in to assist, working on vehicular content for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/13/star-wars-battlefront-ii-review/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, the Firestorm battle royale mode for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/13/battlefield-v-review/">Battlefield V</a>, and was dragged away from Need for Speed to help with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/15/battlefield-2042-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-ps4-pc/">Battlefield 2042</a>. Motive’s closest ties to the franchise has been with creating the single player for Battlefront II – it’s a little unexpected to see them seemingly take a supporting role to Criterion on this.</p>
<p>Lastly there’s Ripple Effect, formerly known as DICE LA, and a part of the Battlefield 2042 development group creating Battlefield Portal, which transported classic Battlefield games, maps and modes into the new engine. A really fascinating side to the game that was one of the highlights from its launch. It’s not clear what they’re working on for the next Battlefield, but expect some kind of adjacent genre, if they’re looking to attract a new audience.</p>

		
		

<p>The video caps off with a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG. Is it possible that we’ll get the full building destruction back from Bad Company 2?</p>

The sequel expands on the first game with a bigger, more detailed world that includes new gameplay systems and a lengthier script. Does all of this extra stuff coalesce into something compelling and meaningful?</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>VGC</em>’s Jordan Middler</a></span>, the larger mix still feels cohesive and intentional in a way the first game’s did not. “This is Warhorse Studios’ <em>Witcher 3</em> moment,” he writes in his five-star review. “<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>is an extremely confident, accomplished, dirty, hilarious, and massively enjoyable RPG. The game tries a lot of things and executes on almost all of them very well, and its commitment to being ruthless must be applauded.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em>’s Katharine Castle</a></span> was similarly impressed but less in love with the finished product. “There’s a lot to admire here, sure, but you have to do so on its own terms,” she writes in her three-out-of-five star review. “It is a hard and maddening slog at times, but one that still has its moments where it surprises and quietly delights. Like the original, this isn’t an RPG designed to make you feel good - you continue to be little more than a passenger in this historical tapestry, following along behind the horse tails of Henry’s betters, and clearing up the mess they leave behind. Some will revel in that work, but I for one won’t be chomping at the bit for another sequel any time soon.”</p><p>Early reviews make <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> sound like its side quests and the way they’re woven together across its big world are a highlight, while combat remains a bit underwhelming, and text-heavy menus make navigating and learning about some of the systems a chore.

And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it’s not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn’t get in the way of the other, and you’re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot.

Not everyone will vibe with its slow-paced and oftentimes tedious approach, but those willing to meet it on its own terms will find a compelling open-world RPG that relishes in player agency and the consequences of your actions.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h41856"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>While a few failures trigger a “game over”, many produce scenarios as winding and gratifying as any victory, and in any case, living life in Henry’s shoes has taught me to take the rain with the shine.

But after a series of mandatory plot skirmishes, my Henry has become a proficient and well-appointed combatant, because that is what KCD2 fundamentally requires him to be.

Rather, it relies on several factors, such as my standing within a community and even the dirt or blood on my clothing.

Combat is a strange dance of positioning both your hands and feet relative to those of your enemies, and charging into the fray even in the late game is liable to get you cut apart. Want to equip a hauberk without first equipping a padded gambeson beneath it? What are you—some kind of moron?﻿</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it’s the first time it’s been given the full high-definition treatment. The game certainly looks better than ever, though it’s worth noting there are no meaningful changes to the gameplay added in this version. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196766,195755" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> is your first time experiencing this classic platformer—or you’re returning to it many years later—you’re probably curious how long it takes to complete. You don’t have to search any further for the answer because we’ve got all the answers to every question ever asked in the history of the Earth. Well, okay, maybe not. But we can tell you how long it takes to beat <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>.</p><p><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> is no breezy platformer. Even in its easier Modern Mode—which grants you an extra heart and gives Cranky’s shop some additional items—this Kong adventure serves up some truly tough challenges to overcome. With that being said, dying is nearly inevitable for all but the most hardened platforming masters, so an average playthrough of the main story can take anywhere from <strong>10-15 hours </strong>depending on your skill.</p><p>Of course, completionists can expect to spend significantly more time with <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> thanks to the return of the franchise’s K-O-N-G letter collectibles. These offer tons of hidden puzzle pieces, and time trials for every level. Moreover, fully completing the game one time will unlock Mirror Mode, which tasks you with replaying flipped versions of every level. Seeing all of this through can take between <strong>25-35 hours</strong>—again, depending on your skill.</p><p>Now that you know how long it’ll take to tackle <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, go bananas and have a great time! <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
