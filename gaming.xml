            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, White Owls announced the release window of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hotel-barcelona-suda-51-swery-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HOTEL BARCELONA</a>. The new game from revered creators Hidetaka 'Swery' Suehiro (Deadly Premonition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-good-life-team-dog-or-team-cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Life</a>) and Goichi 'Suda51' Suda (Killer7, No More Heroes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows of the Damned</a>, Lollipop Chainsaw, Let It Die) will be available in September for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. </p>



<p> The game is a 2.5D sidescroller/slasher featuring roguelite and action game elements. It is set in a mysterious hotel, located in a remote location on the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border. Its luxurious appearance hides a terrifying truth—it’s a trap for America’s most dangerous serial killers. Players step into the role of Justine, a rookie federal marshal with a deadly secret—her mind is connected to Dr. Carnival, a deranged murderer with a violent past. Together, Justine and Dr. Carnival must eliminate the Seven Slash Killers and try to survive long enough to escape.</p>



<p>Hotel Barcelona has seven unique explorable areas, each inspired by a different subgenre of horror, such as haunted mansions or twisted laboratories. Each zone features an unforgettable boss battle.</p>

<iframe title="HOTEL BARCELONA - Dr Carnival Steam Next Fest Trailer 2025 | A new game from SWERY &amp; Suda51" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rfgsl6E0XsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Each time Justine dies, a memory of her past self is born. These echoes, known as Slasher Phantoms, mimic the previous run's movements and can harm enemies. Clever players may use them as shields, allies, or distractions. Thus, with each failure, their strength increases.</p>



<p>The game even supports an online multiplayer mode that can be unlocked. Up to three players can team up in co-op mode to work together to complete missions and survive the hotel's murderous inhabitants. For those seeking a more competitive thrill, PvP mode allows a fourth player to invade your world, where you can hunt or be hunted in a brutal game of cat and mouse.</p>



<p>HOTEL BARCELONA is playable at BitSummit XIII: Summer of Yōkai, Japan's largest indie game festival. From July 18 to 20 at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto, attendees can experience the game's opening section, including its brutal first boss, Jacob, a baseball-obsessed serial killer rumored to strike every few years at the nearby baseball field of the hotel.</p>

Four of the levels are titled Twin-Frog Trouble, Suck It Up, Handhold Havoc, High Inflation, with Team Asobi keeping the name of the fifth as a surprise. The addition of the new levels brings Astro Bot's total level count to over 90.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer teased in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that completing the new galaxy "might lead to something really cool," so players will have to dive in and see what surprises are in store.</p><p dir="ltr">It wouldn't be an Astro Bot update without new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/astro-bot-all-cameo-bots-and-secret-characters-list/2900-5754/" data-ref-id="2900-5754">Special Bot cameo appearances</a>, and now we know a few that players can discover.

Another fan-favorite character, 2B from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nier-automata/" data-ref-id="5000-438557">NieR: Automata</a>, can also be found. Players had long wondered why no Square-Enix, and more specifically why no Final Fantasy characters, were present in Astro Bot at launch, so it's nice to see some finally included.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new levels, Sony as part of its June State of Play announced a new limited-edition Astro Bot DualSense controller, one with a slightly different expression from a previous Astro Bot controller. That controller is still not available for preorder, though Sony said it will launch later this year and that it would have more information to share soon.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-gets-ps5-pro-support-and-new-levels-starting-today/1100-6529484/" data-ref-id="1100-6529484">Astro Bot received PlayStation 5 Pro support</a> and new, more challenging levels back in February.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has announced it will discontinue its Switch Game Vouchers service in January. The program launched in 2019 and allowed users to purchase a pair of digital tickets that could be redeemed on two select digital Switch games, usually at a cheaper overall price than if they were bought traditionally.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7piZNI98ODk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7piZNI98ODk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html">FAQ page</a> on the matter states that vouchers will remain available for purchase until January 30, 2026. Purchased vouchers are valid for one year (365 days) from the date of purchase. So even if you buy vouchers on the final day they're available, they will still be usable until January 30, 2027.</p><p>New Switch games will continue to be added to the list of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0">eligible Game Voucher titles</a>, even after January 30, Nintendo confirms. This means those who own vouchers past the cutoff date can still expect to have new games to redeem them for – and you probably should use them, as purchased vouchers cannot be refunded.</p><p>Game Vouchers cost $99.98, and since they can be redeemed for two full-priced games (usually at $59.99), customers could save a decent bit of money. They are only eligible for Switch 1 games, including The Legend of Zelda: <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights">Tears of the Kingdom</a>/<a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild/b/switch/archive/2017/03/02/game-informer-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.aspx">Breath of the Wild</a>/<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/pulled-in-two-directions">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pikmin-4/mans-best-friends">Pikmin 4</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/getting-its-flowers">Super Mario Bros.

And two of the new bots are from a series that had previously gone unrepresented in the game, despite being beloved by PlayStation fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't want it spoiled, we'll just say that you can unlock one of these bots by rescuing it from the challenge level High Inflation, while the second bot comes only after you beat all five brand new challenge levels in the Vicious Void Galaxy and rescue the other bots inside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> We're going to spoil exactly who all the bots in the DLC are below the video, so if you don't want to know, get outta here!</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The two bots in question are Cloud and Sephiroth, both from Final Fantasy 7. Cloud is the reward from High Inflation, and Sephiroth shows up if you beat all five new challenge levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy representation, and specifically from 7, has been long-requested by Astro Bot fans. The game launched with a whopping 173 bot cameos from PlayStation history, so the lack of Final Fantasy 7 — a game traditionally associated with PlayStation both in its original and remake forms — was surprising. When asked at the time, Astro Bot developers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-says-we-really-respect-the-choice-of-each-publisher-amid-final-fantasy-cameo-absence">attributed this to the choice of publisher partners</a>, meaning it sounds like Square Enix wasn't previously willing to play ball. But it seems the company has changed its tune more recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cloud and Sephiroth aren't the only bots you'll find in the new DLC, and not even the only Square Enix representation. In fact, it sounds like Square was happy to hand over several cameos, with 2B from Nier: Automata and Serge from Chrono Cross also showing up to be rescued. Atsu from Ghost of Yōtei also shows up, though we already knew she'd be in this update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot has received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dlc-arrives-today-as-first-of-5-new-expansions-coming-to-the-playstation-platformer">a number of special challenge stage updates</a> since launch, and it's no surprise Team Asobi was able to give it that extra love given how well-received the game has been. It <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">sold 1.5 million units in just its first two months</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">earned a 9/10 from us</a>. "A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation," our reviewer wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> developer Rare has broadcast a frank and revealing hour-long discussion about the future of its long-running pirate live-service game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">just a week after the studio was hit by layoffs</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">cancellation of its long-gestating next project, Everwild</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention of the layoffs in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sea of Thieves Community Direct broadcast</a>, which instead focused squarely on Rare's plans for Sea of Thieves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These plans include a revamped approach to new seasons, the launch of subscription-funded custom servers, and detail on how the studio will improve the game's overall health and performance. Overall, the message here was that Rare was committed to Sea of Thieves for the forseeable future — with a mention at one point of the team thinking about the next "five years."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of the game's overall health and performance, production director Drew Stevens shared a frank appraisal of how Rare had previously struggled to ensure the quality of new features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've felt like we're always on the back foot," Stevens said. "With a lot of areas, we felt we're a little bit slow to react. We don't have the necessary resource or team structure to allow us to jump straight back and to start to address some of those things that we're seeing, whether it's around quality control and shipping features at a place that we're just not quite happy with, to game performance, like slowly being in a place where we're adding new features to the game but performance over time is degrading, through to game security. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel like we were too slow to react as cheating started to build in the PC community, and there's a couple of areas around that — even just long-standing bugs, and our ability to go and address that stuff alongside features," Stevens continued. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think if I summarise it, it is that almost... we're on the back foot and I want to get us into a place where we've got teams in place, we've got structures in place, we can just be a bit more reactive and then get into a place where we're proactive," Stevens concluded. "[Where] we're actually shipping features and we're knowing the performance of them so we feel more comfortable as a team when we're shipping updates."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, creative director Mike Chapman said Rare's team would focus on being more consistent with new content, while simultaneously ensuring that existing features were not ignored. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sea of Thieves' team dedicated to game health was growing, Chapman said, and had now been split to ensure there were dedicated staff working on the quality of new features, while others were focused on improving longer-term issues. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sea of Thieves -- Season 7 Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 17, the game's next big update, will debut a new three-month model for new content. This will begin with an initial month of additions primarily designed to refresh the game's sandbox, before its second month focuses on expanding the game's live events. The season's final month will then serve as a 'call to action' to bring players back for a big world event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next season, which has a smuggling focus, will see the arrival of new hideouts, Smugglers' Runs shipping routes, plus fresh smuggler cargo in shipwrecks and skeleton ships. The Reaper's Rowboat also returns - and all of this will come in the season's first month, as part of that desire by Rare to reinvigorate the game's sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Month two's live event focus will offer up a heist experience at Royal Crest Fortress, before the season concludes with fresh happenings at Skeleton Forts, now with a Reaper focus thanks to the return of Captain Flameheart, and the need to both attack and defend the locations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This three-month season model will persist, Rare said, and would help ensure seasons stay fresh throughout rather than simply offering one big drop of content at the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, Rare teased that Season 18 will update the Devil's Roar area and pick up the story of the mysterious Dark Ancients. Fans will encounter the faction as threats and uncover hidden shrines.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/sea-of-thieves-community-direct-july-2025-18-59-screenshot-1752161759422.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sea of Thieves production director Drew Stevens.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last big announcement today was saved for Custom Seas, Sea of Thieves' plans for custom servers with "switches and toggles" so players can fully curate their experience. Footage of this showed a user spawning ships, overruling crew limits, setting weather conditions and even toggling the kraken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another addition here will be the ability to operate a cinematic camera, which will be handy for budding pirate film-makers. Custom Seas will debut in "early 2026," Rare said, and would require a subscription so that work on the feature can be funded and continue long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other details mentioned today include a decision to lift the NDA attached to Sea of Thieves' early access Insider Program, meaning members will soon be able to openly discuss and even stream work-in-progress features. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was mention, too, of a mysterious Sea of Thieves sub-team of developers working on long-term oppurtunities for the game, described as a "multi-year vision" to grow the overall scope of the title outside of seasonal updates. More detail on that will come in the next Community Direct, Rare said, which will arrive on a roughly six-monthly schedule. Mark your calendars for early 2026 for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SAG-AFTRA members under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA), the contract under which video game companies hire voice actors for their games have overwhelmingly voted to approve the new version of the contract that had been negotiated for the last three years, officially bringing an end to the strike that began in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">July 2024</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-video-game-agreement">SAG-AFTRA announced</a> that the deal, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-reaches-tentative-deal-with-video-game-companies-voice-actors-strike-might-be-coming-to-an-end/">tentatively reached last month</a> and marked a suspension of the strike, was approved after 95.04% of members voted 'Yes' to ratifying the deal, with only 4.96% of members voting 'No.'</p>



<p>The core issue that kept negotiations going for so long, and that kicked off the strike, revolved around generative AI tools and actors wanting to ensure they would be protected against video game companies abusing the technology to use actors' voices and likenesses without properly compensating the actors and without the actors' consent. This new deal includes a pay raise for actors, but more significantly, it includes the protections that SAG-AFTRA members and contract negotiators were hoping to achieve.</p>



<p>"<em>The new contract also accomplishes performer safety guardrails and gains around A.I., including consent and disclosure requirements for A.I. digital replica use and the ability for performers to suspend consent for generation of new material during a strike</em>," SAG-AFTRA's statement on the deals ratification reads. </p>



<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said on the deal's approval, "<em>I commend the strong leadership of Interactive Media Agreement negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh, who remained steadfast through three years of hard bargaining while facing many challenging headwinds during a challenging negotiating cycle. This deal achieves important progress around A.I. protections, and progress is the name of the game! My sincere respect goes out to the entire video game performer community and their allies for their solidarity during the strike which provided the necessary leverage to secure this deal's many essential gains</em>."</p>



<p>Chief negotiator and SAG-AFTRA national executive director, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added, "<em>All of us at SAG-AFTRA would like to extend our deepest appreciation to the video game performers and allies who endured a great deal of sacrifice through the 11-month strike. I'd also like to express my sincerest gratitude to the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee, and its chair, Sarah Elmaleh, who have worked tirelessly for nearly three years in order to achieve these necessary gains and protections alongside our negotiating staff and lead negotiator Ray Rodriguez.</em>"</p>



<p>For the part of the video game companies like Take-Two, Activision, PlayStation, EA, and more on the other side of the aisle, spokesperson Audrey Cooling said, "<em>We are pleased that SAG-AFTRA members have ratified a new Interactive Media Agreement, which delivers historic wage increases, industry-leading A.I. protections, and enhanced health and safety measures for performers. We look forward to building on our industry's decades-long partnership with the union and continuing to create groundbreaking entertainment experiences for billions of players worldwide.</em>"</p>



<p>Now that the agreement has been ratified, actors under the IMA won't have to worry about another potential strike or negotiating period for at least a few years.  The conclusion of the strike also means that we won't have to see any games delayed due to companies not being able to hire actors to cast in their games.</p>

(<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-prime-character-special-stats-lucy-1851411135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-prime-character-special-stats-lucy-1851411135">The mobile game got a tiny tie-in update.</a></span>) This time around, it sounds like Bethesda has some actual crossover plans with the show and at least one game. </p><p> “We’re always focused on the game,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fallout 76</em> creative director Jon Rush told <em>Variety</em>.</a></span> “I think a distinct trait of the ‘<em>Fallout 76’</em> game is that we’re the furthest back in time. And it’s kind of funny, because the [<em>Fallout </em>show] is the furthest into the future. So there’s a lot of room where we don’t necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories, that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple.”</p><p>Rush explained that the show is “great” at telling a <em>Fallout </em>story as it is made by “big fans” of the franchise. As such, the games and shows go “together really well.” And that brings people from the Amazon series to the games. And some of these people will likely be expecting some content from the series, which Rush teased might be happening. </p><p>“Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it’s stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there,” said Rush. “I’m not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another.” </p><p>So I doubt Lucy will appear in <em>Fallout 76</em>, the timeline doesn’t support it. And fans are already mad about the <em>Fallout</em> timeline as it is. But it does sound like everyone involved with the show and games understands this time around how huge the series is and that doing some crossover content would be smart. There have been rumors for a while now about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>or <em>New Vegas</em> remaster. And season two of <em>Fallout </em>will feature New Vegas. Hmmm... something to think about. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-fallout-76-crossover-new-vegas-update-1851786026]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica-2/" data-ref-id="5000-647677">Subnautica 2</a> was rumored to be delayed following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">the reportedly forced exits of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> by parent company Krafton. Now, Unknown Worlds has officially delayed Subnautica 2's early-access period to 2026. However, the studio also shared a new trailer for the game to tide over fans.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK5Nr1VtJ9Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oK5Nr1VtJ9Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a post on <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the developer's official site</a>, Unknown Worlds attributes the delay to a desire to improve "a few areas" following a private beta test out of a desire to make the game stronger. The devs also stated that the delay will allow Unknown Worlds to include additional biomes, vehicle upgrades, more tools and creatures, and an expanded story.</p><p>Subnautica 2's ousted director and designer Charlie Cleveland recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">his belief that Subnautica 2 is ready</a> for early-release now. A report earlier this week indicated that the delay may be due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">a $250 million bonus that Krafton was supposed to pay Unknown Worlds</a> if the company reached certain financial thresholds this year. Without Subnautica 2's early-access release, Unknown Worlds is unlikely to reach that goal in 2025.</p><p>That's why the YouTube comments under Subnautica 2's latest trailer are filled with remarks urging Krafton to pay the $250 million bonus instead of focusing on the game itself. Whether that show of support for the devs will achieve its goal remains to be seen.</p><p>Subnautica 2 will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Full Reveal Presentation</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">That's not the only difficulty change coming in the update. It will additionally introduce specific settings for player combat damage and enemy combat damage, allowing players to further fine tune their experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 1.2 is currently only available via Steam Beta (which players can opt into), but will be rolling out to all players at a later date. No specific release date was given for when the update will arrive for other platforms. To download the Steam Beta update, follow the steps below.</p><ol><li dir="ltr">Open your Steam Library and navigate to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li><li dir="ltr">Right click on "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered" and select "Properties"</li><li dir="ltr">In the new properties pop-up window, select "Betas"</li><li dir="ltr">In the beta drop down to opt into, select "\[beta]"</li><li dir="ltr">Wait for app to download new build and launch</li></ol><p>Oblivion Remastered's level-scaling and difficulty have been a major discussion point following its release. Early difficulties like Novice and Apprentice feel too easy, as does the default difficulty of Adept in many cases. However, making the jump to Expert can make it so combat quickly becomes a slog, with enemies capable of withstanding dozens of hits and enemies dealing significantly more damage to players. A middle ground between the two difficulties is a welcome solution.</p><p>Some performance optimizations are also coming alongside the new difficulty options. The patch notes state the update will reduce the "frequency of hitches in the open world" and brings improvements to character animation, weather, water rendering, lighting and shadows within several lairs, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">There are, of course, a slew of bug fixes as well, with remedies for issues like missing textures from Daedric statues and bugged vampire sleeping animations. You can read the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-first-update-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes/1100-6532121/" data-ref-id="1100-6532121">Oblivion Remastered's first major update</a> released in June and largely focused on addressing bugs and various technical issues. Despite some technical issues and no official mod support (though that hasn't stopped players from making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-oblivion-remastered-mods/2900-6502/" data-ref-id="2900-6502">Oblivion Remastered mods</a> anyways), Oblivion Remastered is among the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">best-selling games of 2025</a> in the US so far.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Oblivion Remastered Update 1.2 Patch Notes</h2><h4><b>SETTINGS CHANGES</b></h4><ul><li>We’ve added additional difficulty settings to allow players to further tune their “Player Combat Damage” &amp; “Enemy Combat Damage”. Players can now select from “Novice”, “Apprentice”, “Adept”, “Journeyman”, “Expert”, and “Master” options in the Gameplay menu.

It's a move that might be viewed as controversial in some corners of the video game industry. PIF is chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been criticized for fostering a "reality of repression" in Saudi Arabia by human rights group </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">Amnesty International</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He was also linked to the murder of The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56213528">via The BBC</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite those allegations, PIF continues to make inroads into the video game sector and has purchased stakes in major studios like Capcom, Nexon, EA, Nintendo, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked whether those criticisms influenced Side's decision to partner with Savvy and PIF, the studio's chief communications officer, Martin McBride, said "instability" in the region could impact how quickly it might grow in Saudi Arabia, but added that Side believes "great games can be created anywhere."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/uk-minister-forms-uk-video-games-council-to-drive-pro-games-growth-agenda-" target="_self" data-discover="true">UK minister forms UK Video Games Council to drive 'pro-games growth agenda'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At Side, we help create amazing games for people from all walks of life—gaming unites those who are separated by culture, creed, ideology, and physical borders. Our decision to partner with Savvy stems from that belief; great games can be created anywhere, and games that bring excitement to their players should be localized and translated so that everyone can experience them," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are over 20 million gamers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—that’s 60 percent of the population. With 71 percent being under the age of 35, Side is in a perfect position to help bring up a new generation of talent into our industry, tapping into a pool of young, eager gamers who have great ideas and buckets of ambition. Yes, instability in the region could play a factor in how quickly we can grow, but Side firmly believes in the vision of building a gaming hub in Riyadh and will support local developers looking to bring their games to a global audience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a non-specific answer to a very specific question about culture washing. Earlier this year, Game Developer asked the same question to Savvy's newly-appointed SVP and head of international business development Nika Nour, who was in London today to announce the partnership with Savvy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wargaming-published-live-service-title-steel-hunters-scrapped-after-three-months" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wargaming's live service title Steel Hunters scrapped after three months</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite a PR company approaching us for a written interview with Nour at the time of her appointment in January, the process stalled immediately after we asked about Saudi Arabia's human rights record and Savvy's ties with PIF. After posing that question, we were told Nour was unable to answer our questions because she was busy relocating to Riyadh. We expressed we'd be happy to wait for the answers, but they never came.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Side claims Saudi expansion will support local developers">Side claims Saudi expansion will support local developers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When discussing the finer points of Side's partnership with Savvy, McBride noted the Saudi company is not providing Side with any funding. The partnership also doesn't include any ownership stakes or equity agreements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's unclear how quickly Side intends to grow its Riyadh studio, but McBride said the company's recent opening in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is a good example of how the company looks to expand. "We’ve been able to grow that team from less than 10 people to well over 100 in under two years, with some of our biggest global clients moving business to that team due to their performance," explained McBride.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He added that Side intends to work with international and domestic clients from its studio in Riyadh to create a "two-way exchange&nbsp;between Side and the talented, in-region studios we support."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/peak-has-surpassed-4-5m-sales-within-a-month" target="_self" data-discover="true">Peak surpasses 4.5M sales within a month</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What we bring to the table is an established brand, access to triple-A projects, industry-specific jobs, and decades of world-class leadership spanning every facet of the game development lifecycle that can be shared with local talent," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">McBride feels the game industry is entering a "new era" of co-development and that workflows are changing rapidly to incorporate new technologies such as AI. He claims that's positive news for Side, which operates over 20 studios around the world and has worked on more than 2,000 projects in the past decade.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As long as we have humans playing games, we’ll need humans that can develop and discuss what games should look like," he said. "Side will continue to be a key part of that loop, and we believe&nbsp;our Riyadh studio will be able to offer fresh talent, ideas and perspectives to an exciting and collaborative arm of the gaming industry."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

Games like <em>PEAK</em> and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere" rel="nofollow">Split Fiction</a></em>&nbsp;have been topping the charts on Steam all year, and don’t show any signs of slowing down. <em>Mycopunk </em>is another co-op focused game dropping in Early Access, and the current build shows a really fun experience for friends, and a promising start for solo players as well.</p>

<h2>Mission Accomplished</h2>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mycopunkhub.jpg?itok=e_0gzLCL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mycopunkhub.jpg?itok=SecSgOJ_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>Though it isn’t a roguelike, it’s hard for me to play <em>Mycopunk</em> without thinking of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/risk-of-rain-2-is-lootin-shootin-good-time" rel="nofollow"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></a>. The gameplay loop of accomplishing the mission, then getting the hell out of there, is simple but will get you hooked.</p>

<p>The major place <em>Mycopunk</em> diverges is the structure of missions. In <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, the mission is the same: get to the teleporter and defeat the boss.</p>

<p><em>Mycopunk</em>, on the other hand, demands something a little different out of your squad every time. Sometimes you’re just defeating swarms, sure. Other times, you need to connect satellites to a power node, prepare a railgun to take out a rival spy, or clear an infection off a planet’s surface.</p>

<p>These missions help keep every adventure out into the wilderness feel different. If the missions don’t make things feel different enough, though, your own equipment you deploy with will.</p>

<h2>Employee of the Month</h2>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mycopunkemployees.jpg?itok=9ZwT1qek 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mycopunkemployees.jpg?itok=fGLA0gZu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>At the launch of Early Access, <em>Mycopunk</em>&nbsp;includes 4 “employees” for you to choose from. I really enjoyed how the game divided the strengths of each character: they all have different mobility abilities, but weapons aren’t tied to any single character.</p>

<p>These movement abilities are all really varied, and while some feel clunky, there are more good than bad. I felt like the Scrapper’s Jetpack and Wrangler’s Rocket Lasso just didn’t click for me, but the highlights were the Glider’s Wingsuit and Scrapper’s Grapple Pole, which felt excellent to use.</p>

<p>One of the lacking features in the movement was momentum. While I could really get going with the Grapple Pole and Wingsuit, it felt like the moment I hit the ground, I was back to square one.</p>

<p>I have much fewer complaints, however, about the gunplay. Every weapon I tried felt pretty satisfying to use and offered unique ways to play with each character.</p>

<p>In particular, I love how ammo works. You will likely run out of ammo at some point, and when you do, to get it back, you must use your secondary weapon. It’s a perfect way to make sure you aren’t using any weapon in particular as a crutch.</p>

<p>One of the hardest tests <em>Mycopunk</em> is facing, and will continue to face in Early Access, is the balance between solo and co-op. I played entirely solo during my time, and it felt like the game was a little more skewed towards a team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of a teammate to revive, solo players get a set of 5 automatic revives. This makes fighting feel fair, but the missions feel pretty skewed towards co-op players. In addition, even with revives, the enemies will far outnumber you, and it can be hard to know which enemies to focus on and when. As a solo player, you might feel overwhelmed and frustrated more than having fun.</p>

<h2><em>Mycopunk </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mycopunkboss.jpg?itok=UIIqF6gR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mycopunkboss.jpg?itok=hz5-T9A1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>At the moment, I think&nbsp;<em>Mycopunk&nbsp;</em>is a strong start with a bright future. There are some pains that I would love to see it shed as it develops. I’d especially like to see some mission adjustments for solo play and some ability tweaks.</p>

<p>Despite that, if you’re looking for a new co-op shooter, you won’t be disappointed by <em>Mycopunk</em>. Tight gunplay, fun movement, and varied missions will keep you exploring the corporate wasteland for a long time. Just make sure to bring a coworker or two for the best results.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After selling out all of its limited stock of First Edition handhelds last year, ModRetro has announced that its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date">Chromatic Game Boy</a> is now permanently back in stock. The company is also introducing a new white-and-purple cloud color option, new game cartridges, and a collection of accessories that includes a rechargeable battery.</p><p>The Chromatic is now once again available for purchase through <a href="https://modretro.com/">ModRetro’s online store</a> in seven different colors: cloud, midnight, wave, inferno, bubblegum, volt, and leaf. Functionality is exactly the same as the First Edition versions of the Chromatic, and the handheld is still made with a durable magnesium alloy case and a pixel-perfect IPS screen that’s color-matched to the original Game Boy’s and Game Boy Color’s displays.</p><p>Pricing now starts at $199.99 and includes a modernized copy of <em>Tetris</em> that adds new gameplay features, but that’s for a version of the Chromatic featuring a screen protected by Gorilla Glass. The original First Edition version of the Chromatic featured more durable sapphire glass, and if you want that same level of screen protection it will now cost you $299.99.</p><p>The Chromatic can still be powered by three AA batteries that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey">based on our testing</a>, provide around seven or eight hours of gameplay with the handheld’s screen brightness reduced to 50 percent. If you don’t want to provide your own rechargeable AAs, ModRetro is also introducing a $29.99 rechargeable battery pack offering up to 16 hours of gameplay. Other new accessories include a $14.99 link cable for connecting two Chromatic handhelds for multiplayer, and a $14.99 Mod Kit letting you customize your Chromatic with swappable parts.</p><p>ModRetro is also <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games">expanding its games collection</a> today with five new cartridges featuring titles like <em>Sabrina: The Animated Series – Zapped!</em>, <em>Wicked Plague</em>, and a puzzle platformer called <em>Gravitorque</em> where you manipulate gravity instead of jumping (you can <a href="https://nikalego.itch.io/gravitorque">try it in your browser here</a>).</p><p>When the Chromatic originally debuted, the handheld’s creator, Palmer Luckey, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date">told <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister</a> that quantities would be limited and he wasn’t sure if he’d make more than what was needed to fulfill preorders. Today’s announcement is welcome news both for those who missed out on getting a Chromatic during its initial run last year and those who did get one, because this will help grow the Chromatic community and potentially encourage other companies to make new games and accessories for the handheld.</p><div><p>What hasn’t changed is that the Chromatic is still tied to a controversial figure. Although the Chromatic reflects Luckey’s past as a Game Boy modder before he created the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4122388/can-oculus-rift-save-virtual-reality">Oculus Rift VR headset</a>, he was an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/23/13025422/palmer-luckey-oculus-founder-funding-donald-trump-trolls">early Donald Trump supporter</a>, and after selling Oculus to Facebook <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/it-turns-out-palmer-luckey-was-fired.html">he was fired</a> following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15366500/palmer-luckey-trump-donations-chrono-trigger-oculus">controversial political donations</a>. Luckey went on to found Anduril, a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/im-a-propagandist-palmer-luckey-on-the-future-of-warfare-2000506276">defense contractor</a> that makes military tech, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/7/23392441/palmer-luckey-anduril-military-first-weapons-loitering-munitions-drones">lethal weaponized drones</a>.</p></div><p>The Chromatic may be one of the best ways to play classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but if you feel that your enjoyment of retro gaming could be hampered by the handheld’s associations, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Analogue Pocket</a> offers comparable performance and cartridge support without any controversy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/700725/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-handheld-now-available]]></content:encoded>

Their answer was a perfect window into how game development often seems to work at Nintendo, with each new decision occurring as a response to previous ones rather than as a top-down structure superimposed upon the project from the start. While Pauline was suggested as a possible sidekick for the game early on, she wasn’t there from the beginning (<em>Bananza </em>started development as a Switch game, the pair confirmed). </p><p>“I think the moment we actually realized we would go in that direction came about as a result of an artist who created some concept art of the zebra transformation,” Motokura said. “We saw that image and thought it was really fun, so we immediately prototyped it to try it out in the game. And when our composer saw that, they decided to create specific music just for that transformation.”</p><p>He continued, “And the music for it was so good, we thought we could expand on this and turn it into a song and maybe Pauline would be a good choice to sing that song. And so we then asked the composer to create songs for each of the transformations and I think that’s what really cemented Pauline’s place.”</p><p>From there, a lot of other parts of the game started falling into place. <em>Donkey Kong</em> can’t speak but Pauline can, providing a narrative guide to Ingot Isle where the game takes place. Pauline’s music also became a clever way to mask game mechanics like pointing out which direction the player is supposed to go in. Co-op, meanwhile, lets a second player control her voice to stun enemies as DK is running along. Pauline is in the game because her character fits with cool gameplay ideas, not because Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745?_gl=1*wduhkz*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIxNjAyNTckbzQxJGcwJHQxNzUyMTYwMjYwJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745?_gl=1*wduhkz*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIxNjAyNTckbzQxJGcwJHQxNzUyMTYwMjYwJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..">cares about the <em>Donkey Kong</em> timeline</a></span>. </p><p>That doesn’t mean there’s no room for fun speculation about characters and crossovers, like whether <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is secretly a prequel to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Motokura was asked point blank how old <em>Donkey Kong</em> is, but he demurred. “I think that’s another one that maybe is good fodder for player theories,” he said. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019]]></content:encoded>

                <p>ModRetro has announced a relaunch for the Chromatic handheld, its modernized Game Boy. The device quickly sold out last year after it initially launched, and ModRetro says that new stock for it is now available. Alongside the console--which will be available in seven new colors--the company is also debuting new games and accessories for it. Two models will be available--a $200 version with scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass and a $300 version equipped with Sapphire Glass that is designed to be extremely durable.</p><p>The Chromatic library will also expand with five new games, ranging from story-driven adventures to nostalgic re-releases. Sabrina: The Animated Series – Zapped is a re-release of the fast-paced platformer that was based on the cartoon series, Wicked Plague is an old-school metroidvania, and Self-Simulated has over 100 levels to conquer with precision platforming. Rounding out the new arrivals is First Contact Protocol--an adventure-puzzle game with branching choices and cinematic cutscenes--and the puzzle-platformer Gravitorque.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529614" data-ratio="0.3734375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529614"></a><figcaption>The new Chromatic colorway options.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg"></figure><p>All Chromatic units also come bundled with Tetris, and ModRetro has pledged to provide ongoing support and updates. Streaming support is coming to the Chromatic and no additional hardware will be required to stream gameplay natively to Discord, Mac, and PC. For the new accessories, you can choose from the following extras:</p><ul><li><strong>ModRetro Rechargeable Power Core ($29.99):</strong> A snap-in battery that adds up to 16 hours of gameplay power</li><li><strong>ModRetro Link Cable ($14.99):</strong> Enables couch co-op between Chromatics with head-to-head multiplayer support</li><li><strong>ModRetro Mod Kit ($14.99):</strong> High-quality swappable parts that can be used to customize the Chromatic</li><li><strong>ModRetro Koss Porta Pro ($49.99):</strong> A retro-inspired headset for the Chromatic</li></ul><p>While there are several modern versions of the Game Boy on the market today--most of which provide an emulated experience--the Chromatic is easily one of the best in its class. The $200 handheld console looks and feels like a classic Game Boy, but considering that it makes use of several high-quality parts, it's also an exceptionally well-built handheld overall that can easily run all of your original Game Boy cartridges.</p><p>"ModRetro's Chromatic is a truly superb recreation of the Game Boy Color," Steven Petite wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/">ModRetro Chromatic review</a>. "If you want a near-exact replica of your childhood Game Boy with a backlit screen, this is the handheld for you. At $199, and even if you didn't get a great new spin on Tetris, I'd argue the Chromatic is a bargain due to its ridiculously premium build. But this is a bargain for a <em>very </em>specific type of retro gamer."</p>

On face value it seems to have been a successful launch, topping 20,000 concurrent players and 10,000 Steam reviews. However, according to a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Hd10zoJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now-removed Nexon forum post</a>, the developer ran an in-game event incentivizing players to leave reviews on Valve's platform, something which is clearly disallowed in the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steamworks documentation</a>.</p><p>The in-game event description explained that once Blue Archive's Steam review count had reached 10,000, all players would receive five Gift Choice Boxes and five Beautiful Bouquets in-game. The event was due to run from July 4-11, but there is no longer any mention of it when opening Blue Archive. Interestingly, the Steam reviews have exceeded Nexon's goal of 10,000. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529631" data-ratio="0.635" data-width="2000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529631"></a><figcaption>Blue Archive is facing allegations of ignoring the Steam rules.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg"></figure><p>As spotted by one user on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3557620/discussions/0/601909292780678855/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam forums </a>for the game, the Steamworks documentation clearly states that it is not permitted "to abuse or artificially manipulate the review system" nor should anyone "solicit reviews in exchange for any games, DLC, money, or other rewards" with the only exceptions being sending copies of the game to press or creators for previews or reviews. Additionally, developers should not "ask customers to review" games from within the game itself. GameSpot has reached out to Nexon for comment.</p><p>Blue Archive is a tactical RPG with gacha elements, meaning that it utilizes a random draw system which uses the in-game currency of Pyroxene to determine which students, or characters, players receive. Through limited recruitment events, the "drop" rate of specific students can be raised, incentivizing players to use more Pyroxene to try to get the anime girl they're seeking.</p><p>Blue Archive isn't the only anime girl game trending on Steam right now. Following its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-train-and-race-anime-horse-girls-for-free/1100-6532908/" data-ref-id="1100-6532908">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> is also seeing huge figures, topping 50,000 concurrent players at its peak so far.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-is-ending-online-support-for-need-for-speed-rivals-in-october-2025.1240482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that online support for Need for Speed: Rivals will be ending later this year on October 7, 2025. The shutdown was spotted by <a href="https://delistedgames.com/ea-returns-today-to-announce-need-for-speed-rivals-will-lose-online-services-october-7th/">Delisted Games</a>, where a reader noticed Rivals had been added to <a href="https://www.ea.com/legal/service-updates/i-q#:~:text=N-,October%207%2C%202025,-NEED%20FOR%20SPEED">EA's list of games</a> that are getting their online services shutdown.</p>



<p>Need for Speed: Rivals launched over a decade ago, on November 15, 2013, and originally launched for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, before coming to Xbox One and PS4 a year later in October 2014. The shutdown of online services is for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, meaning that players on those devices and on current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, will no longer be able to play any of the game's online modes after October 7, 2025.</p>



<p>Racing against other players online is the core driving factor for why most racing fans play racing games, Need for Speed included, but at least in the case of Rivals, there is still an offline mode for players to dig into, if they want to revisit Rivals after October 7. But that's not the case for several online-focused games that have been shut down recently, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/">Anthem</a>, which EA recently announced will have its online functionality shut down in early 2026, effectively making the game unplayable.</p>



<p>Games like Anthem essentially being taken away from players is at the crux of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, which is trying to get legislation passed that prohibits developers and publishers from taking away rights that they sold to players at the point of the game's purchase. </p>



<p>The campaign began last year and has recently been a hot topic of discussion regarding game preservation, as the petition recently surpassed 1 million signatures. In response, several of the video game industry's biggest publishers and developers, many of whom pull in hundreds of millions of dollars each year, some of them even billions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">claimed that the proposals made by Stop Killing Games, if accepted</a>, would make creating online-focused games "<em>prohibitively expensive</em>."</p>



<p>Minecraft creator Markus Persson, commonly known as Notch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-creator-buying-game-purchase-pirating-not-theft/">also recently weighed in on the campaign</a>, saying "<em>If buying a game is not a purchase, then pirating them is not theft</em>," referencing the argument from publishers that players don't actually buy games at the point of purchase, but a license to play them until such time that publisher decides players don't get that privilege any more. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Total War: Warhammer III Tides of Torment DLC Delayed to "Later This Year"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-dlc-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-dlc-delayed-to-later-this-year.1240476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Creative Assembly and publisher Sega have announced that&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC has been delayed to "later this year".</p>

<p>Originally,&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>was intended to launch this summer, but as Creative Assembly reveals in a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/75" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new blog post</a>, the DLC won't be meeting that release window. Instead,&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>will be launching sometime later in 2025, although the studio doesn't commit to a more specific release window than that.</p>

<p>Creative Assembly says that during recent playtesting for&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment</em>, the studio's developers asked themselves if the DLC "met the standards...set in recent releases", and as you've probably gathered from the delay, the answer was no.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-delayed-firebreathing_0.jpg?itok=YsOA1tEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-delayed-firebreathing_0.jpg?itok=aGDp_7tf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC is going to take a bit longer to launch.</figcaption></figure><p>As a result of this dissatisfaction, Creative Assembly says it's going to spend some time "working on [<em>Tides of Torment</em>], reviewing the content, and improving the gameplay experiences that it’s set to bring".</p>

<p>That also means that the info shared as part of the Slaanesh and Norsca previews released back in May is probably "no longer accurate", according to Creative Assembly. More will be shared about these factions, as well as the third and final DLC faction, when the final What's Next video for&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>arrives.</p>

<p>The studio acknowledges that this year "has been a slower year" for many&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>fans, and that while <i>Warhammer III&nbsp;</i>"is in a better space" this year than in previous years, Creative Assembly is "currently not meeting [its] commitments" to transparency, pledging to address this issue over the next few months through new updates, hotfixes, and preview videos.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, Creative Assembly closes by saying that "one of the biggest <em>Total War: Warhammer</em> content packs ever created in the trilogy" is coming next year, and that the possibility of smaller DLC packs that include certain legendary lords or hero units is also on the table.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer III&nbsp;</em>is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and you can remind yourself of what our very own Andrew thought of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-warhammer-3-review" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. The&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch sometime later this year.</p>
