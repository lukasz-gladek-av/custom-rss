            <p>As X/Twitter owner Elon Musk moves Grok's widely condemned AI image manipulation feature to paid-only and users flood the "town square" with thousands of sexualised images, Epic Games boss said that senators calling for the removal of X from the Apple and Google stores are trying to "censor all of their political opponents".</p> <div>

<p>Kicking off a series of tweets posted overnight, Sweeney wrote: "Reason #42 for open platforms: to shut down every politician’s incessant demands to all gatekeepers to censor all of their political opponents," linking to a story about US senators calling for X's removal from app stores.</p>
<p>He added: "All major AIs have documented instances of going off the rails; all major AI companies make their best efforts to combat this; none are perfect. Politicians demanding gatekeepers selectively crush the one that's their political opponent's company is basic crony capitalism."</p> <div>

<p>The 2016 action role-playing title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria</a> is getting a remastered released on the Switch next month, and we've got some additional details to share about this version's performance and resolution.</p>
<p>As we highlighted in the original announcement last November, the game will target <strong>30fps</strong>. Some extra information from Bandai Namco further notes how the frame rate may change during certain moments of the game:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In comparison, the other versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a> on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will be running at 60fps.</p>
<p>As for the remaster's resolution on Switch, TV mode will run at <strong>1920 x 1080</strong>, and in handheld fans can expect <strong>1280 x 720</strong>. Other versions of the game will support up to 4K.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also notes how it's been testing the compatibility of the game with the Switch Lite and Switch 2, so if there are any significant developments regarding the game on Switch 2, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This follows the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a> on the Switch in October last year, which also ran at 30fps and was 1080p docked, and 720p in handheld mode.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Million ARC Raiders Players Wiped Their Accounts, Embark Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/</link>
            <guid>1402774</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Towards the end of December, ARC Raiders’ first ‘Expedition Project’ went live, allowing players to leave the game’s map behind and reset their accounts in search of a fresh playthrough. It’s a balancing mechanic that allows players another go around at the game, and it’s set to recur once every two or three months.</p>



<p>The optional mechanic was explored by more than <strong>one million players</strong>, Embark Studios recently revealed. Given the game has sold an estimated 12 million copies, that means just 8% of players carried out the optional account wipe.</p>







<h2 id="h-embark-will-evolve-the-expedition-project">Embark Will Evolve The Expedition Project</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders is still sitting at the top of the extraction table, for now. It dropped back in October 2025 and quickly became a stellar, award-winning game adored by millions of players. The exposure the game received on streaming and social platforms was unparalleled, and it’s still beating some of the traditional games in the space at the time of writing.</p>



<p>In December, ARC Raiders players everywhere were invited to complete the game’s first Expedition Project. This optional step requires players to collect scores of specific items to build an ‘escape caravan’, migrating away from the game’s safe zone and walking off into the sunset.</p>



<p>They’re then handed a fresh character and must go back through the game again, this time with a few buffs acquired via the Expedition Project process.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Embark Studios revealed that ‘a little over a million players’ completed that first Expedition. That represents a relatively small minority, per sales estimates. There were a few issues with the Expedition Project, such as the grind required to get there and tick the final boxes to unlock <strong>all </strong>the benefits, so that likely explains why so few players completed the task.</p>



<p>Many players had an issue with the hefty requirements to unlock the five free skill points handed down upon the launch of a successful Expedition. They were charged with collecting a whopping <strong>five million credits </strong>in stash value, translated into one free skill point per <strong>one million </strong>credits.</p>



<p>This is one of the areas that Embark is working on, per the recent <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with PCGamesN</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the bigger topics of feedback was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points, and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on.</p>



<p>So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, we set that as an aspirational goal that some players&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, ‘Well, now I&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to do that to get it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was then confirmed that around 35% or 40% of players running the Expedition Project received the full allotment of free skill points. The team also confirmed that they’re examining the Expedition process from every angle, scrutinizing the data and looking for opportunities to improve it.</p>

<p>Again, this will arrive alongside the free 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch and Switch 2, which includes new features such as the Resort Hotel, Expanded Home Storage, the return of Resetti, collaborations and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 lore fans are in overdrive after a single page of a new campaign book teased something that’s never happened before in the setting: the meeting of two loyalist primarchs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The primarchs are the overpowered, genetically-engineered demigod sons of the Emperor, the leaders of the loyalist Space Marine legions before they were broken up into chapters following the catastrophic civil war known as the Horus Heresy. Warhammer 40,000 as a narrative operated for decades with most of the primarchs either thought dead or lost in the warp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, only two primarchs are confirmed alive and active in the current Warhammer 40,000 setting: Ultramarines boss Roboute Guilliman, who returned to the galaxy during the Gathering Storm event in 2017, and Dark Angels chief Lion El'Jonson, who miraculously popped back into existence as part of the Arks of Omen storyline in early 2023. These were galaxy-shaking plot developments for the Warhammer 40,000 setting, and ever since Lion El'Jonson’s shock return to Warhammer 40,000, fans have wondered when he’d finally bump into his brother, Roboute. Now, it looks like that long-awaited family reunion will take place in the coming months, after a new campaign book teased a meeting of the Emperor’s sons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Word comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArbitorIan" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer 40,000 lore expert Arbitor Ian</a>, who IGN has partnered with for a number of explainer videos, such as the one above. Arbitor Ian got an early look at 500 Worlds: Titus, a soon to be released Warhammer 40,000 campaign book and narrative expansion that features 80 pages of lore covering the beginning of the Ultramarian Reclamation, and <a href="https://youtu.be/LbzAifF0hlM?si=YovaOQ329eobksT2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a new video on its most explosive lore reveal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To back up briefly, Lieutenant Titus from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Space Marine 2</u></a> video game has become one of the most recognizable faces in Warhammer 40,000 following its enormous success. To capitalize on Titus’ newfound fame, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Games Workshop promoted him to Captain and made him Master of the Watch</a>, which means he’s in charge of defending the 500 Worlds of Ultramar, the realm of Space Marine poster boys, the Ultramarines. With Roboute Guilliman off gallivanting with his Indomitus Crusade, Titus is now in charge of keeping things safe and sound back home, where new Necron threats have emerged, as they always do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the new video from Arbitor Ian, 500 Worlds: Titus has a crucial piece of new lore, found right at the back of the book, that teases a meeting between Guilliman and Lion El'Jonson. It is an intergalactic message written by Lion El'Jonson and intended for Roboute Guilliman that reads: “Brother. We need to talk.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/10/skxwr6po7aseaulq-1768088002164.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lion El'Jonson wants a word with his brother, Roboute Guilliman, in a meeting 10,000 years in the making. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This seemingly innocuous message teases a momentous plot development for the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Never before have two loyalist primarchs met in the current setting. Of course they spent a great deal of time with each other <em>before</em> the 41st millennium. They were, generally, pals during the glory days of the Great Crusade, for example. All the primarchs (apart from the two we don't talk about) were active during the foundational events of the Horus Heresy, which took place 10,000 years before the current setting. And we just got our first novel set during the era known as The Scouring, which saw the loyalist primarchs enact their revenge on the traitor legions in the aftermath of the Horus Heresy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, how will this meeting between Lion El'Jonson and Roboute go? It’s hard to tell. Some fans are speculating the Lion will be a bit miffed at Roboute, who has alarmed more than a few inquisitive minds with his Indomitus Crusade. Others think (hope?) the brothers will join forces to help drive back the forces of Chaos and rekindle the glory days of the Imperium. Given this is Warhammer 40,000 and everything is… awful, I suspect that plenty will go wrong, no matter the Lion’s feelings about his brother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the speculation around the message itself: “Brother. We need to talk.” That doesn’t sound aggressive necessarily, but it does suggest a matter of some importance needs to be brought to Guilliman’s attention. What does the Lion know that his brother doesn’t? Does he carry a warning? Has he discovered some grand conspiracy about their father, the Emperor? Does he bring good news? Is another loyalist primarch about to return?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arbitor Ian speculates that the Lion may be upset with Guilliman because he believes his brother to be trying to usurp the Emperor with all this Indomitus Crusade and Ultramarian Reclamation business (there’s a whole thing about Roboute potentially doing something similar during the Horus Heresy when it looked like Chaos might win). Alternatively, Arbitor Ian suggests the Lion will reveal some new threat that becomes central to the plot of the next Warhammer 40,000 campaign book, perhaps to do with would-be fifth Chaos god Vashtorr the Arkifane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever Games Workshop has up its sleeve, it looks like we’re set for some answers over the next few months. At least, that’s the hope. Fans have been waiting three years for the Lion and Guilliman to get together. If Games Workshop just sat on this tease for another few years, well… that would be very Games Workshop, wouldn’t it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warhammer 40,000 story, such as it is, is a slow moving beast. The scribes at Games Workshop sometimes take years to inch the overarching plot forward. Tantalizing plot threads are left dangling, sometimes for decades. Answers remain frustratingly out of reach. Cliffhangers seem destined to hang in a perpetual state of anticipation, never to be fulfilled. Such is the nature of Games Workshop's grimdark 41st millennium, which has exploded in popularity over the last decade. At this point any news on how the story might actually move forward is analyzed to within an inch of its life, as if under investigation by the Inquisition itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Every once in a while, a game rocks up that so quickly finds itself in my Steam wishlist I don't even remember clicking the button. Today, that game is Rakshasa, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> inspired first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in modern India where you must face off against demi-gods and "centuries-old flesh-eating monsters" inspired by Indian folklore. Yeah! Hell yeah! Yeah, yeah sign me up!
</p>
<p>
The reveal trailer for this thing absolutely drips with muck and grime, almost in that nasty cyberpunky kind of way, yet still grounded in a city setting we're all familiar with. But you'll also find yourself in ancient temples and rundown slums alongside the luxury apartments. Even from a short trailer there's a suggestion of a lot of texture environmentally.

Interestingly, despite being first-person, it actually takes a turn-based combat approach, with what appears to be a timing based element when pulling off an attack. Hard to get a read on how this functions moment to moment, but it being an RPG you have your usual upgrade trees to make different builds with, I just can't garner much more than that so I'll leave the combat there. Oh and you can throw snakes! Just, throw 'em. I like it!
</p><p>
Interestingly, this game is actually being made by a YouTube channel called Odd Compass, which makes animated history videos about "under-appreciated events and people in Asian history," predominantly in India. These videos look incredibly well-made too, definitely worth a look if you're a history buff. In the meantime, you can wishlist Rakshasa <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4285930/Rakshasa/">here</a>.

Wizard Pool! It is, probably, exactly what you think it is. You are a wizard, and you play pool. Well, admittedly there is a smidge more to it than that, alongside a healthy amount of charm. Styled in a way that looks like an N64 game in the kind of way you remember that era looking rather than how it actually looked, you play as Kue, a budding young wizard tasked by his uncle to complete a trial in the form of a tower filled with magical, illogical pool tables.
</p>
<p>
The tutorial levels are simple enough, giving you a taste of how it all works; each differently coloured ball has different magical properties. Upon impact one might swap places with the white ball, there's a ball that freezes the white ball temporarily so it slips and slides leaving it out of your control, another ball starts tiny but the harder you hit it the bigger it gets before reverting to its original, miniscule size.

Speaking of, the process of doing the ball hitting is archaic and difficult to get to grips with at first, but won me over steadily enough. You rotate your cue stick clockwise or anticlockwise by pressing the left or right mouse buttons, and then you must physically position the mouse and move it to hit the white ball, the speed with which you do so affecting the strength of your hit. As stated, odd at first, yet delectably tactile when you get used to it.
</p><p>
Things steadily get more and more mixed up as the tables change too, holes appearing in places anywhere but where you'd expect, encouraging you to put a bit more thought into how you position your cue and how hard you might hit the ball. It's neat! And a simple yet engaging little <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzley</a> arcade game, which even has an online multiplayer option.
</p>
<p>
In the game's quite simple story mode there's even these pre-rendered cutscenes that must be no higher than 480p in quality that for some reason very specifically call Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg in terms of vibes. Something about the lighting, can't entirely put my finger on it.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's just a nice way to muck about for a little while, and is cheaper than a cup of coffee on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4177880/Wizard_Pool/">Steam</a>, so well worth a shot!

<p>The next game in the Moonstone Island franchise has been revealed.</p>



<p>Moonstone Island was released on PC in 2023 and later ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2024. Developed by Studio Supersoft and published by Raw Fury, the game is yet another take on the cozy sim, which has proven very successful on the Nintendo Switch. Now, the next game in the franchise which isn’t a sequel, but isn’t not a sequel, according to a new social media post, has been shown off for the first time.</p>







<h2 id="h-introducing-moonstone-academy">Introducing Moonstone Academy</h2>



<p>In a Twitter post, the team behind the Moonstone Island game shared a brief 30-second preview of their work. What followed was a video of a character briefly exploring a tower, then getting on a bicycle with a propeller in front and flying away, before a title reveal reading “Moonstone Academy.”</p>



<p>In subsequent posts, it was clarified that this is a new game in the series, and that while there’s no set release date, more information will follow as updates are made. It’s claimed this isn’t necessarily a sequel, but it wouldn’t be fair to say it isn’t one.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">— Moonstone Island – Physical Edition AVAILABLE NOW! (@Moonstone_game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Moonstone_game/status/2006744230786707762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Insider Gaming will provide further coverage of Moonstone Academy as more information becomes available.</p>

			<p>Multiplayer games are unique in that they can last for years and years, even decades in some cases, but the excitement of a brand new release cannot be truly matched by DLCs or expansions for existing titles.</p>



<p>Luckily, 2026 looks very interesting on the front of new multiplayer games releases. They're also quite varied, offering a variety of settings and gameplay formulas that are likely to entice many players throughout the year.</p>

Later, we learned that the former Game Director, <strong>Christopher Barrett</strong>, a veteran who had been at Bungie for more than twenty years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been fired for misconduct</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced by Joe Ziegler</a>, who had previously served as the Game Director of <strong>Riot's Valorant</strong>.</p>



<p>Rumors continued to be uncertain as to the game's quality, and indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another delay was confirmed in June 2025</a> as the studio worked on refinements based on user feedback from previous testing phases. Last month, the development team finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nailed down the <strong>March 2026</strong></a> release while also explaining the updated vision following the aforementioned improvements: proximity chat has been reintroduced (following its great implementation in ARC Raiders, perhaps), solo queuing has been added, and the new <strong>Rook</strong> Runner makes it easier to drop into in‑progress runs with minimal gear but no real risk, improving accessibility. Grass rendering was significantly improved, and now dead bodies remain persistent with decay animation, so that runners visibly deteriorate post-death, increasing immersion.</p>



<p>Whether that will be enough to catch the player's attention for a long period of time remains to be seen, but Bungie's standing in the multiplayer games category makes it impossible to discount them outright.</p>

<h2 id="h-enshrouded-spring-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-s-x">Enshrouded (Spring 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>



<p>German indie developer <strong>Keen Games</strong> may not be a household name like the others on this list of multiplayer games. However, they've already demonstrated their ability to deliver a fun cooperative action RPG with their previous game, <strong>Portal Knights</strong>, which is estimated to have sold between <strong>1.5</strong> and <strong>2.8</strong> <strong>million units</strong> on Steam alone.</p>



<p>Their new game, <strong>Enshrouded</strong>, has already far surpassed it with its early access sales. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it had broken the <strong>four million units milestone</strong> back in April 2025, so it might be approaching five million units by now.</p>



<p>The survival game has proven to be very popular, and with version 1.0 tentatively slated in Spring (though it might slip) on both PC and consoles, it's not long until the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-qa-keen-games-explains-all-about-its-zelda-meets-valheim-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Zelda meets Valheim'</a></strong> game gets out of early access and into more players' hands.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-duskbloods-tba-2026-nintendo-switch-2">The Duskbloods (TBA 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<p>FromSoftware already delivered a great multiplayer game in 2025 with <strong>Elden Ring: Nightreign</strong>. With the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive <strong>The Duskbloods</strong>, they're looking to repeat the success while experimenting with a different formula. The Duskbloods is a PvPvE game where eight players simultaneously compete against each other and AI-powered enemies and bosses.</p>



<p>According to the Japanese developer known primarily for the <strong>Souls</strong> series, The Duskbloods underwent the longest gameplay prototyping cycle of any of their games to date. It was greenlit even before <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice's March 2019 release</a></strong> and spent years on pure systems validation and mechanical iteration. The setting appears to blend <strong>Lovecraftian gothic horror</strong> with <strong>Steampunk aesthetics</strong>. As humanity reaches its apocalyptic Twilight, various time periods and spaces converge. Players are the <strong>Bloodsworn</strong>: vampire-like characters transcending human limits through blood-granted superhuman abilities. Based on the released gameplay, we can glean the following details:</p>



<ul>
<li>Victorian weaponry, such as blades, great weapons, and serrated arms)</li>



<li>Firearms reminiscent of Bloodborne's trick weapons</li>



<li>Steampunk jetpacks enabling vertical traversal</li>



<li>Winged stone orbs with Cheshire grins</li>



<li>Occult spells, blood magic, and necromantic summoning</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the game's distinguishing features is that the victory conditions are dynamically variable and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Last Player Standing (traditional battle royale)</li>



<li>Designated Rival Defeat (assigned specific opponent to kill)</li>



<li>Designated Ally Cooperation (assigned ally to find and support)</li>



<li>Boss Defeat (cooperative or solo)</li>
</ul>



<p>Victory Points accumulate through direct combat, strategic evasion, objective completion, or boss kills, theoretically ensuring that solo combat skill doesn't exclusively determine victory.</p>



<p>There are over a dozen Bloodsworn, and each possesses unique weapons, abilities, and aesthetic variations. These characters can also move with superhuman feats, unlike previous FromSoftware games, like ​double Jumps, super jumps, dashing, and air-dashing. Finally, a randomized Event System attempts to prevent stagnation by introducing elements such as special enemy spawns and additional objectives that offer bonus rewards.</p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-november-19-2026-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-s-x">GTA 6 (November 19, 2026 - PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X)</h2>



<p><strong>Rockstar</strong> fans are extremely eager to see what the industry-leading studio has in store for them when it comes to the online mode of <strong>GTA 6</strong>. Whereas GTA 4 had a multiplayer mode that didn't really hold players' interest for long, the exact opposite is true for GTA 5, which has had such a successful online mode that the studio is still continuously updating it (and making a lot of money off it) after thirteen years.</p>



<p>Rockstar literally said nothing about it so far. <span>Thankfully, we at&nbsp;<strong>Wccftech</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought you a rumor from the industry veteran&nbsp;<strong>Rich Vogel</strong></a>, who heard through the grapevine that many of GTA 6's online features are typical of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)</span> and as such, he wouldn't be surprised to see it evolving more toward that direction. That rumor is compounded by Rockstar's acquisition of <span><strong>FiveM's</strong>&nbsp;maker, Cfx.re,</span> back in August 2023. FiveM is the popular community-made online modification framework that provides customized dedicated servers and extensive roleplaying features.</p>



<p>With GTA 6 set to launch on <strong>November 19, 2026</strong>, if the game isn't delayed, we might hear a lot more about the massively anticipated game in the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="h-cinder-city-tba-2026-pc-and-consoles">Cinder City (TBA 2026 - PC and Consoles)</h2>



<p>Korean developer <strong>NCSoft</strong> is going to be very busy in 2026. They're <a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-launch-globally-second-half-2026-monetization-less-aggressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing <strong>Aion 2</strong> to Western countries</a>, for one thing, although the Korean launch hasn't been that well-received. They're also working on another MMO-like game, <strong>Cinder City</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I had the chance to play at Gamescom 2025</a> before chatting at length with <strong>BigFire Games</strong> CEO <strong>Jaehyun Bae</strong>.</p>



<p>Cinder City is a lot like <strong>The Division</strong> in that it's an open world third-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic city environment. In this case, instead of New York, there's <strong>Seoul</strong>, which has been quarantined following its invasion by 'bizarre lifeforms'. I didn't see any of that in the Gamescom 2025 demo, nor did I experience any cooperation with other players (it was a single player build), but the full game will have both. In fact, the developers assured me we can expect <strong>dynamic events, dungeons, boss fights</strong>, and even <strong>endgame content</strong>. At launch, there will be <strong>between seven and nine playable characters</strong>, each packing different skillsets.</p>

            <guid>1402630</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The former developers of Little Nightmares are now working on a game that merges twin stick Shooters with Metroidvanias. End of Abyss is being developed by Section 9 Interactive Studios and published by Epic Games. While it is yet another in a long line of Metroidvania-style games, it also promises to shake up the formula with twin-stick shooter controls.</p>



<p>Section 9 is a Swedish game development studio whose founders, Marcus and Matthews Ottvall, have a history of working on hit games, including Little Nightmares and Little Big Planet on the PlayStation Vita. Now, they’re excited to begin revealing their unique take on what a Metroidvania can be.</p>







<h2 id="h-section-9-co-founders-discuss-inspiration-for-end-of-abyss">Section 9 Co-Founders Discuss Inspiration For End of Abyss</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/former-little-nightmares-devs-end-of-abyss-is-a-satisfyingly-creepy-blend-of-top-down-twin-stick-shooter-and-metroidvania-exploration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with Games Radar+</a>, Marcus discussed that the initial plans for End of Abyss called for a cartoony action game. However, they later explored a top-down Metroidvania, leading to a darker atmosphere.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The game started out as a bit of a cartoony action game, a kind of top-down twin stick shooter with some adventure elements. Player movement was quicker back then and with fast dodges to avoid enemy attacks. During development, we talked about how there really weren’t that many top-down Metroidvania games, and we wanted to explore that idea. We started leaning towards a more serious tone. We discussed sci-fi anime and classic horror movie inspirations, and began forming a darker atmosphere, and horror elements were introduced, shifting the game toward slower-paced gameplay.”</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Marcus did not want to disclose too much about the game’s story and characters, but his brother, Mattias Otvall, spoke about the game’s scanner tool and how it was designed to stand out in a crowded genre.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s a tool that we created for making the exploration more manageable and enjoyable. Scanning your environment and creatures also provides a bit of extra information about the world around you and may even help you find some secrets. Metroidvania games can get disorienting at times, so the scanner helps you to mark points of interest on your map so you can have an easier time finding where to go later on.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As of yet, there’s no release date for the forthcoming game. Still, it is expected to be released in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series consoles, and PC via the Epic Games Store.</p>

            <p>
I think as long as you make a new year's update post before the incredibly arbitrary date of January 13th, you're still able to do so without me thinking "come on, it's almost February", which is exactly what EA did with their <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims">new years Sims update post</a>. Perhaps reassuringly, after word came last year of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">EA's concerning acquisition</a>, the post opens by doubling down on what the team has previously said regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">staying committed to their values</a> (those values <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims">including inclusivity</a> is welcome though I wish they'd be more explicit about who is being included). But the post also, sort of, goes into what's next for the series.
</p>
<p>
Top of the order of importance is potentially the fact that Project Rene, i.e. not-Sims 5 with an emphasis on multiplayer, is now being described as a "mobile-first" game. The post is explicit about it not being "the successor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>," noting it is an "experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience." But its future on PC, or any other platform, is now up in the air.
</p>
<p>
One thing the post does make clear is the studio's commitment to single-player games, even if Project Rene is meant to be more collaborative. "Single-player PC and console experiences will always be a part of our future, with more than half of our global development team dedicated to The Sims 4 and the next evolution," the post explains, though what about that last bit, the next evolution? "More news in the coming months!" Very helpful, thanks.
</p>
<p>
We already know there's not going to be a Sims 5, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">at least last time I checked anyway</a>, so this evolution is limited in its potential. Perhaps a big refresh for The Sims 4? It certainly could do with one, given it's over a decade old now. We'll find out in those theoretically coming months!

            <p>Surprise! We finally have a release date and a subtitle - "Broken Things" -  for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> 5: 18th February, 2026. The console release for Chapter 5 will reportedly "follow in the months ahead".</p>
<p>To celebrate the news, developer Mob Entertainment shared a new terrifying cinematic teaser (which is very heavy on the red-brown stuff), and shows off the gigantic Experiment 1006, AKA The Prototype.</p>
<p>You can check it out below:</p>

<p>"Deep within the vacant halls of the Playtime Co. lab, The Prototype stalks its unfinished work… the tattered, lifeless remains of toys that once were. Broken things," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>"In Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5 - Broken Things, players must prepare to face off against the deadly puppetmaster behind the horrifying events of Playtime Co’s dark past. Solve devious puzzles and overcome dangerous obstacles as the true rotten heart at the center of Playtime Co. draws nearer."</p>
<p>You can expect "stomach-churning terror" in a new area of the factory, new "tortured denizens", puzzles, deadly environmental obstacles, and new GrabPack tools.</p>
<p>It's been a long wait for fans. The prior chapter, called Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, predictably enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-coming-to-consoles-this-month">on consoles over the summer</a>.</p>
<p>In May of last year, the studio announced that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works</a> with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>

            <guid>1402591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a third-person extraction adventure game and has been since Embark Studios concocted the concept several years ago. That hasn’t stopped fans worldwide from wondering how the game would fare as a <strong>first-person </strong>shooter. Now, they’re one step closer to seeing what that would look like.</p>



<p>In a new clip uploaded on social media and circulated online, one user manipulated ARC Raiders via dev console commands, a function that has now been <strong>patched out </strong>by Embark Studios. By forcing a first-person perspective, this user allowed us to see what the post-apocalyptic shooter would look like if it <strong>weren’t </strong>a third-person game.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-in-first-person-is-kind-of-trippy">ARC Raiders in First Person is Kind of Trippy</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders is a phenomenal, award-winning extraction adventure title <strong>exclusively </strong>available as a third-person game. That’s absolutely fine, as it works and beats the norm where the <strong>first-person perspective </strong>is king in the extraction space.</p>



<p>However, a new three-minute clip uploaded to social media and shared online showcases a forced first-person perspective in ARC Raiders. It admittedly is a little janky because it’s an exploit and a manipulation effort more than anything else, but it shows the potential of what might have been:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FIRST PERSON in ARC Raiders 😮</p><p>A Reddit user managed to force FPP camera using dev console commands. Even without dedicated animations, seeing the world from this perspective looks incredibly immersive. <a href="https://t.co/mJB6sHA57I">pic.twitter.com/mJB6sHA57I</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders Alerts (@ArcRaiderAlerts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaiderAlerts/status/2010011248922853451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Earlier today, Embark Studios published a hotfix to address this very issue. It was found that PC players were exploiting hidden dev console commands to boost their FOV and disable some of the game’s environmental mechanics, like fog. This resulted in them having hugely advantageous edges over the competition, especially those playing on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<p>This exploit is what led to the forced first-person perspective you see in the clip above.</p>



<p>The reception was mixed on social media, with many claiming that it should <strong>never </strong>have some kind of PUBG-influenced switchable mode between first- and third-person, while others suggested it looks much more immersive in first-person.</p>







<p>What do you think? Does ARC Raiders work as a first-person shooter, or should it stay forever locked to third-person? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>EA has stressed to its community that "the values of The Sims are unchanged" as we head into 2026.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA shareholders approved</a> the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law"> proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms, leaving only the US government in the way of what would be the largest corporate buyout in history. The acquisition, first announced back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>As news about the acquisition spread, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-creators-quit-ea-partnerships-amid-buyout-concerns">a number of prolific The Sims content creators "removed themselves" from the EA Creator Network</a>, claiming the game's inclusive community is at odds with the well-documented conservative and anti-LGBTQIA+ values of EA's buyers, which include the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p>

<p>The Sims team, however, wrote on its blog yesterday (9th January) that the values that have always shaped The Sims "are unchanged", adding: "The Sims has always been more than a game. It’s a canvas for life in all its unpredictable forms…the chaotic moments, the tiny joys, the big dreams, every identity, every version of you. And, thanks to you, The Sims has grown into something bigger than we ever imagined: a living world bursting with creativity, expression, humour, chaos, and heart.</p>
<p>"Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future."</p>
<p>Following this pledge, the team opened up on the future of the franchise, saying it's "building a family of new Sims experiences across PC, console, and mobile", and will put "single-player life simulation experiences" at the heart of its work, confirming singleplayer games will "always be a part" of the games' future.</p><p>As for "Project Rene?" Thanks to your feedback, that has evolved into a "social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game", but is "not the successor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> and is a separate experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience". Playtesting for The Sims Lab continues, with the team assuring players that "these tests are works in progress with experimental game features, concept imagery, naming conventions (The Sims Labs: Life Together, The Sims Labs: Town Stories) and ideas in motion. Some concepts evolve and sometimes an experiment won’t move forward at all".</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-a-replacement-seemingly-waiting-in-the-wings-ea-announces-the-sims-mobile-is-shutting-down-in-january">EA is shutting down The Sims Mobile</a> after seven years, with servers going offline - and all content becoming unplayable - on 20th January. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sims-mobile">The Sims Mobile</a> launched for iOS and Android in 2017, delivering a free-to-play Sims-style experience broadly similar to that of the main series.</p>
<p>From this month, however, EA announced there would be no further content updates or events for The Sims Mobile, and the publisher has now confirmed the game's imminent closure, sharing a detailed timeline for its shutdown. While EA hasn't given a reason for The Sims Mobile's shutdown, it's likely in order to clear the way for its new mobile game, currently being referred to as The Sims Labs: Town Stories.</p>

            <p>
Hear ye, hear ye, another extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> is almost upon us, this time the smaller but still quite bold in scope Sand: Raiders of Sophie. Last time I personally heard of this game it was just called Sand, which doesn't sound great for that whole search engine thing, though I'm not entirely convinced by the subtitle. Anyway, this extraction shooter is set in an alternate 1910 where you get to roam the desert in a steampunky fortress with legs, and it's got a release month!
</p>
<p>
That release month isn't too far away either, being March, though a month is all you're getting right now as there's no specific date in sight. The perils of game development, I would guess. For those that haven't heard of Sand before, it's a PvPvE extraction shooter where you build large, mobile buildings called Tramplers, a sort of 20th century version of the titular castle from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/howl">Howl</a>'s Moving Castle. You then operate these Tramplers, driving them around so to speak, taking down other players' creations with various weapons you may have attached.

<p>
On the ground level, you as essentially a regular Joe will trawl the "once-resource-rich world of Sophie," all so that you can "uncover hidden riches in the barren wastelands, rectify historical injustices," and lay claim to what you believe is rightfully yours (what that is, I can't tell you). 
</p><p>
There's shooting, there's things to find and extract, there's not-zombies to keep you on your toes when other players aren't about. All of it looks fairly par for the course, the real selling point here are the Tramplers, at least from an outside perspective. If any of this takes your fancy, you can wishlist Sand: Raiders of Sophie right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1431300/SAND_Raiders_of_Sophie/">here</a>.

<p>Nintendo has denied claims that generative AI was used in promotional images for their new “My Mario” toy line.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced on Thursday, January 8, 2025, that its My Mario products would launch in the United States on February 19. On social media, they advertised the lineup with pictures of parents playing with their children and several products from the new line. Some who saw the images raised concerns that the company was using generative AI in its marketing, citing the way adults’ hands appear in some of the photos.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-and-campaign-actress-deny-gen-ai-usage">Nintendo And Campaign Actress Deny Gen AI Usage</h2>



<p>One of the models, Brittoni O’myah Sinclair, even commented on Nintendo’s Instagram post to deny using generative AI in the campaign. Now, Nintendo has commented on the matter, telling Insider Gaming that no generative AI was used in the campaign.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The topic of generative AI continues to become more prominent in gaming as Gen AI tools become more commonplace and accessible. Recently, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stripped of its wins </a>at The Indie Game Awards due to the use of generative AI. Also, Larian Studios, the developers of Divinity, recently said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">they would not use Gen AI</a> tools for concept art or dialogue.</p>
