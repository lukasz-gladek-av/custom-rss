		<p>In a roadmap update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>, 11 bit studios has revealed that the console port of their post-apocalyptic city builder is planned for release this summer.</p>
<p>The Frostpunk 2 roadmap now has three major landmarks on it with fairly well defined time windows. 8th May will see the first free major content update that will make adjustments to the City’s management, before the console port arrives at some point in the summer. There’s then an autumn target for the Spectrum DLC.</p>


<p>Further away is two more DLC packs. The Aurora DLC is still expected this year, while the untitled DLC 3 is coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown from 11 bit:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>May 8th</b> – A day to be remembered: a <b>Free Major Content Update</b> that will adjust the City’s management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners.</li>
<li><b>Summer</b> – A grand undertaking: the <b>Console Port</b>.</li>
<li><b>Autumn</b> – Reaching the <b>Spectrum DLC</b>, which may help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one…</li>
</ul>
<p>They also hint that fans of these gritty city builders should keep an eye out for a seventh anniversary celebration of the original game on 24th April.</p>

			<p>While Monster Hunter Wilds is a more than worthy new entry in the series, the game leaves a lot to be desired in terms of image quality and performance on all platforms, and the massive performance issues many are experiencing on PC may be caused by how the game handles streaming data to the GPU.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> released their first look at the PC version of the game, highlighting how the positive first impressions one may get from the detailed graphics settings are soon turned around by bad image quality, low-quality textures that likely suffer from texture decompression issues, and subpar performance. From the testing conducted by the tech experts, there's a very good chance the performance issues are caused by how the game handles data streaming data to the GPU, as it has been noted that frametime gets really bad on mid and low-range GPUs by turning the camera around quickly, whereas frametime remains acceptable without moving the camera or turning it slowly in the same identical scenario with very little going on. The same issue is found on more powerful GPUs, although it is more mitigated and slightly less of an issue.&nbsp; Given how the same issue still happens with low texture quality, Digital Foundry surmises that these Monster Hunter Wilds performance issues may not be caused by VRAM usage but by data streaming to the GPU, as there's the chance that the game could still be streaming things in and maybe decompressing textures in an unnecessarily aggressive manner.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds PC - Profound Perf Problems Must Be Addressed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0yhacyXcizA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's not just mid- and low-range GPUs that cannot run Monster Hunter Wilds with decent performance, but also more powerful high-end GPUs like the recently released RTX 5080. A new video put together by MxBenchmarkPC highlights how the second most powerful GPU currently available on the market can barely hit the 60 FPS mark at 4K resolution, highest setting, which is truly baffling, considering the game doesn't push visual quality boundaries in any way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds on the RTX 5080 - A Solid Candidate for the Most Unoptimized Game of 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUsLUP4tsSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance issues outlined above align with my experience, as the game is not running smoothly at all on my RTX 4080. It is a shame that the game's launch is marred by these issues, as it is a very solid game.

            <p>Playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s Kislev campaign on release was one of the best storified strategy game times I've had in years, launch issues be thrice-damned, triple cooked, and three times a lady. But the Slavic bulwark against stinky, angry, tricksy and horny invaders has lost some lustre since. The details in <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/67">Creative Assembly's latest blog</a> are still a work in progress, but give a solid idea of how Kislev as a faction are changing in a patch due mid-March.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Creative Assembly said a while back that they'd be tweaking the pricing structure for the Shadows Of Change DLC to bring it in line with the a la carte factions from other recent expansions. The Kislev-Cathay-Tzeentch expansion was beefed up post-release with new units, and now it's getting some more love: joining Kislev, Now It's Ursunal are toys for Kairos Fateweaver, and suprise new units for Cathay and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ogre">Ogre</a> Kingdoms.</p>

<p>The biggest news here is that they've axed the supporter race between Katarin and Assputin completely. You'll instead "curry favour with the Orthodoxy to improve your common line troops, strengthen your economy and improve your invocations. And support the Ice court in order to improve your elite infantry, spellcasting and hero usage."</p>
<p>This isn't a race, but there'll apparently be consequences ("unrest") if you focus too much on one side over the other. I'm torn over this. I'm up for regular buffs and army theming all day long, but it sounds like there's already a single correct way to play baked in to the system, with perhaps just a little leeway to make choices if you don't want to suffer penalties. I'd say I'd withhold judgement but the judgement has clearly already wriggled out from  my grasp and made itself known, in print no less.</p>
<p>Also dead is the ubiquitous province control system, replaced with an updated version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>. "It acts much like Control, but can be spent on local invocations to temporarily boost the local province, or to empower an army temporarily".</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Total-Warhammer-kislev-rework-2.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Creative Assembly</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The tech tree is getting an overhaul ("no longer locked behind owning the Kislev capitals"!) as is the Attamans system. They're getting their own unique skill trees, plus the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Atamans now enable a new feature for settlements, tentatively called “Garrison Sally Attack” where you can command settlements managed by them to engage enemies within a limited distance, as if the settlements themselves were armies. Of course, the capital of the province is lead by the Ataman himself, who takes the field with the garrison during this attack."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exciting because it a) just sounds very useful and b) opens up the possibility of Wood Elf tree settlements being able to uproot themselves and branch batter invaders somewhere down the line.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Total-Warhammer-kairos-rework-1.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Creative Assembly</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For fate-weaving failbird Kairos, there's a whole pick n' mix lore system:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The core promise of the fragments of sorcery feature was versatility to build your own composite lore. And the design quickly narrowed in on a true “any combination you want” feature that completely did away with the idea of an ancillary slot, and moved the decision making to its own tab of the character detail panel."</p></blockquote>
<p>Do pop over to the blog for some more detailed visuals, but it basically looks like you'll be able to slot in what spells you want and switch between heads to access more than usual. It's a touch vague at the moment though.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two new units: grenadiers for Cathay and Gnoblar slingers for the Ogre Kingdoms. The grenadiers are vulnerable but powerful bomb hurlers with a debuff stun grenade, and the slingers look like Skavenslave slingers but less perfect, beautiful, graceful, and valiant.</p>
<p>I do enjoy all the work in progress art for its transparency in revealing that videogames look mostly awful for 95% of their development. I once played a grey box version of a game where all the characters in cutscenes had their faces replaced by real time clips of the actors doing mocap. Deeply disconcerting stuff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>AMD have finally confirmed pricing, dating, and specs-ing for their first RDNA 4 graphics cards. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ces-2025-announcements-include-what-will-probably-be-yet-another-worlds-fastest-cpu">Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT</a> will be out on March 6th, and start from $549 and $599 respectively. While these are still relatively fat stacks o' cash, AMD say they’ll compete with Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">RTX 5070</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review">RTX 5070 Ti</a> – and considering the latter is supposed to start at $749, with most models currently going for above $800, that could make for a tasty undercutting.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The RTX 5070 hasn’t launched yet and its $549 MSRP is dead even with that of the RX 9070, though the Radeon does have an edge in the VRAM department, with 16GB to the GeForce’s 12GB. The RX 9070 XT shares this spec, while upping boost clock speeds from 2.54GHz to 2.97GHz and adding a few more RDNA Compute Units (64 to 56 on the RX 9070). Its RT Accelerator count also comes in at 64 to the RX 9070’s 56, so expect superior ray tracing performance as well.</p>
<p>Obviously, in the absence of reliable benchmarks, we can’t say for now which will be best for that crucial GPU workload of Making Numbers Go Bigger. Still, I’d argue that Nvidia and AMD haven’t so much been competing on framerates these last few years as they have on those secondary technologies: DLSS, FSR, frame generation and so on. And here, the Radeon versions have been hopelessly outmatched, be it on visual quality, general performance, or even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">breadth of support among games</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are, in some ways, most RTX-like than any Radeon GPU has been for ages. By embracing a similar flavour of AI and machine learning, they’ll be the first (and, for a while, only) cards to support FSR 4, which itself is abandoning the GPU-agnostic rule of previous versions by basing its upscaling and anti-aliasing on that very same robot brain tech. In other words, FSR is becoming much more DLSS-y. This won’t extend to copying the Multi Frame Generation component of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a>, but FSR 4’s standard 2x frame gen is supposedly much sharper than stabler than that of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>, while the upscaling component aims to make drastic improvements to image quality. FSR 4 will also have over 30 compatible games at launch, dozens more than FSR 3 did, and rising to 75 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Given DLSS 4 has only just launched, I think it’s probably fine if FSR 4 simply plays catch-up to DLSS on picture quality, rather than surpassing it – and for $200 less, the RX 9070 XT could be one compelling card if it can simultaneously match the RTX 5070 Ti’s core performance. Of course, GPUs are in high demand right now, and it would be unsurprising (if deeply unfortunate) for these RDNA 4 cards to suffer the same problem of price-hiked and under-stocked partner models that the RTX 50 series is buckling under. AMD, one suspects, will be crossing their fingers that the eBay reseller crowd already has their hands full with garages of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080s</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sure, it might seem like the most counter-cultural act imaginable amidst these late-stage capitalism end-of-days horrors, but the very internet on which you’re reading these words wouldn’t exist without it. The games you play depend on it. It’s the very core of art itself. So, it’s generally a pretty good thing when games industry people remember this. Speaking of which, EA just made the code for the first four <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games officially open source.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,196663,194143" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You may, as someone possibly young enough to have been untroubled by the <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games in their heyday, see this as a relatively minor act. It’s really, <em>really</em> not. And if we’re going to be fiercely critical of EA when it does horrible things, it’s also crucial that we celebrate when the publisher does something this important.</p><p>Two primers. <strong>Firstly, <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em></strong>, or <em>C&amp;C</em> as it’s mostly known to its adoring fanbase. These were a series of utterly superb real-time strategy games, sometimes the best in the medium,  gloriously loved in part for their kitschy full-motion video cutscenes. The first game, in 1995, sold <em>three million copies </em>in a time before games really did that, and that was despite its FMV sequences starring members of the development team in the lowest-budget way imaginable.</p><p>As the series went on, these cutscenes began to star some really big names, the likes of James Earl Jones, J.K. Simmons, George Takei, Tim Curry, Jonathan Pryce, and—uh-oh—Gina Carano. The release of a new entry was always a big deal, with gaming magazines inevitably plastering them over front pages and  reviews so frequently glowing. So while the name “<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>” may not mean so much in 2025, 17 years after the last decent game in the series—<em>Red Alert 3</em>—it remains one of the most significant franchises in gaming history.</p><p><strong>Secondly, source codes.</strong> Any game being made publicly available for free (as in: yours to keep, copy, share forever) is to be celebrated, in an industry that usually so spitefully clings on to long-dead IPs that it refuses to sell, but still employs lawyers to prevent being accessible. But releasing a game’s source code is next level. This is not the game itself, as in a thing to boot up and play, but rather the flesh and bones that makes the game exist. It’s <em>all the secrets</em>. It offers developers the ability to see exactly how a game was put together, read all the hilariously botched bits of code the devs strung together in desperation to get a game out the door, and learn how the best in the business constructed their games.</p><p>Very few games publishers ever allow access to a game’s source code, even if they’re willing to let a game be freely shared. It’s not always possible—code is lost or difficult to put all in one place, and licenses can be nightmarish. But even when it is easily doable, it’s still a rarity. Often this is simply because developers are desperately embarrassed, horrified at the idea of their peers learning just how precariously held together their code proves to be, even though that’s the case for absolutely everyone else’s work too! Also, people are shitty, and there’s always grim hostility as code is judged by people who couldn’t do better. Sometimes it’s because sharing source code can give people the impression that you’re also now available for tech support, there to answer every question about every detail, and no one wants or needs that. But too often it’s because of a belief that these are industry secrets, precious treasures that must be sat upon for all of time lest a rival do something so inhumanly awful as <em>copy</em>.</p><p>So, given all this context, this move by EA is really significant, and incredibly welcome. Because going “open source” is even bigger than has already been suggested. Publishing the code under <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GPL license</a></span> means that absolutely anybody is now allowed to take that code, make even minor changes to it, and then sell it for profit! Clearly, not many would pay for such low-effort output, but that’s the core of the principle here. It’s the same basis on which Linux distributions are published, along with all the free software that runs on it. It’s free, open code, there for the wider public to learn from, adapt, and reinterpret.</p><p>The four games now having their code published under the GPL are <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, <em>C&amp;C: Red Alert</em>, <em>C&amp;C: Renegade</em> (a first-person shooter!), and <em>C&amp;C: Generals</em>.</p><p>EA isn’t alone here, of course. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/id-software&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/id-software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">id Software was known for many years</a></span> for publishing the source code for its games a few years after release. (Unfortunately  id, now owned by Microsoft, doesn’t seem to have any interest in continuing the trend.) Epic, another company built in the ‘90s on principles of shareware and shared code, also releases <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/RedPandaProjects/UnrealEngine&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/RedPandaProjects/UnrealEngine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">older versions of the Unreal Engine</a></span>, as well as games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unreal-engine-epic-free-internet-archive-fortnite-1851698320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unreal-engine-epic-free-internet-archive-fortnite-1851698320"><em>Unreal </em>and <em>Unreal Tournament</em></a></span>.</p><p>What makes this <em>Command &amp; Conquer </em>move quite so striking is that it’s EA doing it. They’re not exactly a company known for, let’s say, loving acts of kindness. In more recent years, the publisher has become synonymous with the lowest aspects of video gaming, from forcing its games to be played with an internet connection before the era of widely-available broadband, to gacha awfulness with its gambling-adjacent loot boxes. In fact, the <em>C&amp;C</em> name itself was run into the ground until it was all but worthless after EA forced in always-on DRM to hastily made sequels and released terrible free-to-play mobile versions. </p><figure id="" data-id="153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-recommend-id="image://153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-recommend-id="image://153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? Is this a crack in their tough, outer veneer? A sign of a future EA that is interested in games preservation, and the open and free sharing of intellectual property from which it no longer has a means to meaningfully profit? Because dear God, I hope so.</p><p>And I hope other publishers sit up and take notice about how we’re all now making cooing noises and scratching EA under its chin, rather than simply scowling at it. This should be normal! It’s essentially free to a publisher—you just stick the source code on Github and eat your lumps. Somehow one of the most controversial things I ever wrote was suggesting that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games should go into the public domain a full 20 years after their first release</a></span>, despite this seeming like the most sensible, industry-boosting action possible, at a point when publishers are no longer making real money from the original versions. OK, so in the case of most the games being made available here, we’re talking closer to 30 years. But I’ll take it!</p><p>So come on, everyone! A revolution! EA, give us the source code for <em>Sim City 2000</em>! LucasFilm, hand over <em>Day of the Tentacle</em>! Activision, share <em>MechWarrior 2</em> with everyone! Just imagine the learning resources that could be out there, the archive of code for the most important games of past generations, and the absolute assurance of their preservation for the future.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sequels are hallmark of the video game industry, but no one should expect Diablo 5 anytime soon. Blizzard's Rod Fergusson said in an interview that the studio intends for Diablo 4 to stick around "for years" to come.</p><p>Diablo 4 is embracing a sort-of live-service approach with plans for yearly expansions--however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">2025's expansion is now coming in 2026</a>.

                <p> Over a decade ago, Skype was one of the big features that Microsoft boasted about for Xbox One--which the company coined the "all in one experience." Today, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/02/28/the-next-chapter-moving-from-skype-to-microsoft-teams/">Microsoft has announced plans</a> to shut down the video-conferencing app entirely in May, with the ability to transfer data over to Teams.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2013, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2013/05/22/xbox-reveal-skype-blog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skype was going to be one of the ways the Xbox One stood out</a> in the gaming industry, letting you video chat while playing Titanfall and watching TV with Snap. Remember Snap? It was the feature that put secondary applications on the right side of the screen for Xbox One.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Skype worked with voice controls, as Microsoft touted saying things like, "Hey Xbox, Skype Mom!" This was possible as the system was initially bundled with Kinect for Xbox One. On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk-a_Pj4uHM">YouTube</a>, Skype even marketed the features with a silly promo video featuring comedian Bobby Lee.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk-a_Pj4uHM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lk-a_Pj4uHM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Since then, Xbox head honcho Phil Spencer has admitted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/">the entertainment-focused approach to Xbox One was a mistake</a> and ultimately led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-sales-were-less-than-half-of-the-ps4/1100-6506476/">PS4 dominating Xbox One last generation in hardware sales</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems as though a Skype app was available on Xbox Series X|S but pulled from the Xbox Store in the past couple of years, per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/13vwz5c/did_they_remove_skype_from_xbox/?rdt=47026" rel="nofollow ">this Reddit post</a>. Keep in mind Kinect doesn't work in any capacity with Xbox Series X|S, either.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-to-acquire-skype-for-85-billion/1100-6312959/" data-ref-id="1100-6312959">Microsoft acquired Skype for $8.5 billion</a> in early 2013.

At a glance, those picks aren’t that odd. <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>had starters that originated in regions different from the Sinnoh one it was set in. However, given two of them are from Gen II’s Johto region, fans are wondering why Cyndaquil, the fire-type porcupine-ish little guy who also debuted in <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em>, wasn’t part of the starting roster alongside Chikorita and Totodile. The most plausible reasons for the omission aren’t that interesting, but the more outlandish conspiracy theories forming around it are very funny.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you somehow missed it last year, <em>Pokémon </em>developer Game Freak was subject to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688">a massive leak in October</a></span>.

The internet had a field day with it and the fire starter’s reputation hasn’t recovered from the scandal. Now, fans are spinning tales that the reason Cyndaquil isn’t joining its Johto starters in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is that Game Freak may have thought it was too soon to put it back in the spotlight. The more likely explanation is that Cyndaquil was a starter in <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, and Game Freak probably didn’t want to double-dip in the same subseries. But nevertheless, fans are running with the theory, and while some think the Typhlosion jokes are dead, I am still laughing.</p><p>Typhlosion has gotten some recent love, so it’s not like Cyndaquil fans are starving. The Pokémon got a brand new Hisuian form in <em>Legends: Arceus</em> that is arguably even cooler than its Johto region variant. But even if he’s not a starter this time, hopefully the little guy still shows up in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> as an obtainable Pokémon when the game launches later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-reveal-trailer-shows-ciri-and-mioni-are-mirrors-of-each-other/1100-6529728/" data-ref-id="1100-6529728">behind-the-scenes video</a> about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>'s impressive announcement trailer came together featured footage of the character Ciri sporting a different look--or at least that's what some fans thought they saw in the footage. The game's director has now responded, saying the studio has not modified Ciri's look and attempted to explain why her character model in the behind-the-scenes video may appear to look different from the trailer itself.</p><p>"The behind-the-scenes video features the same in-game model of Ciri as seen in the original trailer. We have not modified it," <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1895148428176375925" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sebastian Kalemba said</a>. "What you're seeing is raw footage--without facial animation, lighting, or virtual camera lenses."</p><p>Kalemba also assured fans that the newly released footage in the behind-the-scenes video represents a "work-in-progress snapshot" of Ciri's look.</p><p>"This variation is a natural part of the game development process. At this point, any character's appearance may vary depending on the medium--whether it's in a trailer, a 3D model, or in-game," he said.</p><p>After the original Witcher trilogy focused on Geralt, The Witcher 4 tells its story from the perspective of Ciri. Kalemba previously talked about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">Ciri was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4.</a></p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games, which are in development alongside CD Projekt's other games, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher remake.</a> The Witcher 4, like CD Projekt's other games, is being made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5 following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-explains-why-its-using-unreal-engine-5/1100-6502196/" data-ref-id="1100-6502196">CD Projekt and Epic striking a major development deal. </a></p>

            <p>A new Witcher novel is due out later this year, from original author Andrzej Sapkowski, which will follow a teen Geralt.</p>
<p>The prequel will be called Crossroads of Ravens in English (Rozdroże Kruków in Polish) and focus on an 18-year-old Geralt setting out from Kaer Morhen on his first mission where he'll "discover monsters, traitors, some new friends and some familiar faces, and just how deeply feared and despised Witchers can be".</p>
<p>Yes, Sapkowski stated he'd finished the Witcher saga back in 1999, but he returned in 2013 with Season of Storms, and now will return once again.</p>

<p>"In Rozdroże Kruków I return to the roots of Geralt's journey - not the fearless monster slayer we know, but a young Witcher just beginning to understand the burden of his destiny," said Sapkowski.</p>
<p>"Imagine Geralt, but younger, with fewer scars and a bit more haughtiness. This is a story of growth, of idealism meeting harsh reality, and of choices that forge a legend. It's about finding your place in a world that's constantly challenging you to be more than you thought you could be. As this new story finds its way to readers across the globe this year, I can't wait for them to walk alongside a younger Geralt - experiencing the trials that forged him and the journey that set him on the road to his destiny."</p>
<p>The novel will be released on 30th September in an English translation by David French, responsible for translating 6 of the last 8 Witcher books. For non-English speakers, it will be translated into more than 19 other languages.</p>
<p>The novel will differ from CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">recently revealed The Witcher 4</a>. Instead of going backwards, the next game will follow the previous games as sequels to the books and has Ciri as its protagonist instead of Geralt.</p>
<p>Don't worry gruff hero fans, Geralt will still make an appearance in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">will he be playable? The developers remain coy</a>.</p>
<p>Witcher 4 will compete with The Blood of Dawnwalker, a new game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz's new studio Rebel Wolves. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-directors-dark-fantasy-rpg-the-blood-of-the-dawnwalker-gets-first-trailer">game received its first trailer</a> at the start of the year.</p>
<p>The studio is supported by NetEase and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-next-game-still-on-track-studio-says-despite-netease-funding-fears">recently confirmed it hasn't been affected by the Chinese conglomerate pulling funding</a>.</p>
<p>It also won't be the first time we see a young Geralt, as he features in Netflix anime Nightmare of the Wolf.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-use-layered-armor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds features a lot of different armor pieces, all coming with different skill combinations and stats that can be used to improve your hunter's abilities to overcome the many challenges you will find in the Forbidden Lands. All armor in the game also comes with a different appearance, but thankfully, there's no need to sacrifice functionality for looks, thanks to the game's layered armor system.</p>
<p><strong>To use layered armor</strong> in Monster Hunter Wilds, all you need to do is access the<strong> Base Camp Menu</strong> and select the <strong>Equipment Appearance</strong> option in the <strong>Appearance Menu</strong>, indicated by the first icon to the right of the menu bar. Once in the menu, you will see options to apply layered armor for the Head, Chest, Arms, Waist and Legs gear. Select the armor piece you want to apply a specific look to, pick among the available options, make sure the toggle is set to on, and you are good to go. In addition to applying the specific look of some gear onto your currently equipped gear, you can also modify the pigment of the layered armor, allowing you to make your hunter's look even more unique, toggle your undershirt and tights on or off, and change the look of your pendants. Layered armor is also available for your Palico via the Palico Equipment Appearance option also found in the Appearance Menu.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250228162355_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Monster Hunter Wilds offers right away the ability to use layered armor, you are not going to have any available option for the duration of the main campaign, as you can only unlock the layered armor look of any armor piece by crafting the High Rank version of it, which cannot be crafted until the main story has been completed and the first High Rank monsters have been hunted. If you have bought the game's Deluxe Edition, however, you will have a few layered armor options from the beginning of the game for both the hunter and your Palico. These additional layered armor sets are also available for purchase individually.</p>

While you could argue that the Ancient Alacrity is truly the best, it can’t be obtained until the final stretch of the game’s main story, making it a difficult recommendation. Meanwhile, The Long Touch can be found early and should make for an excellent weapon throughout the majority of your adventure. Here’s what you need to know about it and where to find it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h58"><a id=""></a><strong>The Long Touch passive bonus and enchantments</strong></h2><p>The Long Touch comes with the Lesser Opening Strike passive bonus, which grants +5 percent damage when hitting foes with full health.

Sell anything you don’t need from your adventures and try to save up for it if necessary. You should find plenty of gems and weapons even during this opening part of your journey, so you’ll be able to snag it in no time. I believe in you.</p><p>With The Long Touch now in your possession, head on back into the great big world of <em>Avowed</em> and start sniping bonces. And don’t forget to use those Power Shots for faster speed and fine aiming for more crit chance!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Pocketpair, the developer of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-breed-pals-guide/1100-6520645/" data-ref-id="1100-6520645">Palworld</a>, is declaring today a special day off just to let its employees dive into Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Pocketpair wrote on social media that it had received word from several of its employees that they might be feeling sick on the last day of the month, which just so happened to be the day of Monster Hunter Wilds' release. Instead of insisting that employees show up as scheduled, Pocketpair gave them a holiday.</p><p>Palworld's community manager, Bucky, subsequently <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1895239908031373790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed that this is what happened</a>. It's a very nice gesture, and probably well-deserved.

		<p><em>If you've played video games for long enough...hell, if you've had any hobby long enough, you probably have boxes full of stuff and things related to it. The boxes get full over time, and then you have to find somewhere to put the boxes. </em></p><p><em>Maybe you should, instead, open the box and determine what it's in the box, but it's so much easier to put that box somewhere out of sight. That's a problem for another day. Or is it a problem at all? Who doesn't like a box they can revisit?</em></p><p><em>You might expect that Patrick and Rob take to this problem in different ways, but there is one universal truth: we all have boxes and we all have stuff in them. </em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> The past few months we’ve moved a lot of things into storage. I know Janet’s position on storage units, that anything that ends up in a storage unit is probably something you should just have gotten rid of, but <em>deciding </em>what to keep and what to get rid of requires a lot of consideration in itself. That’s especially true if you’ve <em>already </em>been through several rounds of downsizing your possessions. The stuff MK and I are throwing into boxes is almost always a sentimental in some fashion, or would immediately be useful the second we get a larger place, and so for a few bucks a month we have the luxury of clearing space in our house without needing to decide what space we’ll clear in our lives for stuff like my collections of BattleTech novels or <em>D&amp;D </em>campaign records from thirty years ago.</p><p>The other day I was emptying out my closet to get it ready for painting and I hit what remains of my old video game collection. Lot of PS3 and 360 discs of doubtful utility, a smaller number of PS4 discs, and then absolutely nothing from this current era. But then I hit the PC stuff. The discount Sierra Classics edition of <em>Red Baron</em>. <em>Myth II: Soulblighter</em> with its manual. <em>X-Wing Alliance</em>. <em>Takeda 3</em>, also with its manual. Multiple versions of <em>Thief: The Dark Project</em>. <em>The Last Express</em> jewelcase.</p><p>The list goes on, but not as long as I’d like. More importantly, what I have are bits and pieces of a collection I mostly lost. Some of it was lost when my parents’ home flooded, but I think I’d already tossed most of my old game boxes and manuals. I very much doubt I’d still have them today, for the same reasons it’s easy to roll your eyes at someone moving stuff into storage as opposed to the trash. Why keep such massively oversized packaging, and reams of documentation that you haven’t looked at in years? Yet as I put stuff into another banker’s box for storage, I started kicking myself for not hanging onto more of that material. I’d trade a lot of the easily replaceable paperbacks and comic collections I still have in my possession for the box <em>Grim Fandango </em>came in (look what people are charging for boxes that are in good shape and you’ll see lots of people apparently share my opinion).</p><p>My point is, video game packaging and especially PC game packaging was absurdly overproduced and wasteful for much of the 90s and I absolutely regret letting go of any of it. In a weird way those boxes and manuals were <em>part </em>of the experience. I can go and play <em>TIE Fighter </em>with some compatibility futzing, but the huge art on the glossy packaging? I want to put my hands on it.</p><p>Is there anything you regret letting go of across your various moves and apartments?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshstyle?ref=remapradio.com"><span>JOSHUA COLEMAN</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I’m not sure it’s going to shock you to learn the general answer is “no.” When we lived in California across San Francisco and Los Angeles, we moved almost every year. We knew the Midwest was where we’d end up eventually, so the idea was to experience as much of the cities we were in before it all disappeared. It was mildly chaotic, but what else is the point of your 20s?</p><p>Every move, we’d go through our stuff and toss things. If you were hesitating to pack it in a box, is that really something you needed to unpack on the other side? It gave us enormous clarity, because you are ultimately, in most cases, talking about replaceable stuff if you want it again.</p><p>When I left the Midwest originally the summer after graduating college—graduated in May, moved to San Francisco in June, came back for a graduation party a few weeks later—I packed up most of my life from the northwest Chicago suburbs in boxes. Those boxes, over time, found their way to a garage in Wisconsin, and I didn’t touch them until formally moving <em>back</em> to the Midwest after my dad passed. At that point, it was time to dig into boxes of Sega Saturn games.</p><p>Because that’s what most of those boxes were: video games. DS. Wii. Nintendo 64. SNES. Genesis. GBA. Take your pick, it’s just boxes full of cartridges, discs, and potentially mice holes.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not that I do not ascribe emotions to physical items, I’m just more selective, I guess.</p><p>That journey back to the midwest involved my wife flying back with our dog. I had two friends come out, pack up what little we owned into a moving truck, and we drove my car across (half) the country. We took our sweet time. I drove during the day, another friend drove at night, and then I’d drink beers in the back with a third friend. Eventually, we’d crash at some random hotel.</p><p>At some point, we stopped to hang out at some hiking/camping area. You could also go for a swim and buddy, I love swimming. I changed clothes and removed a watch that my dad had worn while he was still around. (It was a gift from my mom). Well, I went swimming, got out, and it turns out someone had kept an eye on that watch, because it was gone when I got back.</p><p>I was so fucking mad, man. It was petty, cruel, and there was nothing I could do about it. I’ve worn an Apple Watch daily for basically 10 years now, but I’m still so bitter about losing that.</p><p>The boxes of mostly old games were moved out of that Wisconsin garage when I bought a house. They are, at the moment, mostly stuffed into plastic tubs in a closet. In theory, they will find a nicer home when we…put more shelves in? But I suspect they’ll just stay in that closet.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@lorenzoherrera?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Lorenzo Herrera</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>God I’m sorry to hear about that watch. My dad marked a few milestones in my life with a new watch (maybe an odd choice for an elementary schooler but then again my nickname was “Professor” by second grade) and I have sort of internalized the idea of a watch as a really personal, meaningful thing. I’ve still got my first watch, an Indiglo Timex my dad got for me in fifth grade. I fucking <em>loved </em>its light-up face, even if the primary purpose of the watch was to help me know when it was time to go wait for the bus. I also hung onto my first nice-ish watch, a simple brushed-steel Seiko they got me before I started high school. I still sometimes think about getting a nice timepiece but, yeah, what purpose does it serve now that the Apple Watch is always on my wrist? And yet that desire is unabated. Be honest with me: would you think it was douchey if I wore an Apple Watch on one wrist and a dapper little Tag Heuer on the other?</p><!--members-only--><p>I think a couple unique things were going on with PC game packaging in particular, though. For one thing, it’s kind of amazing how much those things had to <em>explain </em>what it was you were buying. They were designed originally for computer hobbyist shops and they used all that visual real estate to pitch you on what they were about, how they wanted you to feel about it, and even how they worked. Before they started downsizing packaging I remember some had false covers so you’d open the top panel of the box and you’d get a two-page spread of screenshots and text to further elaborate on what the exciting cover art implied. But that also means they were unusually good keepsakes of the games you bought, a way of displaying the game and thinking about it without actually firing it up.</p><p>I don’t know if it was as much a thing in console games but a lot of game manuals also opened or closed with designer’s notes, a kind of statement of purpose and acknowledgments section from the team lead behind the game. A lot of board games still have this but the practice is much scarcer in video games, in much the same ways manuals themselves have disappeared.</p><p>It’s funny, because this kind of packaging started to disappear in part because it was seen as wasteful. But I think the culture it represented was much less <em>disposable</em>. Boxes and pack-in materials were part of how a game communicated to its audience, yes, but I think they also said something about how games saw themselves and their relationship to players. The reduction in size and packaging materials might have made boxed retail games slightly less wasteful, but it also made it easier to jam more of them onto store shelves, shortly before the infinite shelf space of digital storefronts made physical editions almost irrelevant, and rendered the the idea of <em>ownership</em> a quaint notion from the past.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jiaweizhao?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Jiawei Zhao</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I, too, have thought about buying a nicer watch for nicer occasions, but I’ve only gotten as far as buying a fancier metal Apple Watch band that I never quite figured out how to configure, so I mostly just wear the sports bands that I’ve accumulated over the years in different colors and move on. But no, you could not wear both watches at the same time! (You could get away with buying a fitness ring, instead?)</p><p>What I will say about opening up those old boxes from Wisconsin, though, is better recognizing how packaging changes over time, how it reflected the ways games had to try to grab your attention. (I get a similar satisfaction from looking through a bookshelf and seeing the different sizes and editions of books. I still need to get entirely hardcover editions of<em> The Dark Tower </em>series; I have several in paperback.) The way some PC games used to package themselves back then are equivalent to today’s collector’s editions.</p><p>Which, of course, tells you a lot about the modern video game. Nobody is going to the store to figure out what to buy. You show up at the store because you already know what to buy. The box, even the <em>disc</em> in many cases, is superfluous. All that’s happening is an exchange of currency to enable playing the game, presuming the company who operates those online components doesn’t turn them off randomly later on.</p><p>If I didn’t play video games for a living, which has obviously impacted the way I think about the form, I’d probably be more precious about those boxes. It’s no surprise, then, that I spend my time and money buying goofy boxes and special editions of horror movies, instead. It’s basically fulfilling the same niche!</p><p>On some level, this contributes to why retail stores are so boring to walk through these days. There is nothing to look at, nothing to grab your eye. You already know what you wanted before walking in the door. In fact, it might be sitting behind a counter for order pick-up, if not delivered straight to your car. And that’s assuming you made the decision to step into a store at all, which is rarer and rarer these days.</p><p>Makes me wonder: What the hell is going to be in my children’s inevitable boxes in Wisconsin?</p>

It could seemingly double that by the time the weekend hits, putting it number one over the ubiquitous <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> and potentially even beating out both<em> Black Myth: Wukong </em>and <em>Palworld</em> for the all-time number 2 spot on the Valve-owned storefront. This is walloping the performance of previous games in the series: <em>Monster Hunter World </em>peaked at around 330,000 concurrent players, and <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>’s all-time peak was 230,000.</p><figure id="" data-id="9ec3965b4c646bfd6c53957afe54e738" data-recommend-id="image://9ec3965b4c646bfd6c53957afe54e738" data-format="png" data-width="1217" data-height="755" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows concurrent players on Steam.

It currently has a rating of just 47 percent, with the majority of reviews giving<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> a thumbs down over PC problems.

But rarely do those same games then go on to break franchise and Steam records.</p><p>It might be because many of the reviews read like this: “This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimization I’ve ever seen.” A common thread is that players who had no real problems with the game’s pre-launch open betas are now struggling to get decent framerates at higher resolutions. “If I can run <em>KCD2</em> and <em>Cyberpunk</em> on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this,” another review reads. Others were more glib. “I paid 70 dollars to boot a crash report,” wrote one person. “My grandma runs better than this game,” wrote another.</p><figure id="" data-id="c1d54fce6eba02cd177c172138414193" data-recommend-id="image://c1d54fce6eba02cd177c172138414193" data-format="png" data-width="914" data-height="867" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative Steam reviews.

As with everything on PC, it’s hard to know how much of this needs to be sorted out on Capcom’s end vs. players fiddling with their own drivers and settings to get better results out of their hardware.<em> Digital Foundry</em>’s assessment didn’t mince words though with a video titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yhacyXcizA&amp;t=176s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yhacyXcizA&amp;t=176s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Profound perf problems must be addressed</a></span>.” Capcom has so far responded with the usual troubleshooting guide. </p><p>That said, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> certainly doesn’t look perfect on PlayStation 5 either.

I spent most of my time with the game during my review playing at a less fluid, more cinematic 30fps for exactly that reason. On the whole though, I’ve experienced no bugs or crashes in my 40 hours with the game on console so far. </p><p>We’ll see how much of this can be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-difficulty-social-hub-free-update-1851766839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-difficulty-social-hub-free-update-1851766839">addressed in post-launch updates</a></span> and how much of it is baked into the game at a more fundamental level. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is Capcom’s first entry in the franchise on the RE engine it uses for <em>Resident Evil</em> (and most other games at this point). It could also be a reflection of just how dense bespoke monster animations and interactions are in the game. It’s nowhere near as immediately dazzling as, say, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, but there’s a liveliness and vibrancy on display few other games have shown us. Either way, it seems like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> could be this year’s <em>Helldivers 2</em> when it comes to being an online multiplayer phenomenon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>AMD's new Radeon RX 90-series cards and the RDNA4 architecture make their official debut on March 5, and a new version of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling technology is coming along with them.</p>
<p>FSR and Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscalers have the same goal: to take a lower-resolution image rendered by your graphics card, bump up the resolution, and fill in the gaps between the natively rendered pixels to make an image that looks <em>close</em> to natively rendered without making the GPU do all that rendering work. These upscalers can make errors, and they won't always look quite as good as a native-resolution image. But they're both nice alternatives to living with a blurry, non-native-resolution picture on an LCD or OLED display.</p>
<p>FSR and DLSS are especially useful for older or cheaper 1080p or 1440p-capable GPUs that are connected to a 4K monitor, where you'd otherwise have to decide between a sharp 4K image and a playable frame rate; it's also useful for hitting higher frame rates at lower resolutions, which can be handy for high-refresh-rate gaming monitors.</p>
<p>But unlike past versions of FSR, FSR 4 is upscaling images using hardware-backed machine-learning algorithms, hardware newly added to RDNA4 and the RX 90-series graphics cards. This mirrors Nvidia's strategy with DLSS, which has always leveraged the tensor cores found in RTX GPUs to run machine-learning models to achieve superior image quality for upscaled and AI-generated frames. If you don't have an RDNA4 GPU, you can't use FSR 4.</p>
