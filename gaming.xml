		<p>Vince Zampella has died in a car crash, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/?_branch_match_id=1106531065027356413&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz0tKzskvTsxLT81JLdZLLCjQy8nMy9avTMq39M32KsuKSrKvK0pNSy0qysxLj08qyi8vTi2ydU1JTwUA19eTCEIAAAA%3D">NBC Los Angeles</a> is reporting. According to the report, Vince Zampella and another passenger were travelling along the &nbsp;Southern California’s Angeles Crest Highway in a Ferrari when the car came off the road and hit a concrete barrier, ejecting one of the passengers from the car while the other was trapped in the vehicle which caught fire, dying at the scene. The ejected passenger died of their injuries at the hospital.</p>
<p>Vince Zampella has been a major figure in the games industry and credited as one of the major creators behind Call of Duty having founded Infinity Ward, releasing Call of Duty 2, and the breakout hit of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare which catapulted the series to being a household name. This was followed by Modern Warfare 2. Vince was fired from Infinity Ward by Activision along with Jason West, going on to form Respawn Entertainment, releasing Titanfall, Titanfall 2, Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. In 2020, Vince was put in charge of DICE Los Angeles and then in 2021 the entire Battlefield series.</p>


<p>Our thoughts are with Vince’s loved ones.</p>

		<p>Bloober Team has announced that Cronos: The New Dawn is going to get a new Temporal Diver Mode, which will allow players to experience the game on an easier difficulty. Not much more detail has been given regarding exactly what this will do in terms of gameplay, with Bloober Team confirming more details will be provided in early 2026. A trailer for the Temporal Diver Mode has been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Temporal Diver Mode Announced | New Game Difficulty" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2BVRu26Fug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/cronos-the-new-dawn-review/">Cronos: The New Dawn Review – Such is our calling</a></h2>
<p>In our Cronos: The New Dawn review, Steve said, <em>“Cronos: The New Dawn is a great new survival horror property and I hope we see more of The Traveller’s adventures in future. The clear influences from genre legends are combined with some original touches to make a game that feels familiar but also manages to innovate and surprise players too. The intriguing narrative, the enjoyable progression, and the challenging combat all combine to make an experience that cements Bloober’s place as horror specialists.”</em></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-side-quests-panam-dream-on-sinnerman-1850875179"><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em></a> is one of the best-looking and most impressive Switch 2 ports around. And for the rest of the month, this open-world RPG is being sold for less than $20 on the Nintendo eShop alongside a bunch of other great deals on other titles.</p> <p>Today is the start of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/#show=0&amp;p=1&amp;sort=dd&amp;f=corePlatforms&amp;corePlatforms=Nintendo+Switch+2">Nintendo’s Holiday Sale</a>, and the big star of all the deals is definitely<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Switch 2, which has been marked down from $70 to $17.50. Yes, that’s the price. That’s not a typo. It’s a discount so big that deals guru <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3malqko57bb2b">Wario64 was seemingly worried</a> it might be a glitch until a press release confirmed it to be accurate. But yup, from now until January 5, you can buy <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOorZAHCtVMvYtP0x1w2bNxy9TXgL0E9uLYngGDW_ZzHT7Lwh-SE0"><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition,</em> which includes the game’s <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion, for less than $18</a>. Wild stuff.</p>

 <p>For those who already own the port or don’t want to play it, there are other big deals and games included in Nintendo’s end-of-the-year holiday sale, including discounts on <em>RPG Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII, Silksong,</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><em>Star Wars: Outlaws,</em> which is another impressive Switch 2 port</a> that even supports cross-saves across all platforms.</p>

 <p>Here’s a list of some of the biggest and best deals we spotted in the ongoing sale. And just a heads-up that there are a few other sales events happening, so some of these deals might go away sooner than January 5. In other words, don’t wait too long to snag any of these games.</p> <ul> <li><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ult. Edition – $17.50 ($70)</em></li> <li><em>Star Wars: Outlaws – $40 ($60)</em></li> <li><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate – $13 ($33)</em></li> <li><em>Survival Kids – $33 ($50)</em></li> <li><em>Street Fighter 6 – $20 ($40)</em></li> <li><em>Cronos: The New Dawn – $45 ($60)</em></li> <li><em>Shadow Labyrinth – $20 ($30)</em></li> <li><em>SpongeBob SquarePants Titans of the Tide – $30 ($40)</em></li> <li><em>Dave The Diver – $12 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fast Fusion – $11 ($15)</em></li> <li><em>Hollow Knight Silksong – $16 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII – $46 ($70)</em></li> <li><em>Ball x Pitt – $12 ($15)</em></li> <li><em>No Man’s Sky – $24 ($60)</em></li> <li><em>NBA 2K26 – $28 ($70)</em></li> <li><em>On Piece Pirate Warriors 4 – $10 ($40)</em></li> <li><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations – $25 ($50)</em></li> <li><em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion – $49 ($70)</em></li> <li><em>Light Nightmares III – $28 ($40)</em></li> </ul>

                <p>Microsoft has said it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">committed</a> to bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo Switch, and it could be coming as soon as next year. Reporter Jez Corden <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> "the first CoD Switch version is nearly done."</p><p>He added that the game, whatever it is, will launch "in a few months."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003179459936145530" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another post</a>, Corden said the release may not be "close" but it's "on the way" for a 2026 release. He added that the game is "hitting milestones," which is a reference to how a game is proceeding through development.</p><p>It remains to be seen if the reported Call of Duty game for Switch is a port of an existing Call of Duty game, like Black Ops 7 or Warzone, or a new title.</p><p>In 2022, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-call-of-duty-on-switch-would-definitely-require-some-work-phil-spencer-says/1100-6509798/" data-ref-id="1100-6509798">"definitely" work to be done</a> to get Call of Duty running on Switch. Since then, Nintendo has released the more powerful Switch 2.</p><p>In 2023, amid the FTC vs. Microsoft court case, Microsoft said it had <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1629180356359495680" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">signed</a> a "binding 10-year legal agreement to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players." The statement said Microsoft would launch Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms "the same day as Xbox, with full features and content parity."</p><p>Then in June 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">a spokesperson for Activision said</a>, "We're committed to getting the [Call of Duty] franchise on Switch," adding that both Microsoft and Activision were working on making it happen. The companies never set any expectations for a release window, however.</p><p>If a Call of Duty game is indeed coming to Switch, one possible venue for its announcement could be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">January 2026 Xbox Developer Direct. </a></p><p>Activision has skipped Nintendo platforms for Call of Duty for more than a decade, as the last Call of Duty release on a Nintendo platform was a port of Call of Duty: Ghosts for Wii U in 2013. Call of Duty has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-has-a-long-strange-history-on-nintendo-consoles/1100-6509800/" data-ref-id="1100-6509800">long, strange history on Nintendo platforms</a>.</p><p>Since Microsoft acquired Activision and the Call of Duty series, the company has continued to release new Call of Duty games on PlayStation day-and-date with the Xbox and PC versions. </p><p>GameSpot has contacted Activision in an attempt to get more details on Call of Duty's future on Switch.</p>

<p>"It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves," he said. "We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again."</p><p>He went on to say that his philosophy is to "adapt the game to the team, and not the other way around." He said Sandfall's ambition with Expedition 33 was to make a game its developers wanted to play.</p><p>"It's making a game that you want to play. It's contradictory, but [try to] not care too much about the players, because if you care about your game, it means you care about the players ultimately," he said. "The best way for me to care about people is to make something that is sincere. If it feels human, [even] if there are little flaws here and there, it's forgivable. It just has to have a strong soul and identity."</p><p>Expedition 33 sold more than 5 million copies and won numerous awards. This included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">record nine wins at The Game Awards</a>, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">overall Game of the Year. </a></p><p>The game was recently embroiled in controversy, as The Indie Game Awards <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">revoked its Game of the Year win due to AI concerns.</a> The game also courted some controversy over its designation as an "independent" game. Its success also inspired people to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-was-under-10-million-report/1100-6536874/" data-ref-id="1100-6536874">see hope for the future when it comes to lower-budget games</a> finding success in a market dominated by many expensive sequels.</p><p>Sandfall has not said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/" data-ref-id="1100-6531816">what it will make next</a>, but it will have very big shoes to fill given the immense critical and commercial success of Expedition 33.

		<p>Patapon 1+2 Replay has received a brand new mode as part of update 1.09, challenging players to take on the Boss Rush Challenge. To access the Boss Rush Challenge players need to complete the main campaign. The Boss Rush Challenge will vary the number of bosses per stage with higher difficulty, and they will get progressively stronger. HP and army strength will carry over through a stage and when a Patapon falls they will do so without dropping a cap, but all health will be restored once fully completing a stage. Along with the new Boss Rush Challenge, there are some additional fixes too.</p>

			<p>Vince Zampella, one of the co-founders of Infinity Ward and Respawn Entertainment, and arguably one of the most renowned creators in the video game industry in terms of first-person shooters, as a co-creator of Call of Duty, and as a lead for Apex Legends, and most recently Battlefield, died in a car crash over the weekend in Southern California. </p>



<p>The tragic news comes from <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/">an NBCLA report</a>, which outlines that it was a single-car crash that was reported to the authorities at 12:45 pm on Sunday, December 21, 2025, with the vehicle hitting a concrete barrier, trapping the driver in the car as it caught on fire and ejecting the passenger. </p>



<p>Zampella was only 55 years old at the time of his death, and his loss is one that the video game industry will be feeling for years to come. He'd <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/">taken over direction of the Battlefield franchise</a> and had also taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">a major role within EA as one of the company's leads under its EA Entertainment branch</a>, in recent years, though he's mostly known for his time at Infinity Ward, where he was one of the key leads behind the original Modern Warfare series within the Call of Duty franchise.</p>



<p>The news has prompted several developers and industry figures to share some words about Zampella and  the impact he had on the industry and on their lives, and to offer condolences to his family, who are the ones, more than anyone, who will feel his loss the most.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, EA has yet to put out an official statement regarding Zampella's death. We will update this article when that occurs. Our condolences go out to Vince Zampella's family and friends. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tabletop publishing giant Asmodee now completely owns <em>Exploding Kittens</em>. After several years of a strategic investment in the studio, the publisher recently made a move to purchase the remaining stock of the company, gaining complete control over the party game brand.</p><h2>Asmodee's Complete Control of Exploding Kittens</h2><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/board-games/asmodee-exploding-kittens-buyout" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Wargamer</a>, Asmodee exercised a call option to purchase the 45% minority stake in <em>Exploding Kittens</em>. Since the publisher already owned a 55% stake in the company back in 2021, this would bring 100% ownership of the company under Asmodee. This was a previously communicated intention by Asmodee.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Asmodee states that the purchase price of the remaining stake will be determined based on the operational performance of Exploding Kittens Inc. for the full year January-December 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>Asmodee's control of <em>Exploding Kittens</em> is a decision that won't adversely affect the studio's output. Both companies have been working closely since 2016, when Asmodee began distributing the studio's games in Europe. In addition, Asmodee's strategic purchases of tabletop developers has been a consistent business practice by the tabletop giant.</p><p><em>Exploding Kittens</em> has undeniable clout when it comes to party games. The titular party game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/interview-shane-small-exploding-kittens" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">insanely popular</a> on release, spawning an animated Netflix show and countless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-good-vs-evil-card-game-announced" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">spin-offs</a>. It even led to the developer creating other popular party games like <em>Throw Throw Burrito </em>and <em>Hand-to-Hand Wombat</em>.</p><p>Admittedly, the studio has also been known for weird marketing stunts and unusual controversy. They had to do a safety recall on several goggles included in copies of <em>Throw Throw Burrito</em> for being <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-goggles-might-explode-on-you-product-recall-issued" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">explosive hazards</a>. Then, back during the hype cycle around NFTs, the studio decided to partner with a 3D printing company for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-to-produce-limited-run-printable-nfts" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">"physical NFTs."&nbsp;</a></p><p>As for how Asmodee will guide <em>Exploding Kittens</em>, both as a creative studio and as a brand, that is something only time will tell.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a brand new update for <em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, and if you like to challenge yourself, then this one's for you.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2383200/view/492711745752663122" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>, the Boss Rush Challenge mode will see you taking on bosses from across both <em>Patapon </em>games included in the collection, and you'll have to clear the main scenario for each title if you want to try out its Boss Rush feature.</p><p>The number of bosses, as well as the strength of the bosses that appear, will vary from stage to stage, and your army's health and status will be retained throughout each stage, although a set amount of HP will be recovered from battle to battle.</p><figure role="group">

<p>When you clear Boss Rush stages, you'll return to how things were before you began, so you don't need to worry about any permanent changes; it's very much an additional mode that runs alongside your main adventures.</p><p>As announced on Bandai Namco's <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/2003133429727088664" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">official X account</a>, original <em>Patapon </em>designer Rolito is back on board, having provided new artwork specifically for the Boss Rush mode, so if you're a fan of the <em>Patapon </em>art style (and who isn't?), then you'll get a special kick out of this one too.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, it is, as the name suggests, a collection that includes remastered versions of the first two <em>Patapon </em>games, which were originally released on Sony's excellent PSP handheld.</p><p>The games are a sort of combination of rhythm-action and RPG in which you need to hit buttons in time with the (brilliant) music in order to advance your army and defeat a series of enemies. You can check out the Boss Rush update trailer, which shows off <em>Patapon</em>'s gorgeous art style, right here.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the <em>Patapon </em>revival doesn't stop with this collection, either; a spiritual successor, <em>Ratatan</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratatan-early-access-release-date-september" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f2e2199-a7b4-4859-8f58-46cef0a83ab5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released this year</a>, and it's getting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratatan-update-christmas-day" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6860479b-517c-4243-b770-0b22c034f105" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">massive update on Christmas Day</a> as well, so you might want to check that out if you want more rhythm-action goodness.</p><p>You can check out <em>Patapon 1+2 Replay </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2383200/PATAPON_12_REPLAY/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/patapon-1-2-replay/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/patapon-1-plus-2-replay-switch/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

                <p>Vince Zampella, the co-founder of Infinity Ward and one of the leading figures behind the first Call of Duty game, has passed away. Zampella was reportedly in a single-car accident on Sunday, December 21 in the San Gabriel Mountains when the vehicle went off the road and hit a concrete barrier.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/?utm_medium=share&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz0tKzskvTsxLT81JLdZLLCjQy8nMy9avTMq39M32KsuKSrKvK0pNSy0qysxLj08qyi8vTi2ydcsEiuVXAADMQ28FRQAAAA%3D%3D&amp;_branch_match_id=1531733479725395701" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBC4 Los Angeles</a>, the driver of the vehicle perished in a car fire while the passenger was ejected and died at the hospital. The report didn't share any further specifics about the incident.</p><p>Zampella got his start in the video game industry in the late '90s with stints at GameTek, Atari, Interactive Media/Ripcord Games, and SegaSoft. In 1999, he joined 2015 Inc and became the lead designer of the third Medal of Honor game, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, which was published by EA.</p><p>Following a dispute with EA, Zampella, Grant Collier, and Jason West co-founded Infinity Ward and partnered with Activision before launching the Call of Duty franchise in 2003. "The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," said Zampella <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-exists-because-ea-were-dicks-says-vince-zampella/1100-6535420/" data-ref-id="1100-6535420">during a recent interview</a>.</p><p>Zampella and West remained at Activision until 2010 when they were fired by the company over alleged insubordination. The pair subsequently filed a lawsuit against Activision that was settled out of court for undisclosed terms. They went on to co-founded Respawn Entertainment, which released titles including Apex Legends, Titanfall, and the Star Wars Jedi games. Respawn was ultimately purchased by EA.</p><p>EA put Zampella in charge of DICE in 2020 with a mandate to revitalize the Battlefield franchise. Those efforts paid off earlier this year when Battlefield 6 was released to great acclaim and higher-then expected sales numbers.</p><p>Zampella had a major impact on the games industry, with many sharing memories of him on social media.

              <p>On Sunday, Vince Zampella, executive vice president at EA, head of Respawn, and one of the devs who helped create <em>Call of Duty</em>, was killed in a car crash in Southern California.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/"><em>NBC4</em> reported that Zampella</a> was killed in a single-car crash involving a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS that happened on December 21 at 12:45 pm local time on a road north of Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Mountains. California Highway Patrol told the outlet that the car veered off the road and collided with a concrete barrier. The car’s passenger was ejected from the vehicle. The driver was reportedly trapped in the ensuing car fire and died at the scene. The passenger reportedly died later at a nearby hospital.</p> <p>No details have been released as to why the car crashed, nor did <em>NBC</em> specify if Zampella was the one driving.</p> <p>“It’s hard to process this right now. He was such a force in the industry and for him to be just gone I still can’t believe,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/witdarkstar.bsky.social/post/3mam2erg6bk2s">shared</a> Respawn developer Patrick Wren on social media.</p>

 <p>“I was fortunate enough to work with Vince a few times, and it was always a pleasure. This sucks,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thevowel.bsky.social/post/3mam2borh622r">posted</a> former Xbox operations manager Eric Neustadter.</p> <p>The 55-year-old game developer was one of the key people behind the creation of <em>Call of Duty.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/when-call-of-dutys-creators-left-they-took-a-lot-of-pe-5817329">He later left that franchise</a> and helped co-found Respawn in 2010 with fellow <em>CoD</em> developer Jason West. The studio’s first game was the critically acclaimed Xbox-only, EA-published <em>Titanfall</em>. It would later produce a sequel, a popular battle royale spin-off, and two highly successful <em>Star Wars</em> action games, <em>Jedi: Fallen Order</em> and <em>Jedi: Survivor.</em> In 2017, Respawn was acquired by EA and became a key part of the publisher’s roster of studios. In 2021, Zampella was put in charge of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-modern-day-specialists-classes-release-da-1851649399"><em>Battlefield</em> and helped the series rebound</a> with this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-sales-black-ops-7-charts-2000645794">massively successful <em>Battlefield 6</em>,</a> which is one of 2025’s biggest games. Meanwhile, the franchise he helped create, <em>Call of Duty</em>, continues to be one of the biggest game franchises in the world.</p> <p><strong>Update 12/22/2025 4:10 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</strong>EA sent over this statement to <em>Kotaku</em>:</p> <blockquote><p>This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.</p></blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto: Tokyo ‘Almost Happened,’ Says Former Rockstar Dev]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-tokyo-almost-happened-says-former-rockstar-dev/</link>
            <guid>1390468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Grand Theft Auto franchise was very close to branching out with a game set in the Japanese capital of Tokyo, a former Rockstar dev confirmed, before eventually being scrapped.</p>



<p>GTA has become synonymous with the USA over the years, with Rockstar creating the likes of Liberty City, San Andreas, and Vice City as counterparts to New York, California, and Florida, and it’s been over 25 years since GTA briefly visited the streets of London, and an exit from North America now seems extremely unlikely.</p>



<p>However, a game based in Tokyo was on the agenda in the past and “almost happened,” though the idea was later scrapped.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-tokyo-almost-happened">GTA: Tokyo Almost Happened</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Almost. Image via Rockstar</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesHub</a>, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij, who worked on the likes of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas, confirmed that discussions did take place for a Tokyo-based version of the game to release.</p>



<p>“We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan was going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn’t happen in the end,” he said.</p>



<p>With the GTA franchise ballooning further since the release of GTA V, and the huge anticipation for GTA 6, Vermeij believes the time has passed for a move to another continent to take place, and believes it wouldn’t work.</p>



<p>“People love having these wild ideas, but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it, it’s too easy to go let’s do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicentre of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities.</p>



<p>“I think it’s unlikely it’s going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there’s just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn’t make sense to set it in some left-field location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn’t work.”</p>



<p>Additionally, while fans have been holding out hope for the bottom of the GTA 6 map to be expanded to include some of the Caribbean, or even Colombia, Vermeij believes it’s still unlikely to happen, even though he admits it’s something he would enjoy.</p>



<p>“I would love that. I think drug running is a good match. I was actually constantly trying to push to get that into the earlier games but it never happened. But is that what Rockstar are doing? I don’t think so. It doesn’t really make sense. It’s a lot of extra work for what it would be.”</p>

                <p>If you find yourself with a shiny new Meta Quest headset during the holidays, be sure to check out the new Winter 2025 Edition of Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Create+Your+Own+VR+Games+Bundle+For+Less+Than+%243+Per+Game&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-22+07%3A28%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-22+11%3A30%3A20&amp;fnarticle_id=6537134&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-quest-vr-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-build-your-own-quest-vr-bundle%2F1100-6537134%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle</a> deal. Like other Fanatical deals, you choose from a catalog of 21 games (all of which are offered as official keys for your Quest), and the more you buy, the more you'll save. <strong>Buy two or more games to get each for $9, four or more for $8.75/each, and seven or more for $8.50/each.</strong> If you want, you can add 21 games to your bundle, in which case you'll pay $178.50--while that's higher than most Fanatical bundle deals, it's still a massive 65% savings compared to the bundle's $471.79 value.</p><p>As for the games in the bundle, if you're a fan of Superhot, take a peek at Chronostrike. The stylized shooter emphasizes cooperative play, tasking you and a buddy to take down hordes of foes while deflecting bullets, manipulating time, and making liberal use of your environment to your advantage. There are also more traditional shooters like Contracts Shadow: ExfilZone. Fans of dark fantasy dungeon crawls should check out Amid Evil VR, which offers a frantic melee adventure with classic Quake-style movement and level design.</p><p>For something more strategic, check out Neon Squad Tactics. The top-down, turn-based, cyberpunk tactics game lets players choose from nine unique characters and fight across 31 maps. Meanwhile, 7th Guest VR and Shadow Chambers are great picks for more immersive, puzzle-filled adventure games.</p><p>The bundle also offers creative VR experiences like SuchArt and SculptrVR. The former has you whipping up colorful creations in your studio as you earn cash to upgrade your gear, while the latter lets you try your hand at sculpting (which, thanks to its innovative tools, is much easier than the real thing).</p><p>Plenty of other great games are eligible for the Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle, so be sure to check out the full list below. All of the VR games purchased in this bundle are delivered as official codes that can be redeemed via the Meta Quest launcher.</p><p>Along with the games, the deal includes a 5%-off coupon code usable on a future Fanatical purchase.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Genndy Tartakovsky is a creative whose reputation precedes him. Ever since getting his foot in the door on the 1993 Hanna-Barbera show <em>2 Stupid Dogs</em>, he's become a household name in animation as the director and creator of<em> Dexter's Laboratory</em>, <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em>, <em>Samurai Jack</em>, <em>Star Wars: Clone Wars</em>, the <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> movies, and his latest and most<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dudes-rock?ref=aftermath.site"><u> dudes rock</u></a> series, <em>Primal</em>. <em>Primal</em>'s elevator pitch is that of a bespoke shower thought: What if a caveman named Spear teamed up with a dinosaur named Fang and went on an adventure that’d tickle the brains of folks who remember <em>Deadliest Warrior</em>?&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JyB3Md1GcWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Genndy Tartakovky's Primal | Season 3 Early Preview | adult swim"></iframe></figure><p><em>Primal </em>&nbsp;ran for two seasons before Spear died. Now, it’s poised to return for a new season on Adult Swim, with an even wilder premise to crank the series to 11: What if the caveman were a zombie now? Speaking with Tartakovsky, this new, pulpier direction was born from his undying belief that he ended the show too early and still had more story to tell, despite operating in a world where original animation is bottlenecked by the safer option of adding more legacy sequels and franchises to streamers.</p><p>“I spent 20 episodes trying to build the character relationship and the stories for everyone to fall in love with, and then it was over,” Tartakovsky said. “But then I realized, no, there’s still more that feels fresh. I think it was a joke at first like, ‘Maybe he’s a zombie’ because we’re talking about how to bring him back. And then I was like, ‘Wait a second. No, no, no, no, this is really good.’”</p><p>Whenever jokes turn into creative roadmaps for Tartakovsky, he puts his instincts to the test to see if they’re correct. Literally bringing <em>Primal</em> back to life after a premature end involved writing down 10 story ideas for how it could happen and where the story could go from there.</p><p>“I wrote them down so quick, which always means it’s ripe,” Tartakovsky said. “It’s ripe for creativity and storytelling, and as soon as the idea that [Spear] is trying to find life through death, that was it. That sealed the deal.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fokFA_vefjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Primal S1 Official Soundtrack | Full Album - Tyler Bates &amp; Joanne Higginbottom | WaterTower"></iframe></figure><p>Crafting a show that’s built on trusting its audience—especially in an era <a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>when streaming’s binge model</u></a> leads to directives from on high for writers to craft dialogue where characters announce what they’re doing and why to keep viewers abreast while they drift back to their phones, a habit Genndy Tartakovsky admits he routinely scolds his daughter for—is its own evolutionary challenge. <em>Primal </em>wagers everything on the belief that viewers will follow its story through serene atmosphere, gnarly action, and evocative micro‑expressions alone. For a series anchored in intentionally minimalist dialogue of “unga‑bungas” and “graaawrs,” supported by a techno‑tribal score by <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1039873/genndy-tartakovsky-takes-an-unusual-approach-to-crafting-primals-score/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Tyler Bates and Joanne Higginbottom</a>, achieving clarity without compromise is a balancing act.&nbsp;</p><p>“The challenge of doing something like this is you can't rely on dialogue to tell the audience what is happening. You really gotta watch it, and sometimes when I'm doing the storyboard, [I] get lost in the abstraction, because I'm just doing drawings and these five drawings in a row are supposed to communicate an idea to you that's clear, without doubt,” he said. “If you're in the weeds too much, they become an abstraction, and you start tripping. Like, ‘Oh my god, nothing is making sense, I don't know what I'm doing. Are these five shots gonna make you feel that?’ That doubt is probably the hardest thing to get over.”</p><p>Fortunately, having tenure on cartoons like <em>Samurai Jack</em> makes telling stories without long stretches of dialogue a creative exercise Tartakovsky enjoys. Whenever his brain starts to overanalyze, he takes a little break, comes back, and powers through.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cwuJpZYJDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Spear Battles a Mutant Gorilla | Genndy Tartakovsky's Primal | adult swim"></iframe></figure><p>There are a few existing episodes Tartakovsky loves for different reasons. Episodes like “A Cold Death” are a reckoning for Spear and Fang, with someone’s death feeding someone’s life, as a herd of woolly mammoths hunts them down to avenge an elder whose pelt kept the pair warm in the harsh winter—a theme that’d serve as a big part of its first season. Or “Rage of the Ape-Men,” an episode so brutal yet so nice for how uncharacteristically peaceful it starts before diving into the worst brutality the show’s ever done by its climax. Or “Shadow of Fate,” which sees a complex love triangle of sorts where Fang finds a mate who wants to kill Spear, her “first familial love.” Still, all that effort can be lost if someone pulls out their phone, a&nbsp; scenario Tartakovsky says is even worse for an animator, who recounted a time when his daughter pulled out her phone while they were watching a movie together and things got “boring.”</p><p>“If she were watching <em>Primal</em>, she’d be lost for sure. But that’s the way people watch nowadays. They’ll get on their phone for a few minutes, and then come back to the movie, and it’s frustrating,” Tartakovsky said, noting how much work everyone from catering to lighting behind the scenes helped make live-action films work, only for audiences to flippantly dismiss it to look down at their phones.&nbsp;</p><p>“For animation, it’s even worse because we’re hand drawing everything so specifically,” he said. “But what can you do? It is what it is. My hope is that <em>Primal </em>means something at the end of the day, and it inspires people.”&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUSr2kEXLBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Genndy Tartakovsky’s The Black Knight Test Animation "></iframe></figure><p>Given Tartakovsky’s reputation as an elder statesman of modern animation—and the recent perception that decades-old passion projects like his infamously raunchy<em> Felix the Cat</em> flavored dog comedy, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fixed-review-netflix-genndy-tartakovsky-idris-elba-kathryn-hahn-adam-devine?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Fixed</u></em></a>,<em> </em>can get greenlit on the strength of his name alone—you’d assume he’s operating in a rarefied space where instinct alone can move mountains to get newer dream projects like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/genndy-tartakovsky-wants-help-getting-his-black-knight-film-made-2000664378?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Black Knight</u></em></a>, which he opted to<a href="https://gizmodo.com/genndy-tartakovsky-wont-give-up-on-getting-black-knight-made-2000667740?ref=aftermath.site"><u> release test footage of online to drum up hype</u></a> for a story he hopes to tell urgently tell in theaters. The animation sees a 14th century knight operating a 20-foot-tall black suit of armor “using ropes, pulleys, and levers” and a gigantic sword to fight a slender, (relatively) diminutive ninja armed with her kusarigama. Tldr: yet another effortless “dudes rock” premise. Tartakovsky hopes <em>Black Knight</em> can garner the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/genndy-tartakovsky-black-knight-test-footage-new-leak/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>same level of bombast </u></a>as<em> </em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-is-killer-with-some-filler-and-a-whole-lot-of-flashy-anime-action-2000657046?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Demon Slayer</u></em></a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kpop-demon-hunters-review-netflix-twice-2000614916?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>KPop Demon Hunters</u></em></a> have had in cinemas, but for Western animation. However, he’s quick to push back on the idea that his past accolades are enough to get works greenlit, especially if they’re original.</p><p>“My name is not enough. It’s not my reality where I walk into a room and go, ‘I wanna make this!’ and they go, ‘Yes, Genndy. Great!’ and we all cheer and hug each other. It’s still a business, and there’s still fear and doubt in something new.”</p><p>Although Tartakovsky has garnered enough faith and experience in the realm of TV that he could walk into a room and, at least, get a project in development pretty easily in comparison to his colleagues, the entertainment industry is a harder sell in the realm of original animated films.&nbsp;</p><p>“If I pitch <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> 4, 5, or 6, it’s easier to get greenlit because ‘Oh yeah, we get this. We know this. We know you’re responsible, so there’s no questions,’” Tartakovsky said in the tone of supposed producer execs. “When you do something different, then it’s, ‘Who’s this for? How much is this gonna cost?’ It’s not art first. It’s business first.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tartakovsky says it's especially complicated for bigwig business execs to greenlight original animated features, in part because studios are making fewer and fewer movies theatrically. In an era defined by legacy sequels and franchise building, Tartakovsky hopes the animation industry shifts to allow bold, original concepts to spearhead the media's direction in the next decade.</p><p>“I don’t want the world to be IP-driven with just twos and threes,” Tartakovsky said. “Before <em>Zootopia 2</em>, there was <em>Zootopia</em>. Before <em>Toy Story</em> one through five, there was one <em>Toy Story</em>. <em>Despicable Me</em>: all these things were original and inspired giant, multi-billion-dollar franchises. So why have we given up on those [originals]?”</p><p>If anything, Tartakovsky believes animation shouldn’t be chasing a new <em>Toy Story</em> or a new <em>SpongeBob </em>as another drop in its IP catalog for streaming, but as a new, original project that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the giants of the past. An instinct, Tartakovsky says, that seems to have disappeared in the industry, supplanted by the instinct <a href="https://gizmodo.com/nosferatu-frankenstein-robert-eggers-guillermo-del-toro-2000689468?ref=aftermath.site"><u>to take an old book or movie, redo it, and call it a day</u></a>.</p><p>“Personally, I want originals,” he said. “That’s what I like to see. It’s more interesting to me. If you have a good original, sure, of course I’ll go see a second one.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIqlw3VX_XU?list=PLcysDhWQHmuQH8BEjWo3yC1szOVGigKvG" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Still, the first hurdle of getting an original animation geared toward adults off the ground is that to be successful, they should be violent, crass, or sensual. All of which dovetails to “the bigger question” that Tartakovsky’s eyes lit up when I asked whether he thinks studios don’t give audiences enough credit for being open to animation as an artform stigmatized as something exclusively for kids</p><p>“If you look at streaming adult animation and a normal network, it’s huge. From <em>The Simpsons </em>through <em>Rick and Morty</em>, <em>Primal</em>, and everything else. It’s very broad and successful. Fox has a whole block of adult animated cartoons so there’s a giant audience there. There’s a big, successful audience on Adult Swim, Hulu, and Netflix has a whole wing devoted to adult animation,” he said. “Then you go to features, there’s zero. Zero animated films are being made for that audience.”</p><p>He continued: “That’s the whole question with <em>Black Knight</em>: Where’s the audience? I would point to all of this success like a lot of comedy and action breaking through, but there is an audience. You go to <em>Demon Slayer</em> and <em>KPop Demon Hunter,</em> and that’s something different. There’s an audience, huge success.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrpYPoUhWmc?list=PLcysDhWQHmuQH8BEjWo3yC1szOVGigKvG" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>For Tartakovsky, the argument is that while <em>Demon Slayer</em> is based on a TV show, it still has an audience coming out to theaters, which is a testament to the thirst for that kind of animation. And, should <em>Black Knight</em> make even half of its success for Sony Animation, it’s a shoo-in to be a success. But even if it doesn’t, an audience for animation of its ilk is there, and it’s growing every year, so it’s only a matter of time before a studio makes an original, commercial adult animated feature film that everyone will go see.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m trying to be the first to do that, and it’s difficult to be the first,” Tartakovsky said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everything is to try something new and have a different vibe. <em>Primal </em>is different than <em>Samurai Jack</em>, and <em>Black Knight</em> is trying to do its own thing. Creatively, it’s exciting, and it’s for a different audience that we’re trying to reach to see if that audience is even there on a big feature scale. That’s every project that I do but at this point in my career, I’m trying to do a different vibe. A different energy.”</p><p>Granted, like <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> creator Shinichirō Watanabe’s newest work, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shinichiro-watanabe-lazarus-interview-cowboy-bebop-2000584667?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Lazarus</u></em></a>, Tartakovsky acknowledged that <em>Primal </em>and <em>Black Knight</em>—while both endeavoring for their own vibes—harbor a resemblance in tone and energy that audiences will connect to his most well-known work, <em>Samurai Jack</em>, by proxy of it being of his. Still, he strives to make something different from the last thing he’s made.&nbsp;</p><p>“The last thing I want to do is 3 more seasons of <em>Primal </em>that’s exactly the same, with another idea,” Tartakovsky said, using aliens as an example of where that could’ve ramped up should he have stuck with making a story for the sake of making it.&nbsp;</p><p>And with <em>Black Knight</em> on the back burner (for now), Tartakovsky hopes <em>Primal</em>’s third season embodies his vision for what original animation can offer.&nbsp;</p><p>“Egotistically and selfishly, I hope <em>Primal </em>is a huge success, and it would prove you could do different stories and not have it necessarily be considered a cult, artistic experiment. It’s mainstream.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8l_o0VmHtBY?list=PLcysDhWQHmuQH8BEjWo3yC1szOVGigKvG" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>While the show exists as the last of a dying breed of shows that anchor themselves on liminal dialogue, Tartakovsky likened <em>Primal </em>to what the television versions of action epics like <em>Sisu </em>and <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> offer viewers, a different experience that’s so unique any proponent for AI won’t have legs to stand on.&nbsp;</p><p>“The more unique that we can make things, the more it makes it anti-AI. It makes it AI-proof,” Tartakovsky said. “AI can copy, but can it create something truly original? We wanna push human creativity to a level where it can’t be copied. And that means doing original things, pushing boundaries, and trying different things. That’s where I hope it goes, and I hope <em>Primal </em>is a big part of that.”</p>

It was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">breaking records in December 2024</a>, and kept that momentum going in January 2025 with over <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">644K concurrent players and $135 million earned in gross revenue</a>.</p>



<p>To say that Marvel Rivals started off with a bang would be an understatement, and while <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">it hasn't kept up the kinds of player concurrent numbers that see it go over half a million players on one platform alone</a>, at least on Steam, it has consistently stayed near or above 100K concurrent players, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">made multiple appearances</a> in Newzoo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">top ten games by monthly active users</a> throughout the year.</p>



<p>But all of that, according to producer Danny Koo, was "<em>just a warm-up</em>." Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/games/marvel-rivals-creators-on-leveling-up-the-game/">Den of Geek</a>, Koo said, "<em>2025 was more of a warm-up period for us</em>. <em>Next year, we’re going to have bigger plans. We’re not going to slow down. We’ve already planned more than a year ahead and I can’t wait for our players to see it</em>."</p>



<p>NetEase publishing and marketing lead, Yachen Bian, in the same interview added, "<em>In the next year, we want to provide more game modes</em>. <em>It’s why we have prototypes in the game, like PvE and 18v18. We want to give the players more choices of different game modes beyond the basic gameplay because your fundamental experience might be very different. When you’re fighting against zombies, it’s quite different from fighting against other people.</em>"</p>



<p>It's difficult to imagine what even more success looks like for Marvel Rivals, considering it was already one of 2025's most successful new games on the market, as it seems to have definitively carved out a place for itself in the highly competitive free-to-play shooter genre.</p>



<p>"<em>It's a lot of hard work and it always feels different and exciting</em>," Koo continued. "<em>This game is releasing new content every week. Even my own team comes in every day asking what's new today. Everyone's excited. They want to continue to make this happen. Everyone wants to make this the biggest game possible</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how NetEase continues to direct Marvel Rivals, and if it can sustain the engagement it enjoyed in the past year, and potentially even grow it further.</p>

The Indie Game Awards also rescinded the Debut Game award given to <em>Expedition 33</em>.</p><p>Here is the Indie Game Awards’ explanation, <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq">from an FAQ</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself. When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of a resurfaced interview with <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-producer-confirms-generative-AI-use-in-Game-of-the-Year-winner.1187946.0.html">Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art</a> in production being brought to our attention on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination. While the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-ai-controversy/">assets in question were patched out</a> and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place.</p></blockquote></div><p>The Indie Game Awards’ Mike Towndrow also explained the decision in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/indiegameawards.gg/post/3magufzccy22i">a video on Bluesky</a>.</p><p>The Indie Game Awards’ criteria, as outlined in that FAQ, says that “Games developed using generative AI are strictly ineligible for nomination.” Sandfall Interactive didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Game of the Year is instead being awarded to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647451/blue-prince-review-architectural-roguelike-balatro">puzzle game <em>Blue Prince</em></a>. Publisher Raw Fury said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rawfury.bsky.social/post/3maivmd5kps2w">on Sunday</a> that “there is no AI used in Blue Prince” and that the game “was built and crafted with full human instinct” by Tonda Ros and the Dogubomb team.</p><p>“As gen AI becomes more prevalent in our industry, we will better navigate it appropriately,” the Indie Game Awards says.</p><p>The Indie Game Awards is also retracting an Indie Vanguard award from studio Gortyn Code, which developed the Game Boy-inspired game <em>Chantey</em>. The game is sold on a physical cartridge by Palmer Luckey’s ModRetro, which makes the Chromatic Game Boy. Luckey also founded defense contractor Anduril, and Chromatic recently announced an Anduril-branded Chromatic made from “the same magnesium aluminum alloy as Anduril’s attack drones.”</p><p>“The IGAs nomination committee were unfortunately made aware of ModRetro’s nature and principles the day after the 2025 premiere with the news of their upcoming handheld console,” the Indie Game Awards says. Because of <em>Chantey’s</em> ties with ModRetro, “Indie Vanguard has also been retracted as we do not want to provide the company with a platform.” The organization also says that “The decision does not reflect Gortyn Code, but ModRetro alone.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/849144/indie-game-awards-game-of-the-year-expedition-33-generative-ai-chantey-modretro]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Goodness gracious, 2025 has been a fantastic year for video games, and most excitingly, for games of all scales and budgets. Big-name releases have hit the spot, while indies have sprung from nowhere to become breakthrough hits, such that wrestling them all down to a top 10 with which I’m happy has been an ordeal. But I got there, and I’m happy with it. I’ve also rather shocked myself by putting two big-name games in the top two spots, thus losing my cool indie credentials. Thankfully the rest of the list makes up for it.</p> <p>My technique for putting these lists together is to read every other site’s top charts, getting angry with the generic crap that’s getting overly lauded, and then scroll through the <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-horrifying-just-how-little-time-steam-users-spend-playing-new-games-2000654158">183 new games</a> I played this year on PC alone. Then I pick the 10 which are objectively the best ones, and rank them in a scientifically proven and unquestionable order of goodnessosity, for an irrefutable list on which history is established.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>10) Eclipsium</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655149">© Housefire</figcaption></figure> <p>I installed&nbsp;<em>Eclipsium</em> on the basis of the screenshots, and <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/10/eclipsium/">am so glad I did</a>. I’m so pleased to see the game got some attention from others too, with the extraordinary art in this walking-sim horror game astonishing everyone who saw it. This is a peculiar and striking game, combining truly beautiful vistas and horrendous body horror, and it’s so damned interesting. Every surface ripples with pixels, such that the world is only truly tangible when you’re moving, giving everything an organic feeling of <em>breathing</em>. It’s a 3D game that’s then re-rendered onto a 320×180 canvas, with a 12FPS human hand added as your means of interaction with the world. The effect is extraordinary, ensuring an already intriguing and surreal experience is all the more compelling.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>9) The Drifter</strong></h2> <p><span>© Powerhoof / Kotaku</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-drifter-point-and-click-adventure-powerhoof-review-1851786671"><em>The Drifter</em></a> starts out looking like a traditional point-and-click adventure, before revealing two super-important things: Firstly, an immediately fascinating story that <em>might be</em> about some peculiar secret forces causing the disappearance of homeless people, and secondly, a control scheme for old-school adventures that makes so much sense in the modern world. Its innovative design for controllers needs to be copied by absolutely everyone else out there, forever.</p>

 <p>The game then divides itself into distinct chapters, with a limited number of locations available in each, to keep the developing story moving along nicely. I’m not a big fan of the ending, but what makes&nbsp;<em>The Drifter</em> stand out is that this doesn’t feel like it matters as much as it normally might in a narrative game. It’s still great fun, and everything that comes before the conclusion is so thrilling. Plus there’s fabulous voice acting, gorgeous art, and some really neat puzzles.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>8) MotionRec</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655153">© Hansum / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s the conceit of 2D platform-puzzler <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/11/motionrec/"><em>MotionRec</em></a>: You can record your movement for a short while, and then “replay” that motion elsewhere in a level irrespective of the platforms available. So let’s say you need to get to a distant point at the top right, and there’s just a void before you. Record yourself climbing a flight of steps from bottom left to top right elsewhere, then replay it here. The further you go, the more superbly elaborate this all becomes, until you’re solving puzzles that would have absolutely flummoxed you near the start.</p>

 <p>The game pretends to be 15 levels long, but the truth is it’s 30, and that’s good to know before you play. There’s something psychologically unsettling about thinking you’re winding down to an end, only to learn you’re only halfway through, and it’s far more pleasant to work through with the knowledge. Also, that second half is wildly more difficult than the first, meaning it’ll take you an awful lot longer to figure out. The game is so clever, and the sparing pixel art amazingly well used, making&nbsp;<em>MotionRec</em> my favorite in a very strong field of puzzle games in 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>7) Escape from Duckov</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655160" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655160"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655160">© Team Soda</figcaption></figure> <p>I was pretty sure&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> was a goof. You know how Steam’s charts get clogged up with those god-awful achievement farms, “games” like&nbsp;<em>Banana</em> suddenly seeing hundreds of thousands of simultaneous players, despite being borderline nothingness? I thought, from the name and its sudden popularity, that this was one of those. Nope! So is it a simple spoof? An <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> knock-off but with duck skins? No, it’s that either! It turns out this single-player extraction shooter from a team of five <a href="https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-ps5-save-bug-crash-patch-update-1851781990">is a superb game in its own right</a>, a compelling loop of outside runs of derring-do, and base-building with the loot you gathered. It’s a twin-stick isometric shooter at heart, with vast locations to explore and quests that encourage you to venture ever-further away from safety, always carrying the grim risk of losing everything. So, an extraction shooter. But with ducks. And no other stinky, horrible players to ruin your day. I ended up spending far longer with this game than I ever thought I would, and just writing about it now is making me itch to switch back from <em>Arc Raiders</em> for my adrenaline fix.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>6) Old Skies</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655168"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655168">© Wadjet Eye / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It took me a little longer to warm up to&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em> than I did to Wadjet Eye’s previous stunning adventure, <em>Unavowed</em>. But warm up I did, until I was <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-skies-wadjet-eye-adventure-pc-steam-unavowed-1851777432">singing from the rooftops</a> about this wonderful point-and-click tale of time travel tourism. You play as Fia Quinn, a “time agent” who accompanies the rich on their travels back to moments in the past to ensure they don’t attempt to change anything important in history. Told in chapters, Quinn’s tale eventually begins to weave an over-arching narrative as various events begin to interconnect.</p> <p>Something I particularly loved about&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em>, apart from its fantastic writing, acting and art, is that it&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> obsessed with the butterfly effect, or an obsessive preservation of history. Instead, this is a future where events are <em>constantly</em> being altered by the actions of those visiting the past, with only certain key events preserved as unchangeable. And one of those is 9/11, allowing long-time New Yorker Dave Gilbert to revisit his own experiences of that day in a way that’s effective and affecting, without ever being intrusive or ghoulish. It’s a time travel story like you’ve never heard before, and a splendid adventure game to boot.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>5) Strange Antiquities</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655169">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I completely missed&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em> in 2022. An odd aspect of my job is that if an indie game is already getting lots of mainstream attention, it becomes a far lower priority for me to play so I can focus on the completely unknown and try to get more eyes their way instead. And what a shame, because what a game! However, when commissioned to write an interview with the developers of the sequel, I quickly put that right and played the original before this year’s second game. And what a treat that was!</p> <p>Both games have you working in a small shop, selling plants in the original, obscure items here, to a range of customers, but nothing in your store is labelled and you must identify them through interacting with a huge range of clues. And wow, what a far greater range there is in <em>Antiquities </em>than its predecessor, with its wonderful spread of ways to interact with items, the piles of pamphlets and letters, its multiple maps with locations to explore (in text adventure format), and secret compartments to discover. It’s a breathtakingly smart game, endlessly delightful in the ingenuity of the challenges, and it comes with a hint system that goes well out of its way to get you past a block without spoiling anything.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>4) Donkey Kong Bananza</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655174"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655174">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve gotta admit, I was a bit deflated after I bought my Switch 2.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> felt like such an anticlimax to me, a game that didn’t seem significantly more interesting than previous entries, and with an open-world I was so excited to explore, and so disappointed to experience. It was, oddly enough, replaying&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> on the device that won me over—the doors finally opened the moment you shot them! And then along came&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza.</em></p> <p>Look, you can hate me as much as you want, but I never really got on with the old <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>games. I KNOW. I’m wrong. I’m not denying it. But it rather flattened my excitement for the <em>other</em> Switch 2 game of 2025. So what a happy boy I was once I started playing! Oh my goodness, this is what I like to pretend represents Nintendo, rather than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">spiteful, lawyer-forward</a> corporation it too often reveals itself to be: a giant box of joyful fun. It’s a game that just wants to be played, to be thoroughly enjoyed as much as is humanly possible, uninterested in pushing you away or restricting your options for distractions. I deliberately played&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em> as slowly as I could, going back and seeking out every last banana on every level once I realized I was getting close to the end, because I didn’t want it to be over. It’s rare that games are this much pure fun.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>3) The Beekeeper’s Picnic</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655192">© Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Did I really enjoy&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/04/the-beekeepers-picnic/"><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em></a> more than&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>? Well, the question itself reveals the complete stupidity of ranking such lists at all. This is, really, ten games I really enjoyed in 2025, and I’ve ranked them based on incoherent vibes. It’s almost as silly to compare a manic 3D action game about smashing rocks to a genteel 2D story about an elderly Sherlock Holmes as it is to compare it to a favorite fruit or particularly enjoyable train ride. They are utterly dissimilar, and both completely wonderful.</p>

 <p><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> is a love letter. It’s a love letter to the entire canon of Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories, a love letter to classic point-and-click adventures,&nbsp;<em>and</em> a love letter in and of itself. This is a game about a post-Great War Sherlock Holmes re-retiring to Sussex and confronting himself over his lifelong treatment of his closest friend, John Watson. As Watson returns from the front lines, where the old man returned to the army as a medic, Holmes delightedly welcomes him into his new countryside cottage, and wants to show his affection for the doctor by putting together a picnic. That’s the setup, and it’s gorgeous.</p> <p>Even better, creator Helen Greetham is a devoted fan of the Holmes stories, and understands them in a way that almost every recent Sherlock-based media has not. It begins with a scene set toward the end of&nbsp;<em>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs</em>, to establish Doyle’s own representation of the love between these two men, before moving to 1918 to tell a new story set after any in the official series. To present a softened Holmes, a man finally able to be reflective and introspective instead of simply an objective detective, is so brave, and could so easily have come across as disingenuous. But Greetham’s deep knowledge and respect for the character ensures it always feels utterly valid. I adored it. I find myself thinking about it. I have <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-beekeepers-picnic-sherlock-holmes-game-review-1851776762">so much more to say about it</a> than I do most other games I played this year. Yeah, you know what, I think I&nbsp;<em>did</em> enjoy it more than&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>2) Arc Raiders</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655179">© Embark Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I was not expecting to like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>. I was, in fact, not the least bit interested in playing <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Online games in which I have to interact with other players are my kryptonite, and on learning that there was no PvE mode, I didn’t even want to bother. But then I kept reading <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198">Claire’s</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">articles</a> on <em>Kotaku</em> about how much fun she was having, and I dunno…she convinced me to try. I’m so glad.</p> <p>Even after this, it didn’t seem likely I’d stick with it. I messaged a friend to say, “I’m going to try playing&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders.</em>” His reply: “I can’t think you’ll enjoy it.” A month later, I’m hooked.</p>

 <p>As I’ve previously documented, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">I’m pretty dreadful at the game</a>, although I am improving. I haven’t died for so long now that the next failure is going to hurt like&nbsp;<em>hell</em>, genuinely to the point where I find myself a little reluctant to try sometimes. Then I see a quest I’m sure I can do, moderate what I’m willing to take with me, and get out there. Although I&nbsp;<em>have</em> given up playing on Xbox until I next die, since I’m significantly more comfortable with a mouse and keyboard.</p> <p>I’m not sure I’d ever have found my way into this if I’d not played&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> first, but now I’m totally all in on solo-able extraction shooters. (Never, ever going to play in a team, ever, not never.) I love the world Embark has built. I love the stunning graphics, especially the game’s <em>air</em>, which is a mad thing to be excited about but it keeps taking me aback. I love the utter terror of creeping around buildings, of spamming, “Don’t shoot!” if I see another player, or delightedly responding with an “OK!” if someone else says it first. I love&nbsp;<em>just</em> making it into an elevator with nothing to spare. God <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-sliding-steps-embark-studios-2000650065">I love sliding down the stairs</a>. I still haven’t found enough fucking lemons to upgrade my chicken, and I love that this is a sentence I’m typing.</p>

 <p>I’m having so much fun playing a game I thought was absolutely not for me, in a genre I didn’t think I’d ever care about, and that’s a truly spectacular thing. Now, all they need to do is <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">replace the sodding AI voices</a> and I can stop feeling guilty about it, too.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>1) Avowed</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655186" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655186"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655186">© Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>January and February games do have a habit of slipping out of end of year lists, so it’s testament to Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em> that it hasn’t left my mind since I finished it. What a big, beautiful RPG, unquestionably the best of 2025, with companions that feel like old friends, characters I find myself wondering about, and massive world-changing choices of significant consequence.&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is up there with my all-time favorites,&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em> and&nbsp;<em>Planescape Torment</em>, a game I cannot wait to return to when it’s been long enough that I’ve forgotten the finer details.</p>

 <p>Oh, and it’s a third game in the world of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, one of the finest RPG series gaming has to offer.&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>‘s use of the setting offers huge amounts to faithful fans, while remaining completely accessible to anyone visiting for the first time. That’s thanks to the Living Lands being a unique setting in the realm of Eora, such that it sits distinct from the <em>Pillars</em> tales of untrustworthy gods, while still in a world reeling from their revelations.</p> <p>Kai is an all-time great RPG companion, and it bewilders me that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avowed">Wikipedia page for&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em></a> still lists that there’s no companion romance in the game. It’s not just that it’s the same voice actor as Garrus; I love him like I love Garrus, and I feel like I miss him since we stopped hanging around.</p> <p>The setting is an all-time great RPG land, with its disparate biomes keeping things fresh, and the parkour-ish climbing and jumping adds a verticality that RPGs rarely see. But, of course, more than anything else it’s about experiencing a story in the company of brilliant characters, which no one else does quite like Obsidian. (No, not even Larian, although I have no shade for the incredible&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.)</p> <p>Thinking back on&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> doesn’t feel like remembering a video game I played this year, but more like reflecting on a place I inhabited, the people I knew there, and the adventures we had. That’s truly special, and it’s why&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is very definitely my game of 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2> <p>I have&nbsp;<em>so</em> many other games I loved this year, and I’m going to have forgotten to mention loads of them, and perhaps even one I’d have put in the top 10 if I remembered. But those I&nbsp;<em>can</em> remember to call out are:</p> <ul> <li><em>Dawnfolk</em></li> <li><em>Slender Threads</em></li> <li><em>Wizordum</em></li> <li><em>Crashlands 2</em></li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></li> <li><em>Ooo</em></li> <li><em>Project Warlock II</em></li> <li><em>The Supper: New Blood</em></li> <li><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></li> <li><em>Strange Jigsaws</em></li> <li><em>Time Flies</em></li> <li><em>Gigasword</em></li> <li><em>The Crazy Hyper Dungeon Chronicles</em></li> </ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Details On Romero Games’ Xbox Title]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Microsoft and Xbox held its wave of mass layoffs in July, one studio that was impacted in a major way Romero Games. Founded by the creator of Doom and founder of Id Software, John Romero, Romero Games had a publisher agreement with Xbox on a new title.</p>



<p>That agreement was ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romero-games-denies-its-closed-after-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled over the summer</a>, with the future of Romero Games left up in the air. At one point there were even rumors of the studio being shut down due to the funding being pulled, but that was denied and Romero Games moved forward.</p>







<p>Fast-forward to December, and Romero confirmed that not only is the studio moving forward, but it’s working on a new game. But what about the game that was in development. Up until now, information has been scarce. However, Insider Gaming has learned a few details about what the game was.</p>



<p>As first reported on Episode 44 of Insider Gaming Weekly, the game was known as “Hellslayer” and centered around the idea of a priest fighting demons. It was also set to be a first-person shooter that had inspiration from games like Hotline Miami in the sense that if you die, you would instantly restart the area. Sources say that it was a game that had been in the works for nearly a decade, but has been ended in its current state to move forward with a new project.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The new game is a “completely redesigned” title that takes elements from the original game. At a panel in early December, Romero said that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/john-romeros-canceled-game-has-been-saved-sort-of/">new project wasn’t being started</a> from scratch, but it will still be a “different game” than what was first planned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned of some of those features, but to protect the source, can’t divulge them publicly at this time. Romero said that the new game was something he never played before, but if you were a fan of the older Id Software titles, you’ll likely enjoy many of the features of the new title if and when it’s finally revealed to the world.</p>
