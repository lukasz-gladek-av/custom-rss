            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-pc-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After yesterday's Developer Direct deep dive, Bethesda and id Software have announced the&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>PC specs, and it turns out you're going to need quite a beefy machine even to run it at a minimum level.</p>

<p>During yesterday's presentation, we got to see more of&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>' gameplay, and we also got a release date for it: May 15th. Now, on the game's official <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Bethesda has unveiled the game's PC specs, and even the minimum preset might prompt you to upgrade.</p>

<p>Often, when it comes to PC gaming, you can get away with older graphics cards if you're just looking to run games with fairly modest visuals. Not so with&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, though; it needs you to have a ray tracing-compatible card even for its lowest tier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-gameplay.jpg?itok=H8Yrp4co 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-gameplay.jpg?itok=XsAivQ6z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>won't let you get away with a potato PC.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a rundown of the specs you'll need at each tier for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. All of these tiers require Windows 10 or 11, as well as a 512GB or higher NVMe SSD with 100GB available.</p>

<h3>Minimum (1080p, 60fps, Low)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X,&nbsp;Intel Core i7-10700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super, AMD Radeon RX 6600, or better</li>
	<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1440p, 60fps, High)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X, Intel Core i7-12700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, AMD Radeon RX 6800, or better</li>
	<li>32GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 4K (4K, 60fps, Ultra)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X, Intel Core i7-12700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, AMD Radeon RX 7900XT, or better</li>
	<li>32GB RAM</li>
</ul><p>id Software calls&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>its "most ambitious" game to date, and it looks like the recommended PC specs will match that ambition. Better make sure you upgrade your machine in time for the game's launch if it needs it!</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>launches on May 15th for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>A new report suggests NHL players are increasingly turning to video games and weed edibles during their downtime, as opposed to boozing like players of past generations took part in regularly.</p><p>Twenty-two-year-old Maple Leafs forward Matthew Knies told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078563/2025/01/24/nhl-weed-gummies-video-gaming-alcohol/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that because technology has advanced so much, it's very easy to "live a virtual life instead of a real one." Buffalo Sabres forward Peyton Krebs, 23, said, "We'll all go out for dinner, but then guys will generally go back to their rooms to play video games."</p><p>One anonymous defenseman told the site that playing video games with teammates can help with camaraderie. "You just have to be more open," this person said. "I'll try to drag guys out of their comfort zone, and then I'll play video games with them."</p><p>Beyond video games, NHL players appear to be increasingly turning to weed edibles over booze during downtime. The Athletic spoke with more than three-dozen current NHL players and asked if they took an edible during the season, and 38% "indicated" they did. Hockey players are known to be big boozers, but this trend may be on the decline. Floridan Panthers defenseman Nate Schmidt told the site he was told when he entered the NHL a decade ago, "If you can't play hungover in this league, you don't belong in it."</p><p>That attitude may be changing, especially with younger players. Schmidt said it's unacceptable for players to show up to practice at anything less than 100%. Alcohol-fueled partying during the season is on the decline, it seems, as players look to mellow out instead and take better care of their bodies.</p><p>A veteran NHL forward who asked to remain anonymous said he's sad about the lack of boozing as a means of team-bonding. "When I came into the league, we were going out for beers the night before games," he said. "I think (the NHL) used to be more fun back in the day."</p><p>Cannabis is not banned for NHL players, and it is legal in many cities across North America where NHL teams play.</p><p>As for EA's NHL video game series, the newest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nhl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-640627">NHL 25</a>, was just recently updated with a new 4 Nations Face-Off update themed around the real-world tournament.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-pass-the-2m-mark.1091037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone, further adding to what has been a pretty good year for the Blue Blur and his dark and edgy rival so far.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/en/release/250124_2.html?year=2025&amp;category=1&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sega reveals that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has hit two million sales, which means it's sold another million copies since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million" rel="nofollow">hit the million mark</a> back in October (on the day of its launch, no less).</p>

<p>Once again, Sega puts the sales figure down to&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow</em>'s range of language options, allowing many players from different regions to experience the game, as well as the "large-scale global promotions" the company engaged in to promote its platformer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m-sonics.jpg?itok=y4lV-qkE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m-sonics.jpg?itok=26_PeGLX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well for Sega, surprise surprise.</figcaption></figure><p>The past twelve months, it seems, has been the year not only of Sonic, but of Shadow as well.</p>

<p>Played by Keanu Reeves, Shadow made an appearance in the third&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie, which was released late last year and which helped the movie franchise as a whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">cross the $1 billion mark</a> at the box office. A fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie has already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">earmarked for March 2027</a>.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>itself, it's the latest 3D platformer in the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>series...well, sort of. It marries a remaster of 2011's&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>with a brand new campaign revolving around Shadow, complete with several new levels and boss fights.</p>

<p>It might be better to think of this one as the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>rather than as an entirely new game; it's not on the same scale as something like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sonic-frontiers" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></a>, but it does have some new stuff to check out, even if you rinsed the original&nbsp;<em>Generations</em>.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-x-shadow-generations/9mvlzdh2fh05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

Player choice can influence their interactions, prompting things like a date with different characters depending on how the player, as Cloud, treats  them. The "canon" relationship has long been debated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were therefore shocked when Hamaguchi appeared to have essentially dismissed Aerith as a romantic partner in his comments, though he has now told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/cloud-and-aerith-are-not-like-brother-and-sister-final-fantasy-vii-rebirths-director-speaks-out-about-misinterpretation-of-his-statement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> this was a misinterpretation and that he, nor anyone at Square Enix, would convey the nature of their characters' relationships beyond the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As creators, we will continue to convey [the relationships between our characters] through our content," Hamagucho said. "For example, no one will make any official statements about who Cloud likes, who Aerith likes, and so on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added that the misunderstanding may have come from subtle differences in language and culture between his native Japanese and the article's publication in English.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all comes as the modern retelling of Final Fantasy 7 hasn't concluded yet. More answers, or more questions, could emerge in the third and final part of the Remake Trilogy, though fans will be waiting a while for them as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027">Square Enix doesn't hope to release it until 2027 at the earliest</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix">The story has now been wrapped up internally</a> though, and Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase previously said he's "sure fans will be satisfied with the final chapter."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action role playing game full of exciting challenges and an awe inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

    <p><span>The Mikawa Flower Festival returns to Inazuma with new character Yumemizuki Mizuki.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [121 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Moonlight Amidst Dreams,” will launch on February 12, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-940256"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This time, players will knock on the doors of the centuries-old Mikawa Flower Festival once again, sharing this grand occasion with youkai as they explore a variety of gameplay experiences. What’s more, the versatile and capable Yumemizuki Mizuki joins the roster as a playable character. This update also includes a host of optimizations for increased convenience.</p><p>The Mikawa Flower Festival, a symbol of the bond between humans and youkai, returns with more reunions, challenges, and rewards for all to cherish and savor the moment. Raiden Shogun will also attend the gathering, and she seems to be investigating a mysterious nightmare. The fun and exciting games from the “48-hour game development competition” are sure to keep players entertained. For instance, try “A Little Fox’s Daydream,” where players must guide a little fox through its dreamscapes, collecting Fried Tofu and reaching its destination. For those up for a brain-teasing challenge, dive into “Bunshin Phantasm.” In this unique experience, Muji-Muji Daruma will mimic the player’s actions from the previous round. Players need to use the Daruma’s imitated actions to unlock the bridge to the goal within three rounds. The beloved “Akitsu Yuugei” is also back with a twist as the new “Akitsu Harpastum.” In this game, players must dodge a barrage of bullets while returning their harpastum to keep their vitality above zero. Join the games to earn Festival Stamps and exchange them for rewards, including a new 4-star polearm, “Tamayuratei no Ohanashi.”</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_940257"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>The dedicated clinical psychologist and major shareholder of the Aisa Bathhouse, Yumemizuki Mizuki, will soon join the roster as a 5-star Anemo Catalyst user and showcase her special treatments in her latest Story Quest. Her Dreamdrifter state, activated by her Elemental Skill, is one of her key combat features. While in this state, she deals AoE Anemo DMG and further enhances her team’s Swirl DMG when nearby party members hit opponents with Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro attacks. Her Elemental Burst summons a Mini Baku that creates Yumemi Style Special Snacks. When party members with less than 70% HP pick up these Snacks, they recover HP. If their HP is above 70%, the Snacks explode instead, dealing AoE Anemo DMG. Additionally, if Mizuki is in the party, using healing food items has a chance to restore an extra 30% HP to all characters.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Yumemizuki Mizuki will debut in the first half of Version 5.4’s Event Wishes with Sigewinne’s rerun, followed by reruns for Furina and Wriothesley in the second half. Mizuki will join the Standard Wish banner after the Version 5.5 update.</p><p>More exciting events are soon to follow in the update’s wake. “Travelers’ Tales: Anthology Chapter” offers players a glimpse into the captivating slice-of-life stories of their favorite characters. Additionally, mini-games, including the film editing challenge “Reel Ad-Venture,” the fishing game with cooperative and competitive modes “Invasive Fish Wrangler,” and the combat event “Realm of Tempered Valor,” will be available in this update.</p><p>To make adventuring and combat easier, this update also introduces several system optimizations. Players can now set Level-Up Plans for their characters in the Training Guide. Once these goals are set, the required materials and their sources will be clearly displayed. The filter systems for both Characters and Weapons have also been streamlined, reducing the steps needed to navigate the interfaces. Lastly, an Auto Add button has been added to the Weapon Refinement interface to speed up the process.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,708 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,620 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,200 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

                <p>A regular library typically doesn't have a section devoted to out-of-print video game magazines and promotional materials, but that's a gap that the Video Game History Foundation is looking to fill next week when it opens the doors to its virtual library. The non-profit organization has been steadily collecting video game materials for several years, and its public library will be accessible starting January 30.</p><p>"After years of collecting, cataloging, and digitizing video game history materials, the VGHF is finally opening the virtual doors to its library--wherever you are," the group said in a statement (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-video-game-history-foundation-makes-its-digital-library-available-to-the-public-next-week" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). Some of the materials teased by the organization include high-resolution scans of Final Fantasy 7 artwork and more than 1,500 video game magazines.</p><p>The VGHF added that its library will be home to "never-before-seen game development materials," and with powerful search options teased, it could become an invaluable resource for video game historians to make use of.</p><p>If you're interested in seeing more of the VGHF's work--and supporting its efforts to preserve the past--<a href="https://gamehistory.org/" rel="nofollow ">you can check out its main website for more details</a>.

<p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4 lands on February 12th, just in time for Valentine's Day. Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">this month's Version 5.3</a>, this update's main attraction is the return of the Mikawa Flower Festival, which gives you the chance to engage with a variety of exciting minigames and exchange the rewards you get from them for some cool stuff.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the addition of a brand new five-star character in the form of Yumemizuki Mizuki, a "dedicated clinical psychologist and major shareholder of the Aisa Bathhouse".</p>

<p>She can also create snacks that can either heal party members or explode to deal further damage, depending on how much health your party has left. It sounds like she'll be a pretty valuable addition to your team.</p>

<p>You can expect Yumemizuki Mizuki to debut in the first half of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4, alongside a rerun of Sigewinne. The second half will bring reruns of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-furina-gameplay-video" rel="nofollow">Furina</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-wriothesley-gameplay-demo" rel="nofollow">Wriothesley</a>, just in case you haven't added them to your roster yet.</p>

<p>As well as the new character and the Flower Festival, Version 5.4 will also bring new slice-of-life vignettes that will revolve around some of your "favorite characters", and of course, you can expect system improvements and gameplay optimizations too.</p>




<p>As always, HoYoverse has released some new codes that will net you some nifty free stuff for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>as well, and here they are.</p>

                <p>Circana has shared new video game data that shows how challenging 2024 was for video game hardware. Total spending on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch devices in the US declined a gargantuan 25%, dropping to $4.9 billion (down from $6.45 billion in 2023).</p><p>For December 2024 specifically, spending on new video game hardware fell 29%, declining to $1.1 billion. PS5 hardware sales in December 2024 dropped by 18%, with Xbox Series X|S and Switch sales each declining a more precipitous 38%.</p><p>A major drop in spending on video game hardware is expected, of course, given PS5 and Xbox Series X|S being past their prime selling peaks and the Switch's maturity in the market, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggacbcepk2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana's Mat Piscatella said</a>.

            <p>
BioWare appears to have bid farewell to any further updates for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, following the launch this week of the game's Patch 5.
</p>
<p>
Patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">notes</a> for the update thank fans for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the past few months while some small additional quality of life features have been implemented. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare goes on to state that it is now happy the game is in a "stable place" and will move to monitoring for any reports of game-breaking bugs, should these occur.
</p>
<p>
The patch notes finish with "Dareth shiral!" - meaning '<em>farewell</em>', or '<em>safe journey</em>' in the game's Elvish language. It really sounds like this is it.

<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA said Dragon Age: The Veilguard had missed the publisher's own internal targets</a>, after it "engaged" 1.5 million players between October 2024 and the end of the year, "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations".
</p>
<p>Last week, Eurogamer published the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware">first statement from Dragon Age: The Veilguard game director Corinne Busche</a>, discussing her exit from the studio.</p>
<p>
While large updates to Dragon Age: The Veilguard were not expected and BioWare had already ruled out the prospect of DLC, fans have still reacted in surprise at the sudden end to any further small additions.
</p>
<p>
There had been some hope of a New Game Plus mode being added, for example, as well as further cosmetic options for character clothing designs.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Patch 5 contains a number of small bug fixes, and one final quality of life change: "Recommended levels have been added to side quests that players may receive at significantly lower levels."
</p>
<p>
Dareth shiral, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. On the upside, here's hoping this helps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">BioWare get work spun up more quickly on Mass Effect 5</a>.

			<p>Sometimes a game just meshes so well with you that you feel as though the developers reached into your head just to get the idea for it. The first Heroes of Hammerwatch was one of those for me, and not just me either, but a group of my friends. The lovely graphical style, the music, the exceptional gameplay loop, the meta-progression, and perhaps most importantly the ability to play with as many players as you wanted, are still sublime. Well, Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 is now out, and it’s basically all of that again, but with a new take on some classes, some new skills and systems here and there, and more awesome bosses to get beaten by.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enzo Margaglio - Heroes of Hammerwatch II Trailer Music Full Version" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qIt-Rch26Ds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 is a roguelite action RPG, think original Diablo with more dying, that has you trying to fight off an evil cult. To do this, you have to venture out of the town you save and fight a bunch of stuff. You’re going to die a lot, but that’s very much the point. The overarching progression in Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 comes in a lot of forms.</p>


<p>Building up your town is a surefire way to unlock new upgrades for characters, new buffs to choose at the beginning of your run, and even ways to alter the dungeons you’ll be delving into. You can then keep levelling your character up to get new skills, upgrade their stats, and find equipment as well. Equipment is permanent, but in each run, you’ll also find trinkets to serve as passive boosts during just that run. So, you’ll always be more powerful by the end of a run, but whether that’s powerful enough to beat the game depends on how you started things.</p>


<p>Along with all of that, you unlock in-game achievements as you play the game that grant stat boosts, or extra points to spend on skills, and so on. Each class also grants a special buff that gets better the higher the level is, which means you’re encouraged to play every class, and each time you make a new character, they feel a lot stronger. It just all ties together really well, and makes for an incredibly engaging gameplay loop.</p>
<p>The seven character classes all feel varied too, with each one having its own skills and strengths, along with the skills that different weapons can give them, and then each of those has three subclasses too. You can respec basically all of this whenever you want too, which means that if you get a piece of gear you think could carry an entire build, you can switch it up and try it out.</p>

<p>When you add the ability to play with friends or strangers, and the ability to create lobbies as large as you want, you’ve got a game that just wants to be played, and will always reward you for doing so. Sometimes, you’ll pick your buffs to make sure you can gather resources to buff your town, sometimes to buff your character, and sometimes, you’ll choose violence.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Even when you do eventually beat the game, you're then thrown into a new game plus cycle that means you can just keep playing and making your character stronger and stronger. It's such a blast to play. In fact, it's so good that I've been meaning to write this review for about a week now, but every time I think about Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 I seem to end up playing it instead. Speaking of which...	</p></div>

            <p>If you turn 33 years old in the next couple of months then, sorry, you are dead. I don't make the rules, that's just how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a> world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it. </p>

<p>It's coming out on April 24th. Anybody squeak through in time? Good. You'll be able to enjoy the Persona-style turn-based combat, and probably have sprightly enough reflexes to hit the quicktime prompts at various points mid-battle (although the QTEs "aren't forced on you", we've been told - so maybe you can simply turn them off). This newest trailer, shared during last night's Xbox Developer Direct, also shows off some of the ways you can traverse the world, at one point using a big beetle-like friend to swim and fly over long distances. We've already seen the combat in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55rUagD9sVQ">a previous trailer</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur definitely has an interesting hook. The idea is that every year a big mortal countdown gets shorter, and a bunch of people over a certain age instantly dissolve into the air. Human lifespans are being mystically contracted, the various stages of life compressed into a smaller and smaller box while the remnants of humanity struggle on in the ruins of late-nineteenth century France. All the while the world seems full of weird critters painted into existence by a distant madwoman. Previously, developers Sandfall Interactive have revealed that Andy Serkis of Gollum fame is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/4529024222446556926">among the English voice cast</a>. Although my bet is that his is a small part.</p><p>As for the title. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is certainly a bunch of words in some order with a number attached. The eyes pass over it like a faded road sign. It might say something important under all the grime and vowels. But it might also just be a picture of a windsock. Let us be generous and say the baroque title is just another example of the game following in the footsteps of JRPGs, right down to the often impenetrable naming conventions. Laxadolia: Menacing Shards X. Sephical Lights: Code Wonder. QsY XIV: Last Awakenons. Yes, sir, these are unique Google terms. </p>
<p>Edwin has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noughties-style-jrpg-clair-obscur-wants-to-recapture-the-glories-of-lost-odyssey-with-a-touch-of-devil-may-cry">peered at a preview demo</a> of the game with a curious raised eyebrow, drawing parallels not only to Persona games but the old Xbox 360 games of the mid-2000s, such as Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, not to mention similarly alt-history JRPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valkyria-chronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>. Edwin is dead now, though, lost some Expeditions ago. I too was lost in Expedition 36, making my thumbs too dusty and incapable of saving this particular fantasy world. But maybe, come April, some of you will make it through. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Later in episode, we find out that Innie Mark’s forcible demand for the return of his team in the Season 2 premiere prompted The Board to give him exactly what he wants. This is the same Board that doesn’t respect a single employee enough to show their faces or speak directly to them, yet now they’re willing to let a disgruntled employee force them to change one of their decisions. </p><p>Once we discover Mark’s seeming irreplaceability, certain details of the show go from overlooked fodder to clues. Cobel living across the street from Outie Mark and forcing herself into his life was likely done to make sure he stayed on task. Outie Mark being the only one on the Severed Floor to have someone close to him—his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman)—work for Lumon appears to be some form of emotional manipulation, especially since he specified her death and his inability to shake her memory as reasons for him getting severed. He’s the only one of the four Innies that broke the rules in the Season 1 finale to not only not be fired, but get offered a 20 percent pay increase to return.</p><figure id="" data-id="63b0233803cc19b5dedfed8fcab1d53e" data-recommend-id="image://63b0233803cc19b5dedfed8fcab1d53e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gemma on the Cold Harbor file" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gemma on the Cold Harbor file" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="63b0233803cc19b5dedfed8fcab1d53e" data-recommend-id="image://63b0233803cc19b5dedfed8fcab1d53e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gemma on the Cold Harbor file" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This also gives us a clue into what these people are actually doing for work. At the end of last week’s premiere episode, we see Mark is 68 percent finished with a project called “Cold Harbor” that has Gemma’s face plastered on it. If Lumon has no problem firing and replacing his team at a moment’s notice, it’s safe to assume that whatever they’re working on can be done by anyone. For some inexplicable reason, only Mark can finish his project, which implies there is some sort of connection the workers have to the numbers they’re sorting on the screen. We already know the workers sort the numbers based on an ineffable emotional reaction they have to what the screens show them. Mark being the only one who can finish a project that appears connected to his supposedly dead wife means the project has some inextricable connection to Mark as a person.</p><p>What that connection is, and how Mark became such an important figure to a company that’s been around for over 150 years, is still unknown. Now, figuring out why Mark S is so important is the central mystery we all must uncover, because it likely will unravel the entire tapestry of confusion that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616"><em>Severance</em></a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in 2023, the Video Game History Foundation announced it was curating a digital library, which would allow users to access its vast collection of magazines, art books and more from the comfort of their homes. And while it didn't pop a date on when it would be available to the public at that time, it now has.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamehistoryorg.bsky.social/post/3lggnduk3p227">Writing on social media</a>, the Video Game History Foundation revealed its digital library will be launching next week, on 30th January.</p>
<p>"Good things come to those who wait," the team wrote, promising it would share further details on what to expect closer to the time.</p>

<p>When the digital library was first announced a year and a bit ago, library director Phil Salvador said one of the questions the team at the Video Game History Foundation was asked was how people "can access our collections of rare video game history research materials", but without having to make a trip in person.</p>
<p>This digital library - which in 2023 had already been in the works for two years - was the solution. You can check out a little video about the library above.</p>
<p>The Video Game History Foundation was initially set up back in 2017, by game preservationist and historian Frank Cifaldi. Writing on BlueSky, Cifaldi shared a more recent teaser for the team's "work-in-progress" digital library, adding it will be "such a great resource" for users.</p>
<p>"I just asked it to show me every video game magazine in our collection in chronological order that says Metroidvania," Cifaldi posted.</p>

			<p>A new NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution comparison video further highlights the significant image quality improvements the new Transformer model brings in popular games like Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>Following the release of the video highlighting the significant image quality improvements brought by the new Transformer model in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-4/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shared another comparison video showcasing the image quality improvements the new model brings in Red Dead Redemption 2 and STALKER 2. In the Rockstar Games open-world title, the biggest change is in vegetation quality, as the new model significantly decreases the shimmering in vegetation over the previous version of the upscaler using the CNN model. Hair rendering is also improved with better stability and less aliasing. In GSC World's game, on the other hand, NVIDIA DLSS 4 using the Transformer model improves image stability considerably and reduces vegetation shimmering like in Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution in 5 Games - The Ultimate Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dwv2jaa5yPE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Transformer model isn't the only new thing NVIDIA DLSS 4 brings to the table. Multi Frame Generation, which will be exclusive to RTX 50 series cards, will deliver an up to 8x performance boost versus DLSS 3, making it possible to enjoy games with full path tracing at high framerates and resolutions. Cyberpunk 2077, for example, can run with Overdrive Mode path tracing at above 120 FPS at 4K resolution on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">RTX 5080</a>, which is extremely impressive, considering how taxing path tracing is in pretty much every game that supports it.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 will make its official debut next week, on January 30th, when it will become possible to use a new Override feature to update to the latest version of the upscaler with any game that already supports previous versions.</p>

How many times can video games riff on that one Dr Who episode with the weeping statues? At least once more. Surgeon Simulator devs Bossa have just announced Don't Get Got, in which you and up to seven of your so-called friends are trapped in a large school with randomised objectives and safe rooms. Also in the school: a bunch of horrifying little boys in shorts and braces.
</p>
<p>
It's out in early access today. Yes, they've sprung this one on us like a ghastly Jack-in-the-box. Steady your nerves and watch the trailer.

Going by the video, the little boys only move when you're not looking at them, or can't see them. You probably don't need a PhD in Who to know what kind of play strategy this adds up to: keep that torch topped up with batteries, travel as a pack while looking in different directions, and try not to turn your back on any empty space. 
</p><p>
The trouble is that some of the objectives seemingly require you to take your eyes off the environment - operating a music box while staying perfectly still, for example, or using a scanner. The other trouble is that you have a sanity bar - not sure what the effects of running low are, but I doubt they are helpful. The other other trouble is that some of your friends are bastards. I mean, the game encourages them to be bastards. I'm not calling your friends bastards, with the exception of, you know, <em>her</em>. "Use the environment and collaborate with other players until they no longer serve your needs," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3467390/DONT_GET_GOT/">Steam page</a> summarises.
</p>
<p>
Don't Get Got began life as a gamejam project, and will be in early access for around a year. The current build includes one map, game mode, character and enemy type. The 1.0 release "will definitely have more content in terms of maps, characters, enemy types, items and so on". They're also "intending to use this period to test some radically different ideas, which means there may be experimental features that we try in EA but decide not to ship in the final version."
</p>
<p>
While impressively ghoulish in itself, Don't Get Got does feel a little like yet another claimant to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>'s throne that doesn't have a fraction of that game's cosmic grotesqueness. The title is also a bit How Do You Do, Fellow <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kids">Kids</a>, not that I'm in a position to judge.
</p>
<p>
Still, I'm a fan of Dr Who's Weeping Angels - it's one of two episodes of modern Who I've ever watched, the other being the one with the library where the shadows eat people. I also quite like Bossa, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surgeon-simulator-and-lost-skies-devs-bossa-studios-lay-off-a-third-of-staff-due-to-perfect-storm-of-events">who've been through rough times recently</a>. So I may yet find time for a trip to the schoolhouse.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dooms-combat-evolves-alongside-modern-metal-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom has always had a close relationship with metal music. Hearing one quick burst of any Doom soundtrack, or even just catching a quick glance at the series’ persistent demonic imagery, will tell you this. Its customary pile-up of flames, skulls, and devilish creatures is not far from what you’d see adorning any Iron Maiden stage, past or present. This relationship with the heavier side of music has progressed in step with the series’ gameplay, with both elements having reinvented themselves several times over the 30-plus-year journey of Doom. From its thrash beginnings, Doom has explored multiple metal sub-genres across the decades, progressing all the way to the present day with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and its crunching metalcore hammer blows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 1993, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-1993">original Doom’s</a> driving soundtrack was influenced by the big metal bands of the late 80s and early 90s. Co-creator John Romero has freely discussed how the likes of Pantera and Alice in Chains were major influences, and this can be heard clearly across the score. “Untitled”, for instance, the track used for the E3M1: Hell Keep level, features a riff that’s nearly identical to that heard in Pantera’s “Mouth of War."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Doom: The Dark Ages - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The wider Doom score borrows aspects of the thrash subgenre, recreating in digital form the likes of Metallica and Anthrax. This thudding sound propelled players through Mars’ narrow corridors, quickly getting them from a-to-b while sprinkling in demonic enemies just like Kirk Hammett would a guitar solo into any song possible. Thrash was fast, to the point, and hit between the ears with its urgency, much like Romero’s creation did with its shotgun and BFG when it burst onto the scene. Composer Bobby Prince’s soundtrack remains as timeless as the shooter it soundtracks, perfectly matching the rhythm of its unforgettable gunplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For over a decade, Doom and its music continued in a similar vein, harmonising the rate of its bullets with the speed of its shredding score. That was until 2004, when the experimental <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-3">Doom 3</a> emerged from the darkness. This survival horror-inspired reinvention took risks, and not all of them were successful. A controversial flashlight mechanic that prevented you from shooting a gun while holding it was considered antithetical to Doom, and eventually removed by modders and a 2012 re-release, but no one could deny that Doom 3 <em>was </em>trying new things. A slower, more deliberate pace required a new sound, and so id Software sought out new inspiration.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom 3’s main theme could practically be a bonus track on Tool's 2001 masterpiece, Lateralus.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Trent Reznor’s talents were reportedly sought out to orchestrate the entire sound design of Doom 3, but that plan never quite came to fruition, as explained to IGN by former Nine Inch Nails bandmate Chris Vrenna: “Well, way, way, way back when I was with 'Nails, you know, we worked on Quake. I know that Trent was involved with the project early on and then wasn't involved with it anymore”. In fact, it was to be Vrenna himself who would instead take over the reins with Clint Walsh to compose the threequel’s theme. Their approach mirrors “the thinking man’s” metal outfit, Tool. Doom 3’s main theme could practically be a bonus track on their 2001 masterpiece, Lateralus, its own snaking time signatures and off-kilter soundscape providing the perfect accompaniment to the horror shooter’s sci-fi facility. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Doom 3 was a huge success for id Software and the best-selling game the studio had made so far, its survival horror-ish design is today considered something of an anomaly among its series peers. But that’s unsurprising; the early 2000s was a time when FPS games were going through an evolution, with Call of Duty and Halo arriving on the scene to usher in the era of the console shooter. It was only natural for Doom to morph and change alongside those titans. It was a similarly awkward time for metal music; for every stellar Slipknot and Deftones outing, the remains of the nu-metal blowup were haphazardly working things out. Artists like Limp Bizkit or Mudvayne would certainly have been <em>interesting</em> influences for Tweaker (Vrenna and Walsh’s band) to pick up on, to say the least, but their final Tool-ish direction was undoubtedly the right move. Doom 3 won’t go down as the classic artifact that Tool’s Lateralus has, but it certainly served as a worthy experiment with an unsettling soundtrack that fits its tone perfectly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Doom 3, years passed with no sign of a new entry. Behind the scenes, the series went through an awkward period of development hell. After scrapping the Call of Duty-influenced Doom 4 project and starting afresh, id Software realised that its hallowed shooter needed a complete facelift, and that’s exactly what it got when it returned to stunning form in 2016. Directors Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin helmed the Slayer’s return to Mars, which fully embraced the momentum kickstarted back in ‘93. Shotguns clicked to the rhythm of the score’s chainsaw guitars, and bullets rattled from chainguns as quickly as the double bass pedal slammed down. Composer Mick Gordon layered sub-bass frequencies with white noise to create a quite literally heart-shaking soundtrack that even Meshuggah may have called a little bass-heavy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presenting itself as a playable djent (a progressive and rhythmically chugging metal subgenre) album that bounds along at irrepressible speed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom">Doom 2016</a> incorporated the desire for new extremes in both the shooter and metal worlds. It’s become one of the most celebrated video game scores, perhaps even eclipsing the original itself, so much so that it’s impossible to imagine playing Doom 2016 without it. The question is, once you’ve written something that sounds as good as BFG Division, where do you go from there?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom 2016 incorporated the desire for new extremes in both the shooter and metal worlds.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, that’s where things got a little complicated. Gordon returned to compose the music for 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a>, but a series of messy back-and-forths with id Software resulted in a soundtrack that’s not all his. It’s unclear exactly what happened, with contradicting stories disagreeing on just how many of his mixes made the final cut. His fingerprints are clearly all over it, though, as the tracks feel like evolved versions of those that came four years previously with an even more modern edge. Eternal’s soundtrack leans further into metalcore, <em>the </em>prevailing metal genre of the late 2010s and early 2020s. It’s likely no coincidence that, around the time of Doom Eternal’s release, Gordon was also producing songs and albums for the genre’s big British names, Bring Me the Horizon and Architects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gordon’s production can certainly be heard in those bands’ mixes, especially in BMTH’s Post Human: Survival Horror (an album incidentally laden with video game references). But the sound of these bands has also found its way into Eternal’s score, especially its propensity for even more crushing breakdowns and added electronic splashes. It’s still undoubtedly heavy, but feels a little lighter when compared to its predecessor, something that is reflected in Eternal’s gameplay with its platforming and puzzle sections that sprinkle more experimental game design in between the punishing gunfights.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom 2016 is still my favourite Doom game. I appreciate the hell out of Eternal, but much like the metalcore bands that influenced its soundtrack, I prefer the rawer, less refined work they produced a few years previously. Architects’ album All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us, also from 2016, happens to be my favourite metal album of all time. It’s a crushing piece of work both sonically and lyrically, hitting a sweet spot much like Doom did in the same year with its landmark reinvention. Eternal, much like Architects’ more recent outings, is extremely good, and can never be faulted for taking risks, but just doesn’t hit me in quite the same way. Sometimes less is more, but I know many who hold Eternal in higher regard who would happily disagree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Doom: The Dark Ages finds itself in an intriguing spot. In the recent Xbox Developer Direct, we got a good look at how its refreshed combat changes things up in a fairly big way for the series. So, if history is anything to go by, it will need an appropriate soundtrack to sit alongside that brutality. We may have only heard snippets up until this point, but it appears that new composers Finishing Move (Borderlands 3 and The Callisto Protocol) are taking inspiration from metal both past and present, much like how The Dark Ages’ gameplay references the original Doom with new twists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Ages plays at a slower pace than Eternal’s whiplash vertical platforming and arena slingshotting, instead arming you with a Captain America-like shield that encourages you to square up and barrel into enemies of all sizes. This face-first nature reflects the original Doom’s design which shuttled you through corridors and into gangs of enemies, but The Dark Ages take this philosophy and expands it a hundred-fold, arming you with 30-story high mechs and fire-breathing dragons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Such combat requires a malleable soundtrack; something that can feel as heavy, if not heavier, than anything that has come before, but also light on its feet when you’re swooping around on a winged beast. The former can be found in the tracks of one of the most prominent heavy bands in the world right now, Knocked Loose. The seismic-sounding breakdowns and plunges into half-time heard in the background of the gameplay shown so far are only a guttural scream and a pig squeal away from the Kentucky natives’ output. But this is then combined with more traditional, almost thrash-like moments that echo the original 1993 Doom, and even earlier metal that borrows a lot lyrically from fantastical, satanic, and medieval inspirations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re yet to fully understand the breadth of The Dark Ages’ gameplay suite, but I’m more than hopeful that id Software is building on everything that came prior, not just in the Doom series, but also from beyond its own walls. Mounting mythological creatures and piloting giant mechs are exciting additions that one wouldn’t necessarily expect from Doom - a traditionally “boots on the ground” shooter - but are welcome surprises nonetheless. Titanfall 2 appears to continue to influence campaign shooter design beyond its signature mobility and wall-running. In many ways, this shift parallels the evolution modern metal music has experienced in recent years, with experimentation within the genre proving fertile ground, whether that’s in a greater exploration of electronic, hip-hop, or hyperpop trappings that the likes of Bring Me the Horizon freely implement, or the grin-inducing reggaeton-like beat that powers Knocked Loose’s “Suffocate”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an exciting time for heavy music, and in turn an exciting time for Doom fans. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-the-first-preview">The Dark Ages is shaping up to thrill in every area where the series has excelled over the years,</a> but naturally, gunplay will always be king when it comes to an id Software shooter. In fact, if Doom was a packed-out arena metal concert, its combat would be centre stage, and its soundtrack would (somewhat confusingly) be the demonic set dressing. We’ve only had a small peek at what lies in store for us in both regards when it comes to Doom: The Dark Ages, but it’s safe to say I’m very excited to potentially have a new favourite metal album to play through in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

			<p>After an incredible year for indie horror in 2024, Dead of Darkness looks to continue the genre’s resurgence in the new year. At first sight, Dead of Darkness looks like it might be paying tribute to Konami’s classic series Silent Hill, with main character Miles sporting the obligatory grieving Dad uniform of beige jacket, jeans, and floppy hair parting, but the game itself is far more inspired by Capcom’s earlier Resident Evil.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead of Darkness - Story Trailer (2D Pixel Art Survival Horror Action Adventure)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jiS9Q9KZQZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You begin the game as burned out PI Miles Windham. After receiving a mysterious message recorded on a cassette (the game takes place in 1985) he sets out for Velvet Island in the Celtic Sea off the coast of Ireland. His unknown messenger claims to have information about the tragic fire that claimed the lives of Miles’ family. Mysterious and tragic backstory – check; unexpected journey to an isolated mansion – check; immediate meeting with a blonde woman who will probably be more than she first appears – hell yeah. This opening sounds clichéd but I think it’s more correct to consider it deliberate homage to the genre traditions. Dead of Darkness is clearly deeply immersed in the world of survival horror for better or for worse.</p>


<p>Dead of Darkness has a distinctive top down pixel aesthetic that feels straight out of the Super Nintendo days. The resultant lack of clear detail in the backgrounds is alleviated by the use of shiny circles to show where collectable items can be found – ironically the same tactic used in the highly detailed pre-rendered PS1 games.</p>


<p>While initially enemies are entirely made up of identical zombies, as the game progresses there are some wonderfully disgusting creatures waiting to eat your face off. The characters are nicely designed and the static figures used in dialogue sections look good too.</p>
<p>Audio is solid with suitably creepy moans and screams and a surprising amount of voice acting. I was taken aback, though, by how foul-mouthed the script is, with some characters throwing out the C-word like they’re auditioning for an Irish sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes the Deep</a>. I have no problem with strong language, but wasn’t expecting it here.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for Mile’s trip to take a turn for the worse and you quickly obtain a pistol that will be your main weapon for much of the game. Later on you’ll also obtain a shotgun, but I would have liked a little more variety in your arsenal beyond this. There are upgrades for both weapons which you’ll need to take out the more dangerous foes towards the end of the game. The positive to this limited arsenal is that it does help reduce the inventory management that is such a core aspect of the genre. Aside from some quests that require you to carry multiple items you can generally get by having both pistol, shotgun, and healing items at all times.</p>

<p>What initially seems to be a standard retread of familiar spooky mansion shenanigans becomes something far more interesting as the storyline develops. Yes, you have the inevitable sinister Umbrella-analogue corporation, but there is also a backstory that feels closer to folk and cosmic horror.</p>
<p>Alongside a lot of combat (with many narrow corridors not making evasion a workable strategy) there is the usual gamut of puzzles and key fetch quests. One neat addition here though is the use of Clues. Reading some files and notes can unlock Clues which you can use like objects to interact with the environment or your inventory. This is a great way to incentivise actually reading the notes and really brings the world of the game to life.</p>
<p>Less welcome are a bunch of instadeath timing puzzles that don’t quite gel with the top down perspective. Moving up the screen across retracting spikes when your character obscures the view is less than ideal, with one very late-game area being a particularly egregious example. I would also put the instadeath enemies in the bin as well, especially when the shotgun sometimes seems to fire through them and necessitate a game reload.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		All in all, Dead of Darkness is a great 2D Resident Evil tribute that brings plenty of its own ideas to the table. There could have been less reliance on instakills late in the game and the attempts to feed in some Eternal Darkness style sanity effects are underdone, but the core gameplay, the puzzles, and the twisting narrative are all well worth the price of entry.	</p></div>

			<p>Warner Bros. Games CEO David Haddad is leaving the company. The news <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was broken by Variety</a> and confirmed by the publisher, which shared the following statement from WB Global Streaming CEO JB Perrette:</p>
<p><em>David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title.</em></p>
<p>Haddad himself also provided a statement on his departure from the company after nearly ten years in the role and over twenty in total at WB Games:</p>
<p><em>I am so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together at Warner Bros. Games during my time with the company. It has been an absolute pleasure working on and building our iconic gaming franchises, and I will continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of this talented team’s future endeavors. I look forward to working on the next chapter of my career and will always be grateful for my time with Warner Bros. Games.</em></p>
<p>Speculation is that the recent failures of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus might have played a role. The former game by Rocksteady was a massive disappointment that <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> a major financial drop in revenue for the publisher after a big investment. The latter certainly cost a lot less to make, but it still ultimately underperformed despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-surpassed-20-million-players-in-less-than-a-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial success seen in the Open Beta a couple of years ago</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's also worth remembering that Warner Bros. Games smashed sales records just a couple of years ago with Avalanche Software's Hogwarts Legacy, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was the best-selling game of 2023</a> in a year filled with triple-A releases. A sequel is already in production and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might have live service elements</a>; in the meantime, rumors suggest a sort of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitive edition of Hogwarts Legacy</a> is being made with the help of Rocksteady.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-developers-are-allegedly-hiding-fake-heroes-in-game-files-to-catch-leakers.1090938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>New claims have hit the internet that the Marvel Rivals developers are adding fake heroes within its game files to confuse and catch leakers, or are they?</p>



<p>The discussion first appeared on the Marvel Rivals Leak discord channel, where data miner and leaker Keone posted that NetEase is likely adding fake heroes to the game in order to confuse data miners.</p>



<p>“Hello everyone, it has come to our attention that the devs have set up characters to catch leakers, not only the ones in the code – but potentially insider sources, too. Kang will probably explain this more as we go on, but here is the current list as far as we can figure out,” Keone explained. He then posted a picture of the characters which he believes will not be coming to the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-fake-heroes-being-planted-in-marvel-rivals">Are There Fake Heroes Being Planted in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>But the story doesn’t quite end there, as X0X Leaking Team member&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zvis_ceral</a>, who is also a dataminer stepped in to elaborate. </p>



<p>“This is not a 100% confirmation that they are all coming or when they will come. This is just to show off that these actually exist,” he said. He continued with a thread of heroes and code:</p>



<div><article><p><span>This is not a 100% confirmations that they are all coming or when they will come. 
This is just to show off that these actually exist. 🧵

All Hero tags can be found in: Marvel/Content/Marvel/Data/DataTable/MarvelHeroTable

Ability Tables are to long to fit the screenshot, will… </span></p></article></div>



<p>While it would be uncommon but plausible for developers to add fake code to their games to catch leakers intentionally, it doesn’t quite make sense as to why they would. After all, the “real” heroes that are making their way to the game would still have to be in the code and would be leaked before their official announcement anyway.</p>



<p>While I don’t consider myself a tech guru when it comes to datamining, to me, it seems like this is all just code related to game development and not necessarily some huge plan from the developers to screw over leakers. All the game code tells us (and is the case for all game leaks that come via game code) is that certain things were in development and planned at one point or another. Whether they release or not is unclear unless the code specifically says.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-x-men-characters-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – These X-men Characters have been leaked to be coming to Marvel Rivals.</a></strong></p>



<p>So, are Marvel Rivals planting fake heroes? I don’t think so. Personally, I think people have misinterpreted the game code and what it means in some way.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Marvel Rivals leaks? Do you think some have been fake-planted? </p>

More recently, Musk had a hardcore level 97 Path of Exile 2 character, although it has since perished. <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879520605634220362" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He has said</a> he plays video games “to quiet my mind.” “Some days are real tough, so playing video games is my strange solace,” he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Musk's self-proclaimed gaming prowess was brought into question as players began to take a closer look at his performance and knowledge of the games he plays. Some had questioned whether Musk was capable of dedicating the huge amount of time that would be needed to reach his high levels in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2 given his commitments as boss of Tesla, SpaceX, X/Twitter, and now as Donald Trump's efficiency tsar. Then <a href="https://youtu.be/4gxRyXsPoXI?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an early January livestream that saw Musk tackling endgame tasks in Path of Exile 2</a> drew criticism from fans who said he failed to demonstrate a basic understanding of the game’s mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many had assumed that Musk might have been paying others to boost his Path of Exile 2 character for him, and so it proved. <a href="https://x.com/NikoWrex/status/1880845217525588330" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A video posted on</a> Sunday by the Diablo player NikoWrex showed a direct message conversation with Musk on X in which Musk admits to account boosting, insisting it was the only way to compete with players in Asia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Have you level boosted (had someone else play your accounts) and/or purchased gear/resources for PoE2 [Path of Exile 2] and Diablo 4?” asked NikoWrex. Musk responded with a 100% emoji. He later added: “It’s impossible to beat the players in Asia if you don’t, as they do!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But when I post a video of a game or am streaming, that's 100% me," he added. Musk was asked whether he intended to take credit for having a high level hardcore Path of Exile 2 character. "No. Never claimed that," he replied. "The top accounts in Diablo or PoE require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> producer and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has once again warned players not to use third-party tools in the MMORPG.</p>
<p>In particular, there is one tool being used to check in-game character information not displayed during gameplay, which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is considering taking legal action over.</p>
<p>In a post on Final Fantasy 14 forum <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515102">The Lodestone</a>, Yoshida stated the development team is aware of this tool and concerns raised by the community.</p>

<p>"The tool is being used to display a segment of an FF14 character's internal account ID, which is then used in an attempt to further correlate information on other characters on the same FFXIV service account," explained Yoshida.</p>
<p>As a result, Square Enix is discussing requesting the tool be removed and deleted, as well as pursuing legal action.</p>
<p>Yoshida further assured players personal information is not accessible through this tool.</p>
<p>"Aside from character information that can be checked in-game and on the Lodestone, we have received concerns that personal information registered on a user's Square Enix account, such as address and payment information, could also be exposed with this tool," he said. "Please rest assured that it is not possible to access this information using these third-party tools."</p><p>He continued: "We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools. We also ask that players do not share information about third-party tools such as details about their installation methods, or take any other actions to assist in their dissemination."</p>
<p>Lastly, Yoshida reiterated that third-party tools are prohibited in Final Fantasy 14, concluding: "We will continue to take a firm stance against their usage."</p>
<p>It's a line Yoshida has repeatedly stated, despite some players using third-party tools and mods in the game.</p>
<p>Back in November last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-world-first-ultimate-raid-challengers-busted-for-cheating-thanks-to-single-pixel">Ultimate Raid world first challenge was disrupted for the third year in a row</a> due to cheaters using a tool to highlight a character's exact hitbox.</p>
<p>"As the individual who is entrusted with full supervision over Final Fantasy 14, it is my responsibility to enact countermeasures and police the use of these tools, as well as educate people to not use these types of third-party tools - this is especially unfortunate when I, as a gamer, am cheering on everyone who is learning this content by trial and error and putting in the effort to clear," said Yoshida after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-extremely-disappointed-in-final-fantasy-14-mod-use">previous year's challenge was similarly disrupted</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After partnerships with Halo, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Mountain Dew, Doritos' next video game promotion is the upcoming live-action/CGI Minecraft Movie starring Jason "Aquaman" Momoa and Jack "Tenacious D is on hold" Black.
</p>
<p>
Two new flavours are being rolled out - so you can finally find out what a Minecraft Creeper, and also a Ghast, taste like as a processed corn snack.
</p>
<p>
A press release today trumpets the fact that Doritos are also changing their shape for first time. Yes, the triangluar treat is turning square. But this will only be the case for a rare 100 packs - and if you find one, you win a £10k prize.

<p>
"Creeper Vinegar delivers a zesty, explosive flavour," Doritos said in a press release, describing its new flavour. Apparently, it is "reminiscent of the sneaky green creatures that lurk in the shadows". 
</p>
<p>
Ghast BBQ, meanwhile, "offers a sweet and tangy taste". 
</p>
<p>
So, basically salt and vinegar and then sweet chili.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Minecraft Movie is set to arrive in cinemas on 4th April</a>, and it looks... yeah. Jack Black plays default Minecraft man Steve, in a blocky CGI world that looks like Mojang's simulation put through an AI filter.
</p>
<p>
I'll give the salt and vinegar flavour a go, anyway.

            <p>Good news for anyone eager to meet a big talking catfish. A new trailer for action adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/south-of-midnight">South Of Midnight</a> sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US' Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.</p>

<p>It's coming out April 8th. The trailer was part of yesterday's Xbox Developer Direct, and it shows a little more of the protagonist's motives, as well as the mythical and human figures who will both help and hinder her. We catch a glimpse of Huggin' Molly, for example. A <a href="https://www.spiritshack.co.uk/blog/ghost-stories/huggin-molly/">legend of Abbeville, Alabama</a>, Molly is a ghostly (and again, tall) figure who is said to stalk any kid out late at night. She will grab, hug, and scream at you if she catches you. I don't see the problem. Sounds like a normal granny to me.</p>
<p>This trailer marks the third big glimpse we've had of the marshy misadventure. One previous trailer showed us how the player will bash <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witchy-swampy-action-adventure-south-of-midnight-gets-a-proper-gameplay-trailer-with-island-sized-alligators">a big-armed miniboss bozo</a>, and fly across the bog in the company of crows. While the release announcement introduced us to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-happy-few-devs-reveal-south-of-midnight-a-new-action-adventure-set-in-a-magical-realist-american-south">long-limbed guitar player called Shakin' Bones</a>. If you're really desperate to follow more of the development, developers Compulsion Games have also made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLBOyKqw58A">a 30-minute "making of" video</a> that talks more about the music, influences, and ideas behind the story.</p>

<p>Compulsion are the studio who made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/we-happy-few">We Happy Few</a>, a first-person survival dystopia with some creepy character design and a strong theme (alternate history Britain in the 1960s where everyone is on drugs). But it was also a little jumbled when it came to actually playing through the story, said John in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-we-happy-few">our review</a>. I'm still keen to get my hands on this new swamp-and-slash of theirs though. The music alone seems worth a look. Or a listen. You know what I mean.</p><p>Meanwhile the Xbox show also revealed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/koei-tecmo-surprise-release-ninja-gaiden-2-black-definitive-unreal-remaster-of-the-2008-hack-and-slash">surprise Ninja Gaiden 2 remake</a> that was released immediately onto Steam (haha, what). And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-out-may-15th-2025-heres-everything-we-learned-from-ids-press-show">a release date for Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, which is also coming out in Spring. That's good. Let this long winter end. Let the games flow forth.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I’ve really enjoyed my gaming time this week. Whether it’s been jumping into some co-op in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/22/hyper-light-breaker-early-access-review-beauty-and-a-beast/">Hyper Light Breaker</a>, or taking down some Orcs in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, it’s been fun to catch up with friends while taking out a variety of ugly badniks. I’ve also reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/20/freedom-wars-remastered-review/">Freedom Wars Remastered</a>, and taken a look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/22/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-shows-just-how-far-mobile-gaming-has-come/">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a> too. Alongside that, I’ve replaced the battery in my 3DS and been playing around with Fire Emblem Awakening, Animal Crossing: New Leaf (of course I immediately received a letter from Winnie to say she’d left sometime in the 8 years since I last played it), and Project X Zone. There’s a bunch of stuff on my account that I only have a minimal memory of too, so that’ll be a fun diversion in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>First up, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. This is little surprise, I know. Meanwhile, <strong>Jason</strong> joined me for some Hyper Light Breaker and Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, but mostly it’s been Heroes of Hammerwatch 2, calling it, “The one true game of the year so far.” I think he likes it, and you’ll catch his review later today.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> finally finished off the main quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance which ends rather abruptly and on a rather obvious cliffhanger. He tells us, “I was tempted to mop up a few of the outlying side quests but figured I’d already spent plenty of time in Bohemia and will no doubt revisit once I get my hands on the sequel.”</p>
<p>That’s not all though, as he moved onto the next on his backlog, Alan Wake 2. He says, “I remember being excited for the original game back on Xbox 360 but didn’t have the same appreciation for its media and literary inspirations at the time, namely Twin Peaks. The sequel is exactly what you’d expect from a survival horror game in a post-RE2 remake world, albeit fuelled by a mind-bending plot that feels like its own autonomous being, giving itself permission to fuse Alan Wake with Remedy’s other video game worlds.”</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been playing the brilliant Unicorn Overlord, saying, “I’ve just reached the halfway point and have loved every minute so far! As a big fan of Fire Emblem, Unicorn Overlord’s combo of strategy, characterisation, and stat tinkering has had me hooked.” He continues, “I’ve also played Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter for review, which you can read my thoughts about this coming Monday. Oh! And my partner and I are nearing the end game of Sea of Stars – a fantastic old-school RPG with excellent local co-op, highly recommended!”</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> week has seen him play more The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. He tells us, “I have decided out of every open world game I have ever experienced, nothing comes close to exploring the Skellige Isles. It is a combo of the scenery and music that makes it click so well. My gaming will come to an abrupt end after this weekend as I’m jetting off to Japan for a few weeks, and I will be seeing if I can find any treasures out there.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been switching between modern indie and classic 360 gaming with my Gears of War journey continuing with the second game. He says, “I’ve been thoroughly enjoying my time with it and it’s a massive improvement over the first with some spectacular setpieces. I did encounter some horrific screeching crashes which seem to be fixed by turning off the FPS boost feature so hoping to get it finished soon.” That’s not all that’s been on his screen though,&nbsp; “Alongside the adventures of Dom and Marcus I’ve been enjoying some top-down Resident Evil homage with the excellent Dead of Darkness, a smidgeon of sci-fi Metroidvania with a classical mythology twist in Somber Echoes and some strategic adventuring with Stone of Madness. The range of styles and sheer quality in indie gaming continues to astound me.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has&nbsp;been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-remaster-review/">Star Wars Episode 1: Jedi Power Battles Remastered</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and Cuisineer for review—also a bit of Phasmophobia and Dying Light.</p>
<p>And finally&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been joining me for bouts of Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap, alongside some Assetto Corsa EVO as it makes its first steps into Early Access, and has been getting on with our review of Sniper Elite: Resistance.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have </em>you<em> played?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Sutte Hakkun</li>
<li>Fatal Fury 2</li>
<li>Super Ninja Boy</li>

<p>Fatal Fury 2 is a SNES port of SNK's arcade fighting game. Will you choose to fight as Terry Bogard, or his younger brother Andy? Or perhaps wrestling as Big Bear is more your thing.</p>
<p>As for Sutte Hakkun, it's this chap's first official time in the west. It's a cute looking puzzler, where players control a little bird-like creature who can suck up liquids of different colours and then inject that liquid into once-colourless blocks to move them in different directions.</p>
<p>In case you were unaware, Nintendo Switch Online members can get themselves access to multiple NES, Super NES and Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Additionally, those who choose to go for the higher priced Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack option will also be able to get their mitts on Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and SEGA Mega Drive games, along with other perks. That includes things like expansions for other Nintendo games, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-8-deluxes-final-wave-of-dlc-arrives-next-week">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/24/synduality-echo-of-ada-review-the-ultimate-extraction-experience/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I have not been able to stop thinking about Synduality Echo of Ada since I started playing it. When I wake up, I think of doing a quick run to get those last few cables I need to upgrade my crafting station. While I’m working, I think about what I should equip to deal with the snow bandits in the South Map reliably. As soon as I finish work, I hop onto the game and spend hours hunting resources, creatures, and other players. For years, I’ve been clamouring for a game that scratches that Escape From Tarkov-inspired&nbsp;extraction-shooter itch I’ve never had properly scratched. For Synduality Echo of Ada to not only grant that wish, but bundle it in with mecha combat, customisable characters, and rewarding base upgrades feels like all of my favourite things about gaming rolled up into one package.</p>
<p><iframe title="SYNDUALITY Echo of Ada - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6Zjh8O7JnM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Funnily enough, Synduality Echo of Ada isn’t just a standalone game release – it’s part of a wider Synduality multi-media franchise that kicked off in Japan a couple of years ago with the release of the anime Synduality: Noir. You won’t need to brush up on what happens in that anime to enjoy this game, though, and that’s for a couple reasons. For one, this game is set a few decades before that anime. For another, though, there’s only a whisper of storytelling happening in this game regardless. An intro cutscene sets you up as being a faceless mech-piloting contractor called a Drifter, who operates in a post-post apocalypse world alongside your own humanoid AI Magus companion. Once that’s set up, you’re tossed into your dilapidated garage of a base, told to start gathering resources, and so it goes.</p>


<p>Synduality Echo of Ada is much more about telling and discovering your own story, and it’ll often be a story of scraping by on a wish and a prayer – or not scraping by at all. As an extraction shooter, your goal is simple (on paper) – customise your loadout of weapons and consumables at home, then launch into a massive map at a randomised location. Your only mandatory goal is to find one of several extraction elevators and get out alive. Whatever happens between those two points is up to you – in the beginning, you’ll probably just want to get straight to that elevator and survive. Two major things stand in the way of that, though – roaming monsters, and other roaming pilots. There’s a pretty basic handful of monster varieties in the game that repeat frequently, but I appreciated the fact that this repetition made it easy to start learning how to navigate around them or consistently target their weak points.</p>
<p>Pilots are a whole other story, though. In Synduality Echo of Ada, you are never alone on the map. Some major locations will have AI bandits roaming around that are tough to deal with, but you’ll also have other real players out in the field alongside you. Typically, an encounter with another player leads to the two of you hitting the “Wave” emote and hopping up and down a few times before going your separate ways. There’s trepidation from both parties to engage in any kind of combat in a situation like this, since – as per extraction shooter rules – dying means losing everything you’re carrying. Whoever survives a theoretical PvP bout gets to loot their destroyed foe’s goods, though, and even take their mech parts.</p>


<p>On one occasion, I was deep in the city ruins, wearing my basic starter weapons and mech parts. I passed by another player whose back was turned to me, their attention focused on a box they were looting. My trigger finger moved before my brain could think. I blasted them in the back with a couple of shotgun rounds, and they swivelled around to desperately spray a few machine gun rounds in my general direction. A third shotgun shell smacked against their frame. I was locked in. They were turned back around and sped as far away from me as possible. I swapped to my machine gun and plucked rounds into them as they got further and further away, but not far enough to survive that last round. I ran to their deathbox to see what the spoils of my bloodshed were, and I discovered a rare mech set that could fetch me over half a million in-game credits if I could get it back home alive. I grabbed everything, sprinted to an elevator, and waved sheepishly at any other player I encountered.</p>
<p>I felt things I’ve never felt before in that moment of playing Synduality Echo of Ada.</p>
<p>The fact that loss matters so much in this game makes every run so immediately important and visceral. And with so many reasons to do a run, you’ll naturally have some goal to work towards each time you dive in. Requests pour in from various factions that reward you with new gear and Magus clothing items upon success, but you’ve also got dozens of rooms and features in your run-down homebase that you can build and upgrade by collecting and crafting materials. Eventually, you’ll unlock the ability to start a co-up crew with players who you meet in the field, which will spawn a huge boss monster you can fight together for some randomized rewards. There’s even a full single-player mode to unlock that acts as a psuedo story-mode, giving you a pre-built mech and Magus to tackle bespoke missions with and collect documents tying into the lore of the Synduality universe.</p>
<p>I’ve got to talk about the Magus. Your AI companion can be customized visually from head-to-toe, and the base unit you choose also indicates their personality and how they’ll talk to you. Believe me, they talk a lot. Your Magus will be hanging out all the time in your base when you’re not exploring, and when you are exploring, they’re floating by your side and regularly calling out nearby resources, gunfire in the distance, other players, incoming deadly weather, and more. There’s a constant stream of vital information pouring in from your companion, and the more you play, the more they learn about why and how you play – noting areas you frequently die in, potential locations for items you need, and more. Your Magus can also fall into several different classes that give them different special abilities to assist you – from a Weather Catcher that can spot incoming rain and shield you from it’s damage to another class that specializes in healing you and scanning for the quality of nearby resources.</p>

<p>The blend of endearing human interaction via your Magus and cold, calculated, cool-as-hell mecha combat is the sauce that really brings Synduality Echo of Ada together. So many things have been blended together into this one package, and the fact that it all works so well and creates such an addicting and immersive experience is an absolute treat. When PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds came out, it put a spotlight on the potential of the battle-royale genre and then Fortnite adapted that into a clean, accessible, and addictive alternative. Synduality Echo of Ada is the addictive and accessible extraction shooter that the world has been waiting for.</p>
