			<p>Final Fantasy XVI has been wanted by those on different platforms for a long time, with the game finally coming to PC as of September 17. Initially, when the game was being developed, it was established as being on PC before they decided to make it a PlayStation 5 exclusive, which was released in June 2023. Since then, the game has received two paid DLC episodes, with multiple fixes coming out to make the game more accessible, especially with camera controls.</p>
<p>While the announcement dropped today with a brand-new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI, it is also on good authority from a known leaker named NateDrake that the game is potentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-happen/">coming to Xbox in the future</a> on ResetEra forums, as developers have stated in the past that they want as many people as possible to play the game.</p>
<p>In the new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI titled "Deliverance," you can see some of the action you can expect throughout the game as you fight against Eikons and other enemies. The DLC will be available to purchase on release for those who plan on purchasing it on PC. You can buy the base game on PC for $49.99 or the Complete Edition of Final Fantasy XVI, which includes the two DLCS: The Rising Tides and Echoes of the Fallen, for $69.99.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the system requirements for Final Fantasy XVI aren't as heavy as some might expect. Below are both the minimum and recommended specifications for Final Fantasy XVI. The most surprising thing on the list is probably that the game is a whopping 170 GB.</p>

Your first set, the Primitive Armor Set, you can craft directly from your inventory system with a handful of resources. It’s adequate, but you’ll want to upgrade quickly.</p><p>Once you progress deeper into the game, you require a Workbench and Forge to smelt iron ore into forged iron, which is a key component of many armor sets. But for that, you must first track down iron deposits, which typically spawn underground. If you can find a mine POI, you’ll have much better luck. But you can also dig deep into the ground with a shovel in the hopes of finding a small deposit.</p><p>On top of resources like iron, many armor sets also require Armor Crafting Kits, which you can find in high-value loot containers and as quest rewards for the traders.</p><h2 id="h11039"><a id=""></a><strong>Types of armor in the game</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b18565e0252e9da4b623006d05ff8e88" data-recommend-id="image://b18565e0252e9da4b623006d05ff8e88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The armor crafting UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The armor crafting UI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Fun Pimps / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b18565e0252e9da4b623006d05ff8e88" data-recommend-id="image://b18565e0252e9da4b623006d05ff8e88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The armor crafting UI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In total, <em>7 Days to Die</em> features 16 unique armor sets, with the majority offering a set bonus that boosts your stats and abilities for wearing every piece. These armor sets fall under four categories: Primitive Armor, Light Armor, Medium Armor, and Heavy Armor.<br></p><p>In the early game, you’ll likely rock the Primitive Armor. It’s the most cost-effective to craft, but it’s also the only armor set in the game that doesn’t offer a bonus.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esl-faceit-group-announces-partnership-extension-with-dhl/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>More and more companies are getting involved in esports. DHL, the popular logistics organization, has officially announced an extension of its partnership with the esports tournament organizer, ESL FACEIT Group. This is a multi-year deal that will showcase the brand across various ESL broadcasts.</p>



<p>DHL already has a prominent presence within the Snapdragon Pro series, which is the world’s largest mobile esports competition. </p>



<h2 id="h-esl-faceit-group-extends-partnership-with-dhl">ESL FACEIT Group Extends Partnership With DHL</h2>



<p>DHL first found themselves in a deal with ESL FACEIT Group back in 2018. In those six consecutive years working together, DHL has obtained immense success from the partnership, with a result of gaining more than 10,000 job applications just since 2022. It is a no-brainer as to why the company is choosing to continue working with ESL.</p>



<p>Not only will DHL be a title sponsor for ESL, but they will also be managing the logistics of staging and broadcasting technologies required for events, such as DreamHack and more.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>“Through its partnership with EFG, DHL has become a brand that inspires gaming fans like none other,” said Rodrigo Samwell, Chief Commercial Officer at ESL FACEIT Group. “We see thousands of fans chanting ‘DHL’ at our live events, and the love the esports community shows to DHL is nothing short of extraordinary.”</p>



<p>ESL has been consistently adding more and more partners to its brand, making it one of the biggest names in esports.</p>



<p>“That support is a testament to the fact that EFG’s and DHL’s joint long-term strategy resonates with the most important people: our fans.”</p>



<p>The industry continues to thrive as more and more brands are beginning to partner with esports.</p>







<h2 id="h-about-dhl">About DHL</h2>



<p>DHL is a global leader in the statistics industry. The company specializes in international shipping, courier services and transportation. The company was first founded back in 1969 in San Francisco, California, and has long since been catering to different businesses, people and organizations.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> will launch on PC on 17th September across both the Epic Games Store and Steam.
</p>
<p>
The PC version has been long-awaited since the game was released as a PS5 console exclusive last year.
</p>
<p>
Today's news comes with a new PC specific trailer, see below. A demo is available to try out now.

<p>
The game will arrive as a complete edition, including all DLC: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-first-dlc-opens-that-one-mysterious-door-and-its-characters-minds">Echoes of the Fallen</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-is-finally-complete-though-its-dlc-wont-appease-critics">The Rising Tide</a>.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month speculation rose that an announcement was imminent when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-profile-in-latest-nvidia-driver-leads-to-speculation-of-imminent-pc-release">Nvidia's latest driver included mention of the game</a>, along with a demo.
</p>
<p>
The demo begins at the start of the game and data can be carried over to the full game. This is the same as the PS5 launch.
</p>
<p>
Final Fantasy 16 received a mostly positive response, though some longtime fans were less keen on the series shift from traditional turn-based combat to real-time action combat.
</p>
<p>
The simultaneous release across Epic and Steam differs from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, which first launched as an Epic exclusive before arriving on Steam the following year. However it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-pc-barebones-port">criticised at launch for its performance</a>.

</p>
<p>
Let's hope Final Fantasy 16 doesn't suffer the same fate.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-gets-new-trailer-ahead-of-gamescom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Commandos: Origins, the latest game to be developed by Claymore Game Studios and published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-kalypso/">Kalypso Media</a>, has dropped a new trailer ahead of their showcase at Gamescom 2024. This game is the highly anticipated sequel in the Commandos franchise, which has been around since 1998. This will be the eighth game in the franchise, and it is a completely new story compared to the previous two, which were HD remasters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Gameplay Trailer (US)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HImqjeqCANo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer offers an exclusive look into the stealth-oriented game, which will be released later this year. "We are incredibly proud to present Commandos: Origins for the first time to a wide audience at Gamescom 2024. This represents a significant milestone for our studio after working secretly on our game for so long. As we draw closer to release, we're excited to offer gamers the opportunity to embark on their first mission at the show floor and we are eager to hear their feedback as they experience the compelling tactical gameplay from Commandos: Origins firsthand," says Juergen Reusswig, Studio Director at Claymore Game Studios.</p>
<p>Technically, Commandos: Origins is a prequel. It delves deep into the beginning of the Commandos' journey and allows players to embark on missions with iconic characters from the franchise. Players will reunite with characters such as Jack O'Hara (The Green Beret) and Thomas Hancock (The Sapper) while navigating through a World War II setting.</p>
<p>The new gameplay trailer showcases intense combat sequences, demonstrating the Commandos' multiple mission approaches and abilities. These demonstrations show players that they can lurk in the shadows and use stealth tactics to complete the sequences, or they can go in guns blazing, utilizing Flak-Vierlings to their advantage to cause dramatic explosions and kill enemies with flair.</p>
<p>For those attending gamescom 2024, you can test Commandos: Origins in person at the Xbox Booth in Hall 7. In addition to being on platforms such as <a href="https://kalypso.shop/click.html?x=a62e&amp;lc=hOl&amp;mc=H&amp;s=ySOl&amp;u=X&amp;z=7Xp4FrA&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1479730/Commandos_Origins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, they've also expanded the game to be available to those using a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In addition, to those who have Xbox Game Pass, you'll be able to play it as a Day One release on both Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>Commandos: Origins features a 2-player cooperative multiplayer where you can team up with a friend on either a local split-screen or via online gameplay. There will be more than 10 missions for players to get through while seeing six infamous characters from the previous games for nostalgia as you travel through a World War II campaign.</p>

<p>The full lineup for the upcoming Intel Core Ultra 200 family of CPUs has leaked along with its release date. According to <a href="https://benchlife.info/intel-core-ultra-2-desktop-cpu-will-announce-10th-oct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">benchlife</a>, the new line of Intel Core Ultra 200 CPUs will launch October 10 and feature 14 SKUs at the start.</p>



<p>The new Arrow Lake-S processors are the first to use the new Intel Core Ultra naming convention. Prior to the new chips, Intel had used the “Core i” scheme.</p>







<p>The highest-level CPU, the Ultra 9, will have three SKUs for consumers. The Ultra 7 will have five SKUs while the Ultra 5 will launch with six options.</p>



<p>You can check out the current specs for the known new Intel processors below via benchlife. No information on pricing is currently known.</p>

<p>When <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> came out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review-lets-spend-some-time-together/">nearly 10 years ago</a>, PC players could have invested $329 (~$435 in today's dollars) in a brand-new GTX 970 graphics card to make the game look as good as possible on their high-end gaming rig. Surprisingly enough, that very same 2014 graphics card will still be able to run follow-up <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/bioware-reveals-dreadwolf-as-the-next-dragon-age-title/">previously known as <em>Dreadwolf</em></a>) when it launches on October 31. If you're using AMD cards, an even older Radeon R9 that you purchased back in 2013 will be able to run the game.
</p><p><em>Veilguard</em>'s minimum specs are just the latest to show the workmanlike endurance of the humble GTX 970, which is currently available used on Newegg for <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100007709%20600536049&amp;Order=1">as low as $140</a>. Relatively recent big-budget PC releases like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-early-impressions-youll-spend-whole-weeks-in-here-and-love-it/"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>&nbsp;and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> both use the old card (or the less powerful follow-up variant, the GTX 960) as their "minimum requirement" benchmark.</p>
<p>Not every big-budget PC game these days is so forgiving with its minimum specs, though. When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/a-week-spent-in-cyberpunk-2077s-beautiful-messy-urban-future/"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/"><em>Doom: Eternal</em></a> launched in 2020, they both asked players to be sporting at least a GTX 1060, which had come out around four years prior.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8DkDQhPx2A?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure>
<p>For a bit of context, the GTX 970 was used as the "recommended" baseline spec for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/oculus-reveals-first-oculus-ready-pcs-bundled-starting-at-1499/">the mid-range "Oculus Ready" PCs</a> needed to power the then-new Rift VR headset when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/the-ars-review-oculus-rift-expands-pc-gaming-past-the-monitors-edge/">launched in 2016</a>. Today, a $500 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">Meta Quest 3 headset</a> gives you much better graphical performance in a self-contained portable package, no gaming PC required.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p><em>Veilguard</em> players sticking with a GTX 970 shouldn't expect to get the best graphical experience, of course. EA suggests an RTX 2070 (circa 2018) or a Radeon RX 5700Xt (circa 2019) to run the game at "recommended" specs. And you'll need at least 16 GB of RAM and 100 GB of storage space.</p>
<p>Since work on <em>Veilguard</em> began in earnest in 2015, the game has suffered a string of high-profile staff departures: Creative Director Mike Laidlaw <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/02/23/dragon-ages-mike-laidlaw-opens-up-on-why-he-left-bioware.aspx">left in 2017</a>; Executive Producer Mark Darrah and BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/bioware-studio-gm-and-dragon-age-lead-are-both-leaving-company/">left in late 2020</a>; Senior Creative Director Matt Goldman <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ages-senior-creative-director-has-left-bioware-1848114644">left in late 2021</a>; replacement Executive Producer Christian Daley <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/dragon-age-4-executive-producer-has-left-bioware/">left in early 2022</a>; and producer Mac Walters <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/dragon-age-dreadwolf-loses-another-veteran-bioware-producer/">left in early 2023</a>.
</p><p>The full requirements for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong><br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/almost-90-of-developers-surveyed-says-premium-games-dont-need-microtransactions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microtransactions are a hot topic in the gaming industry, especially as they become increasingly frequent. Even in " completed games," microtransactions are finding a way to worm themselves into the game. For example, look at Star Wars Outlaws, an upcoming game made by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft. The game isn't even out yet, and they already <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/">have a roadmap for microtransactions</a> planned.</p>
<p>However, 90% of developers who participated in a survey at <a href="https://www.devcom.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devcom 2024</a> said that premium games don't need microtransactions. While the general audience already knows this, game companies still incorporate them into premium games.</p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/devcom-opens-with-indie-game-awards-and-survey-results-from-300-speakers/#:~:text=Devcom%20speaker%20survey%3A%20Key%20insights&amp;text=Best%20Use%20Cases%20for%20AI,marketing%20and%20communication%20(18%25)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">89% of developers surveyed</a> at Devcom 2024 said they believe premium games can be "financially successful just by being Buy-to-Play." It seems that premium games released without microtransactions are becoming rarer each day.</p>
<p>Regarding business models, 65% of people believe in a premium game's business model for physical and digital edition games. Additionally, 81% of survey participants believe that cross-platform play is essential for a premium game to be successful. Surprisingly, one person believed that free-to-play with ads was the best business model in gaming. While this may be true for mobile gaming, it'd be hard to imagine games like Elden Ring or Call of Duty being free-to-play with ads. Even in mobile gaming, plenty of people refuse to play games if there are ads or will spend a small amount of money to eliminate ads.</p>
<p>Looking at other insights from the Devcom survey, 31% prefer minimal AI usage in their work, with 21% wanting to leverage AI for code and production to make the development job simpler. 18% would like to use AI for marketing and communication. Considering how rapidly AI is expanding and evolving, it'll be interesting to see the results of next year's AI usage.</p>
<p>Regarding challenges that the games industry faces, 55% believe that the biggest issue is market saturation, with 46% saying the biggest issue is development costs. Both are significant issues in the games industry, with genres becoming more saturated with each new game. For example, the Soulslike genre exploded, and there are more games than ever to choose from in that genre compared to last year.</p>
<p>Finally, when asked about layoffs within the games industry, 57% of speakers anticipated that layoffs would continue at the same pace or faster over the next 12 months, with 43% believing that the layoffs would decrease and more jobs would open up in the industry for people.</p>
<p>The games industry is rapidly changing and evolving—not necessarily for good, either. However, it'll be interesting to compare the results of this Devcom 2024 survey to next year's.</p>

The idea behind them is that you select the type of Roulette you wish to join based on the rewards you want, and the game will put you in a randomized Duty, which are <em>FFXIV</em>’s version of missions. Most Roulettes also specify which type of content you will encounter, so it can also be used if you are in the mood for say a boss battle, but not sure which one to do.<br></p><p>Roulettes are a great way to complete whatever goal you are currently working for in <em>FFXIV</em>. You will receive bonuses for finishing multiple categories of Roulettes a day, but only if it was the first time that type was completed in that period. For example, if you run through the “Leveling” and “Main Scenario” Roulettes on the same day, you would get an EXP and Gil bonus for both of them, as well as Seals for “Leveling” and Tomestones of Poetics for “Main Scenario,” but if you ran “Leveling” twice in the same period, you would only receive the bonuses for your first completion until they reset. In order to maximize your time, you should be completing different Roulettes to capitalize on all the rewards instead of just playing through the same one.</p><p>Your Daily Roulettes can be found by navigating to the “Duty” Option of the Main Menu and then selecting the “Duty Finder” Option. From there, it will be the leftmost option, signified by the question mark icon.</p><figure id="" data-id="bd8eea493c37d64b0f39726be6d6d1bf" data-recommend-id="image://bd8eea493c37d64b0f39726be6d6d1bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Duty Menu screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Duty Menu screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bd8eea493c37d64b0f39726be6d6d1bf" data-recommend-id="image://bd8eea493c37d64b0f39726be6d6d1bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Duty Menu screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h10968"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Unlock Daily Roulettes</strong></h2><p>Since there are many different types of Roulettes, they are unlocked in many different ways. Generally, you will unlock them as you play through the Main Storyline or reach certain milestones. One of the first Roulettes you will unlock is the “Leveling” option as all you have to do is complete the second and third dungeons. However, others like the “Expert” Roulette require you to reach level 90. The best advice is to just keep working through the main story and complete any optional dungeons you come across, as this will provide access to a bulk of the Roulette options.</p><h2 id="h10969"><a id=""></a><strong>Types of Roulettes</strong></h2><p>Given the large number of options in the Roulette Menu, it can be a little overwhelming, here are all the different types as well as the bonuses they give:</p><h3 id="h10970"><a id=""></a><strong>Expert</strong></h3><p>This option will put you in the newest dungeons <em>FFXIV </em>has to offer so it is updated alongside the game. Currently, it contains Duties from the newest expansion <em>Dawntrail</em>, and provides Tomestones of Aethestics and Heliometry, two of the newest currencies in the game which can be used to buy Neo Kingdom and Quetzalli Gear. It also rewards you with Gil and EXP. Note that you can only receive the two types of Tomestones once you reach level 100.</p><figure id="" data-id="b6abeef89b6a549d74baf12a27695c4d" data-recommend-id="image://b6abeef89b6a549d74baf12a27695c4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sparkly battle in one of the game's dungeons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sparkly battle in one of the game's dungeons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b6abeef89b6a549d74baf12a27695c4d" data-recommend-id="image://b6abeef89b6a549d74baf12a27695c4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sparkly battle in one of the game's dungeons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h10971"><a id=""></a><strong>High Level Dungeons</strong></h3><p>You’ll unlock this category at level 50. This allows you to enter any level 50 dungeon you have access to. This category will also add new tiers for every ten levels you gain until you reach level 90. Rewards for these roulettes include Tomestones of Poetics, and Aesthetics as well as Gil and EXP. Note that unlike Aesthetics and Heliometry, Tomestones of Poetics can be received once you reach level 50.<br></p><h3 id="h10972"><a id=""></a><strong>Leveling</strong></h3><p>The Leveling Roulette will have you play through a random dungeon or trial (i.e. boss battle), however it will only be one that you have previously unlocked. The great thing about this roulette is that even though you will most likely be synced to a lower level to complete the duty, you will receive bonuses based on the difference between your synced level and actual level. For example, if you are Level 90 and doing a level 50 dungeon, you will receive better rewards than someone who is Level 60 running the same instance, which encourages a playthrough no matter your level. Leveling Roulettes provide EXP, Gil and Grand Company Seals upon completion so it is a great option to level up a secondary Job or your GC rank.</p><figure id="" data-id="bdad5a8b9e718d38128085f7bd37b541" data-recommend-id="image://bdad5a8b9e718d38128085f7bd37b541" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1194" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man and his pet in front of a boring wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man and his pet in front of a boring wall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bdad5a8b9e718d38128085f7bd37b541" data-recommend-id="image://bdad5a8b9e718d38128085f7bd37b541" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1194" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man and his pet in front of a boring wall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h10973"><a id=""></a><strong>Trials</strong></h3><p>These Roulettes will place you in <em>FFXIV’s </em>version of Boss Battles. As you progress through the game and conquer these fights, they will be added to the Duty Roulette. Rewards include Aesthetics, Heliometries, EXP and some of the largest quantities of Gil the Roulettes offer.</p><h3 id="h10974"><a id=""></a><strong>Main Scenario</strong></h3><p>Currently, the Main Scenario Roulette has you play through one of three Duties which are the final Main Scenario Quests from the launch version of the base game, <em>A Realm Reborn. </em>As such, it will either be one of the two dungeons or a boss battle. These are a little longer missions, so they are not the most efficient method of grinding out EXP or Gil, but they also provide a healthy amount of Poetics which can be used to buy the Ironworks Armor—one of the best armors for you if your character is between Level 50 and 60.</p><figure id="" data-id="00760dee0bbb484c6b9542c965fab9b4" data-recommend-id="image://00760dee0bbb484c6b9542c965fab9b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Oh goodness, this chap doesn't look very nice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Oh goodness, this chap doesn't look very nice." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00760dee0bbb484c6b9542c965fab9b4" data-recommend-id="image://00760dee0bbb484c6b9542c965fab9b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Oh goodness, this chap doesn't look very nice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h10975"><a id=""></a><strong>Guildhests</strong></h3><p>This Roulette will place you in a random Guildhest and is unlocked once you have completed two different instances of this content type. Guildhests are some of the first content you will unlock in <em>FFXIV, </em>so they don’t provide bonuses as large as some of the other Roulette options, but they are good for new players learning how their class works in the confines of a party. Guildhest Roulettes provide EXP, Gil and Grand Company Seals upon completion.</p><h3 id="h10976"><a id=""></a><strong>Alliance Raids</strong></h3><p>These are the big ones. Alliance Raids are some of the most intense content in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and will place you in a 24-person raid. This Roulette option is available after you unlock two of these Raids. Depending on your level, rewards include any of the types of Tomestones (Poetics, Aesthetics and Heliometry) as well as EXP and Gil.</p><h3 id="h10977"><a id=""></a><strong>Normal Raids</strong></h3><p>These are the small ones. Normal Raids are like Alliance raids only one-third the size (that means eight players). Rewards are the same as their larger brethren, though the quantity of Tomestones received is slightly smaller given the less strenuous nature.</p><figure id="" data-id="bfdef58499f7038993f975c75ee19f8d" data-recommend-id="image://bfdef58499f7038993f975c75ee19f8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1170" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man doing a mentor by some rocks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man doing a mentor by some rocks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bfdef58499f7038993f975c75ee19f8d" data-recommend-id="image://bfdef58499f7038993f975c75ee19f8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1170" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man doing a mentor by some rocks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h10978"><a id=""></a><strong>Mentor</strong></h3><p>Mentor Roulettes should not be confused with <em>Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> mentor system, which encourages longtime players to help out newer ones. The Roulette will place you in an instance that has been waiting the longest, usually some of the more unpopular content. However, to be eligible you need to be experienced with the game, as it requires you to be level 100 and have an armor level of 685. On completion, Mentor Roulettes reward you with Aesthetics, Heliometries EXP and Gil.</p><h3 id="h10979"><a id=""></a><strong>Frontline</strong></h3><p>Frontline is <em>FFXVI’s </em>PvP mode, so this option is basically just a bonus for completing a round every day. To make it even simpler, there is only one Frontline map per day, so this Roulette is really just to get full queues for those interested in going head to head with other players. After you complete a Frontline match, you will be rewarded with Aesthetics and Heliometries.</p><hr><p>Daily Roulettes are a great way to take some of the grind out of <em>Final Fantasy XIV.</em> Given the numerous options available, you’re sure to find the perfect roulette to help you reach your current goals, whether that is getting a fantastic piece of end-game armor, or leveling up your secondary job. They can be a little intimidating, but just look at the list of rewards each one provides and pick the option that sounds the most enticing, then see what <em>FFXIV </em>is going to throw at you today!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"That was all the information we'd get."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jeffries explained she was once asked to act out a "graphic rape scene" with no prior warning. "This act could be watched for as long or as little time as the player wanted through a window, and then a player would be able to shoot this character in the head," she added. "It was just purely gratuitous in my opinion."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She refused to participate and eventually convinced the studio involved to ditch the "disgusting" moment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's no nudity involved, but it's still an act and there's an intimacy in that act and also a violence in this situation," she continued. "So yes there may be a layer of Lycra between us, but you are still there and still having to truly immerse yourself in this scene."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lax practices can turn working on explicit scenes into an 'excruciating' experience">Lax practices can turn working on explicit scenes into an 'excruciating' experience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another actor who spoke out anonymously explained those working in games are "told almost nothing" when signing on to projects and must accept non-disclosure agreements to secure work. It's an approach that resulted in them having to record a "full-on sex scene" without any prior warning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I had to [vocally] match the scene and through the glass in the booth was the entire team, all male, watching me," they recalled. "It was excruciating. At that stage I had been in the games industry a while, and I had never felt so shaken."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They felt "upset" at being put on the spot and explained "nobody thought to ask me if I was okay with it, and nobody checked to see if I was okay afterwards."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/c-smash-vrs-new-dimension-preview-no-vr-no-problem/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/14/c-smash-vrs-review/">C-Smash VRS</a> was easily one of the best games from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2’s</a> launch window. Taking the cult classic arcade and Dreamcast game Cosmic Smash, it shifted the perspective, giving us a minimalist blend of Breakout and real-life Squash for a compelling VR sports game.</p>
<p>But shouldn’t everyone be allowed to smash cosmically? Not just the relative few with fancy hats? Enter C-Smash VRS: New Dimension, a fresh launch and free update coming at the end of September that will bring back flat-screen play and arcade delights alongside all the VR goodness of before.</p>
<p><iframe title="C-Smash VRS New Dimension - Date Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMxDfVt-dG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>New Dimension feeds a lot more of the original Cosmic Smash back into C-Smash VRS, specifically with the shift back to a third-person camera – there’s both a dynamic tracking cam and a pulled-back fixed camera – and seeing your avatar race back and forth as you position yourself to slap the ball back down the arena.</p>

<p>Going hands-on back-to-back with a classic arcade cabinet, there’s a very familiar feel between them, with the way that your avatar is animated in running, jumping and hitting, the ease and accessibility of timing shots, and more. However, New Dimension has added a few extra flourishes and moves on top of that. Whether they’re new moves or old, it’s pretty cool to see your character pulling off wall jumps, seeing the spinning flourish of a power shot, or a last ditch dive to reach a ball that’s heading outside of your hitting sweet spot.</p>

<p>Every mode from C-Smash VRS is available to play in New Dimension, whether it’s the Journey mode through strings of action puzzle stages, the endless Infinity mode, co-op or head-to-head multiplayer. Through all of the multiplayer modes, one of the key factors to New Dimension is that this bridges the divide between VR and flat-screen play.</p>
<p>This isn’t quite the first time that this has been done in VR gaming, since we have cross-play in digital board games like Demeo, or more significantly with racing games like Gran Turismo 7 and flight games. However, C-Smash VRS: New Dimension is possibly the first time that we’re dealing with two completely different styles of motion and control.</p>
<p>GT7 or Star Wars Squadrons might give VR players a greater awareness of their surroundings, but you’re still fundamentally fixed in the cockpit and have the limits of your vehicle. New Dimension has VR players with a first-person view and full motion tracking of your arms going up against the abstracted arcade action of the flat-screen game.</p>

<p>It’s a really fascinating problem, but one that RapidEyeMovers and Wolf &amp; Wood are very close to getting just right. We went through the gamut of head-to-head multiplayer options, myself playing on TV in London against Wolf &amp; Wood’s Ryan Bousfield up in Newcastle, and had some good fun and close matches, despite the completely different controls.</p>
<p>A few things stood out the more that I played, though. Depending on your preferences, C-Smash VRS is perhaps a bit too lenient with allowing you to press the hit button well before the ball gets back to you. You do want to try to position yourself and time the button press to get the best power and control, but there’s a lot of give here and your avatar can almost always make that diving hit to dribble the ball back down the court.</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s more advanced moves that have much, much less margin for error. A jump shot is very easy to end up with whiffing at clean air, and cool as it looks, so can a wall jump shot. When playing against another person who’s actively aiming for the edges of your reach, these are pretty important to master, and hopefully the final product can bring these two extremes a bit closer together.</p>

<p>VR versus TV play works wonderfully well and feels like it should be well balanced. A VR player will need to have better natural hand-eye coordination than a TV player, especially when trying to pinpoint a shot at a small target, but that physical control gives a higher ceiling for play.</p>
<p>Coming out on 26th September, C-Smash VRS: New Dimension is set to be all things to fans of hitting balls with rackets. This is probably the game that fans of the original would have hoped for, a modern successor with a bunch more modes, block types and power ups, but with familiar gameplay and feel. And you can always still pop a VR headset on as well, now hopefully with more people to play with online.</p>

The event was held in Hawaii this year, so its closing ceremony took place late at night for many people around the globe. . The Pokémon Company made a few lowkey announcements at the end of the tournament, and spoilers: there was no news on the upcoming RPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span>. But if you like the card game, the MOBA, or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-fest-2024-niantic-necrozma-1851592588&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-fest-2024-niantic-necrozma-1851592588"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a></span>, there were a few exciting announcements.<br></p></div><div><p>The mobile capture and collection game <em>Pokémon Go </em>got two announcements during the closing ceremony, but one was easily the bigger deal. Developer Niantic teased that Dynamaxing, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746">battle gimmick</a></span> from <em>Pokémon Sworld </em>and <em>Shield</em>, is finally coming to <em>Pokémon Go</em>. These temporary transformations allow Pokémon to grow in size like a Kaiju, with some getting original forms called Gigantamax that are distinct from a typical Dynamax form. The feature was teased with a live-action trailer showing what appears to be a Dynamax Pokémon descending upon a beach.<br></p></div><div><p>Also during the <em>Pokémon Go </em>segment, Niantic revealed Morpeko, the Galar region’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-raichu-pichu-clones-mimikyu-pachirisu-1850622444&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-raichu-pichu-clones-mimikyu-pachirisu-1850622444">Pikachu clone</a></span>, is coming to the app “soon.” <em>Pokémon Go </em>still hasn’t fully rolled out Generation VIII’s Pokédex, though it has sporadically released critters from the <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em> games over the years. Hopefully Dynamax and Morpeko are signs that more are on the way.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mobile-android-ios-1851289803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mobile-android-ios-1851289803">revealed earlier this year</a></span> as a new way to play the <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game </em>on your phone. Now, the app has a release date. The Pokémon Company confirmed <em>TCG Pocket </em>will launch on the Google Play Store and App Store on October 30. You can preregister on either storefront from your phone or tablet.<br></p></div><div><p>One of the highlights of the showcase was the reveal that Owner’s Pokémon cards, which include Pokémon that are trained by a specific trainer from the games or anime, are about to make a proper return. They’ll be officially known as Trainer’s Pokémon cards, include art of their respective trainer, and can only be evolved into an evolutionary card from that line. For example, the Lt. Surge’s Pikachu card can only evolve into Lt. Surge’s Raichu. The first wave of these cards was teased with an animated trailer featuring cards like Lillie’s Clefairy, Marnie’s Grimmsnarl, and a gorgeous full art of N’s Reshiram.<br></p></div><div><p>The Pokémon Company revealed the next three Pokémon set to join the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-unite-is-as-simple-and-approachable-as-a-moba-g-1847185517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-unite-is-as-simple-and-approachable-as-a-moba-g-1847185517"><em>Unite</em></a></span> roster. First up will be Armarouge, who will join the MOBA’s roster as an Attacker on September 12. The fire/psychic-type seems to specialize in area-of-effect attacks. Next up in October will be the mythical Pokémon Darkrai, which has the power to put enemies to sleep and strike them down while they’re incapacitated. Finally, Psyduck will join in November, acting as a support character. It looks like this will be a Pikachu situation, in which Psyduck doesn’t evolve throughout a match like other characters. So if you were hoping to play as its evolved form Golduck, that doesn’t look like it’s in the cards.<br></p></div><div><p>The final announcement rounding out the closing ceremony was the reveal of the location for the next two Pokémon World Championships. The tournament will be held in Anaheim, California in 2025, and will stay in California in 2026 and head to San Francisco. The Pokémon Company has held the event annually since 2004 (with the exception of 2020 and 2021, which were canceled due to the covid-19 pandemic), and it has been almost exclusively held within the United States. Worlds 2013 was held in Vancouver, London hosted the 2022 show, and, surprisingly, 2023 was the only year the event was held in The Pokémon Company’s home country of Japan. I’m glad to see it return to the continental US, at least. Now I may actually get to make the trip.<br></p><hr><p>Ultimately, it was a light series of announcements this year, as I know a lot of folks were hoping to hear more about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span>. The Kalos-based RPG was announced at the Pokémon Day Presents in February, but was only teased with a concept trailer. So we still don’t know a lot about the game beyond that it will take place entirely in the metropolis of Lumiose City.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-impressions-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/im-so-tired-total-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One of the first blogs I ever wrote for this website was about <em>Total War: Pharaoh</em></a>, and how the underbaked and hugely disappointing release had pushed me to the very brink when it came to one of my favourite franchises. Nine months later, I have some good news: I am here to eat some shit.</p><p>My criticisms of <em>Pharaoh </em>at launch were not isolated, nor were they made in a vacuum; while Creative Assembly enjoyed some recent well-deserved success with the main <em>Warhammer </em>games, and the mega campaign made available as a result, fans had still been simmering away for a while, upset at everything from<a href="https://thesouthernnerd.com/2021/05/30/fans-incensed-when-ca-announces-end-to-three-kingdoms-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the supposed abandonment of <em>Three Kingdoms</em></a> to<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwarhammer/comments/15torey/official_blog_post_from_ca_regarding_the_shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> deeply unpopular <em>Warhammer </em>DLC pricing and plans</a>.</p><p>To then release <em>Pharaoh</em>, a game so underwhelming I called it <em>Total War: Going Through The Motions</em>, was for many a final straw.<a href="https://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?818995-An-Open-Letter-to-CA-on-the-State-of-Total-War-(Oct-2023)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Some folks were mad</a>! And more importantly, I guess, more folks simply didn't care, with <em>Pharaoh </em>enjoying nowhere near the critical success <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-issues-financial-warning-after-sluggish-sales-of-sonic-superstars-endless-dungeon-and-total-war-pharaoh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or sales performance</a> that previous historical <em>Total Wars</em> had enjoyed.</p><p>While Creative Assembly could have just ridden this out--keep milking <em>Warhammer </em>for DLC and slowly release <em>Pharaoh </em>DLC in the hopes <em>someone </em>would like it--what they've actually done in response is remarkable. Because what they've done is tear up what looks like a years-long release schedule of expansions and downloadable content and just...dumped it all on players in one big package.</p><p>For free.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Total War: PHARAOH - Dynasties Overview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6erHiCuh1tQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Called <em>Total War: Pharaoh Dynasties</em>, this update was released late last month. It adds two whole new regions to the map (it shipped with just one), doubling the total size of the game. It doubles the number of unique factions available to play as, adds a dynastic system (your leaders can now die and have their children inherit) and a ton of new units. Every single thing I just mentioned could have been at least paid DLC, if not a dedicated expansion, but it's all been rolled up and dropped in everyone's lap in one big download, and it hasn't cost anyone a cent.</p><p>Game director Todor Nikolov says of <em>Dynasties</em>:</p><blockquote><p><em>From the outset of our design journey on Total War: PHARAOH, our vision has always been to deliver a grand-scale recreation of the turbulent Bronze Age Collapse; one brimming with historical intrigue, authentic representations of iconic civilisation, and a sandbox theatre that allows you to rewrite the course of human history</em>. <em>We’re very proud of what we’ve achieved and whilst this will be our final content addition, we hope it serves as a love letter that encapsulates our continued passion for this wonderful age. Thanks for your support.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>By "thanks for your support" I think he means "we're sorry", and when he says it'll be the final content addition, it sure sounds like this was years worth of releases all dropped at once.</p><p>On the one hand, this highlights the very worst of modern, big-budget video games. If the plan really was to release such a limited game in 2023 and then drip-feed so much of everything else to players over the next year or two, then that plan can fuck right off. It's bad enough when Paradox do it, but I think most people's criticism of that approach is slightly unfair, since Paradox's base games often ship in a pretty complete state already. <em>Pharaoh</em>, as so many said at the time, felt like half a <em>Total War</em> game. Because, turns out, it was!</p><p>On the other hand, though, that's a strategic decision made above most people at Creative Assembly's heads. Those responsible for making <em>the game itself</em> can now have their work surveyed in full, and in a remarkable turnaround from November 2023, I think that work is <em>fantastic</em>.</p><p>While I still have reservations about the time period--"Bronze Age collapse" sounds cool but the primitive units available to the player kinda limit the tactics you can employ as a result--<em>Pharaoh</em> now boasts easily the series most accomplished strategic section, with a ton of cool features like outposts (which can be customised to add benefits to your region and slow down defenders) and a court + religion overlay that really helps each corner of the map feel like a distinct ethnic region.</p><p>And the bigger maps, extra cultures and fog-of-war frontiers help make the game feel <em>vast</em>, and not in the bland, tedious way that <em>Rome 2</em> or <em>Three Kingdoms</em> were, but more like <em>Empire</em> or <em>Warhammer</em>. <em>Dynasties'</em> world is one to be explored and adventured in, starting small in your own region with your own familiar people before venturing out into the wider, wilder world.</p><p>Basically, in the space of one update this has gone from being one of the worst<em> Total Wars</em> of all time to one of the best, all because we got to see the full game as it was intended to be seen, not held back and drip-fed over months and years. Does it make up for the years of frustration and disappointment fans have been dealing with across the entire <em>Total War</em> series? Probably not! But does it make up for months of frustration and disappointment surrounding <em>this</em> game? You bet.</p><p>I have no idea if this is indicative of Creative Assembly's release strategy going forwards, or if it's just an emergency, one-off decision made in response to <em>Pharaoh </em>bombing last November. I fear it's the latter, but man, wouldn't it be great if the company<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1edi3bo/tw_pharaoh_dynasties_sits_at_a_92_user/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> could look at the unprecedented turnaround <em>Pharaoh</em> has enjoyed here</a>, and the resulting swing in people's appreciation of the game and the studio, and realise that we <em>can </em>go back. That even in 2024 and beyond,<a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when it feels like every other game on the planet is feeling the pressure to keep releasing content forever</a>, it's possible to do the most old-fashioned thing imaginable: just release the whole game at once and make people happy.&nbsp;</p><p>(<strong>Bonus note</strong>: if you're into <em>Total War </em>and want to hear me and some people much smarter than me talk about it, I was on last week's episode of 3MA specifically to chat about <em>Dynasties</em>, <a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/forums/topic/15748-three-moves-ahead-619-total-war-pharaoh-dynasties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and you can check it out here</a>).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the <a title="Series > Fate [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>stones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.</p><p>Now 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,671 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>rs weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!</p><p>The original <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song</em> included many of the <em>SaGa</em> series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded high-definition graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. This makes it highly recommended for both fans of the original and newcomers to the <em>SaGa</em> series.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Brand new localization in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. (English also included.)</li><li>Full high-definition graphical update.</li><li>Schiele, Marina, Monica, and Flammar can now be recruited.</li><li><a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d and more difficult bosses.</li><li>High speed mode.</li><li>Mini Maps.</li><li>New Game+ mode.</li></ul><p><strong>■ Staff Comments</strong></p><p><strong>Akitoshi Kawazu, <em>SaGa</em> Series General Director</strong></p><p>“With the support of Red Art Games, we’re now able to release a new version of <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered</em> that includes localization into French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages. We are finally able to grant this desire of our loyal fans! We know there’s a big <em>SaGa</em> fanbase and community in the west, so releasing a new localized edition of the game to more of our fans has long been a dream of mine. I hope to continue to fulfill the wishes of our fans, as well as creating opportunities for even more people to play the game.”</p><p><strong>Masanori Ichikawa, <em>SaGa</em> Series Producer</strong></p><p>“The opportunity for this release all began when Michael Binkowski (CEO, Red Art Games) and Romain Mahut (business development and communications manager, Red Art Games) contacted me directly. Thanks to them, a long-time dream of ours is coming true and I’m so grateful. From visiting the Red Art Games office in France to all the discussions we’ve had on this project, it’s been an amazing experience from start to finish, and I can’t wait for <em>SaGa</em> fans to get their hands on this beautiful game.”</p><p><strong>Hiroyuki Miura, <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered</em> Producer</strong></p><p>“<em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered International</em> is a title that allows players to enjoy a great many of the characteristic mechanics of the <em>SaGa</em> series, including the Freeform Scenario system, Glimmer, and Combos. The addition of new localization into French, German, Italian, and Spanish is particularly impactful for the freeform scenario. Now, players globally will be able to experience the story on an even deeper level, in their native language. I’m excited for more people to discover the <em>SaGa</em> series thanks to the additional language support and the physical release of the game. I’m delighted to be partnering with Red Art Games on this collaboration.”</p></blockquote><p>View a new set of screenshots and box arts <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/romancing-saga-minstrel-song-remastered-international/august-19-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_906827"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Lego retired the Super Mario 64 Question Block set at the end of July. The writing was on the wall before then, as the set has frequently been out of stock at major retailers, including Amazon, for months. But strangely enough, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has replenished its stock</a>--probably for the last time. If Lego-scalping history is any indication, buying the Mario 64 Lego set for $200 might sound like a deal before long.</p><h2>Lego Super Mario 64 Question Block Set</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615"></a><figcaption>Lego Super Mario 64 Question Block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg"></figure><p>The 2,064-piece Lego set is shaped just like the iconic Question Mark blocks from the Super Mario series, and inside of it are several small dioramas of landscapes from Super Mario 64. You can construct the game's hub world, Peach's Castle, and a trio of levels: Bob-omb Battlefield, Cool Mountain, and Lethal Lava Trouble with this kit, and as you'd expect, the building process is a treat.</p><p>Additionally, this comes with Lego Super Mario 64 microfigures of Mario, Yoshi, Princess Peach, King Bob-omb, and Chain Chomp, and as an added touch, the entire set is compatible with the interactive Lego Mario/Luigi/Peach figures that come with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Playset-Nintendo/dp/B0CV2G23D8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Mario starter courses</a>, which received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-starter-sets-cost-less-and-come-with-better-figures/1100-6525381/" data-ref-id="1100-6525381">cool new editions earlier this month</a>.</p><p>As mentioned above, this Lego set is one of the rare display-grade Nintendo pieces released over the last couple of years. Sure, there are plenty of Mario playsets available, but the diorama kits are certainly more appealing for those who love the Lego building process. Plus, the display sets appeal to the nostalgia of older fans who grew up playing retro Super Mario games. The Question Block would make for a great gift for someone who adores the series.</p><hr><h2>Lego Mario Display Sets</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 64 Question Block at Amazon</a> (2,064 pieces) -- $200</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego NES at Amazon (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $262 (<del>$270</del>) | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flast-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good%2F1100-6525901%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Target</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flast-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good%2F1100-6525901%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi at Target</a> (1,215 pieces) -- $130</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Mighty-Bowser-Building-Collectible/dp/B0B3BZZWSL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mighty Bowser at Amazon (2,807 pieces)</a> -- $270 | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-6379558-Super-Mario-The-Mighty-Bowser-71411-Building-Toy-Set%2F321283899%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flast-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good%2F1100-6525901%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-TBD-Super-Mario-71426/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piranaha Plant at Amazon (540 pieces)</a> -- $60 price</li></ul><p>The Question Block is one of only five non-playset Lego Super Mario kits.

The Lego NES is a great build for two people to construct together, as it comes with separate instruction booklets for the CRT TV and console.</p><p>One of those five sets has yet to be released. <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flast-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good%2F1100-6525901%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi launches October 1 and is available to preorder now at Target</a></strong> for $130.

        <p>The livestream will, however, offer a 10-minute tour of its new Kyoto museum.</p>

            <p>Yes, Nintendo is opening up its Japanese Nintendo Museum for a tour later today. No, it will not be taking questions about anything else at this time.</p>
<p>That's the official line from Nintendo, which announced on its official American X/Twitter account over the weekend that whilst it's happy to share a quick 10-minute tour of its Kyoto museum, "there will be no game announcements or mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation".</p>

<p>"Join us [later today], August 19 at 3pm PT, for a tour of the Nintendo Museum that’s scheduled to open during the fall of 2024 in Kyoto, Japan!" the account announced. "The Nintendo Museum Direct livestream will last roughly 10 minutes.</p>
<p>"Please note that there will be no game announcements or mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation," a subsequent tweet confirmed.</p>

<p>Nintendo Museum was announced at a Nintendo Direct almost a year ago now. It's now set to open fall/autumn 2024, having slipped a little from its initial March 2024 opening date.</p>
<p>While Nintendo's statement is a firm indication that we won't get any news about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> just yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">Eurogamer sources previously confirmed that Switch 2 will launch in 2025</a>. Our understanding is that Switch 2 was previously due to arrive later in 2024.</p>
<p>Nintendo has opted for a 2025 launch instead to ensure the console arrives with a more robust software line-up, Eurogamer understands. Here's hoping this extra time also allows for any new Joy-Con hiccups to be ironed out, and we avoid a repeat of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-in-five-switch-joy-cons-affected-by-drift-says-uk-consumer-watchdog-report">Joy-Con drift drama</a> that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-pledges-to-repair-switch-joy-con-free-in-uk-until-further-notice">plagued the current Switch</a> through its lifespan.</p>
<p>While we're on the topic of museums… did you see that a Two Point Museum was on the way?</p>
<p>As Ed said in his wonderful preview earlier this month, just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-campus-review-university-was-never-this-fun">Two Point Campus</a> iterated on Two Point Hospital, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-turns-a-fresh-slice-of-mundane-life-into-a-wacky-british-adventure">Two Point Museum looks to be doing the same</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-not-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As many fans were hoping and praying, Geoff Keighley himself has officially confirmed that Hollow Knight Silksong will not be at Gamescom Opening Night Live. In <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1824923122929119364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1824923122929119364%7Ctwgr%5E6c037ce01b6b1f449db9cec0e0dd69ac61322759%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live%2F1100-6525900%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on X</a>, he made the statement so that people could lower their expectations for Hollow Knight Silksong being at Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>
<p>In the post, he says, "Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL. Team Cherry is still cooking." Fans have been patiently waiting for any news on Silksong since 2019 when it was first announced on Valentine's Day in 2019, alongside a developer diary video. Since then, updates have been very few and far between, with minimal information given to those waiting for the sequel. In 2019, fans saw the most updates for Hollow Knight Silksong, with the most recent update being in 2022, when fans saw a brand-new trailer for the game.</p>
<p>Past that point, they did express that there were delays in the development, with Team Cherry initially planning to release Hollow Knight Silksong in 2023. However, 2023 quickly came and went, and there was, unfortunately, still no sign of it. The latest glimpse of progress is the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESRB rating for Hollow Knight Silksong,</a> which went live on the Xbox Store Page about four months ago.</p>
<p>As far as people know, Hollow Knight Silksong is still very much in development, with no news of it being canceled or further delayed. Unfortunately, no one knows how much progress Team Cherry has made during this time.</p>
<p>Over the years, Gamescom Opening Night Live has seen some huge announcements. While people have expressed their disappointment in the lack of Hollow Knight Silksong, they are now (jokingly) holding out hope for Bloodborne or Bloodborne 2.</p>
<p>So far, it has been confirmed that people can expect to see content from Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Indiana Jones, and The Great Circle, as well as a brand-new game made by Tarsier Studios, the developers behind award-winning Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>In addition to those titles, viewers will also get glimpses into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, MARVEL Rivals, Black Myth: Wukong, and Dune Awakening, to name a few. There is something for everyone to look into for Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will be airing on August 20 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM BST and 8 PM CEST.</p>
<p>Gamescom has a jam-packed schedule this year, so keep your eyes and ears out for any upcoming announcements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that Level-5's upcoming life-sim-come-RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has been delayed beyond its original release date, and no new release date has been revealed either.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1825535030866628851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message</a> on the official European Nintendo X (formerly Twitter) account, the company reveals that <i>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</i>has been delayed and that "more information about the new release date will be announced in the future".</p>
<p>The game was originally slated to launch on October 10th around the world for Nintendo Switch, but sadly, it seems it'll be quite some time until you can enjoy Level-5's latest cozy adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-napdragon.jpg?itok=PPx5bT22 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-napdragon.jpg?itok=K7IRRN1y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's now unclear when exactly&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>will arrive.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>was originally announced all the way back in February 2023 as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/february-2023-nintendo-direct-here-are-all-news-announcements">that month's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>.</p>
<p>A full-blown sequel to 2013's 3DS RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>, the game, which is being developed by&nbsp;<em>Professor Layton&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>creator Level-5, was originally due to launch sometime in 2023.</p>
<p>However, in November of that year, Level-5 announced that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed">would be pushed back to 2024</a>, citing a need to ensure that the game was "better quality for everyone" when it eventually launched.</p>
<p>That same month, Level-5 revealed a summer 2024 release window for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, eventually announcing a full release date of October 10th during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-january-2023-recap-find-all-news-and-announcements">this past February's Nintendo Direct</a> (although it may have been somewhat overshadowed by the Xbox-on-Switch reveals).</p>

<p>When the game does eventually arrive, it'll offer a similar blend of simple action-RPG combat and life-sim job dabbling as its predecessor did.</p>
<p>Taking place once again in the land of Reveria,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will task you with solving two core mysteries: one revolving around the titular "girl who steals time", and another concerning a dragon soaring through Reveria's skies.</p>
<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>isn't available for pre-order yet, but you can keep up with it <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the Nintendo eShop</a> if you want to. Level-5 <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/240819/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says it'll announce a new release date</a> during its "To the World's Children" event, although we're not sure when that will be just yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>
