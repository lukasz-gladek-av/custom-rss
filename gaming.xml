                <p>The world of Skyrim felt alive when players first ventured into it, and a mountain of discoverable texts helped add to its immersion.

            <p>
In case you hadn't noticed, what with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s launch and the annual Summer Geoffs causing all sorts of distractions, June is well and truly upon us. And Sony is marking the occasion - much as it does every month - with a fresh batch of additions to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogue, which this time include Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 17th June, bringing a total of eight new games for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, alongside one further addition exclusive to the latter tier. You'll find the full list of June's titles below:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>FBC: Firebreak (PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 2042 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wild (PS4)</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Endless Dungeon (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So there're some decent arrivals, then, with highlights including Alan Wake developer Remedy Entertainment's promising co-op Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, and the ever-delightful We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. RPG fans, meanwhile, might get a kick out of Suikoden spiritual successor Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, and Amplitude's tower defence roguelike Endless Dungeon is also a good old time.
</p>
<p>
As for those forking out for Sony's top-tier membership, June's retro addition comes in the form of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a>: The Conspiracy - the PlayStation 2 adaptation of developer Ion Storm's cyberpunk immersive sim classic Deux Ex, which first hit the console back in 2002.
</p>
<p>
And that's your lot! All the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June, meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-ps-plus-catalogue-additions-for-may">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention is yanked elsewhere.

<figure><a title="Age of Calamity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7aab1096cbe2/age-of-calamity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One pleasant surprise of the Switch 2 launch, beyond the advertised upgrades — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free and otherwise</a> — to various Switch games, has been seeing how <em>some</em> Switch games that once struggled to hit their frame rate targets have gotten a nice boost on the new console.</p>
<p>It seems that Switch 1 games with unlocked frame rates are getting a largely untouted bump in the performance department, with games like the nigh-on unplayable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> — which we called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/batman-arkham-knight">"one of the worst ports we've ever played"</a> — now becoming a viable option on Switch 2. Loads times have also shot down for some titles. Result!</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Here, we've collected 13 examples which have impressed us. Some were fairly miraculous on Switch to begin with, but Switch 2 is making a bunch of the bad ones good (or at least playably stable!) and some of the great ones shine brighter than ever. Let's jump in, in no particular order...</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories!</a> My god, I love this game. However, it was a bit of a mess, a bit of a *bunch of swear words* if i'm being honest, on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Back at the release, our review said, <em>"From a technical perspective, the Switch port of Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories is an absolute mess. Narratively and artistically, however, it’s one of the most fascinating games in recent memory."</em> Correct.</p>
<p>Now, though, thanks to Switch 2, from what I can see, the game runs flawlessly. And you need to play it. Now, I'm not gonna pretend I know exactly what the numbers are here, but if I had to guess, I'd say we're looking at an uncapped frame rate that's lifted the action right up to around the 60 mark. It feels great. It also looks much clearer. I think a replay is unavoidable. Sorry. <em><strong>- PJ</strong></em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I fired <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> up and dove into one of the EX missions and...blimey. Essentially, it now has the performance you always wanted from the game. I played a mission and tried out the two-player splitscreen and didn't note a single dropped frame.</p>
<p>Granted, its original state, while hitchy, didn't massively affect my enjoyment of the game. Of course, I saw it — you couldn't miss it — but I still very much enjoyed my time with it (RSI notwithstanding).</p>
<p>Now, I'm not going to play through the entire thing hunting frame rate dips, but after firing it up again for the first time in several years, I'd absolutely consider it if the backlog didn't just have two dozen Switch 2 games piled on it! <strong>- <em>GL</em></strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3 (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a> is an incredibly ambitious, bombastic game that definitely struggled in places on Switch 1 as a result. It looks fuzzy when playing handheld and the accompanying frame rate rarely hits its 60fps target.</p>
<p>Moving over to Switch 2, the game still kind of looks like arse in handheld mode, and it'll likely take a proper 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' upgrade to change this. The frame rate, however, is now buttery-smooth throughout. There's not a single drop below 60fps, from what I've played, even during the busiest set pieces.</p>
<p>For me, the last mainline entry in PlatinumGames' flagship series has its downsides, but if performance was one of them for you, then you can feel comforted in the knowledge that this has been completely rectified for Switch 2. Oh, and load times are now much zippier, too. Nice. <strong>- OR</strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Booting this horiffic mess up for this article,...I'm now impressed? Sort of.</p>
<p>There's no doubting that the move to Switch 2 has benefitted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Arkham Knight</a> immensely with regards to its frame rate, which is now super smooth — even whilst driving Batman's car. I can't remember what it's called...the Bat Car? Anyway, you can barrel through the streets now and it's all good.</p>
<p>And so it goes in combat. It now feels very smooth, and even spinning the camera around Gotham City as you glide through the sky causes no stutters or anything. Miraculous. Or it would be if they could fix the resolution, which is rough in places.</p>
<p>However, if you only have this one way to play Arkham Knight — or it came in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Arkham Trilogy</a> and you abandoned it — it's good to know this version now runs well enough, besides some fuzzy visuals. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bakeru">BAKERU (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Oh, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bakeru">BAKERU</a> is so lovely. If you haven't played this delightful little 3D platformer yet, then now is the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p>On Switch 1, Bakeru's frame rate was kind of all over the place at times. You could tell it was gunning for that 60fps sweet spot, but it never even came close to hitting it. On the Switch 2, it's a completely different story.</p>
<p>I felt like I was playing a remaster when I booted it up for the first time on Nintendo's new console. The frame rate is absolutely spot on, and it really helps elevate the incredible art design and animations. This is up there with some of Nintendo's best. Get on it. <em><strong>- OR</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I'm gonna be blunt now. I hated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3</a> on Switch. I know, I know...it was a miracle port. Whatever. I couldn't handle the muddiness, the sluggishness, and the draw distance that gave me a headache outside of towns. It just wasn't viable for me. I'm a pig.</p>
<p>And so, I'm very pleased to announce that, having taken so poorly to The Switcher, the very same game on Switch 2 is one I'd happily go on a date with. I might even pay for the food. Switch 2 makes the game look night and day different. It's really crisp and clear and, even with all the graphical excisions, manages to look quite purdy, especially while galloping (unfettered by flailing frames) across the game's glorious countryside.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpn5-Ifk27k">Yep, the frame rate feels slick as hell now, too.</a> The Witcher has gone from struggling to run, to feeling as though it needs a bespoke patch to unleash its full powers on a machine that can handle it. For now, though, it's a bloody nice, free little boost. Ta. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I was super-hyped for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a> on Switch (massive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/castlevania">Castlevania</a> fan detected) and even decided to make that my platform of choice for the game.</p>
<p>Whilst it was okay, in a pinch, there was a big loss in terms of visual fidelity, and frame times were all over the place, leading to juddery, unsatisfying play. It just wasn't a <em>grea</em>t version of what is a great game, put simply. However, on Switch 2, any frame time issues have been sorted, with a fully solid lock to 30fps (yes it's not 60, but it's smooth and maybe we'll get a patch).</p>
<p>It's also just a much nicer game to sit down with, thanks to more responsive menu navigation and loading times that have been squashed right down to a breezy minimum. If the game had arrived on Switch like this, I probably wouldn't have double-dipped. Not bad! <em><strong>- OR</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Compared to other series entries, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> wasn't quite as rage-inducingly bad in the performance department, but as highlighted by Alex in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rwJk2nz_xcA?si=Mqsb70rP8ZKf9sbp&amp;t=1071">a recent live stream</a>, the game is now rock-solid, stable 30fps for anybody playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Now, that's not to say that Arceus is some bastion of graphical prowess or anything, but if the frame rate drops bothered you before, they've been zapped on Switch 2. The Pokémon Company let everyone know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> were getting an update, but don't forget this winner, too. <em><strong>- GL</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>, despite being utterly incredible, definitely had its drawbacks on the Switch 1. Load times were pretty dire, and even just heading into the pause menu would yield some unsavoury slowdown.</p>
<p>Not so on the Switch 2. Here, everything is as slick as you could possible hope for. Transitions from one area to the next are pretty close to instantaneous, and heading into the pause menu now has absolutely no slowdown whatesoever.</p>
<p>These hardly sound like the most enthralling improvements ever, I know, but with some like Disco Elysium — a game that utterly demands you to pay attention — seeing all these little improvements add up makes for a much more enjoyable experience. <strong><em>- OR</em></strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM 2 Collection (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM 2 Collection</a> is a game that I awarded an 8/10 to when it released on Switch, and I stand by that score, as bringing a game of this depth and size to a dinky little console, and in a form that played well enough, was very obviously a huge undertaking. And Firaxis managed it - albeit with some big concessions.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, while the graphics remain downgraded (for now), the game now runs buttery smooth, meaning that it's now a viable way, <em>a fully enjoyable way</em>, to play this timeless collection of strategy classics in portable mode. Get in. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>

						<h5>Lies of P: Overture</h5><p><span>June 6th, 2025</span>

			<p>Since the Souls series formula has become popular among players, countless games have tried to recapture what makes FromSoftware's hardcore action role-playing games so engaging, but only a few have managed to even get close. Among these is NEOWIZ and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/">Lies of P</a>, which still stands, a few years since its release, as the game that got the closest to recapturing the haunting atmosphere of the beloved Bloodborne.</p>
<p>Launching almost two years after the base game's release, the Lies of P: Overture DLC promised, before its release, to provide more of the same solid experience players have been enjoying since late 2023. Those who didn't expect anything else will find the expansion a worthy addition to the experience, but those who expected something more will inevitably be disappointed to see how the expansion doesn't push the formula past the boundaries set by the base game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lies-of-P_20250609121253-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Lies of P: Overture expansion is set in the past, in a time before Krat was overrun and then destroyed by the terrible Puppet Frenzy Outbreak that players deal with in the base game. Starting with the Krat Zoo, which was burned down in the main timeline, players get to explore a slew of different locations which are no longer standing in the post-outbreak Krat, get to meet characters who are only briefly mentioned in the main adventure, and fight tons of powerful enemies to learn more about the world's lore and the chain of events that led to the Outbreak.</p>
<p>When it comes to the story, there's no doubt that Lies of P: Overture fully delivers. The main characters of the expansion may be fewer compared to the base game, but they are endearing enough and add quite a bit to the experience. Same with the new information on the world, which better fleshes out the story of the city of Krat. If you wanted to learn more about the setting, then the DLC is definitely a worthy purchase, even if you aren't too keen on dealing with high difficulty, thanks to the two new easier difficulty settings that have been added to the entirety of the experience with the free update that added support for the Overture DLC.</p>
<p>Even if you pick the easiest difficulty setting, however, you should be aware that the Lies of P: Overture DLC expansion is not a walk in the park, and you won't be able to mash your way to victory. As the expansion can only be accessed after reaching the end of Chapter IX, it is meant to be a late-game experience that expects players to possess a certain degree of skill, properly upgraded weapons, and effective builds. As such, the expansion is challenging from the get-go.</p>
<p>Possibly a little too much: enemy HP pools are generally high, as is the damage they can deal at the base difficulty, so expect to die a lot as you get reacquainted with the experience and some of its quirks, such as perfect blocking, which is more important than ever before to leave the enemies open to powerful critical attacks, if you haven't played the game in a while like myself. The difficulty of the expansion is so high that even the developer has promised to look into balance changes down the line. If you are coming to the expansion straight from the base game, you will likely have far less trouble, but you will still need to be on your toes, as it's not just the enemy stats that make them challenging, but also their placement, which, at times, gets really, really unfair. The enemy placements, alongside some locations that resemble each other a little too much, somewhat impact level design, though they are minor issues that most of those who liked the base game will have no trouble looking past. For the rest, expect to explore some fairly intricate locations, unlock shortcuts, and discover all sorts of secrets, including some new gear.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lies-of-P_20250609170050-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though the Lies of P: Overture experience is the same Souls series-inspired action RPG experience seen in the base game, the expansion offers plenty of new tools to play with. Some really change the way the game is approached, such as the Royal Horn Bow, which provides a solid ranged combat option, but the other weapons are similarly well designed and can really shake up how combat is approached. The Pale Knight greatsword, inspired by Final Fantasy VIII's gunblades, is a persona favorite of mine, but every other new weapon and Talisman in the expansion is a worthy addition to the experience.</p>
<p>With these new tools at the player's disposal, it's no surprise to see enemy design take them into account to prevent some options from being too powerful. Some of the new enemies, for example, are quite aggressive, so don't expect, for example, to be able to use the Royal HornBow from afar too much. Other than this, however, enemy design isn't too different from the base game. Bosses, on the other hand, are the highlight of the experience, and are rather well designed, except for a couple that are, in my opinion, more frustrating than fun. Even this, however, is entirely in line with what is seen in the base game, so if you have spent 40 hours going through the streets of Krat already, you will feel right at home spending 20 more in the Krat of the past.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Lies of P: Overture is an expansion in the true sense of the word. Opting to deliver more of the same, Round8 Studio plays to the game’s strengths, offering an experience every bit as enjoyable as the base game, even with some unfair difficulty that will likely get toned down in time. As such, the DLC is a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more. Those who feel they’ve had their fill or struggled with the game’s quirks the first time around won’t find much to change their minds here, however. For better or worse, it’s more Lies of P.</p>

				<p>While it doesn't add anything substantially new to the experience, Lies of P: Overture expansion is a more than worthy expansion, delivering an engaging story delving deeper into the base game's lore, featuring some of the best bosses in the entire game, and adding new weapons that can significantly shake up combat. Its lack of innovation and unfair difficulty may turn off a few players, but all those who loved every second of the base game will have no trouble falling in love again with one of the best Soulslikes of the past few years.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-update-1-1-for-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-now-available-on-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda%E2%80%99s-update-1-1-for-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-now-available-on-all-platforms.1215930/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-update-1-1-for-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-now-available-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda's new update for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/article/6KFC705KG7qmVTfEfG7Txl/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-steam-beta-update-1-1">update 1.1</a>, is now available on all platforms, after initially being available only for Steam Beta users when it launched on June 5.</p>
<p>The update addresses several issues, from bugs that were causing the game to crash or freeze at different points, to VFX and gameplay animation issues. Notably, it also fixes a number of quest issues that would have soft-locked players from being able to complete the quests and progress further.</p>
<p>This is the first of two major patches that Bethesda is working on for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, the second of which will also be out first through Steam Beta, before being made available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles. There's currently no word from Bethesda as to when the next update will arrive, with the studio simply saying in the patch notes that it will be live "<em>in the coming weeks</em>."</p>
<p>While Oblivion Remastered launched with <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">significant performance issues</a>, that hasn't stopped it from being a top seller since it launched. It was part of Xbox's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/">US game sales dominance in April 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">according to Newzoo, Oblivion IV Remastered is</a> "<em>a benchmark for how to execute a remaster effectively</em>."</p>
<p>Though, if you disagree with Newzoo, and Bethesda isn't fixing the issues you're having with Oblivion Remastered fast enough, plenty of modders are already putting in the work to try and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-anti-stutter-improvement/">fix the game's problems themselves, with varying degrees of success.</a></p>
<p>Barring performance issues, returning to Oblivion has been a treat for many fans of The Elder Scrolls series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo scored the remaster very highly</a> when it was shadow-dropped earlier this year, and praised Bethesda for bringing the game into the modern gaming landscape in all the best ways.</p>
<p>"<em>Enhancing the original where it mattered most while preserving what made it truly unique, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered stands as the definitive way to experience Bethesda's classic. Although the shift in atmosphere and noticeable performance issues will put some players off, as will the dated gameplay, the game couldn't have debuted on current gaming platforms in a better way</em>."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> has surpassed&nbsp;<strong>5 million copies sold</strong>, Capcom announced in a <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1932603814827180338">post on the game's official X account</a>.</p>
<p>The milestone comes two years after the latest entry into Capcom's long-running fighting series launched. It's almost two years to the date since Street Fighter 6 launched on June 2, 2023.</p>
<p>"<em>Street Fighter 6 has now sold over 5 million copies! What a way to celebrate our 2nd anniversary! Thanks to all our fans out there around the world and to all the prospective fans in the future!</em>" Capcom wrote announcing the news.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is the latest event in Capcom's continued stellar performance in recent years, and it's also less than a year since Street Fighter 6 reached its last major sales milestone of <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-reach-four-million-globally/">4 million units sold.</a></p>
<p>Hitting 5 million in just two years also puts SF6 perfectly in position to be the best-selling game in the entire Street Fighter series. The current top spot is held by Street Fighter 5, which is sitting at over <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-street-fighter-v-i-sold-7-million-copies-in-7-years">7 million copies</a> sold since it launched in 2016. It could be the case that Capcom is celebrating SF6's three year anniversary with the news that it's also now the best-selling game in the entire franchise.</p>
<p>Capcom also recently <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1931118961846038736">announced</a> the Year 3 roster of fighters that'll be joining Street Fighter 6 between this summer and spring 2026. At some point this summer, Sagat will join the roster, followed by C. Viper joining in fall 2025, then Alex joining in early spring 2026, and Ingrid shortly after in late spring 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pragmata-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pragmata-preview-capcoms-next-hit-ip.1215888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pragmata-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I love it when Capcom makes games that aren't from an established franchise. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and others as much as everyone else, but completely new IPs are also fun.</p><p>
After several years of silence since its initial reveal, <em>Pragmata </em>was a game shrouded in mystery. A new IP from Capcom is sure to catch anyone's attention, so who wouldn't be curious about it?</p><p>
We got hands-on gameplay of Pragmata at Summer Game Fest 2025, so join us as we unravel the mystery behind this title.</p></div>



<h2>Two Makes a Team</h2>

<p>Although we were able to play through 20 or so minutes of gameplay, the story of&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>remains enigmatic. There isn't much in the way of dialogue, other than that we control two characters simultaneously.</p>

<p>One character is this burly man clad in a utilitarian space suit -- his name is Hugh. The other is an android, Diana, that takes the form of a little girl. One might think that this is an escort mission, then, but as it turns out, Diana is quite capable.</p>



<p>Gameplay takes place within this clean, sterile space station. Something's happened, and we're essentially exploring to find a way out. The station is manned by these creepy, humanoid-like robots that are hellbent on taking you out.</p>

<p>Combat largely comprises two components: shooting and hacking. Hugh can shoot various firearms to destroy the robots, and Diana can hack them to make them vulnerable. Just shooting robots without hacking them first means they are near invincible.</p>



<h2>Hack and Shoot to Victory</h2>

<p>Players have to frantically hack these robots to make them vulnerable. On the upper right portion of the screen, there's a small grid that players use to hack. You have to guide your way to a green node to open a robot's vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>There are also blue nodes that will make them vulnerable for longer, so you have a bit of a high risk, high reward type of situation: hit some (or all) of those blue nodes before the exit, or just go straight for the finish?</p>

<p>Later on in the demo, we pick up an upgrade that unlocks shield nodes on the hacking grid. Hitting those nodes on your path to the seem to make robots take more damage.</p>



<p>The gist of combat is, then, to hack and then shoot. Hacking is succinct and easy enough to handle, though it remains to be seen if the complexity of this system will increase over the course of&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>.</p>

<p>Gunplay, by the way, feels pretty tight on controller. If I'm playing a shooter, first-person or, in&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>'s case, third-person, then I'd prefer a mouse and keyboard. During my demo, I actually forgot I was playing with a controller, so it all felt very natural to control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outside of combat, Hugh explores the station while Diana clings to his back. There are light puzzle and platforming elements, but nothing complex, so it's hard to gauge if puzzles are even the focus of&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While I did enjoy my time with&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, I couldn't help but wonder how Capcom would continue to keep gameplay feeling fresh. I found three out of what appeared to be four total weapons, so I'm hoping there's more than it appears.</p>

<p>Other than weapons, the hacking might not feel stale after 10 or so hours, but I could see myself finding it a nuisance if&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>&nbsp;doesn't constantly introduce new mechanics to keep things fresh.</p>

<p>I'm optimistic, though, because&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>is a gorgeous game, and the dynamic between Hugh and Diana has potential to be very heartwarming -- or even tragic. We'll have to find out in 2026, which looks to be a big year for Capcom.</p>

Midjourney’s conduct misappropriates Disney’s and Universal’s intellectual property and threatens to upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law that drive American leadership in movies, television, and other creative arts.” </p><p>This is the highest-profile legal attack yet on a generative-AI company, following lawsuits by <em>The New York Times</em> and others against companies like OpenAI for copying written work. The outcome in court would have major consequences for the viability of a technology that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta are investing billions in. Without the ability to essentially copy the internet for free, the entire business model behind a lot of generative-AI and large language algorithms falls part. </p><p> “Midjourney’s bootlegging business model and defiance of U.S copyright law<br>are not only an attack on Disney, Universal, and the hard-working creative community that brings the magic of movies to life, but are also a broader threat to the American motion picture industry which has created millions of jobs and contributed more than $260 billion to the nation’s economy,” the companies claim in their lawsuit. “This case is not a ‘close call’ under well-settled copyright law.”   </p><p>  .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Complete Resident Evil Timeline Explained</p>
      </div>
<p>Resident Evil 4 was a gigantic hit, both in 2005 and each subsequent time the game was re-released, and remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 launched with dynamic, third-person camera angles in 2019 and 2020. The Resident Evil 2 remake has sold over 15 million copies since then, making it the third-most-successful games in Capcom's history.</p><p>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and Resident Evil Village switched to a first-person camera angle, providing more intimate scares and claustrophobic action. Resident Evil Village went on to sell over 11 million copies since launching in 2021, proving that fans would eat up the scares Capcom provided no matter the camera angle.</p><p>We <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/" data-ref-id="1100-6532336">played Requiem for a short time</a> and came away with more questions than answers, leaving us hungry for the full experience. Resident Evil Requiem is set to launch on February 26, 2026.</p>

In fact, compared to players with a jar on their head or the bubble-sprayer, a Wraith Calling Bell is not too strange. It's fascinating, though, to watch one player clear the big bad of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> with the bell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber Syrobe posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXxRPBNAC6s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solo Recluse run yesterday</a> where, throughout the outing, they took down Nightreign's final Nightlord Heolstor using just the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Wraith+Calling+Bell" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wraith Calling Bell</a>. It's a great run to watch, and also highlights some interesting tech being discovered in Elden Ring Nightreign right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the whole run, you can see Syrobe ringing and flinging the little ghosts from the bell at their foes. Now, the Wraith Calling Bell is not an imposing weapon; it's a little bell that the player rings, and then a small wraith floats out and damages the enemy. By itself, it might already seem like an uphill battle to clear bosses with this instead of some of Elden Ring's more tried-and-true armaments.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this victory emerged from patience, skill, and really good play from Syrobe. There are some aspects that have helped, though. Namely, the technique Syrobe shows off at the beginning of the video, allowing players to be more mobile while casting spells, or in this case, ringing bells. It's a pretty handy bit of tech for the magic casters out there that I recommend writing down and trying out later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, Syrobe locks in and focuses on building a run that can enhance all the necessary aspects for winning. Generating solid FP recovery, picking up some solid upgrades and items, and putting together a route for solo success. Yes, keep in mind, this is a solo victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fascinating thing is, Syrobe is not the only one putting up great clears and exploring the power of the Wraith-Calling Bell.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-played-resident-evil-requiem-in-both-first-person-and-third-person.1215843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">After going first-person for the last couple mainline RE games, Capcom is putting the perspective back in your control.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, it’s called Resident Evil Requiem, but make no mistake: this is the ninth mainline entry into the Resident Evil franchise, and set to star yet another new protagonist: FBI Agent Grace Ashcroft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Capcom surprised everyone with a trailer during the Summer Games Fest trailer, we got a chance to get the first hands-on preview with Resident Evil Requiem (aka Resident Evil 9) shortly after the announcement. And fans will be happy to know that Capcom is still keeping the series rooted in its newfound survival horror goodness.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>First Person or Third Person?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first question for everyone is likely to be whether or not Resident Evil Requiem will be in the first-person perspective like past mainline games Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village, or will it be playable in third-person like the Resident Evil remake games? The answer to that is both!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right, from the jump Capcom will let players toggle between first-person and third-person perspectives through the Options menu at any point during the campaign. While it’s not the most seamless way to change perspectives, the fact that Resident Evil Requiem lets you swap perspectives at all without needing to restart feels pretty revolutionary for this series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And with the perspective swaps comes an interesting dilemma, at least one that I encountered while playing Resident Evil Requiem. But first, let me set the table for you.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Scary Times at the Wrenwood Hotel</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer shows agent Grace Ashcroft as she awakes upside down on a scary looking examination table, and this is where the gameplay demo begins. Once free, Grace must navigate what appears to be a medical ward. It’s unclear if this is in the hotel or in a separate location, but like other Resident Evil locations such as Raccoon City Police Department, for example, this medical ward appears to be decorated by someone who loves classical architecture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grace is pretty powerless from the get-go, and she’s only able to pick up makeshift weapons like glass bottles to use as projectiles. The narrow hallways are sometimes bathed in blinking red emergency lights, or no lights at all, while some doors only lead to pure darkness. At some point Grace finds a lighter that helps her navigate these previously unlit areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom describes Grace as a kind of bookworm – as evinced by the trailer when she’s surrounded by a stack of files. So while she’s had combat training thanks to being in the FBI, she’s not a hardened combat veteran like Leon Kennedy or Jill Valentine. That means she’s more afraid of her nightmarish surroundings, and as you explore the dark hallways, you can hear Grace as she lets out calming breaths to steady her nerves. It does a lot to convey how powerless Grace feels compared to more confident heroes like Leon or Jill, and even helps her stand out against Resident Evil’s last new hero, Ethan Winters, who was stoic to a fault.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I know online there’s been some theorizing about who the true main character of Resident Evil Requiem is. And while Capcom has done bait-and-switches before for Resident Evil protagonists, Grace Ashcroft makes a compelling new hero, whose vulnerability in particular already helps her stand out. I’m curious to learn more about Grace, particularly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-forgotten-resident-evil-game-that-holds-the-secret-to-resident-evil-requiem">her connection to the forgotten Resident Evil Outbreak games</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, Grace will encounter a horrifying new monster that kind of reminds me of the creature from the 2022 horror film Barbarian (Fun fact: Barbarian director Zach Cregger is set to direct the next Resident Evil live-action movie). This monster will stalk Grace through the dark corridors much in the same way as Mr. X or Lady Dimitrescu. Combined with Grace’s palpable fear, running away from this mysterious new monster feels even more terrifying and reminds me almost like the first time I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this fear I describe is mostly present if you play the game in first-person perspective. And as Capcom revealed during the preview, you can switch perspectives at any time. When I played the demo I did extensive testing in third-person mode, including while running away from Requiem’s new monster. In third-person I found that the tension of hiding and running to still be there, but the fear factor was replaced somewhat with a more action-like feel. In third-person, running away from the monster felt a little more tactical than survival-horror, though given Grace’s limited arsenal it was no less stressful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I said, with only bottles to throw at the monster, Grace is better off running away, and in third-person Grace will stumble over her own feet while getting away, highlighting her inexperience and adding more stress to the encounter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi says that the game will stay true to the survival horror core, but highlight a kind of thrill to the action – and I feel like these two elements are highlighted whenever you swap perspectives. For exploration and dread, first-person is the way to go, but for monster encounters, third-person feels livelier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visually, Capcom maintains the high standards set by all previous Resident Evil games since switching to the RE Engine with particular emphasis added to the contrast between light and dark. There are moments where Grace will turn on a hallway light only for it to cast the smallest light possible, while casting menacing shadows. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Resident Evil Requiem, you no longer have to make the choice between first-person and third-person perspective, something Capcom flirted with when it released a third-person option as DLC for Resident Evil Village. While the balance between horror and action naturally shifts depending on the perspective, my main takeaway is that Resident Evil Requiem was exciting to play in either mode, and looks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-golden-age-the-rise-and-fall-resident-evil-monster-hunter-wilds">continue Capcom's strong string of game releases</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>For the next Hearthstone expansion, we're going back to the Lost City of Un'goro with another swashbuckling adventure. And since any such adventure needs an angry swarm of stinging insects, we have the Demon Hunter quest. With the <strong>Unleash the Colossus</strong> quest, you'll get regular tempo plays to inflict damage, followed by a reward that will make your future stings that much more deadly.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Hearthstone quests are 1-mana spells that always start in your hand, and give you big rewards for completing their objectives. Demon Hunter's quest, Unleash the Colossus, challenges you to deal exactly two damage to an enemy on your turn, a whopping 15 times.</p><figure data-embed-type="comparison" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509083-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509084-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_signature.png" data-ref-id="1300-4509083,1300-4509084" data-size="large" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4509083-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4509084-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_signature.png"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>The Unleash the Colossus quest card, in both standard and Signature variants</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509083-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509084-demonhunter_tlc_631_enus_unleashthecolossus-117871_signature.png"></figure><hr><p>This may be an especially tricky proposition for Demon Hunter, whose hero power only deals one damage by default. But the full Demon Hunter quest package is built around giving you lots of options to deal exactly two damage, with a variety of new beasts to deliver the 2-damage stings. There's <strong>Gorishi Wasp</strong> that hits for two damage and gives you access to the <strong>Gorishi Stinger</strong> spell, which then delivers two damage twice more. <strong>Infestation</strong>, a new spell, also gives you Stingers. There's also the new <strong>Insect Claw</strong> weapon that gives you two charges of a two-damage strike, <strong>Gorishi Tunneler</strong> that acts as a two-for-one trigger of the quest by damaging both its target and the hero, and the 1-mana <strong>Silithid Grub</strong> with rush. Finally, while not a direct trigger for the quest, <strong>Silithid Queen</strong> synergizes well with the rest of the package by giving you big damage if you played a Beast the previous turn, thanks to its <strong>Kindred</strong> keyword.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509085-demonhunter_tlc_630_enus_gorishiwasp-117869_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509086-demonhunter_tlc_630t_enus_gorishistinger-117870_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509087-demonhunter_tlc_833_enus_insectclaw-117813_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509088-demonhunter_tlc_840_enus_gorishitunneler-119754_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509089-demonhunter_tlc_902_enus_infestation-117686_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509090-demonhunter_tlc_903_enus_silithidqueen-117687_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509091-demonhunter_tlc_903t_enus_silithidgrub-117689_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4509085,1300-4509086,1300-4509087,1300-4509088,1300-4509089,1300-4509090,1300-4509091" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509085-demonhunter_tlc_630_enus_gorishiwasp-117869_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509086-demonhunter_tlc_630t_enus_gorishistinger-117870_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509087-demonhunter_tlc_833_enus_insectclaw-117813_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509088-demonhunter_tlc_840_enus_gorishitunneler-119754_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509089-demonhunter_tlc_902_enus_infestation-117686_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509090-demonhunter_tlc_903_enus_silithidqueen-117687_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4509091-demonhunter_tlc_903t_enus_silithidgrub-117689_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509085-demonhunter_tlc_630_enus_gorishiwasp-117869_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509086-demonhunter_tlc_630t_enus_gorishistinger-117870_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509087-demonhunter_tlc_833_enus_insectclaw-117813_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509088-demonhunter_tlc_840_enus_gorishitunneler-119754_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509089-demonhunter_tlc_902_enus_infestation-117686_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509090-demonhunter_tlc_903_enus_silithidqueen-117687_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4509091-demonhunter_tlc_903t_enus_silithidgrub-117689_normal.png"></figure><p>So after delivering multiple stings against your opponent, you'll be rewarded with the <strong>Gorishi Colossus</strong>, a 5-mana 8/8 Beast that doubles your 2-damage attacks from that point on, for the rest of the game.

                <p>Legendary video game developer Hideo Kojima hasn't made a secret about being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-he-feared-he-would-never-make-games-again-after-illness/1100-6532346/" data-ref-id="1100-6532346">gravely ill during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and he worried that he would never finish another project. Kojima is still thinking about his mortality even after his recovery.

"I will rather crush the baton… [Laughs] I don't need to give 'Hideo Kojima' to anyone. If I pass the baton to my staff and tell them to make things the same way I do, the company will not succeed and will go out of business."</p><p>When asked to elaborate on his statement, Kojima explained that creators who are inspired by him "received my small fire" and aren't trying to be exactly like him. He's happy to have influenced so many, but not eager to see anyone try to copy him exactly.</p><p>Earlier this year, Kojima disclosed that he filled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-he-has-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-his-studio-to-use-after-he-dies/1100-6531577/" data-ref-id="1100-6531577">a USB stick full of his ideas for video games</a> to be used after his death. He referred to it as his "will," and stated that he would rather Kojima Productions continue making new games and new ideas rather than simply repeating the ones he's already made.</p><p>Kojima's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, will be released on PlayStation 5 on June 26.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156739/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Listen. I'm not gonna dive into this review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on Switch 2 with any ideas of pretending to know everything, or even understand anything, about a game that's grown from hastily retooled battle royale to...well...it looks kind of like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/roblox">Roblox</a> now, in all honesty. What on earth is going on here?</p>
<p>Yes, since the last time I launched into a game of Epic's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, it's changed, I think it's fair to say, <em>immeasurably.</em> The menu system that you boot into is incredibly confusing if you haven't been keeping up with the changes, and looks exactly like the mess of game modes, fan content, and madness I watch my sons syphon through on a daily basis in the Roblox Corporation's behemoth.</p>
<p>Fortnite, it seems, has evolved into something of a lifestyle choice, and it's attracted all the big brands. Hey, there's LEGO, that's cool to see. And over there are lots of licensed superheroes in the main battle royale mode, there's a music festival going on, and there's even some sort of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a>-type racing thing happening. It's a lot. And, even though I may sound a little dismissive, it's actually all very impressive.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156744/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Epic has the mega-bucks to make things happen, you see, and it shows. All of the various games here are decently entertaining, great at times even, and they are collected together in such a way that it all feels, I'm sure, as though you are socialising in effect, dropping in and out of game types with your pals and getting chaotic on the mic. Again, it's basically turning into Roblox, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>This is all much slicker, though. You can feel the money in the bigger games, and even the fan stuff is much better. Hopping between games is fast and breezy now, too, and so there's always something, whether official or fan-made, to take for a spin without having to worry about a sluggish port making it much slower than it need be.</p>
<p>Let's dig in, just a little, to the core modes involved for those who are new to this 2016 game, or platform, such as it is these days. You've got the super-solid battle royale that started it all (pour one out for Save the World), seemingly available here in a few seasons at once, with superheroes and some classic older stuff all there to cycle through. It may have been around for aeons now, but honestly the building element to this — where you erect makeshift walls and platforms on the fly — just never really gets old, and having this one mode running smoothly on Switch 2 is probably enough for some to make it worth the download.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156743/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's <strong>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</strong>, a fully fleshed out survival game that's managed to stick around and remain popular for quite some time (full transparency, I've been very excited by what I've played of this so far) alongside <strong>Lego Brick Life</strong>, a sort of multiplayer social-sim deal where you can probably spend hundreds of hours making an apartment just how you like it in a big Lego city full of other people.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Harmonix gets involved with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, which is a full-on rhythm game featuring rotating song selections, a song shop, and the choice to take control of one of four instruments in each song, meaning multiplayer is a go-go. What I played was, like everything in Fortnite, surprisingly in-depth and fully-featured, so I can imagine it's good fun with some pals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_racing">Rocket Racing</a>, meanwhile, is genuinely a pretty great online 12-player racer (by Psyonix!) that does a great job of giving you a fast-paced, flashy and very moreish arcade experience replete with everything from boost pads to drift techniques and more besides.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156741/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>These offerings are the main pillars within the Fortnite zeitgeist at the moment, with all the other good stuff just gravy. You've also got a huge creative suite which has been powered up and added to over time, resulting in a flexible system that enables gamers to make impressively varied content, some of which is actually very decent - from the little I've tried.</p>
<p>There's freeze-tag games, co-op horror efforts, a Minecraft clone (which seems good?!), BMX games, sports stuff, sci-fi adventures and a game which I will even mention by name here, Octo Game, which is basically <strong>Squid Game</strong> online. Nice.</p>
<p>I'm sure none of us need a 46-year-old nerd's in-depth thoughts on every last one of the game modes and fan content bits and bobs here; we all know what Fortnite is and how it plays across the various aspects that have been added to it over the past few years. It's also <em>free</em> — the microtransactions, although annoying in quantity, are purely cosmetic, so ruining yourself financially is entirely optional — so I guess there's no loss to just jumping in and giving it a whirl.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156742/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, the big question. How does it play on Switch 2? Well, it's all very good news. Looking back on the original Switch version now, after years of iteration and several console launches, it really is a bit of a muddy, depressing mess. We all put up with it, because we're hard-as-nails gamers, but as soon as you make the leap to Switch 2, there's no turning back.</p>
<p>The blurred visuals have been eradicated to the point my son is happily playing it in docked mode on a big TV and thinks it looks "great". This coming from someone who baulked at the idea of just <em>looking</em> at the Switch version is surely a very good sign.</p>
<p>In both docked and handheld mode you are now getting 60fps and it looks way, way sharper. Resolutions, I believe, have jumped from 900p/660p (or thereabouts) for docked and handheld respectively on OG Switch — both of which were 30fps — to 1220p/900p at 60fps on the Switch 2. Result!</p>
<p>Geometry looks far more impressive, with way more detail and sharper, cleaner edges and textures have seen a big old boost all-round. Foliage has also returned to the map in the form of lots of lovely trees and details, an aspect which looked AWFUL on Switch 1 as you departed the Battle Bus and landed down onto a barren wasteland. Here it looks great. Is it as sharp as a PS5? Of course not. But it looks very nice, especially in handheld, and there have been no issues across any of the game modes as far as I have experimented. It's 60fps all the way, baby.</p>
<figure><a title="Fortnite Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156736/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of the modes themselves, just very quickly, I still love the main battle royale/building mode of this game. It's just very smart, and one of those timeless things that draws you in fully every time you return to it. Elsewhere, I have to say, I could also quite easily get fully addicted to Rocket Racing and all of the various Lego stuff is also great. I'd much rather my kids stuck to playing this than return to the dankness of Roblox, in all honesty.</p>
<p>Another cool aspect to this embiggened version of Fortnite, is all of the creative opportunities it offers to players through its various Creative modes. I should also mention that the Lego Odyssey survival/adventure mode absolutely got me hooked. I was not expecting it to be this involving.</p>
<p>Seasoned players will also be happy to hear that loading times are way sharper, and all of your various skins — which on Switch might straight up refuse to load in — now appear in a timely and orderly fashion. Heck, they even look good! These are the sorts of changes that take it from a fuzzy, low-end version, albeit one we put up with on Switch, to an eminently viable experience.</p>

<p>Whilst I've been playing Fortnite on Switch 2, it's also received an update to add mouse controls, and I...love them? I was not expecting to say that. Quite the opposite, in fact. However, the way the game handles it all is very cool.</p>
<p>Hopping into Settings, you can select a hand for mouse control, turning your chosen Joy-Con on its side and using the shoulder buttons as your mouse buttons. Sweet. The other Joy-Con then gets held normally for movement with your thumbstick, and combining these gives you a hybrid setup that feels ace. Yes, you'll need to have a little space to do it, but if you're sitting at a desk (or have ironed your trouser legs), this is now the way. A big surprise, and something that's now got me excited to use mouse controls for shooters on Switch 2 going forward.</p>

<p>Overall, then, this port may not be quite as slick as your powerhouse PC or Series X variants, which is fair enough and expected, but honestly, if I had to choose a console to go with, it's no longer straightforward. Portable brings <em>a lo</em>t to the table, especially considering the gaming habits of the kids this game is primarily aimed at. I also now love mouse controls.</p>
<p>So, yes, it looks a bit shinier on other platforms, but sitting on the sofa to mess in creative mode, listen to tunes via Fortnite Festival, or get stuck into Lego or battle royale? I'm gonna go ahead and say I'm rocking the Switch 2 every time.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fortnite on Switch 2 fixes all glaring — and not so glaring — issues with the Switch 1 version of the game. This is a huge package of activities; from battle royale to survival game, racing, creative modes, music festivals, and more besides. It's a lot, and it now runs at 60fps with crisp, clean resolutions all round.</p>
<p>Mouse mode controls are a revelation, loading times are hugely improved, graphics look very nice indeed, thanks, and, well, I reckon this is now the best way to play this one, regardless of a slight downgrading in visuals.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>sales have topped another major milestone around the world, including sales across all platforms and on both digital and physical platforms.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250611.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official Capcom website,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell five million copies since launching back in June 2023. The new sales milestone means that&nbsp;the fighting game has picked up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million" rel="nofollow">since September last year</a>.</p>

<p>Sales may well have accelerated thanks to the launch of&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>as a Switch 2 launch title. The console, which launched on June 5th, racked up 3.5 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">within its first four days</a>, making it Nintendo's fastest-selling console around the world.</p>

<p>The game largely continues the one-on-one fighting game trappings of its predecessors, although it naturally boasts new characters in its roster, as well as new mechanics and a more newcomer-friendly approach (which, incidentally, is one of the things Capcom credits with the new game's popularity).</p>

<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>also features a single-player mode by the name of World Tour, in which players can create their own avatars and explore various environments from both the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fight&nbsp;</em>universes.</p>

<p>Like many modern fighting games,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>also features <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow">rollback netcode</a>, as well as cross-platform play. A host of new characters have also been added to the roster as part of post-launch DLC, many of which are included in the Switch 2's&nbsp;<em>Years 1-2 Fighters Edition&nbsp;</em>package.</p>




<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>is available right now for PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. You can check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/street-fighter-6-review" rel="nofollow">our review of the game here</a>.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’re dealing with what appears to be poor battery life on the Nintendo Switch 2, the company has a <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo">support document</a> with steps you can try to fix it.</p><p>The document spells out what you can try if “the battery amount displayed and the actual remaining battery use don’t match,” according to Nintendo. “For example, you are able to continue using your Nintendo Switch 2 console for a few hours even though the battery charge indicator displays the battery is almost depleted.”</p><p>Nintendo’s troubleshooting steps include making sure you have an “adequately powerful AC adapter” to charge your system, confirming that your console has the latest system update, and booting the system into recovery mode, which the company says “should reset the battery level meter.” If those steps don’t work and your battery life is still showing incorrectly, Nintendo suggests sending your console in for service.</p><p>Since last week’s launch, there’s been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1l4pv2t/switch_2_battery_life/">some chatter</a> about poor battery life, but some of that might just be due to the Switch 2 not having a great battery. On the Switch 2 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqtSU0D6vLzB2FZkUZBPUQThJrhxAhmYOFf54WuhkoLdMQmWf3-" rel="sponsored">tech specs page</a>, Nintendo rates battery life from approximately 2 to 6.5 hours, and it notes that those are “rough estimates” and that “the battery life will depend on the games you play.” For comparison, Nintendo rates the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch%2Ftech-specs%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopTIBh2Cpv7_cuH96gdOvMX8PCEYxr2_v8l8nLREfBVOws7Xnso%23switch-section" rel="sponsored">Switch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch%2Ftech-specs%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopTIBh2Cpv7_cuH96gdOvMX8PCEYxr2_v8l8nLREfBVOws7Xnso%23oled-section" rel="sponsored">Switch OLED</a> for about ​​4.5 to 9 hours of battery.</p><p>The differences are stark in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gqD6US5HEo">battery test on YouTube</a> between the Switch 2, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite. With all three running <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> under similar conditions, the Switch 2 was the first console to power down after about 2 hours and 45 minutes. The next was the Switch Lite, which lasted nearly 30 minutes longer. And the Switch OLED? It lasted for approximately double the time of the Switch 2, finally powering off at just about five hours and 30 minutes.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
