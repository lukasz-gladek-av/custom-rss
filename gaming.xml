		<p>A mouthful in all senses, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, an original IP from Studio Zero – a team made up of Persona veterans – continues to stretch the word soup of game names to its limit. But what does it mean? Well, just like part of its namesake, it’s an idea, a comparison, and an image that is designed to take your mind to unexpected places. This becomes even more clear when you actually play it, with Metaphor: ReFantazio drawing on the grotesque and off-kilter ideas of the Persona franchise and spinning them out into an all-new RPG experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Travel Beyond Fantasy | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_-BPELOl0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>My word, does it looks good! From the fully animated cutscenes, via the imaginative character and creature designs, the anime-esque gameplay envelops you in a fantasy world that’s totally its own.</p>


<p>Our playthrough starts with a murder. The king, already seemingly on his deathbed, has a blade plunged into his body, potentially sending the kingdom spinning off into chaos, as his only heir had recently died himself. There’s foul play afoot and Louis, a behorned knight, is at the centre of it.</p>
<p>You take on the role of a young Elda boy, whose origin in the story starts by being kicked off a cliff. Accompanied by the fairy Gallica, a slightly more combative Tinkerbell, you’re on a vital mission to infiltrate the royal guard, though that’s as far as your knowledge goes at this point. Perhaps it was the fall off a cliff.</p>

<p>As well as being our companion, the opening of our demo sees Gallica cast our character’s favourite spell, which suddenly brings the world to life with music. I love the idea that the soundtrack has been cast on our character rather than just accepting that every event is just accompanied by music. The vocal-led, high tempo track certainly makes things more dramatic, and throughout our hour with the game it’s often stunning.</p>

<p>Eight tribes and three nations make up the United Kingdom of Euchronia. As you’d expect, the city is more diverse than our characters have encountered out in the sticks, though it’s mainly two tribes – the Clemar and the Roussante – that you’ll see.</p>
<p>There’s some racial undertones at play within the fantasy setting, and as an Elda you’re looked down on by pretty much everyone else. Gallica speaks out against the prejudice, and here’s hoping that people become more accepting as you progress. It’ll be interesting to see whether the Studio Zero team use this opportunity for social commentary, or whether it’s purely a narrative tool.</p>
<p>You’re on the way to the Grand Cathedral, an inverted pyramid looming out of the desert. Despite the sandy setting, it’s a very British city that you’re visiting, with the localised language options using local accents to bed things in further, and Georgian-styled streets filled with people.</p>
<p>As you wander around you can listen in on all the gossip of the city-folk, with ‘PSST’ signs showing that you’re not really supposed to be listening in. It’s fun though, and gives the world some real grounding as the people talk in hushed tones about the assassination and how the country is going to hell. It’s so stereotypically British that you even get to join a queue. ‘Press A to join a queue’, might just be this winter’s favourite meme.</p>

<p>There were so many cutscenes in our hands-on that it feels as though this is a TV series that you’re occasionally playing, though I’m sure that balance is going to be a lot more gameplay-heavy across the finished game. What is does prove is how involved the storytelling is, and the production values are truly stunning. After an hour in this world I’m already fully invested in seeing where this tale goes.</p>
<p>Leon Strohl is your first companion, and it’s in his company that you first experience true battle. It’s here that it becomes clear who the monsters in this world are: they’re humans, though not exactly as you or I would know them. In fact, the first ‘human’ looks more like a dinosaur escaping from an egg, with vaguely human legs. So, there’s that.</p>
<p>You can start Squad Battles here, with turn-based combat playing out as you’d expect. You can choose to attack, defend, or utilise skills or items, gaining experience when the enemy is vanquished. You can surprise enemies by catching them unawares with a swipe of your sword, letting you enter combat with an unanswered attack and an initial stun which makes chopping them into bits a little bit easier.</p>

<p>During our hands-on this was the most straightforward aspect of Metaphor: ReFantazio, but the reassuring combat should allow the more unusual world and narrative room to breathe.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio was one of Gamescom 2024’s highlights, and a game to keep an eye on as we hurtle toward its <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/07/metaphor-refantazio-trailer-showcases-why-you-should-get-excited-for-this-rpg/">October release</a>. Our hands on gave us a massive taste of the world that Studio Zero are building, and it looks utterly fantastic across the board. Persona fans, or those seeking this year’s freshest RPG experience, should be salivating at the prospect.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-gamescom-hands-on-a-jrpg-hit-in-the-making/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is a game that has been in the works for a very long time. Announced back in 2016 as Project Re: Fantasy, the first game by Studio Zero, a new ATLUS internal development studio headed by Persona 3, 4, and 5 director Katsura Hasino, the game only resurfaced <a href="https://wccftech.com/personas-team-fantasy-rpg-metaphor-re-fantazio-announced-for-a-2024-release/">last year</a> with a trailer that provided the first look at the project deeply rooted in traditional fantasy aesthetics. Even with a different setting, however, the Persona series DNA is still quite prevalent in Metaphor: ReFantazio, but that is not a bad thing at all, as I feel the game will be the first real step forward for the formula in a very long time.</p>
<p>During last week's Gamescom, I had the chance to play through the first hour of Metaphor: ReFantazio. Right from the beginning, I was hooked. The United Kingdom of Euchronia, the assassination of its king, and the main character's mission, which involves lifting the curse placed on the crown prince, was engaging from the start, as was the little world-building I experienced. The game's world seems to be rather complex, featuring multiple tribes with tense relationships among one another, which I expect to play a rather big part in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as everyone Persona fan knows, one hour of gameplay is too little to evaluate a massive game like Metaphor: ReFantazio, but I definitely appreciated how the adventure doesn't waste too much getting the main character and his fairy companion Gallica into the thick of things. As such, I was able to experience some short exploration sequences on the field surrounding the city of Grand Trad, and I couldn't help but notice how much better roaming around is compared to the latest Persona games. Fields, for example, are vast and filled with enemies and treasure, while cities are rendered in the proper scale that represents their grandeur rather nicely. Interaction with the environment and other NPCs was standard fare for JRPGs, but at least Metaphor: ReFantazio seems to do its best to properly represent the vastness of its world.</p>

<p>In my hour with the game, I was also able to test out the game's combat system and explore one dungeon, the Northern Bord Fort, which honestly felt very straightforward and not particularly remarkable. Metaphor: ReFantazio employs the Turn Press combat system, which allows both player and enemy to obtain extra turns when hitting weaknesses, but with a new twist that gives players an advantage if they stun the enemy before entering combat by attacking them on the field. This is a great addition that does wonders for the game's pacing, even though this iteration of the Press Turn system is pretty snappy to begin with. For the rest, battles play the same as in the latest Persona and Shin Megami Tensei games: find an enemy's weakness, exploit it, and win the battle while avoiding getting one's own weaknesses exploited. I was unable to test out the Archetype system, unfortunately, as my time with the demo ended before it was properly introduced, and exactly when another feature from the Persona series got introduced: a time limit for main quests.</p>
<p>Evaluating a massive role-playing game like Metaphor: ReFantazio in just one hour is impossible, but my time with it during Gamescom definitely left me hungering for more. For the first time in a very long time, the formula of the Persona series is getting a much-needed shake-up, and I am very interested to see if the game will end up being something more than just Persona in a fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/18-CA-349076" rel="noopener" target="_blank">complaint</a>, which was picked up by <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1828561778978226446/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> (as well as the good folks at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/unionised-staff-at-cod-studio-raven-software-says-activision-is-stalling-over-contract-talks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VGC</a>), contains three allegations against Activision, Microsoft, and Raven Software itself.</p>
<p>Those allegations are as follows: "Refusal to Bargain/Bad Faith Bargaining", "Changes in Terms and Conditions of Employment", and "Concerted Activities (Retaliation, Discharge, Discipline)".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raven-software-activision.jpg?itok=N-Zm-QpX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raven-software-activision.jpg?itok=S5r0zdAS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Raven Software is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As noted by VGC and Totilo, Claude Cummings Jr, president of the Communications Workers of America union, said the union's members were "optimistic" that Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> would speed things up for Raven Software's collective bargaining efforts.</p>
<p>However, he goes on to acknowledge that this "has not happened", imploring Microsoft to "address the concerns" raised in the complaint and to "make reaching a fair agreement a priority".</p>
<p>In response, Microsoft told Totilo and Game File that the company was "committed to negotiating in good faith". That, to me, seems a slightly mealy-mouthed response to a complaint that contains an accusation of doing exactly the opposite, but I'm not a legal expert.</p>
<p>Raven Software first announced its intention to unionize <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-is-unionizing-as-game-workers-alliance">back in early 2022</a>, and in June of that month, then-Activision head Bobby Kotick <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-to-start-talks-with-raven-software-union">declared the company's intention</a> to enter into "good faith" negotiations with said union.</p>

<p>It is, however, slightly disappointing to hear that Microsoft's acquisition doesn't seem to have done much to stop such behavior, at least not in the short-term.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the next couple of years, the situation for unions under Activision will improve, but that's got to start somewhere. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things gaming union-related.</p>

The Elda are viewed as “tainted” by the remaining seven tribes, and have been othered by everyone else.

There are systemic and cultural barriers that make it difficult for your character to navigate the world. Exploring a world already in the midst of political upheaval as a marginalized person lets you see the rot firsthand. That’s all well-worn territory, even in this team’s previous works like <em>Persona 5</em>, but the game’s portrayal of these ideas really struck me in how it frames the fantasy genre as escapism.</p><figure id="" data-id="f280de905b8594bf37cd19610472bacc" data-recommend-id="image://f280de905b8594bf37cd19610472bacc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Metaphor characters shake hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Metaphor characters shake hands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f280de905b8594bf37cd19610472bacc" data-recommend-id="image://f280de905b8594bf37cd19610472bacc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Metaphor characters shake hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The main character of <em>Metaphor</em> has a book that tells of a “fantasy” world that sounds a whole lot like ours. It depicts a modern-day metropolis, a completely unified world where everyone is equal and free to live as they choose. But we know that’s not how the real world actually operates, it’s very much projecting an idealized version, a fantasy, if you will, of reality. I’m curious to see if <em>Metaphor</em> examines that disconnect, and in the four hours I played, the game<em>&nbsp;</em>made several allusions to the fact that the real world seems to exist in this game. You name your hero and also yourself as a separate entity who guides him through his journey. The Akademia safe house in which you learn new truths about the world and expand your party’s jobs has books that reference your name. My theory is <em>Metaphor </em>is leading into a big metatextual twist that involves its fantasy world and its idealized vision of ours. That a fantasy world with so many problems that are analogous to ones we experience in the real world imagines mundane city skylines as its own form of escapism is a fascinating framing, especially when fantastical worlds full of impossible things are often used as an excuse by bad-faith actors to pretend works set within them should be viewed as entirely separate from ours and shouldn’t be beholden to any kind of real-world scrutiny.<br></p><h2 id="h227824"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is clearly based on real-world conflicts, but Atlus says it has “no political agenda”</strong></h2><p>After my hands-on, I sat down for a group Q&amp;A with a panel of Atlus developers with other members of the press. We asked about quest structures, combat design, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134">relationship building</a></span>, and plenty of other topics. But when it came to discussing the overtly political story, the conversation was in stark contrast to the game we’d been playing for several hours.</p><p><em>Metaphor </em>producer Junichi Yoshizawa explained through a translator that the election story allowed the team to portray “people putting in a lot of effort and power into making a better future.”</p><p>“We wanted to really focus on the power that it can potentially bring to make the world something better,” Yoshizawa said. “And of course, it being, you know, at times a battle, there’s also that festivity to it in trying to make the world better. So we wanted to bring that power to the forefront without ignoring it, but facing it head on depicted that realness within the state. We believe that it has that power to make changes. So this was an element that we had decided to incorporate from a very early conceptual stage.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0001f0f2019211dcaf84e0317dcd6416" data-recommend-id="image://0001f0f2019211dcaf84e0317dcd6416" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist pulls out his heart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist pulls out his heart." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0001f0f2019211dcaf84e0317dcd6416" data-recommend-id="image://0001f0f2019211dcaf84e0317dcd6416" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist pulls out his heart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Elections are one of the many tools that citizens have to try and enact change within society, and <em>Metaphor </em>doesn’t shy away from the imagery of the common people rising up against corruption to try and make the United Kingdom of Euchronia a better place. When Strohl, one of your party members, awakens to his <em>Persona</em>-like Archetype, he rallies a group of people to his cause, literally tearing his heart out and screaming into it like a microphone. <em>Metaphor</em> isn’t subtle about its ideology. But Yoshizawa immediately followed up his answer with the following:<br></p><p>“Of course, we have no political agenda or message that we want to push with this,” Yoshizawa said. “It’s more so a tool, if you will, that we decided to use to convey the story that we want to in this fantasy world. If there were to be an election, how would people would react to it, how people would think, what people would do to better the future for themselves? So we essentially took this concept as a tool as a motif to push our story to the forefront. So we do hope that separating from that sort of political agenda or message people truly get to enjoy this election perspective and tool within this fantasy story setting.”</p><p>Charitably, it seemed Atlus was most wary of Americans assuming this was in direct response to the vitriolic presidential election we are currently experiencing in 2024. Before any of us had a chance to play the game, Atlus played a video of <em>Metaphor </em>director Katsura Hashino introducing the game in which he made clear that its launching during an election cycle was merely a coincidence. I do believe that <em>Metaphor </em>is not a response to any specific election. I could even believe that there might not have been a specific inciting incident that inspired it, rather than just a long history of persecution, classism, and election anxiety that has plagued our world for centuries. But Atlus did, at least, acknowledge that the tribes are meant as a fantasy stand-in for how different cultures navigate political and identity-based anxieties.</p><p>“Nobody is perfect, so there are different ways that people face anxiety when they are confronted with it,” Yoshizawa said. “With that idea in mind, we decided to separate these tribes from the actual races that we see in real life where we created different tribes with [...] different sort of ways that they feel or how they feel or interact with anxiety. So we’ve taken away all these existing ideas of race and created these new tribes in this game with that as a foundation. So we believe that that is a very original concept for this game and something that we are proud of.</p><p>Here’s the thing, Atlus can say that <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>has no political agenda, but this isn’t a story that materializes out of thin air from a team that is imagining a worst-case scenario. Just because it’s not about a specific political campaign or candidate doesn’t mean it isn’t making a statement about the world we live in. The belief that the world can and <em>should </em>be made better than it is right now is an inherently political view that extrapolates beyond a fantasy setting.&nbsp;The attempts to distance itself from reality when it so pointedly mirrors current global, societal unrest isn’t surprising in the current landscape of the video game industry. No company who wants their game to sell millions of copies is going to say outright that “this game is about rising up against corrupt systems and those exist in our world.”</p><p>But saying your game has things to say about the way the world is doesn’t automatically mean you’re talking about Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Saying it’s all just hypotheticals when the game clearly unpacks the notion of the fantasy genre as idealized escapism undercuts the world the team built to examine class, political machinations, and othering. It was jarring to hear Atlus representatives’ attempts to distance <em>Metaphor</em>’s intriguing foundations from anything that might read as controversial. I mean, the game is literally called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kv2lVyWzRQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kv2lVyWzRQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“<em>Metaphor.”</em></a></span> Sometimes you just have to let the art speak for itself, and the excellent four hours I played of <em>Metaphor </em>shouted over even the sanitized answers from someone trying to sell me something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoUq073Pp7I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a> with MinnMax, Astro Bot creative director Nicolas Doucet gave fans a clearer view of possible PSVR2 and PC releases for the upcoming game.</p>



<p>Early in the interview, Doucet said that there is “no chance” the new Astro Bot game is coming to PSVR2. They explained that it was “designed for a different medium,” and that Astro Bot “would be a different game” if released on that platform.</p>



<p>Just minutes later, the interviewer followed up about a potential PC launch, asking if Doucet had a message for PC players who are excited to play Astro Bot. Doucet replied that “we want to hear from you, absolutely, we want to hear from you.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following a series of rumors, Sony finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-officially-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Astro Bot</a> during the latest PlayStation State of Play showcase last May. The reveal trailer confirmed it will launch on September 6, 2024, and it will be available exclusively on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Since then, there have been a variety of updates on Astro Bot details. In a previous interview with Doucet just last month, the creative director also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-game-length-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed Astro Bot’s length</a>. They mentioned the game will last around 12 to 15 hours, without counting completionist collecting.</p>



<p>Fans also learned that Astro Bot will feature at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-biggest-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 PlayStation cameos</a>, and a leak later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-game-size-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed the game size</a> fans can expect.</p>

Set in the far future, humanity has gone to the stars in search for precious resources. And the planet orbiting our namesake star, Ruptura, while being a resource-rich open world is also rife with dangers.</p><p>In the teaser clip, we see our lone explorer face off against hordes of enemies charging a custom-built base. If that isn’t enough, our exploding star is mere minutes from releasing an apocalyptic fire wave on the planet’s surface. All of our fighter’s vitals are looking good, but Creepy Jar isn’t forgetting their roots in survival and eagle-eyed viewers will notice not only the health and armour stats for our player/character, but also the thirst, toxicity, and hunger levels, as well.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_909952"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Utilizing collected resources to create ammunition to load turrets as one line of defense, the player is valiantly attempting to protect a base under a full-scale assault and there’s no time to waste. As enemies make their way to destroy the base’s wind farm and storage buildings, a split-second decision is made to protect smelters and <a title="Genres > Crafting [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> pods from a terrifying new enemy assault on the other side of the base. While automated drones are busy zipping around their elevated tracks to deliver resources from location to location, the enemy assault becomes all but overwhelming. Making matters worse, our soldier looks up to see Ruptura ready to unleash its fiery blaze. With no time left to lose, the race is on to get to safety… but will he make it in time?</p><p>Taking what was learned over the five-year journey of <em>Green Hell</em>, Creepy Jar’s experience makes it the perfect developer to support <em>StarRupture</em>‘s three gameplay pillars of base-building, exploration, and combat. <em>StarRupture</em> sets itself in the story of man versus nature taking place in an otherworldly and breathtaking science-fiction environment where elemental cataclysms of extreme temperatures loom as a constant danger. The player takes up the mantle of a convict exiled from the Earth to serve their sentence by mining and expanding industrial production alongside researching new technology on a seemingly hospitable new planet rife with mystery and danger. Tasked with surviving the deadly waves of elements—not to mention facing down against hostile enemy monsters in tense combat—each cycle spells destruction yet ushers in a new era of growth and rebuilding. Played from a first-person perspective—adventuring solo or as part of an up-to-four-player group in cooperative mode—players will be able to explore, adapt, mine, gather resources, and build complex machinery to survive and prosper.</p><p>Though by definition it is a base-building simulator, <em>StarRupture</em> is much more. The game will invite players to push beyond, to stay resilient and sharp against every assault, building and forming prior to the cycling eviscerating conditions on an otherwise beautiful planet. For fans of builders, management, science-fiction <a title="Genres > Action [2,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, and combat <em>StarRupture</em> will challenge all comers to utilize the technology at their fingertips and weather both the extremities and fierce enemies in order to survive and create a prosperous industrial complex.</p></blockquote><p><em>StarRupture</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,098 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.

The threequel was unveiled at Gamescom 2024, but unlike its forebears will be shunning the App Store and launching exclusively on Netflix Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't the first time Ustwo has collaborated with Netflix. The studio launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Desta: The Memories Between</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> exclusively on the platform, which grants all subscribers access to a growing roster of video games on smartphones and other devices, before eventually bringing it to PC and Nintendo Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Monument Valley, though, is a different beast. When it launched in 2014, the atmospheric puzzler became a poster child for Apple's digital marketplace. The inevitable sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, debuted exclusively on iOS in June 2017 before shuffling onto Android a few months later. So, what's changed?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about Ustwo's decision to renew its partnership with Netflix on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lead producer John Lau says the current incarnation of the App Store is a very different beast to the one that connected the studio with new audiences all those years ago.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you think about the choices one might have in the market economy, it's not the same as it was 10 years ago. I think discoverability is the key thing we're trying to maximise as much as possible. It's really important that we get our games in front of as many people as we can," says Lau.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He feels the App Store is currently more focused on surfacing free-to-play projects and titles that prioritize "high user-acquisition" above all else. As a result, he says it now makes a lot more sense for a morsel like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to venture onto mobile by way of a subscription service like Netflix Games, which he says will actually "allow people to see it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The thing about that is, it also allows it to stay Monument Valley rather than change its mechanics or do whatever else you need to do to survive in a different [ecosystem]," Lau continues. "[The Netflix Games deal is about] trying to make the kind of game we wanted to make, without having to compromise in order for it to survive in the kind of App Store that exists in the modern day."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game director Jennifer Estaris agrees. She emphasises the Netflix deal is about securing an audience, and points to the streamer's massive subscriber base–which currently includes almost 270 million households across over 190 countries–as a clear and obvious boon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/FINAL-Q1-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">In a recent fiscal report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Netflix stated it has an "audience of over half a billion people," and claimed developing and signing video games was a core part of its mission to create "great stories that appeal to lots of different tastes." Elaborating on that point specifically, Estaris states that families are a core part of Netflix's subscriber base, and feels </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will thrive among that demographic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Netflix's lofty subscriber count makes for good reading, in 2022 it was reported that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/only-one-percent-of-netflix-users-have-downloaded-its-games">less than 1 percent of those paying customers had downloaded its games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

			<p>The God Hand series began and ended with the release of the first entry in 2006, but if given a chance to revive any of the series he has worked on, director Shinji Mikami would choose it over every other.</p>
<p>In an interview with both the legendary creator of the Resident Evil series, among other franchises, and Goichi Suda, also known as Suda51, regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-gets-official-release-date/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a> conducted during Gamescom last week, I asked which game or series they had worked on they would like to bring back and give another chance. Mikami-san answered first without hesitation, saying only "God Hand 2," to the cheering of most people in the room. Unfortunately, the chances of the game happening are very slim, considering CAPCOM owns the IP and has shown no interest in it since release, but still, maybe with enough demand, the Japanese publisher may give Shinji Mikami the chance to create the game and give modern players a taste of what it is that made the original so unique.</p>
<p>During the interview, Shinji Mikami and Suda51 discussed a variety of other topics as well, such as the possibility of a second entry in the Shadows of the Damned series, Suda51's desire to realize the original vision of the game, a potential complete edition of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/868520/killer7/">killer 7</a> featuring cut content and even a sequel, which he would very much like to create. Check back in the next few days for the complete interview!</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro could come with 2TB of storage, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the Broken Silicon podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> revealed that they have seen a PS5 Pro devkit and confirmed that it comes with 2TB of storage. While the storage space could be lower for the retail system, the fact that Microsoft is releasing an Xbox Series X with 2TB of storage suggests that Sony could do the same for what is effectively a premium gaming system.</p>
<p>On a related note, the PlayStation 5 Pro is likely to be a quiet console that runs cool. According to Moore's Law is Dead, the devkit uses the same power connector as the base model, meaning Sony is not going to push the system, keeping the same power draw. This, in conjunction with the transistor increase over the base model, should make the system quiet and cool.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has quickly become one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming in 2024. After months of rumors, we ourselves <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/">heard</a> from a video game developer that the console will run Unreal Engine 5 better, and multiple reports from other sources essentially confirm the system is real and coming. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-launch-this-year/">According to Jeff Grubb</a>, the system is still scheduled for release this year, although the reveal timings are still unknown.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

						<h5>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</h5><p><span>August 29, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>The Nintendo Switch has seen a lot of deep-cut releases over the past year, but arguably none slice quite as deep as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</a>. A series of surprisingly-mature 8-bit visual novels written by Metroid co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/famicom-detective-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famicom Detective Club</a> games gained a certain amount of notoriety over the decades amongst hardcore Nintendo fans who like to keep up with the company’s unlocalized oddities. It certainly came as a surprise when Nintendo brought remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club titles, The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, to worldwide audiences in 2021. While that was a big deal to a certain niche audience, the remakes didn’t exactly do Mario numbers, so many assumed the series might just disappear again. Thankfully, the surprises kept coming, with the first all-new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series launching tomorrow.</p>
<p>Is Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club a page-turning revival of Nintendo’s cult series? Or is this particular Detective Club not worth joining? Time to investigate…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club once again casts players as a rookie investigator (you determine your name) working for the Utsugi Detective Agency, although this time around you also get to step into the shoes of sprightly fellow investigator Ayumi Tachibana for some sections. Your latest case is set in motion when a middle school boy is found strangled to death with a paper bag bearing a creepy scrawled-on smile placed over his head. This bears resemblance to a local urban legend, The Smiling Man, who’s said to strangle teenage girls he finds crying before fitting them for a grinning paper bag so they’ll have a “smile that will last forever.” This legend was bolstered by a spate of actual murders of high school girls 18 years ago that were never solved. Is this new murder a continuation of the earlier crimes? If so, why was a boy killed instead of a girl? Is it a copycat crime? Or is something altogether different happening? It’s up to you to find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even though it arrives over 35 years after the last original entry in the series, Emio - The Smiling Man sticks closely to retro visual novel conventions, with most of the game consisting of lengthy dialogue exchanges with various witnesses and other NPCs. Players have standard menu options available to them like “ask” and “show,” as well as the ability to “think” to yourself in order to spark a new line of questioning. You’ll also occasionally have to search the area you’re in point-and-click style for clues.</p>
<p>Despite this old-school approach, squeezing responses out of witnesses is often fairly engaging. Thankfully, Emio - The Smiling Man has been given a significantly better localization than either The Missing Heir or The Girl Who Stands Behind, which were often clunky to the point of being hard to follow. There’s no such issue with Emio, and it feels like efforts have been made to have the game’s story-progressing choices follow a more rational path than in the past. One question leads to the next in a logical way, finding new clues in the environment will spark new conversations, etc.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This doesn’t happen all the time, mind you. There are still plenty of moments when progressing in Emio just means exhausting all other options before the game presents a new line of questioning or place to go. Most irritating, there are certain points where it feels like the game is intentionally wasting your time, forcing you to click everything in a scene or jump back and forth between locations multiple times before you’re randomly given a chance to progress. And yeah, this kind of stuff was always a part of old-school visual novels and the simplicity this game means you’ll never get lost for <em>too</em> long, but I would’ve appreciated a better balance between logical and trial-and-error solutions (the split is about 60-40 as is).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, a game like this lives and dies based on the quality of its story, and thankfully, Emio - The Smiling Man delivers on that front. Don’t go in expecting the kind of wild, fourth-wall-breaking decadence of more modern visual novel series like Danganronpa, but Emio does a good job of building a solid, absorbing mystery block by block. All this is brought to life via simple-yet-clean visuals that are a subtle yet notable step up over the Famicom Detective Club remakes. The game even offers up a handful of basic cutscenes that deliver a surprising amount of creepy atmosphere.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/WCCFemiothesmilingmanfamicomdetective6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Emio - The Smiling Man moves at a rather deliberate pace over its 10-hour story, it all builds to a mostly satisfying finale. No, the game’s ending isn’t going to blow your mind with a volley of wild twists and turns, but it delivers the proper tone and largely holds together. If this ending was <em>actually</em> the ending, I would have chalked up Emio as an entertaining, if slightly unremarkable, detective yarn, but Nintendo goes and does something kind of wild after the credits roll.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club – A chat with producer Yoshio Sakamoto" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpFWGeMLhjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Without giving anything away, Emio - The Smiling Man expands upon and reframes much of the story you’ve just been through in a surprising, complex, and decidedly dark epilogue.&nbsp;<span>It’s rare that I’m legitimately shocked by a video game that I ask, “Where the hell did&nbsp;<em>this</em> come from?” aloud while playing, but Emio got me.</span>&nbsp;Granted, some of the shock was due to the fact this was coming from <em>Nintendo</em>, but even without that caveat, this is pretty bold storytelling. Days later, the final hours of Emio - The Smiling Man are still rattling around my head, and if this is the direction Nintendo and Sakamoto want to take the Famicom Detective Club franchise in, I very much hope this isn’t their last case.</p>
<p><em>This review was based on a copy of Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club provided by publisher Nintendo. </em></p>

</div>

<p>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club really sneaks up on you. For much of its runtime the game is a likable, if somewhat by the book, throwback detective visual novel, but Nintendo swings big in terms of narrative in its final hours, ultimately delivering a story that’s much more daring, dark, and affecting than anything this franchise has delivered before. Whether you’re a visual novel nut or just in the mood for a good mystery with some teeth, Emio will leave you grinning.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-protocol-canceled-in-the-west-japanese-service-to-end-in-january.965814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that it's shutting down action RPG&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>'s service in Japan this January, and as a result, the game will also no longer get a Western release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>website, Bandai Namco says it's shutting down&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>on January 18th in Japan, and that the Western release of the game, which was planned to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-amazon-games-explains-changes-you-can-expect-in-west-compared-to-japan">handled by Amazon Games</a>, will no longer go ahead.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco goes on to say that both it and Amazon are "disappointed" they won't be able to release&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>globally, acknowledging that there has been "great anticipation" for the game since it was first revealed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-protocol-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=VbCsvoMf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-protocol-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=SVClLNUn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>isn't coming West anymore.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer goes on to say that its goal with&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>was to create an experience "that is like stepping into the world of anime", and one that allows players to become "the main character of the anime".</p>
<p>However, Bandai Namco says it has "come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you". The studio signs off by apologizing for its "sudden announcement".</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear why Bandai Namco has chosen to shut down&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>, but if it's anything like a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down">other</a> live-service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocket-arena-will-be-officially-shut-down-in-march-2024">games</a> that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-will-shut-down-echoes-of-mana-mobile-game-year-after-release">shut down</a> in recent times, it's likely due to dwindling player numbers or a lack of profitability.</p>
<p><em>Blue Protocol</em>'s shutdown and cancellation could also be part of Bandai Namco's initiative to refocus its development efforts on quality.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-will-refocus-game-development-on-quality-following-declining-financial">February financial report</a>, a then-new online game released by the studio performed below expectations, and while&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>isn't named, it's likely that's the game to which Bandai Namco is referring.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason might be, unfortunately, if you've been hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>in the West sometime this year, you may have to look elsewhere for your anime kicks. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Bandai Namco.</p>

            <p>
Konami has announced the Castlevania Dominus Collection, a re-release of classic games from the series that originally launched on Nintendo DS.
</p>
<p>
As revealed during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-in-todays-nintendo-direct-and-indie-world-showcases">yesterday's Nintendo Direct</a>, the collection features <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-dawn-sorrow">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-portrait-ruin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-order-ecclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a>. In addition, two bonus games are included: Haunted Castle (the arcade version of Castlevania) and Haunted Castle Revisited (a reimagined version).
</p>
<p>
The collection is available now for Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).

<p>
Dawn of Sorrow was the first of these to be released in 2005, its name a nod to the DS console. It continued the same metroidvania design established by Symphony of the Night and continued on Game Boy Advance with Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance, and Aria of Sorrow.
</p>
<p>
Portrait of Ruin followed in 2006, and then Order of Ecclesia in 2008.
</p>
<p>
The collection includes quality of life additions like rewind and quick save, plus buttons and layouts for the original dual screens are fully customisable.
</p>
<p>
A gallery mode and encyclopedia include previously unreleased artwork and an exhaustive compendium of information on each game, while a music player features tracks from each game.
</p>
<p>
This Dominus Collection also follows the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-anniversary-collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>, which includes classics from the series, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/castlevania-advance-collection">Castlevania Advance Collection</a>, which includes the three Game Boy Advance games plus Dracula X.
</p>
<p>
Still, when will we get a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night re-release?
</p>
<p>
The series featured last year in the excellent indie roguelite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-expansion-gets-march-release-date">Dead Cells</a>. Further, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-castlevania-collaboration-adds-dracula-and-trevor-belmont-later-this-month">latest chapter of Dead by Daylight celebrates the Castlevania series</a>.

            <p>Unionised staff at Raven Software have filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board after claims both Activision and Microsoft are stalling over contract negotiations.</p>
<p>The studio, which is known for its work on the Call of Duty series, filed the complaint last Friday. As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-partner-showcase-raven-activision-union?open=false#%C2%A7item-call-of-duty-union-say-activision-is-dragging-its-feet-on-contract-talks">Game File</a>, the complaint alleged "Refusal to Bargain/Bad Faith Bargaining" in relation to ongoing efforts to reach a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>"After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, our members were optimistic that they would progress quickly to a first contract at Raven Software," Communication Workers of America president Claude Cummings Jr. told Game File following the filing. "Unfortunately, that has not happened."</p>

<p>"We encourage Microsoft to address the concerns raised in the Unfair Labor Practice charge and make reaching a fair agreement a priority," Cummings concluded.</p>
<p>While the CWA did not go into detail about the issues raised within the charge, Game File noted other allegations in the public summary include "changes in terms and conditions of employment", as well as "concerted activities (Retaliation, Discharge, Discipline)".</p>
<p>A Microsoft spokesperson further told Game File the company is "committed to negotiating in good faith".</p>
<p>Unionisation efforts within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>'s Raven Software subsidiary started all the way back in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzards-raven-software-announce-intent-to-unionise">January 2022</a>, following strike action that December. This was in reaction to the firing of 12 members of the developer's QA team.</p>
<p>Eventually, in May of that year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzard-studio-raven-software-successfully-vote-to-unionise">the vote to unionise was won</a>, despite Activision Blizzard's ongoing anti-unionisation efforts, which included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-sent-anti-union-emails-ahead-of-pivotal-raven-software-vote">sending emails asking recipients to "please vote no"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-retro-range-launched/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GameStop has announced the launch of ‘GameStop Retro’, revealing that locations around North America will start selling retro titles from the last forty years of gaming history. The retailer confirmed that the likes of the Game Boy, Wii, PS3, and Dreamcast will be represented by GameStop Retro, but fans have been quick to cast shade at the announcement.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gouged-to-the-max">Gouged To The Max</h2>



<p>GameStop has just revealed that <strong>some stores </strong>will start selling retro titles once again, but not everyone is pleased about it.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>On social media, some users were quick to stress the price gouging that’s prevalent in the retro gaming community, suggesting that GameStop will be no stranger to this practice. Further, some posters published pictures of GameStop stores selling retro software, highlighting how ‘weak’ the stock was. It was said by some that it’s just a bid to push outdated stock at ‘extortionate’ prices.</p>



<p>In the image posted by GameStop, it was revealed that the following platforms will be supported by the new Retro offering:</p>



<ul>
<li>NES</li>



<li>SNES</li>



<li>Game Boy</li>



<li>GBA</li>



<li>N64</li>



<li>DS</li>



<li>Wii</li>



<li>Wii U</li>



<li>GameCube</li>



<li>Xbox</li>



<li>Xbox 360</li>



<li>PlayStation</li>



<li>PS2</li>



<li>PS3</li>



<li>Dreamcast</li>



<li>Sega Genesis</li>



<li>Sega Saturn</li>



<li>PS Vita</li>



<li>PS3</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s assumed that other platforms that aren’t mentioned will also find a spot in GameStop Retro, such as the PlayStation Portable.</p>



<p>Retro gaming is a huge and lucrative market, and with all the remasters coming back into fashion, gamers have no end to the number of nostalgic experiences they can enjoy. GameStop returning to the sale of Retro software isn’t a massive leap and it might just be a bid to clear out old stock, but it’s a nice bonus for shoppers with a taste for days gone by.</p>

            <p>A number of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-early-access">Star Wars Outlaws</a> players have been advised to restart their game with a new save file to avoid problems with progression.</p>
<p>Ubisoft last night emailed some PlayStation 5 players asking them to update their copy of Outlaws to the latest version, following a chunky bug-busting patch.</p>
<p>"To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game," Ubisoft's email reads. "As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after this recent patch. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused."</p>

<p>Ubisoft asked those affected players to "start a new save to fully enjoy Star Wars Outlaws as our team intended". It noted that if players continue to play on an earlier save file, they will "unfortunately face issues and progression blockers".</p>
<p>Our friends over at Digital Foundry received the above email. Tom Morgan informed me when he captured footage for Star Wars Outlaws a few days ago, his PS5 was on version 1.000.002. On Xbox Series X/S, meanwhile, he was on version 1.0.0.3 (see below).</p>
<p>Please note, this email has not been sent out to all Star Wars Outlaws players - our Guides team and Eurogamer's deputy editor Chris did not recieve it.</p>

<p>This news from Ubisoft has caused some discontent among Star Wars Outlaws players who had paid more to gain early access via the Gold and Ultimate editions of the game.</p>
<p>"I just got this email this morning, wish I knew that [before] I played 5 hours last night. Honestly this game is testing my patience," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1f2qpau/comment/lk89kra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">complained</a> one such player over on Reddit. "I'm disgusted. Paid $110 and played all night, 12 hour stretch," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1f2qnbd/comment/lk8dz37/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another. "This is how Ubi thanks us??"</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Ubisoft for further comment.</p>

<p>Due to a day one patch, Ubisoft has asked all Star Wars Outlaws Early Access players to start with new saves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws Early Access has kicked off, with Gold and Ultimate Edition players enjoying three days of early gaming in Ubisoft’s new <a href="https://youtu.be/Nk86fu2BP9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">open-world</a> title. However, the progress made during this time could be wasted, as the developers have asked players to update the game with the day one patch and start fresh with a new save.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the new patch dropped, Star Wars Outlaws Gold and Ultimate Edition players on the PS5 were sent an email stating that the best way to experience the Outer Rim was to play the “latest version.” The developers added that players on the previous version of the game might be experiencing some issues due to the newest patch.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hence, they asked the early access Star Wars Outlaws players to update to version 1.000.002 and start with a new save “to fully enjoy” the game. Also, the developers have warned that if players continue to play on the prior save, they “will unfortunately face issues and progression blockers”. </p>



<p>Therefore, the players have to let go of all their progress until now and start again, or else they could face even more significant problems later in the game.&nbsp;However, this could be cumbersome for players as many might have already invested hours in the game. </p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone wants to do a crossover with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, he wants to see Pam - the farming sim's alcohol-drinking bus driver - in the online shooter, though he's "open to anything".
</p>
<p>
Barone discussed the crossover in a Discord conversation shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Panedwards, where he was asked "would you be willing to ever do a Fortnite crossover?"
</p>

<p>
He replied: "Yeah I've been trying to. I want Pam in Fortnite. I'm open to doing a collab.
</p>
<p>
"It doesn't have to be Pam though I would be open to anything, Abigail and Sebastian could be good. Stardrop or Joja Cola item? Galaxy Sword or slingshot?"

<p>
Pam driving the Battle Bus sounds like a good - but also bad - idea, depending on the amount of mead she's been gifted.
</p>
<p>
Yet the Galaxy Sword or slingshot could certainly work easily enough, as would items like Stardrops and Joja Cola.
</p>
<p>
Who would you like to see in a possible crossover?
</p>
<p>
Last month, Barone commented that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-will-never-charge-money-for-dlc-or-updates">he would never charge money for DLC or updates</a> "for as long as I live".

</p>
<p>
That wouldn't necessarily fit with the thousands of paid cosmetics available in Fortnite, but the shooter would certainly provide another outlet.

            <p>
Bandai Namco will shut down the servers of its anime MMORPG Blue Protocol in Japan and has cancelled its release in the West.
</p>
<p>
Blue Protocol was released in Japan in June 2023, with the forthcoming western release managed by Amazon Games.
</p>
<p>
However, in a new statement from the <a href="https://www.playblueprotocol.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-blue-protocol">developers on the game's website</a>, the "difficult decision" has been made to end service as "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".

<p>

"We know this is disappointing news, and we share your disappointment. We love the world and characters of Blue Protocol, and we were excited to welcome players around the world into Regnas. We join Bandai Namco Online in expressing deep gratitude to the passionate fans who followed Blue Protocol development and participated in the Closed Technical Test."
</p>
<p>

Further, a <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507">statement from Bandai Namco</a> reads: "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.
</p>
<p>
"We know there has been great anticipation for Blue Protocol since the first announcement of the game. We wanted to deliver an experience that is like stepping into the world of anime, and we have been challenging ourselves to create a world where each and every player can enjoy adventures as the main character of the anime. We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply apologise for the sudden announcement."
</p>
<p>
The Japanese servers will remain online until Saturday 18th January 2025.
</p>
<p>
I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol last year</a>, which was set to follow the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO. However, I had concerns of whether the game could differentiate itself from its key competitors.

</p>
<p>
The game didn't receive a particularly positive response from Japanese players, but it's a shame the game has been cancelled before it really got started with a global audience.

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that they are shutting down their online action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> in Japan, and cancelling their plans to release the game in the West in collaboration with Amazon Games.</p>
<p>The Japanese version of Blue Protocol will shut down on 18th January 2025.</p>


<p>On the West-facing site for the game, the team behind it said, “<span>We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of BLUE PROTOCOL, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.”</span></p>
<p>Bandai Namco’s more general statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>We regret to inform you that the Japanese version of Blue Protocol will be discontinued on Saturday January 18, 2025.</p>
<p>As a result, we have also canceled our plans to release a Western version of the game in collaboration with Amazon Games. We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world.</p>
<p>We know there has been great anticipation for Blue Protocol since the first announcement of the game. We wanted to deliver an experience that is like stepping into the world of anime, and we have been challenging ourselves to create a world where each and every player can enjoy adventures as the main character of the anime. We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for the sudden announcement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blue Protocol took an intriguing approach to the MMORPG, featuring a classless character system that would allow a great deal of flexibility for setting your own role within a player group, and a fun anime-styled world that quickly grabbed 600,000 players shortly after the game’s launch in Japan.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco partnered with Amazon Games to bring the game to the West, entering into a degree of co-development that sought to tailor the game through Amazon’s more Western perspective. The game had targeted a 2024 release round these parts, but never got the chance, as Bandai Namco has now pulled the plug on the project as a whole.</p>
