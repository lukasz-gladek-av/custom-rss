			<p>Earlier this week, the development team behind the free-to-play third-person looter shooter game The First Descendant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNh7vwqYdvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared in an official livestream</a> to outline the December update and the roadmap for the first half of next year.</p>



<p>The December update adds the new Descendant Ultimate Yujin, who's revealed through Yujin's Descendant Story. Ultimate Yujin features a hybrid playstyle with two Ultimate Skill Modules: </p>



<ul>
<li>Combat Protocol, which introduces a new combat-focused playstyle that lets him sustain his HP while dealing damage.</li>



<li>Battlefield Medic, which offers a support-oriented style that grows stronger the more he assists his allies.</li>
</ul>



<p>Players can also explore the new Forbidden Sanctuary dungeon, an experimental facility in Axion that supports multiplayer co-op and features a challenging new boss. The Forbidden Sanctuary offers key rewards for acquiring Ultimate Yujin.</p>



<p>The December update will also introduce The Grim Reaper, a new Abyss Colossus and a mutated form of Death Stalker, which offers a poison-based challenge that requires The First Descendant players to master its mechanics through careful strategy and timing.</p>



<p>Some Descendants, including Ajax, Freyna, Valby, and Viessa, along with select weapons, will also receive balance adjustments to enhance playstyles and skill performance. Moreover, a new Bunny-exclusive External Component, Sprint Accelerator, will be added, and players will be able to trade Ancestors Modules via the Trade Market.</p>

<p>When it comes to next year's roadmap, the developers have decided to delay the debut of Season 4 from early 2026 to Summer so that they can perform an overhaul of the core experience and systems. The goal is to provide players with a clearer loop: set a goal, farm and experiment with builds, and then tackle structured endgame, especially on “Hard” and above difficulties. In the meantime, Season 3 will continue with Episodes 3 and 4. Even Episode 2 will get something in January with the addition of Breach Tracking, a gold‑oriented farming activity where fields and missions are selected at random and can also drop items like superconductive cooling units.</p>



<p>Season 3 Episode 3 will go live in February 2026, introducing the beta version of the new Onslaught Mode to The First Descendant. This is a four‑player endgame mode where parties of four players face waves of increasingly powerful enemies, strategically placing turrets and buffs using resources gained during battle. The full version is planned to go live with the May update.</p>



<p>Episode 3 also introduces regular Descendant Dia with a main story centered on her, while Episode 4 adds one new Ultimate Descendant. Late during Episode 4, the developers will revamp Hard-mode Void Intercept Battles, turning this activity into a multi‑tier endgame pillar; until the new variant arrives, deep‑Void bosses will rotate monthly so older skins, cosmetics, and previously unobtainable deep‑Void Descendant skins can be farmed again.</p>



<p>Farming at Hard difficulty and above will be restructured around an Operation Command/Directive system, where players first choose the item they want to farm and then clear assigned missions for rewards, with the entire high‑level farming experience being rebuilt.</p>



<p>The Arche Tuning/Mutant Cell system is also being redesigned from fragmented A/B/C item drops into selectable nodes, making it easier to understand what benefits a Descendant and where to get it. Moreover, Stat display will be overhauled so final damage and contributions from modules, reactions, tuning, and externals can be viewed and “simulated” in one menu, reducing reliance on the lab for testing.</p>



<p>Finally, the team revealed that Season 4, currently scheduled to hit live servers in Summer 2026, brings Karel's final battle arc plus a large‑scale Mega Dungeon that surpasses current infiltration operations and Void Vessels in scope and spectacle, alongside a complete weapon system overhaul and the introduction of Transcendent‑tier weapons with a more farming‑centric, less grindy progression model.</p>



<p>The First Descendant <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in July 2024</a> and immediately garnered the attention of many players who were looking for an alternative to existing looter shooters, such as Destiny 2 or The Division 2. NEXON soon boasted that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-celebrates-10m-players-in-first-week-responds-to-allegations-of-copying-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been played by ten million users just in its launch week</a>, although it didn't take long for it to start losing steam, which is why the studio is now trying to overhaul the game's foundation.</p>



<p>On a technical level, the game was pretty advanced. It was the first title to integrate Samsung's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+ Gaming feature</a>, and it was also the first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-is-the-first-ps5-pro-game-to-combine-pssr-with-amd-fsr-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution alongside AMD's FSR Frame Generation on the PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a> over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">Light of Motiram</a>, a game that the former alleges is a "slavish clone" of the Horizon franchise. Now, the two sides have apparently struck a temporary deal ahead of an important court hearing that may determine whether the case goes forward.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, a new filing in court acknowledges that Sony and Tencent have been "engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute." Most notably, Tencent asked for more time to respond to the motion for an injunction, and Sony agreed in exchange for certain concessions. The terms call for Tencent to pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram while also agreeing not to argue in court that Sony delayed its request for emergency relief by granting the extension.</p><p>The filing also notes an agreement between the two sides that Tencent won't ask for expedited discovery in connection with the preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram. It also calls for Tencent to hold the game to its Q4 2027 release window rather than moving it up. Finally, the court document revealed another area where Tencent and Sony see eye-to-eye. The two sides jointly requested that a hearing for Tencent's motion to dismiss and a second hearing held for Sony's injunction request be held on the same day: January 29, 2026.</p><p>At the heart of Sony's case is an accusation that Tencent intentionally tried to confuse players by passing Light of Motiram off as a Horizon-related game. Prior to the legal fireworks, Tencent apparently pitched Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-pitched-sony-on-a-horizon-game-set-in-asia/1100-6533509/" data-ref-id="1100-6533509">a Horizon game that was set in Asia</a>, which was ultimately turned down. Once the lawsuit was filed, Tencent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-accused-of-copying-horizon-gets-radically-updated-steam-page/1100-6533796/" data-ref-id="1100-6533796">pulled the Horizon-like imagery</a> from the game's Steam page. In court, Tencent claimed that Sony's lawsuit was an attempt to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-attacks-sony-lawsuit-over-game-accused-of-copying-horizon/1100-6534865/" data-ref-id="1100-6534865">get a monopoly on games similar to Horizon</a>.</p><p>Tencent also argued that it wasn't liable for any damages because any previous discussions about a Horizon game or even the development of Light of Motiram were done by subsidies owned or partially owned by Tencent. In response, Sony accused Tencent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-accuses-tencent-of-playing-a-shell-game-to-avoid-liability-in-horizon-lawsuit/1100-6535487/" data-ref-id="1100-6535487">playing a legal shell game</a> to avoid the repercussions of infringing on its intellectual property.</p><p>As these legal maneuvers played out, Sony and NCSoft announced a new MMORPG called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-steel-frontiers/" data-ref-id="5000-702414">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, which will be coming to mobile platforms and PC. However, it's rumored that Sony is planning its own Horizon MMORPG for PS5.</p>

                <p>Stranger Things returned for Season 5 Vol. 1 last month, and the series is taking one last bow in the '80s before concluding later in December. Usually, the show is pretty sharp about not making major mistakes in the time period or anachronisms that shouldn't be there. But this time, the show made an apparent goof with an old-school Nintendo game.</p><p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/random-did-you-spot-this-nes-related-blunder-in-stranger-things-season-5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Hawkins' latest home-grown bully, Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly), was playing the notoriously difficult <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghosts-n-goblins/" data-ref-id="5000-9758">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a> on his NES. However, the version of the game playing on the screen was actually the original arcade game that was released by Capcom in 1985.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/myretrolifeshow/status/1994560916118278169" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I love Stranger Things, but Season 5 just committed a cardinal sin. They show a kid playing ‘Nintendo’ in his room… but the TV is clearly running the arcade version of Ghosts ’n Goblins, NOT the NES port.

That said, it's also possible that this isn't a mistake and the arcade version of Ghosts 'n Goblins was used on-screen because it's simply a better looking version of the game.</p><p>To demonstrate, this is what the NES port looks like:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7CdqiHHPpQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P7CdqiHHPpQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The original Nintendo was a good home console for its era, but it couldn't make the game look as good as it did in the arcade. This version also had better music and sound effects.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqMlLueMpew" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dqMlLueMpew" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When it comes to goofs, this isn't quite on the same level as <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-thrones-viewers-spot-starbucks-cup-episode-1207606/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the coffee cup that was left on set in Game of Thrones Season 8</a> or HBO Max's <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/mad-men-hbo-max-4k-stream-roger-sterling-barf-tube-errors-1236439517/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent mix-up with Mad Men</a> which featured shots that included crew members who were supposed to be hidden.

<p>This new entry in the series, which sees you not only becoming the hero but also rebuilding your home, has received <strong>8/9/9/8</strong> from the four Famitsu critics, giving it a total of <strong>34/40</strong>. In the same week, this puts it two points ahead of Famitsu's score for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (sitting on 32/40) and two points <em>behind</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which leads with a score of 36/40.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> games on Switch, the first and second games both received scores of 36/40.</p>

<figure data-uuid="3b48478afafae"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b48478afafae/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've finally made it, folks! This week marks the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. After years of development, delays, and even a restart, Samus Aran's next 3D outing is officially here for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The critic reviews have also gone live ahead of the big release, and admittedly, the aggregate score has got a lot of people talking online. Prime 4 is currently sitting on 81/100 based on 74 critic reviews. At the time of writing, it's got the same "top critic" score on OpenCritic.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194688 @ 1764752827 -->
<p>This score technically makes Metroid Prime 4 the lowest-rated "mainline" Metroid Prime release on Metacritic. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-remastered">Switch remaster</a> of Retro Studios' first game received an aggregate score of 94/100 when it was released in 2023, and every other "major" entry in the Prime series has received a score of 90 or more.</p>
<p>As harsh as all of this may sound, it's still <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">an "excellent" adventure in our books</a>, and we're not alone here – with some sites even awarding it a perfect score. Of course, these scores are focused on the Switch 2 version of the game. As you might have seen, we're currently working on getting our Switch review out the door as soon as possible. So be on the lookout for that!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194682 @ 1764752827 -->
<p>So, with the scores and lengthy wait time for this anticipated release in mind, we want to know if you will still be getting Metroid Prime 4: Beyond this week? Has anything in the lead up to this big release swayed your decision, or will you still be diving in day one? <em>Vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-preview-and-impressions/</link>
            <guid>1371190</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is taking a major step forward as it ages into the back half of the decade <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-gameplay-trailer/">with the release of its expansion, War Sails</a>. The action strategy game is finally adding naval combat in this expansion, and ahead of its release, I got to spend some time hearing about it from developer TaleWorlds Entertainment.</p>



<p>I also got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-qa-interview-with-taleworlds-entertainment/">speak with a couple members of the development team, senior producer Falk Engel and design lead Gökçen Karaağaç</a>, all about this expansion and how it changes Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II, and why TaleWorlds Entertainment is calling this its "<em>biggest expansion ever</em>."</p>



<p>I want to start by saying I'm very new to strategy games. I've previously avoided them because whenever I saw gameplay clips, no matter which specific strategy game it was, it all seemed like it moved too slowly for me. I was also concerned with not being able to really grasp the mechanics, and was overall concerned that I would just not be very good at the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Screenshot_03-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But at the same time, I also knew these concerns were holding me back from an entire genre of video games I knew I might seriously enjoy, particularly when it comes to the strategy games that integrate historical elements into their gameplay. Wanting and willing to finally overcome those concerns is what drove me to Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails, and after spending some time with the game, I can confidently say: I was right to be concerned, I am not very good at these games.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I was also wrong to be concerned, because I'm still having a great time. It helps that this feels like a fresh start, not just for me, but for Bannerlord as well. With the release of War Sails, old saves are getting wiped, and it's a fresh new Caladria to explore on land and on sea.</p>



<p>"<em>Mount and Blade has always been about freedom, it's meant to be a blank slate for you to write your own stories</em>," as TaleWorlds Entertainment's Antonio Santo said in the opening to the studio's presentation ahead of release. You can't get more 'blank slate' than new saves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Gameplay_Screenshot_03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels understandable, then, that the cost of this expansion, which is $24.99 USD at regular price (currently $22.49 with its introductory 10% off sale), is half the price of the base game (when the base game isn't on sale like it is right now for half-price, which means with the base game at $24.99 and War Sails at $22.49, you get both for the price of Bannerlord not on sale). </p>



<p>I won't be going into detail about the War Sails storyline, purely to avoid spoilers and also because I'm not through all of it. What I can say is that while it does take a bit to get going since you need to scale your naval capabilities and party size to really get a feel for it, I now can't imagine playing Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord without War Sails and without naval combat. In a lot of ways, it really does feel like a whole new arm of the game has been added, and can now be improved upon.</p>



<p>Which is to say, there's incredible potential here, and while War Sails perhaps doesn't deliver on everything you'd want right away with the addition of naval combat, it sets a strong foundation for what could be next.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Screenshot_01-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For one thing, the sailing is wonderfully intricate and fun to try to master. Mastering maneuverability with your own ship, and especially with a whole fleet of ships, creates an incredible spectacle in naval battles. Even if most of my battles did devolve into smash-and-board skirmishes mostly, the wonderful backdrops and learning how to navigate the conditions, paired with a strong soundtrack, strike at the core of what Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord does best.</p>



<p>And the battles where I employed more strategy than just a head-on assault were all the more rewarding because of how challenging it was to work against the wind and stormy conditions. Large-scale battles are where Mount and Blade is at its best, and that's true for its land battles, and now, naval battles.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Gameplay_Screenshot_01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, combat isn't the only area of Mount and Blade that was changed with the addition of naval combat. In his presentation about War Sails, senior producer Falk Engel said, "<em>Even before the full release of the main title, we started receiving many community requests for a naval</em> <em>expansion. By the time we had finished our work on the core game, it was clear that this type of content would be one of the best additions that we could make. Why? Because the addition of the naval dimension allows us to build upon the wide range of gameplay and content, without taking from what people already know and love</em>."</p>



<p>Which is exactly what TaleWorlds Entertainment did, as the naval expansion not only introduced naval combat, but also changes to the game's economy, to trading, to the balance of importance between cities. Coastal cities like Chaikand are now even more important as a hub for trade. You even get a new port area you can walk around that's tuned to each nation.</p>



<p>Speaking of nations, War Sails also brings the Nords back into the equation, an inclusion that design lead Gökçen Karaağaç told me was introduced partly for nostalgia, partly because they were "<em>easy to justify"</em> introducing. "<em>Oh, they were always up there, and now they've started to pick up their ships and come here</em>," he said in our interview.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Nords_Screenshot_no_logo_01-2-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Nords, an entire new area to explore, new campaigns, and an entire new frontier of combat are altogether a sizeable addition to Mount and Blade, though they're by no means perfect. Even with TaleWorlds Entertainment putting out several patches since launch, the odd bug feels bound to happen. Thankfully, it's not been anything too severe, like issues with the game crashing on me consistently; it's been more firmly in the funny, sometimes ruinous, freezes and hitches that, as I said, aren't too bad, but are consistent enough that I expect them.</p>



<p>Of course, they hurt far more when you are, as I did, going against the advice Karaağaç provided, which was "<em>do not sail a ship that you can't afford to lose</em>." The stakes are already high enough with how much it means to lose a ship, or multiple ships, in a battle, and especially because most engagements, once you've boarded an enemy ship, can result in unwinnable situations if you're not careful with how you move across the deck of your ship. Losing your ship and the battle because of an untimely freeze doesn't feel great, no matter how you slice it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount-Blade-II-Bannerlord-Screenshot-2025.12.03-00.21.08.001.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But bugs can be patched, and at least in this case, they don't ruin the entire experience. War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers. Hopefully, now, it won't be another five years before the next major expansion.</p>

<figure data-uuid="53de7ecbc26e6"><a title="Starsand Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53de7ecbc26e6/starsand-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Seed Lab</em></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese dev Seed Lab has officially announced that its upcoming cosy life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starsand_island">Starsand Island</a>, is getting a Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release when it launches next year.</p>
<p>Scheduled for release in the nebulous "early 2026" and coming to all the usual platforms, that list also now includes Nintendo's latest console, where the devs will be offering two modes depending on your preference: Quality Mode, "targeting 45FPS in 1080p", and Performance Mode, delivering "60FPS in 1080p" in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will also support mouse controls and GameChat during online multiplayer. You can check out the reveal trailer below if this one's passed you by thus far.</p>
<p>Now, it has to be said that we're hardly lacking for great <del>roguelike deckbuilders</del> <del>Metroidvanias</del> cosy life sims on Switch, but last year <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsandisland/starsand-island">a successful Kickstarter campaign</a> amassed over $300,000 for this one, so there's clearly an appetite for more chilled vibes and harvesting on a handheld hybrid near you.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo is bringing its island-based slow-life hit <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - NS2 Edition</a> to Switch 2 in January, so Starsand might want to avoid that <em>particular</em> part of 'early 2026'. (Then again, is there anyone reading this who doesn't already own New Horizons?)</p>
<p>If you're after an overview and the vibes aren't strong enough on their own, our friends over at Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/starsand-island-is-a-cosy-ps5-rpg-straight-out-of-a-studio-ghibli-daydream">recently previewed the game</a>:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193292 @ 1764750791 -->
<blockquote>
<p>"What really sets Starsand Island apart from the likes of, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, for example, is its complex build system. It functions much closer to games like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/sims_4">The Sims</a> and allows you to completely change the size and shape of buildings by adding and moving walls, doors, windows, and roofs as well as all the usual interior decorations."</p>

<p>Following an update for NieR:Automata</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="61e87ca746c94"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61e87ca746c94/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After ongoing requests from players, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nierautomata-finally-lands-switch-2-compatibility-update">got a compatibility update</a> for the Switch 2 in November. With this game now functioning as it should on Nintendo's new hardware, another Square Enix title has now received a compatibility update.</p>
<p>This time it's for the role-playing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a>, which was originally released on the Switch eShop in 2022. While it might not be the <em>best</em> remaster in Square Enix's library, there are still fans out there who have been wanting to experience this title on the Switch 2 without any problems.</p>
<p>The good news is the issues associated with this game on Nintendo's hybrid system have now apparently been resolved. Since the arrival of the Switch 2, there were some start up issues, and while these didn't appear to be a massive problem for a lot of players, there were also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1l7dtsz/comment/n0i7402/?share_id=l1E6CBXyyz7XxS7LSjCtZ&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">some graphical glitches reported</a>.</p>
<p>While nothing is specifically mentioned on Nintendo's compatibility search page, as of 2nd December 2025, the game is now "supported" and the "game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch" on the Switch 2. The notes attached to this mention how the "previously identified issues have been resolved with an update".</p>
<figure data-uuid="a2baf6b5624a0"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2baf6b5624a0/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows a handful of compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. Apart from NieR, several other titles received compatibility updates including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>. If you haven't already played the Radical Dreamers Edition of Chrono Cross, we said it was the "best and most convenient way" to relive this classic, despite its shortcomings in the remaster department.</p>

Fans of lo-fi indie horror games will also want to check out Faith, whil anyone who misses bygone gaming eras will want to check out the retro-inspired RPG 8-Bit Adventures 2--which evokes console-style RPGs of the NES, SNES, and PS1--and the adventure-platformer Lunark, which takes inspiration from classics like Out of this World and Flashback.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-map-swamp-field-bosses-2000649718</link>
            <guid>1371088</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m one of the many <a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreigns-bell-bearing-carion-draconic-tree-sentinel-2000649218"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> players</a> who’s been begging for DLC for months.<a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"> Once it was finally revealed</a>, I was a bit disappointed at how small it seemed. Fortunately, three new pieces of information have convinced me that I have been underestimating FromSoftware’s upcoming <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC. According to a new interview, it’ll be harder than the main game, feature a bigger reworking of the map than previously thought, and include the introduction of the <em>Dark Souls</em> studio’s signature poison swamps.</p> <p>Since the summer, it’s felt like the only way to really revitalize <em>Nightreign</em> was by <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">giving players a new map</a>. When <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> was finally announced, publisher Bandai Namco’s description suggested the Limveld sandbox everyone had become accustomed to would be tweaked but left pretty much intact by the new content. According to a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">preview at <em>GameSpot</em></a>, Bandai Namco actually undersold their new content. The new Scholar and Undertaker classes aren’t the only big additions. There’s also the Great Hollows, which is technically still a Shifting Earth event, but is also a much more expansive one than players have previously encountered.</p>

 <p>Players will glide into a separate section of the map with its own fields, city ruins, and sprawling mines. There will even be side-quests where players have to visit side-objectives to alleviate a special new curse. The Great Hollows will apparently be much more vertically focused as well, with caves and tunnels and also points higher up that require light platforming. It definitely sounds like a bigger deal than any of the existing Shifting Earth events players usually just spend the last five minutes of a run zooming through.</p>

 <h2>No new map, but the next best thing</h2> <p>Also, there are swamps now. Not just in the Great Hollows, but the whole of Limveld. These new areas will slow movement and build up poison, scarlet rot, frenzy, and other ailments if you stay in them too long. It sounds simple, but <em>Nightreign</em> is all about navigation, time management, and risk assessment. I can already see many runs succeeding or failing based on players getting too greedy or overly cautious when it comes to traversing these new hazards.</p>

 <p>Director Junya Ishizaki told <em>GameSpot</em> he’s aware of the poison swamp meme, and while there’s no strict rule about every FromSoftware game needing a swamp, it just “always seems to be [that before you realize] someone’s come up with the idea, it’s already sort of in there, and it’s just sort of taken a life of its own.”</p>

 <p>All of these new elements, including new field bosses and some re-worked points of interest, seem aimed at giving seasoned Nightfarers the feeling of playing the game for the first time again, back when they were utterly confused by its mechanics and constantly getting punished for it. This is exactly what fans have been waiting for.</p>

 <h2>Hard enough to feel like you’re playing <em>Nightreign</em> for the first time again</h2> <p>“Obviously, we don’t want it to be so hard that new players can’t get into it, but I think the original idea is that when the game initially had come out, there were even players who are veterans of some of the other games trying to figure out the new systems, trying to figure out how the game works,” Ishizaki said. “I think [we want our] ideas when we’re working on the DLC content to be a reflection of that.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they’ll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played <em>Nightreign</em>, where there’s still a bit that they’re trying to figure out. [The Forsaken Hollows is] definitely a little bit harder, but it’s not ridiculous or anything like that, but that’s still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge.”</p> <p>I hope he’s lying and players get absolutely wrecked. Like <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-libra-summons-everdark-tips-2000617780">Everdark Sovereign Equilibrious Beast</a> except fun.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov is the most popular extraction shooter in the world, boasting hundreds of thousands of active players. It’s a game centered around <strong>loot</strong>, and sometimes, you might need help securing that loot. That’s where Battlestate Games comes in, regularly publishing Escape from Tarkov codes that you can use to get free items.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has a habit of publishing Escape from Tarkov codes that expire quite quickly, with some only being available for 24 hours.

The patch notes for Burning Springs also highlight new Bounty features, more wildlife, and the introduction of The Ghoul character from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGPRrcnJ5Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9bGPRrcnJ5Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Although Fallout 76's main setting is the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Appalachia, players can now explore a brand-new bordering area with a setting in rural Ohio. Burning Springs is described as a region of southeastern Ohio affected by nuclear destruction and environmental poisoning from a chemical plant. This map expansion offers players a new questline that features a Super Mutant known as the Rust King.</p><p dir="ltr">Highway Town is a main point-of-interest for the new region, and it serves as a social hub for some of the game's new characters. A notable location to visit is the town's Last Resort saloon, which is where players can meet Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul, from the TV series.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new features for the Burning Springs update is Bounty Hunting events. Players can collect "Grunt Hunt" bounties while in town, and these mark mutated targets to take down. There are also more challenging "Head Hunt" bounties, and these contracts offer unique rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Burning Springs adds new wildlife to the game. Players can add a new creature, the Radhog, as a Camp pet. The water sources in the region introduce new fish types to fish out and collect as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there are new Legendary mods, more public events, new items to craft, and other content available with the Burning Springs update.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for the December 2 Burning Springs update can be found below, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2tpInvSHR0w7C8GXqEEbrz/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Bethesda Studios</a>.</p><h2>Fallout 76: Burning Springs Release Notes</h2><h3>Update Highlights</h3><ul><li>Bounty Hunting – Grab your duster, cowboy hat, and your favorite weapon because it’s time for some Bounty Hunting!</li><li>Explore Burning Springs – Cross Point Pleasant Bridge to enter a new land of rust and blood.

A major new piece of content here to give you the opportunity to find and eliminate some of the area’s largest threats.</p><p>We’re extremely excited to share that The Ghoul from the Fallout TV Show on Amazon Prime will be joining us in Burning Springs! Voiced by Walton Goggins himself, The Ghoul will be your guide in all things Bounty Hunting.</p><p>The main questline for Burning Springs is just the start of your story in this new region. Planned as the beginning chapter for a story that spans multiple updates, this quest works as an introduction to characters that you’ll end up spending more time with down the line.</p><p>With a new questline for you to complete, two new public events, the introduction of Bounty Hunting, plus a load of additional content (including new fish and a local legend to catch), Burning Springs is our largest update since Wastelanders back in 2020.</p><h3>Welcome to Ohio</h3><p>Burning Springs, a region of southeastern Ohio rocked not only by the nuclear destruction of the bombs dropping, but also the environmental poisoning from the local Abraxodyne Chemical plant. The area is now a desolate and barren wasteland with poisonous water, and a dust storm coating everything in a toxin known as Rust.</p><p>Who would ever want to call this land home? The Rust King is who would.</p><p>A Super Mutant with just as much brains as brawn, The Rust king is the unrelenting and unforgiving ruler of Burning Springs. He has twisted the land into his cruel kingdom, where the only rule is "might makes right."</p><p>Players will cross paths with this monstrous monarch during the new questline. He will task the player with proving their worth and braving the wilds of his wasteland.</p><p>While barren, Burning Springs still holds pockets of life. Highway Town serves as a pit stop for the last of humanity. Built on a section of elevated highway, players will be able to rest and resupply here.</p><p>Highway Town serves as the region's new social hub and a last resort for survivors-- speaking of which, The Last Resort saloon at the end of town also serves up Bounty Hunt contracts.</p><p>Once you unlock the location, you'll be able to fast travel directly to the saloon for maximum Bounty Hunt efficiency!</p><p>You can wander into Burning Springs by crossing the bridge in Point Pleasant. The questline can be started by tuning into the Ohio Distress Signal once they've reached level 30."</p><h3>Bounty Hunting</h3><p>Mosey down to the Last Resort saloon in Highway Town if you're looking to put your gun to work. The Ghoul has set up shop there, providing piles of bounties to plunder.</p><p>To start a Grunt Hunt, just pick up one of the posters off the table. There's plenty to go around, so you can repeat this activity to your heart's content.</p><p>Each time you start a Grunt Hunt, a random location in Burning Springs will be chosen, and a mutation will be applied to your target. Watch out, though, because these mutations are contagious: enemies near your target will also benefit from the effects of the mutation!</p><p>Plan accordingly to take out your target without getting overwhelmed. Adjust your build to counteract their mutation or just go for the classic stealth approach.</p><p>If you're lucky, a Grunt Hunt target might drop a premium Bounty Poster. These will allow you to start a Head Hunt-- an extra challenging bounty hunt in the form of a public event! (Note: these are granted through the Quest Rewards and not found on the body itself.)</p><p>Just place your poster on the bounty board outside of the saloon to send the word wide. All players on the server will be alerted to show up to your aid when you do. Only one Head Hunt can be active at a time, though, so be sure to join in any actives ones before trying to start your own.</p><p>There's dozens of unique Head Hunt targets across a handful of locations. Each has a unique loadout and posse protecting them-- some with pretty wild and weird skills, too!</p><p>If you've got an itchy trigger finger, and caps to spare, The Ghoul would be more than happy to part with a premium poster… for the right price.</p><p>Players will be able to track which Head Hunts they've completed from their Challenges and earn a variety of unique rewards for doing so.</p><p>Speaking of loot, Bounty Hunting is primed to be the premiere path for Legendary Item hunters. Grunt Hunt targets will initially appear as 1-star Legendary enemies. As you complete more, they will eventually make their way toward 2 and 3-star!</p><p>Head Hunt targets will always appear as 3-star legendaries and are flanked by a pair of 2-star posse members.</p><p>But, most importantly, Head Hunts have a chance to drop items with NEW 1-, 2-, and 3-star Legendary effects.

Your job is to head over to the Junkyard and help The Beastmaster gather the scrap metal needed to armor up her latest tamed Deathclaw.</p><p>During this public event, you'll fight alongside your Deathclaw-in-training against the wastelands wildest foes. Just be sure to keep the beast alive! It can't die a glorious death in the arena if doesn't survive the junkyard first…</p><p>Remember: you can heal friendly NPCs using the Medic's Legendary Mod. Don't have one? Well luckily a new unique named weapon, the Stimpike, comes with this pre-installed! You'll have a chance to earn it-- alongside many other rewards-- by completing this event.</p><p>Sinkhole Solutions</p><p>Fires rage beneath the surface of Burning Springs and natural gas deposits occasionally breach the surface near places where the ground has broken.</p><p>Willow, a resident of Highway Town, needs your help culling Radscorpions and Stingwings that have gathered around a highly volatile sinkhole. These creatures are causing issues for the residents of Highway Town so you’ll need to head over to the aptly named Scorpion Lake to activate a “stomper” device to draw them out of their dens.</p><p>Your objective will be to destroy their dens, all while dodging pillars of fire and navigating a blinding sandstorm.</p><p>Also, stick around to the end to learn why Radscorpions aren't an apex predator…</p><h3>Additional Content</h3><p>More Fish</p><p>Assuming you can even find them, the watering holes around Burning Springs are poisonous and irradiated, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t new fish to catch. Explore this new zone and find new fish (including a Local Legend) to add to your collections.</p><p>Side Quest: Dirty Laundry</p><p>Keep a sharp eye out for mysterious Abraxodyne intel briefcases hidden all over Burning Springs.

Scaring poor brahmin into going off track, leaving deliveries incomplete.</p><p>For now, Milepost Zero will be closing shop and moving their wares to other vendors across Highway Town. Awaiting a time in the future when things might be a bit safer for their operations.</p><p>The rewards from Milepost Zero are now spread across the Wasteland:</p><ul><li>Plans for the V63 Laser Carbin and mods have been moved to the Weapon Vendor Splint in Highway Town.</li><li>Mac in Highway Town will sell the following items:</li><li>Rolled Persian Rug</li><li>Persian Wall Rug</li><li>Makeshift Wine Rack</li><li>Noren Curtains</li><li>Park Ranger Supply Box</li><li>Persian Rug</li><li>Stargazer’s Telescope</li><li>Lightning Battery Lamp</li><li>Noren Awing</li><li>Snow Globes from the Milepost Zero vendors will now be sold by Windy in Highway Town (she is a Gold Bullion vendor).</li><li>Spooky Scorched will reward the Lederhosen Outfit &amp; Hat, Redcoat Outfit *Hat, and the Vault Girl/Vault Boy backpacks.</li><li>Holiday Scorched will reward all the Skyline Valley specific Snow Globes.</li></ul><p>All characters who completed the “A Bump In the Road” Caravan intro quest will receive the title “Caravan Investor” (immediately upon logging in).</p><p>We will also be granting a pennant that can be used account wide (any character on the account will have access to this pennant) and characters that have completed the quest will also receive 2K Gold Bullion. The Pennant will be granted during the first week of Burning Spring’s release while players should expect to see the 2K Gold Bullion upon logging into characters who have completed then quest.</p><p>We believe that Bounty Hunting delivers on the same promise of on-demand content, with Legendary enemies, and great rewards in a more succinct and satisfying way. We love the Skyline Valley region and have some fun things planned.</p><h3>New C.A.M.P. Pet - Radhog</h3><p>One of the new creatures you’ll find in Burning Springs is the Radhog. They’re tough and fiercely protective of their young, so if you get too close expect to be attacked.</p><p>What would happen if you brought one to your C.A.M.P.? You would probably have the most adorably disgusting pet this side of the Ohio River!</p><p>After purchasing the Radhog C.A.M.P. Pet from the Atomic Shop, the radhog bed item can be found in the “Dwellers” section of the Workshop menu and its Nose Ring is in the “Pet Clothing” section of the Armor Workbench.</p><h3>New Seasonal Weapon – Dom Pedro</h3><p>A new weapon is entering the fray.</p><p>The Dom Pedro is a Hand Cannon that can fire .50 rounds or be swapped to .308. It has an explosive effect and can pierce enemies too. Really sending a message to anyone foolish enough to stand in your way.</p><h3>Emote Wheel</h3><p>Whether you’re hitting your favorite emote at the wandering traveler passing by in the hulking Power Armor skin or trying to convince a level 30 Vault Dweller to pick up the loot you just dropped for them, emoting is core to the Appalachian way of living.</p><p>In the Burning Springs update we’re reorganizing emotes so that more emotes can be equipped at once.</p><p>We’re doing this by:</p><ul><li>introducing 2 new categories, “Social” and “Performance”</li><li>removing the “Follow Me” and “Team Up” categories and placing most of their emotes into “Help” and “Social”</li><li>reorganizing the emotes in the “Misc” so that more of them live in more appropriate categories like “Performance” and “Taunt”.</li></ul><p>With the work done here, you can now equip all your favorite emotes at once with little to no need to go into the Atomic Shop to swap them in and out.</p><h3>Gleaming Depths</h3><p>Almost a year after its introduction, Gleaming Depths has proved to be an excellent place for players looking for an endgame challenge to push themselves and their builds to the limit.</p><p>We’re introducing a new weekly challenge for Gleaming Depths that can be completed by working through all stages of the raid. Your reward for doing so will be a 4-Star Legendary cache that contains a 4-Star Armor, Power Armor, Melee Weapon, and a Ranged Weapon.</p><p>To go along with this new weekly challenge, we’re also redistributing the raid rewards so that the farther you progress in Gleaming Depths the more enticing the rewards will be. We know this may cause some disruption to your local EN06 farming group (and you can still farm him for XP), but it was never our intention to have one phase of the raiding experience be the source of some of the most coveted rewards in the game.</p><p>In this update we’re also fixing numerous bugs and introducing quality-of-life improvements to make the raiding experience smoother for everyone.</p><hr><h3>Combat</h3><p>Combat in Appalachia has experienced a lot of changes since the Skyline Valley update was released last year. For Burning Springs we’re slowing things down to see how it all settles.</p><p>We are making a few more adjustments to V.A.T.S. to address the feedback we’ve received after the Fallout 76: C.A.M.P. Revamp update. All in all, you should experience far less instance of V.A.T.S. chance to hit fluctuations and targeting issues.</p><ul><li>Fixed cryo slow being applied to players who aren't in PvP.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Hack and Slash could damage players outside of PvP.</li></ul><h3>C.A.M.P.</h3><ul><li>All items from the Mischief Night rewards now appear in the Build menu.</li><li>Build budgets of various items have been adjusted.</li><li>Fixed an issue which could cause the Store/Scrap button to not work when pressed by the player.</li><li>Straw Goat decoration plans are now known by default for all players.</li><li>Fixed issue where C.A.M.P.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-no-offline-mode-always-online-2025-1851777885">EA’s live-service reboot of <em>Skate</em>,</a> which launched back in September, is continuing to expand and improve. The skateboarding game’s second season is out now, and fans mostly appreciate the new content and changes. But a lot of players aren’t happy about their in-game characters suddenly looking sick and tired after season two went live, with some jokingly referring to them as drug addicts or stoners.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-launch-date-september-xbox-ps5-pc-trailer-2000620375"><em>Skate</em> season two went live on all platforms.</a> The update adds cosmetic items, fresh areas to skate, a new trick (the Impossible), and a host of quality-of-life tweaks and visual changes. That’s all good and nice, and overall, fans are happy about the update, even if there are some odd lag issues at the moment. But many players were surprised to find their characters looking different, a bit more tired perhaps, when logging on Tuesday to play <em>Skate</em>. As part of EA and developer Full Circle’s commitment to improving <em>Skate’s</em> visuals, a lot of characters now have dark bags under their eyes and darker complexions.</p>

 <p>“Why the faces look so tired and weird?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pcibc1/why_the_faces_looks_so_tired_and_weird/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">asked one Redditor</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pciob3/season_2_comparison/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Skate</em> subreddit.</a> Someone else joked that the new update had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pchvpk/update_ghould_my_character/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">“Ghoul’d” their character.</a> On Twitter, some replies to EA’s tweet announcing the new <em>Skate</em> update included more screenshots of characters that now look a lot more tired than before. One user shouted at EA: “Look what you did to MY FACE! Look at my face! Look at it!” <a href="https://x.com/Koreyzzz/status/1995931933600350654">Another player shared an image of their character </a>with darker eyes and mentioned that the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-six#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20important%20to,our%20future%20updates.%E2%80%9D">devs had previously promised to make characters look better</a> and didn’t think that this update accomplished that.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You guys are not making any sense. <a href="https://t.co/Rw5vhBi8fW">pic.twitter.com/Rw5vhBi8fW</a></p> <p>— Роман Платонов (@Roman__Platonov) <a href="https://twitter.com/Roman__Platonov/status/1995928606980407603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Some players even claimed that they loaded up the game and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pcfk94/they_changed_my_skin_color/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">found their character</a> had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1pchja2/what_did_they_do_to_him/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a totally new skin tone</a>.

Some are even asking EA to revert the change to characters or add a toggle to let people go back to the more cartoony look seen when <em>Skate</em> launched earlier this year.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted EA for more information.</p> <p>I doubt EA will let people toggle between the old and new look, but with how often Skate has been updated and the devs’ commitment to listening to player feedback during the game’s early access development, I expect this won’t be the last time players boot up Skate and discover their characters look a bit different. Hopefully, next time everyone won’t look so tired.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/</link>
            <guid>1371040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Santa Ragione's <em>Horses</em>, the unsettling horror game in which horses are naked human slaves wearing horse masks, won't be released on the Epic Games Store after all. <em>Horses </em>was previously <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio?ref=aftermath.site"><u>banned from release on Valve Software's Steam platform</u></a>, too. Publisher Santa Ragione, which released survival horror game <em>Saturnalia</em> in 2022, announced on Monday that Epic Games alerted the company just 24 hours ahead of its release that the game wouldn't be published on Tuesday.</p><p>Epic Games told Santa Ragione that <em>Horses</em> violates its content guidelines—"specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies," <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a reprint of the message published on the <em>Horses</em> website</u></a>. Epic Games communications director Jake Jones confirmed that the platform "found violations of those guidelines during our extensive review," and pointed Aftermath towards the correspondence published on the <em>Horses</em> website. Santa Ragione "immediately" appealed the decision, it said, but that appeal was rejected.</p><p>Epic Games specifically said it prohibits content that “contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated" and "promotes abuse and animal abuse." Santa Ragione denies that <em>Horses</em> includes these things.</p><p><em>Horses </em>is described on its GOG storefront as a "first-person game with live-action sequences." It takes place over the span of fourteen days in-game and will test a player's "obedience, complicity, and restraint" as they play as a college student working on a weird-as-fuck farm. <em>Horses</em>&nbsp;is currently listed on GOG's recent best-selling games page, after only&nbsp;<em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat</em>'s enhanced edition. </p><p><em>Horses </em>has a pretty lengthy content warning, which certainly provides a better understanding of the sort of imagery in the game:</p><p><em>"This game contains scenes of physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny. The inclusion of these elements is intended to depict and characterize a fictional world and its fictional inhabitants. The presence of these elements is not an endorsement of them, nor do they reflect the beliefs or values of the creators. Some scenes also feature unsettling sounds, such as chewing and swallowing, which may be disturbing for players with sound sensitivities or related phobias.

If you feel uncomfortable or upset while playing, please consider stepping away and reaching out to someone you trust."</em></p><p>The game <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87?ref=aftermath.site"><u>does still have an Epic Game Store page</u></a>; several critics reportedly reviewed the game ahead of launch on the platform, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including IGN</u></a>.</p><p>Epic Games claimed in its email to Santa Ragione that the game received an Adult's Only (AO) rating from the International Age Rating Coalition. Santa Ragione said that when <em>it</em> filled out the IARC questionnaire, it received a PEGI 18 or ESRB M rating. AO rated games aren't allowed on the Epic Games Store—except games that received that rating for the inclusion of NFTs or blockchain—but mature or 18+ games are. Aftermath has reached out to IARC for clarification on <em>Horses</em>' rating. Santa Ragione said it submitted its certification of its rating to the Epic Games Store ahead of its release.</p><p>Epic Games wasn't specific about <em>what</em> caused the ban, and neither was Valve when it originally rejected the game from being published on its platform in 2023. Santa Ragione said in late November that the game was banned in 2023 after the company had to upload an early build of the game—a requirement to getting a Steam storefront page up and running. Valve rejected the build without comment, and Santa Ragione said on its website it was likely due to a scene in which a "young girl" rides on the shoulders of a naked adult woman with a horse head. Santa Ragione said it has since changed all characters in the game to be in their 20s or older.</p><p>"Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor," Valve wrote in an automated review sent to the studio, according to the FAQ on the <em>Horses</em> website.</p><p>Santa Ragione said in its FAQ that the Steam ban isn't related to the recent restrictions on adult content that caused <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout/"><u>a major "deindexing" of NSFW games</u></a> on Itch.io and the outright removal of others there and on Steam. That's because Valve's rejection of the game happened in 2023, before conservative activist group Collective Shout's campaign to harass game platforms into removing anything it deemed objectionable. The group went after game platforms by harnessing the power of payment processors—<a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-steam-itch-porn-payment-processors/"><u>with payment processors determining what's acceptable sexual content and what's not</u></a>, platforms like itch.io and Steam complied or risked having access to the processors removed.</p><p>This sort of censorship-by-payment-processor can have a chilling impact on the industry; in an effort to protect children, these restrictions can end up restricting free expression of even mildly-uncomfortable ideas. <em>Horses</em> certainly seems to push up against these restrictions, but its developers said it doesn't cross them: the game is supposed to be "challenging, adult storytelling," the publisher said on its website.</p><p>Guidelines for platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store are often written in such a way that leaves some grey area for certain content—platforms then can apply these restrictions however they'd like, and in ways that often feel confusing to players. Both Epic Games Store and Steam sell sex games and games with graphic violence. For instance, there are a lot of "anime boob games," <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-not-easy-putting-a-gay-sex-game-on-steam-1782457390?ref=aftermath.site"><u>as Nathan put it in 2016</u></a>, but not many gay sex games. He spoke to game developer Robert Yang about getting his games on the platform: Dicks can be used for "exploitation or titillation," but not in the context of sex.</p><p>"We respect players enough to present the game as intended and to let adults choose what to play; lawful works should not be made unreachable by a monopolistic storefront’s opaque decisions," Santa Ragione said. "Steam publicly downplays human curation in favor of algorithmic sales optimization, yet intervenes with censorship when a game’s artistic vision does not align with what the platform owners considers acceptable art. Steam’s behavior passively shapes which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship."</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Merge And Fight monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Seeds, Buckets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Merge And Fight is a fusion of Plants Vs Brainrots and the iconic Plants vs. Zombies title. Players must increase their total output and total DPS to build the best garden filled with the finest plants. Furthermore, one must defeat the most profitable high-HP brainrots to increase their revenue contribution. This is when the active Merge And Fight codes come into play. Redeem these <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-survive-wave-z-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> codes to have your inventory overflowing with various Potions and Gears. New players using the codes will quickly secure the finest early-game brainrots and build the most damage-inflicting plants without grinding.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-active-merge-and-fight-codes">Active Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>update1</strong>&nbsp; – x2 Jalapeno Seed, x3 Iron Bucket, and Damage Potion (New)</li>



<li><strong>cactus</strong> – x2 Cactus Seed, x3 Golden Bucket, x2 Plant Attack Potion, and x5 Freeze Grenade&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>pea</strong> – 2x Damage Potion, 2x Seed Potion, Speed Potion, and 3x Buckets of Water&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>plantsmerge</strong> – x1 Brainrot Potion, x1 Gloves, and x1 Cactus Seed</li>



<li><strong>welcome</strong> – Damage Potion, x2 Buckets of Water and x1 Shuriken&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-inactive-merge-and-fight-codes">Inactive Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired codes as of the writing of this article. You can expect new codes to be released during milestones and major in-game updates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-merge-and-fight-codes">How To Redeem Merge And Fight Codes?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Merge And Fight Code Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow the steps below to redeem all the active codes:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Merge And Fight and spawn on the map.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hit the “Store” button.</li>



<li>Scroll down to the last or press the “Redeem Code” key to see the code box.</li>



<li>Enter any code into the “Enter Code” text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Press the “Redeem” button to activate the code.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-more-about-merge-and-fight-codes">More About Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<p>Gears claimed from the active codes have the following use:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Wooden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 30 seconds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Freeze Grenade – Throws to freeze brainrots for a while.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Shuriken – Throw to deal 120 damage and bounce 2 additional times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gloves – Click to deal 600 damage to brainrots.</li>



<li>Iron Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 3 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Golden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 10 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Damage Potion – All plants ATK +50%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Brainrot Potion – Legendary+ brainrot spawn chance +100%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>Use the free Potions when you see boss brainrots walking down the Brainrot Portal. Freeze Grenades are useful because they can stun high HP brainrots and bring them down slowly. When you place rare plants, they’ll take quite some time to grow. This is when you must use the Bucket gears. They will help you ignore the annoying waiting time and quickly set up a sturdy defence in your garden.&nbsp;</p>
