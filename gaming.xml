		<p>Over twenty minutes of footage from Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has been released from the Tokyo Game Show and it is, as you might expect, banana crackers.&nbsp; We get to meet Shioli Kutsuna’s Rainy and Elle Fanning’s Tomorrow, and they sing a nice duet while Normal Reedus’ Sam looks on with his sentient puppet pal swinging from his belt, who then joins in the song – and that’s just the first ninety seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 NEW Trailer 4K (2025) PS5 Pro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRvuCmbrjAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The footage then continues with the return of a familiar face and location, and some casual tear collection and emoticons. We then skip to on board DHV Megellan and get explanation for why everyone is in shades of grey, plus another new character, Tarman, voiced by legendary director George Miller, and his pet devil tar cat.&nbsp; Lea Seydoux’s Fragile is also present, being as French as possible and smoking a cigarette, and then the puppet is introduced (so the clips are clearly out of order) as Dollman, voiced by another director, Fatih Akin.</p>
<p>Fragile, Rainy, and Tomorrow then pose for a photoshoot with cuddly toy versions of the white grubs that were introduced as food in the first film.&nbsp; They then model some nice jackets and have dance on some of the vehicles from the game.</p>
<p>We’re still only seven minutes in and frankly if Bea Arthur turned up dressed as a ferret I wouldn’t bat an eyelid.</p>

<p>The video then continues with the footage from the trailer that was released in January before what appears to be a new trailer with Baby Lou (at a guess) and some sort of religious ceremony before skipping back to Fragile carrying Lou away from some sort of danger.&nbsp; Next is a shot of the DHV Megellan before we are told that a private company, APAC, is funding the project.</p>
<p>If that all seemed vaguely sensible the final shot is Baby Lou’s pod with octopus tentacles in it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/death-stranding-2-has-been-revealed-watch-the-trailer-here/">First confirmed back in 2022</a>, this sequel has now been fully titled as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach but the trailer does, thankfully, give it the snappier name of DS2.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> says he knows <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>'s release date, but "unforeseen circumstances" prevent him from sharing that date further.</p>
<p>Talking at Tokyo Game Show, Kojima said that while he and his team were working "in preparation" for the release date, he could not confirm it until "some point next year".</p>
<p>As yet, there's no official English-language versions of the presentation on TGS' Special Stage, but the Japanese livestream is embedded below:</p>

<p>"I haven't said the release date today, but the release date has already been decided, and I'm currently working on it in preparation for that," Kojima said, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kojima-says-death-stranding-2s-release-date-is-decided-but-he-cant-reveal-it/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>"Since we are talking about 2025, it will be released next year, so we will announce it at some point next year. But, due to some unforeseen circumstances, we cannot announce it today."</p>
<p>Kojima did not expand on what those unforeseen circumstances were, or when we'll likely get confirmation of the release date, but he did unveil a further 20-minute gameplay demo of Death Stranding 2, which you can see above.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 - now officially now known as On the Beach (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-death-stranding-2-details-reportedly-being-revealed-in-next-15-days">as suspected</a>) - was announced back in 2022 during the Game Awards, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-revealed-by-hideo-kojima">bamboozling trailer</a> featuring Léa Seydoux and Norman Reedus.</p>
<p>Hideo Kojima has signed with talent agency WME to "traffic control all that [he does]" and "handle exchanges with all the actors" he wants to work with, hinting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojimas-next-project-could-be-a-game-anime-film-or-something-totally-different">his next project may not even be a video game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The crowd is a mix of high-profile streamers like Central Committee and KaceyTron, smaller Twitch affiliates, and fans—and all of them are <em>living</em> for the third annual TwitchCon Drag Showcase. JuiceBoxx, a streamer and one of the hosts this year, has her face plastered all over the convention center.<em> Ru Paul’s Drag Race </em>superstar Trixie Mattel has a makeup space on the show floor where employees are offering beauty tips and touch-ups, and at an off-site Capcom party, several drag queens mill about, their hair nearly grazing the ceiling of the bar. Pronoun pins are available for attendees to display on their badges, and non-profits like TransLifeline have booths on the show floor. — Alyssa Mercante</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitchcon-2024-drag-queens-showcase-queer-inclusive-1851655276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitchcon-2024-drag-queens-showcase-queer-inclusive-1851655276">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dc259b1983a74188639e1d829711400c" data-recommend-id="image://dc259b1983a74188639e1d829711400c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An inflatable live button at TwitchCon.

<p>I don’t blame you if you want to spawn money in a Bethesda game. After spending countless hundreds or thousands of hours playing, I tend to follow suit. It’s easier when you can buy everything you need, and then you can focus on the adventure. So, without further ado, here’s how to use the Starfield money console command to prepare for Shattered Space!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-starfield-money-console-command">What is the Starfield Money Console Command?</h2>



<p>To access the Starfield console on PC, hit the tilde (~) on your keyboard to open up the menu. You’ll likely receive a warning that using console commands in the game will disable achievements, but if you have all of them or don’t care about unlocking 100% of the game’s achievements, you can ignore the warning. Then, start to type in the following command:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>player.additem f [value]</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll want to swap “[value]” with the number of credits you wish to spawn in your inventory. The game doesn’t seem to handle significant numbers too well, so consider spawning credits in increments of 10,000 or 100,000. You must repeatedly enter the console command to spawn credits until you’re filthy rich.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-buy-with-your-infinite-money-in-starfield">What to Buy With Your Infinite Money in Starfield</h2>



<p>Once you have a stock of credits, it’s time to go shopping!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ammunition</strong>: You’ll need copious amounts of ammo as you travel to Va’ruun’kai.</li>



<li><strong>Grenades</strong>: Shattered Space features new grenades and grenade crafting mechanics, so why not bring a few explosives along for the ride?</li>



<li><strong>Weapons</strong>: You will want a primary and secondary weapon to bring with you into the expansion. A few recommendations include Head Ranger or The Prime, which you can buy at Laredo Firearms, or Boom Boom and The Buzzcut from Neon Tactical.</li>



<li><strong>Health Items</strong>: Stock up on med kits and syringes beforehand to ensure you don’t run low. There’s no telling what or how much you can buy on Va’ruun’kai!</li>
</ul>



<p>What weapons do you recommend players buy with infinite credits in Starfield? Let us know in the comments, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a> to start the discussion!</p>

This means, moving about the world organically, you’ll likely miss a lot of the best quests! Some are cleverly hidden, others require special stat checks or certain prerequisites to be met before you can reap the rewards, and it’s all too easy to just walk past them, never even knowing they were there.

Maybe tons of it is funny to the millions of players outside of myself, but most of it misses the mark for me. Instead, I often find humor in the random conversations me and my friends have when we play games together, or the shenanigans we sometimes get up to. Recently though, there’s been an uptick in games taking a more tactful approach to comedy; rather than a shotgun spread of zingers and Whedonisms—which have their place but have unfortunately oversaturated the market—there are some games now dialing into particular niches and styles of humor that go underappreciated or unrepresented in games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tactical-breach-wizards-impressions-strategy-steam-1851626007"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a></span><em> </em>or even AAA heavy-hitters like the <em>Like A Dragon </em>series. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-guide-walkthrough-1851633756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-guide-walkthrough-1851633756"><em><strong>Thank Goodness You’re Here</strong></em></a></span><strong>, which is currently going for $16 on </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam</strong></a></span><strong>, is one of those games, and thank goodness for it, because it’s utterly ridiculous in the best way possible.</strong> - Moises Taveras <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thank-goodness-youre-here-steam-sale-absurd-comedy-1851656501">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0f9938bda37ee642b2d2c249fe093035" data-recommend-id="image://0f9938bda37ee642b2d2c249fe093035" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="One angry fire dragon, his yellow eyes spiking the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="One angry fire dragon, his yellow eyes spiking the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f9938bda37ee642b2d2c249fe093035" data-recommend-id="image://0f9938bda37ee642b2d2c249fe093035" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="One angry fire dragon, his yellow eyes spiking the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> makes no qualms about scaring you in its early game.

            <p>Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki "Yoshi-P" Yoshida outlined what's coming up on Patch 7.1 in his latest Letter from the Producer Live event at Tokyo Game Show overnight, including new artwork, quests, and the Yuweyawata Field Station dungeon.</p>
<p>Expected mid-November, the patch, called "Crossroads", will also include new Allied Society quests for Dawntrail, focusing on a new Pelupelu trader.</p>
<p>While Yoshida stopped short of providing any story clues, he suggested that these quests would be perfect for players levelling jobs to 100.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-14-patch-7-1-crossroads-coming-november/">The Gamer</a>, Yoshida treated us to some new artwork, including that of Bakool Ja Ja, and revealed the new main scenario quests (MSQ) would primarily focus on Zoraal Ja and his relationship with his son. We also learned that we'll spend time with Wawlika's wife, Nitowikiei, who will assist us during Dawntrail's Custom Delivery quests.</p>
<p>We also learned that Chaotic Alliance Raids, a newer, harder version of the existing Alliance Raids, are also on the way. These accommodate a raid party of up to 24 players.</p>
<p>Players can also expect more Role Quests once players complete all existing Role Quests for all role types.</p>
<p>Expect more news as we get closer to Crossroads' release in November.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-14s-new-70-graphics-update-transforms-pc-ps5-and-series-x">Final Fantasy 14's first graphical overhaul</a> since the release of version 2.0 in 2013 is here with version 7.0, including changes to lighting and ambient occlusion (AO), the addition of DLSS upscaling on PC, 120Hz support on current-gen consoles and a 30fps cap most useful for last-gen machines.</p>
<p>As Digital Foundry summarised for us, it's a substantial effort that even includes reworked textures, models and shading work for some (but not all) characters and environments, helping the game feel a little closer to its modern contemporaries.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I created Kojima Productions under the scope of 'digital entertainment', but I don't think it necessarily has to be a video game," Kojima said. "We could create a new IP from a game, or an anime, or a film, or something totally different. Anything is possible.</p>
<p>"I would like to work with talented people from around the world and create something new, with 'digital' being the keyword. It could be a movie, a game, or something else entirely. I can't die until then! I don't think I'm trying to do anything too out of the ordinary!"</p>
<p>Kojima also stressed that he considers his studio, Kojima Productions, is an "indie".</p>
<p>"We are indies! Really! We never know when we'll close. We are not backed by anyone. We do everything on our own, from creating concepts to production and even promotion and marketing. I think there are many studios like us.</p>
<p>"We can't do mass production, so we won't go public. I'm getting quite old, and it's not always easy. But I'm creating things because I want to. I'm running a business so that I can keep creating. It's not because I want to do business. I didn't necessarily want to make my own studio. I went independent so I can make what I want to make."</p>

			<p>At TGS 2024, Hideo Kojima gave a special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3XizwzhEY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90-minute presentation</a> of his upcoming game Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. While the presentation was conducted in Japanese for obvious reasons, Kojima later shared English versions of the new game footage sprinkled throughout it via Twitter(X).</p>
<p>In the first one, we meet two new characters: Tarman and Dollman. The first one is the captain of the so-called DHV Magellan submarine, and he features the likeness of none other than George Miller, the creator of the Mad Max franchise. In keeping with the franchise's previous guest appearances, such as Guillermo Del Toro's, Miller won't be voicing the character himself; Australian actor Marty Rhone will do it instead. Dollman, on the other hand, is exactly what the name says: a name stuck in a doll. His likeness is modeled on Turkish film director Fatih Akin, and his voice comes from actor Jonathan Roumie. Their introduction is handled by returning character Fragile, who is still played (and voiced) by Léa Seydoux in Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> This is the headquarters of our humble operation, the bridge of the DHV Magellan. It's always like this when the DHV Magellan is on the move. Meet Tarman, our resident doctor and geophysicist. He's also the captain and pilot, in case you hadn't noticed, and a fellow Doom-sufferer. The nav console offers a direct connection to the tar currents, the downside being that we all have to bathe in carallium.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tarman:</strong> Happy to have you aboard, Sam. You'll have to excuse me if I don't shake your hand.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> You steer this ship?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tarman:</strong> Yeah. Now, the computer does most of the work.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> So, this is a submarine?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tarman:</strong> Spot on. We dive into the tar and use it to travel underground.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> Just beneath the surface of the earth, there are currents we can ride almost anywhere.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> So what's your role in all this?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> Me? I make sure Drawbridge's grand plans go off without a hitch.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> So you're the commander?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> That's right. These days, I'm Fragile in name only.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> Hello? Excuse you! I too am a member of Drawbridge, believe it or not. It is an honor, Sam.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sam:</strong> Little puppet?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> What? Puppet? No! I am alive and my own master.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Fragile:</strong> This is Dollman. A man who got stuck inside a, well, you get it. He used to be a spirit medium.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> When I was still flesh and bone, of course. Regrettably, my transformation cost me my talents.</em></p>
<p>The second video clip introduces two more new characters that fans will meet in Death Stranding 2: Tomorrow, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-to-feature-actress-elle-fanning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played by Elle Fanning</a> (Super 8, Maleficent, The Great) and Rainy, played by Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool, Invasion).</p>
<p><em><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> In the place where I came from, no one gave birth to babies. They just stayed inside their mother's bellies.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rainy:</strong> Well, in our world, babies are born and grow up to be adults. Or at least they're supposed to.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> It's only natural that Tomorrow wouldn't understand. After all, she was living in a realm of the dead. I wouldn't expect children to be born into such a place.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> But Rainy's baby will be born, right?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dollman:</strong> In due time, of course. Isn't that so?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rainy:</strong> *nods*</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> So you'll be a mother who gives birth to her baby.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rainy:</strong> Mm-hmm. And I just can't wait.</em></p>
<p>The third video clip shows another returning character, Heartman, whose likeness is based on movie director Nicolas Winding Refn, while the voice comes from actor Darren Jacobs. But it's the fourth and fifth clips that show how much crazier Death Stranding 2 is going to be compared to the original.</p>

<p>In the fourth clip, Hideo Kojima demonstrated the new Photo Mode, which shows characters like Fragile, Rainy, and Tomorrow making all sorts of poses ranging from cute to weird. Apparently, Kojima confirmed that this Photo Mode will somehow influence the story of Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>The fifth and final clip shows what the developer is describing as a 'Dollman In-Game event', in which protagonist Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) enjoys an animated in-game concert featuring music from actual artists. In this case, it's a song called Horizon Dreamer, made by Daichi Miura; the song will be released in a few hours.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a generic 2025 release window</a> for the PlayStation 5 version. Looking at the original, a PC port could happen in 2026, although it hasn't been confirmed yet.</p>

<p>Last night, Kaysan’s 2v2 LAN Showdown unravelled, featuring the Call of Duty talents of a host of CDL players and two Warzone champions. Alongside HyDra, Scrap, Shotzzy, Simp, aBeZy, and Drazah, Warzone’s Hisoka and Shifty stepped up to the plate. In recent weeks, the Warzone pro players have stressed that they’re better than the CDL pros in many ways.</p>



<p>This tournament proved them <strong>very wrong</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-down-in-la">Down in LA</h2>



<p>In Los Angeles, seven Call of Duty esports world champions (and Scrap) turned up to prove once and for all that Warzone pros can’t hang with the big boys in the Call of Duty League. In the opening round, Hisoka and Shifty secured just one map against Scrap and HyDra before being catapulted into the lower run.</p>



<p>They then faced Simp and aBeZy – the ‘Tiny Terrors’ – and failed to secure a map, thus being forcefully ejected from the running.</p>



<p>As the rest of the event unfolded, Simp and aBeZy eliminated Drazah and Shotzzy before falling to Scrap and HyDra in the Grand Final. This power duo has only just linked forces after being signed to the LA Thieves as part of a ‘super team’ that will dominate the CDL next season.</p>



<p>Even at this early stage, Scrap and HyDra’s energy and chemistry were nothing short of flawless.</p>



<p>Here are the winning moments, courtesy of Breaking Point:</p>

<p>In the last few weeks, scores of Warzone pro players have been talking their talk about the CDL, stressing the skill gap that exists between them. Hisoka and Shifty recently claimed the top spot at both the World Series of Warzone and the Esports World Cup, before being embarrassed by the very pro players they’ve spoken out against.</p>



<p>It might be that Warzone and traditional Call of Duty multiplayer platforms have differing playstyles, metas, and mechanics, but there’s a reason the CDL players are the only ones making the lists of ‘the best Call of Duty players ever’.</p>
