            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modern-horizons-3-previewed-by-wizards-of-coast<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new material on <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>. This official preview of the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set provides fans a glimpse at what cards and mechanics will return, skips over elements already revealed via the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modern-horizons-3-leaks-addressed-by-wizards-of-coast">April leak</a>, and shows off some updated card artwork.</p>

<h2>The MTG Modern Horizons 3 Preview</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Wizards of the Coast covers a lot of ground as to what <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> will contain. First, the press release confirms that the set will contain Special Guests cards. These are 10 borderless mythic rares in Play Boosters (non-foil) and Collector's Boosters (foil).</p>

<p>Roughly 1 in 64 Play Boosters and 1 in 15.5 Collector's Boosters will contain a Special Guests card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/modern-horizons-3-borderless-card-artwork.jpg?itok=U3cL07Vb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/modern-horizons-3-borderless-card-artwork.jpg?itok=K_k0A78t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Drink in the wonderful artwork.</figcaption></figure><p>The set will also feature new borderless cards. 17 cards in <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> will feature alternate art and classic borderless; 10 rare and 7 mythic rare respectively. In addition, 19 cards will receive the borderless profile treatment, 30 will feature the borderless frame break treatment, and 58 will receive the fan-favorite retro-frame treatment.</p>

<p>For Eldrazi fans, <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> has some heavy hitters. The titans Emraskul, Ulamog, and Kozilek return in non-foil and foil in Play Boosters and Collector's Boosters and serialized double rainbow foil printings contained in Collector Boosters. There are only 250 printings of each of them. Good luck.</p>

These cards will showcase the origins of <em>Magic's</em> more iconic characters. An example given is Tamiyo changing from Inquisitive Student to a Seasoned Scholar, complete with different abilities.</p>

<p>For fans of Commander format, Wizards of the Coast revealed more info on the sets' Commander Decks. Specifically, we now know the signature leader cards behind the four decks.</p>

<p>The Black/Red/Green deck, <em>Graveyard Overdrive</em> is lead by <em>Disa The Restless</em>, which can bring certain permanents to the battlefield if they are discarded. The Green/Blue deck <em>Tricky Terrain</em> showcases <em>Omo, Queen of Vesuvia</em>, a shapeshifter that can put counters on permanents making them count as every land or creature type.</p>

Lastly the rainbow deck <em>Eldrazi Incursion</em> features <em>Ulalek, Fused Atrocity.</em> This Devoid legendary creature lets you copy spell effects and activated and triggered effects.</p>

<p>The press release confirms that <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> will have forty returning mechanics. Those mechanics include Energy, last seen in the Universes Beyond <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements"><em>Fallout</em> Commander Decks</a>, Umbra Armor, and Kindred. Those last two were formally called Tribal and Totem Warrior, but have been changed following the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/card-updates-coming-with-khans-of-tarkir-on-mtg-arena" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MTG Arena release</a> of <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>.</p>

<p><em>Modern Horizons 3</em> officially releases worldwide May 21.</p>

<p id="xeWtIy">We’ve praised the Genestealer Cults before here at Polygon as one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/16/17704024/warhammer-40000-genestealer-cult-cheapest-way-to-play">the most inexpensive ways to get started with <em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, and the little purple critters are back with a vengeance in 2024. A new 10th edition Codex is on the way and, just like the Sororitas above, that’s being paired with a new Battleforce starter army and a Combat Patrol. It’s the smaller Combat Patrol box that’s really turned our heads here since it comes with a standard vehicle, a heavy weapons-enabled quad bike, and no fewer than five cultists on dirtbikes. That should make this one of the most mobile small-unit forces in the game! Pricing and availability are forthcoming, with <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-the-genestealer-cults-get-a-big-brained-new-benefictus/">more information promised</a> in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<h2 id="Y9ZqjL"><strong>Plastic Adeptus Mechanicus units for The Horus Heresy</strong></h2>

<p id="nwBW17"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23153625/horus-heresy-age-of-darkness-price-availability-release-date-review"><em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em></a> is getting a boatload of new plastic miniatures for the Cult Mechanicum — the first in the history of the line. That includes a dashing, art deco-inspired transport vehicle to ferry them all into battle and <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-the-mechanicum-turns-its-love-of-metal-to-plastic/">the promise of even more unique units to come</a>. Again, no pricing or availability information was shared, but these products are nonetheless expected soon.</p>
<h2 id="eEapyX"><strong>Necromunda gets a major new expansion</strong></h2>

<p id="rlTnxY">Finally, perhaps the biggest news from the weekend is the continued expansion of Games Workshop’s <em>Necromunda</em> universe. Already one of the most <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22458895/necromunda-warhammer-40k-getting-started-miniatures-kitbashing-conversions-terrain">vibrant and engaging</a> sectors of “the hobby” as it’s called, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-plunder-the-haunted-depths-of-necromunda-hive-secundus/"><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus</em></a><em> </em>looks for all intents and purposes like a new starter set. Games Workshop is describing it as “a full game in a box” however, noting that it contains a linked campaign for two players. Pricing and availability — Say it with me! — will be announced at a later date.</p>

When Mario first meets the witch, she’s a member of the antagonistic Shadow Sirens group alongside her sisters Beldam and Marilyn. It’s clear she doesn’t get along with her sisters and that they bully her, but the specifics of how and why were slightly different in the English and German localizations on the GameCube than they were in the original Japanese version.</p><p>In that version, Vivian was often referred to with male pronouns as an insult, despite her asserting that the Shadow Sirens were made up of three sisters. The group’s introduction in Japanese and several other localizations had Vivian introduce the group as sisters, which led to her sisters insulting her and referring to her as a man.

She says she realized she “was their sister...not their brother,” and that her sisters’ bullying has gotten worse since. The constant berating from her sisters is what prompts Vivian to join Mario’s party, and now new and old players can see the original context in 2024.</p><p><em>Nintendo Life</em>’s video review has the full exchange at about the five-minute mark. Vivian’s story only takes up a few scenes, but now you get the satisfaction of taking down transphobic assholes on the Switch.</p><p><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> remake comes to Switch on Thursday, May 23.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Deep dive and drill down on those deliverables by investing in a mix of barracks, factories and new tech during the day to keep your colony strong and reach the planet’s core.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/vanillaware-is-looking-for-developers-to-work-on-a-new-fantasy-action-rpg/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vanillaware-is-looking-for-developers-to-work-on-a-new-fantasy-action-rpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following critical hits with <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim </em>and <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>—which has done <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/vanillawares-unicorn-overlord-clears-the-500k-shipment-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty well for itself</a>—developer Vanillaware has some hints as to what it’s working on next. According to a recent tweet, the studio is actively recruiting staff for a “new fantasy action-RPG.”&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">The recruitment flyer says Vanillaware is on the hunt for programmers, 2D animators, and background designers (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/vanillaware-recruiting-development-staff-for-new-fantasy-action-rpg">Gematsu</a>). While details are understandably light, you can see the notice below. It describes the genre, notes that they’re recruiting development staff, and lists the above roles.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Vanillaware has spent the better part of the past 20 years jumping back and forth between a few different genres. Its latest efforts, <em>13 Sentinels </em>and <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>, were a time-spanning adventure and a medieval strategy-RPG, respectively. Members of the Vanillaware team and Atlus <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unicorn-overlord-devs-talk-history-card-games-and-that-delicious-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently spoke with Destructoid</a> about the development process, where they got the inspiration for <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>‘s scenario and setting, and more.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Prior to those, Vanillaware partnered with Atlus to release fantasy action-RPG <em>Dragon’s Crown</em>. Most of their games have some degree of fantasy to them, fitting the requested bill for the next project nicely. <em>Grand Knights History </em>hit PSP as a Japan-only title in 2011, and before that they put out titles like <em>Muramasa: The Demon Blade</em>, <em>Odin Sphere</em>, and <em>GrimGrimoire</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="false">Some of those games have been re-released via remasters and enhanced ports, which is why the “new” before “fantasy action-RPG” is doing a lot of the heavy-lifting in this listing. Since they’re still looking for staff, it might be a while before we hear anything else about it. Whatever Vanillaware is cooking up, it will most definitely look gorgeous, at the very least.</p>

<p data-characters="314" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the fabled launch of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> directly on the horizon, we already know a majority of what events will be available at the time of release. If you’re interested in knowing where a good portion of your premium currency will come from, keep reading, as I’ll detail each event as much as I can.</p> <h2 id="h-every-wuthering-waves-official-release-event" data-injectable="false">Every <em>Wuthering Waves</em> Official Release Event</h2> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false">According to the most recent developer livestream for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, we can expect four major launch events once the game officially releases on May 22, 2024.</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Depths of Illusive Realm</strong></li> <li><strong>Overdash Club</strong></li> <li><strong>Alloy Smelt</strong></li> <li><strong>Second Coming of Solaris</strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">The Depths of Illusive Realm and Overdash Club events were both available during <em>Wuthering Waves’ </em> CBT2, so I can give you some extra details on them. Alloy Smelt and Second Coming of Solaris are newly announced events, so my information on those comes directly from the aforementioned livestream. As always, any information I provide from the CBT2 is subject to chance on release.</p>
 <h3 id="h-depths-of-illusive-realm" data-injectable="false">Depths of Illusive Realm</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">Depths of Illusive Realm is a highly repeatable combat event that features a roguelike-style game mode where you transverse various randomly generated rooms, fighting enemies until you reach the boss at the end. Each room comes with a set of enemies you must defeat to proceed to the next, and each victory rewards you with the option to select from several strong buffs to make progression easier. Once you progress far enough, you’ll face a powerful boss on a timer, and must defeat said boss to conclude the run. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="766" data-current-count="1066" data-injectable="true">Before all that though, when you enter Depths of Illusive Realm, you must select <strong>one </strong>main character out of a small roster of currently featured characters for the event. Now that we know <strong>Jiyan</strong> is the first limited character banner in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>; expect him and the four-star characters apart of his banner to be the ones you can use in this event. This does mean, however, that your selection of characters is very limited if you don’t pull on banners to get featured characters. I’m hoping this has changed for the release, but this is how it relatively functioned in CBT 2. You also get to select <strong>one </strong>support character that can lend aid via their Ultimate ability. You won’t be able to fully swap to this character at any point during a run.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false">You can expect this event to be somewhat <strong>permanent</strong>, as it is set to be updated over time as new characters are released.</p> <h3 id="h-overdash-club" data-injectable="false">Overdash Club</h3> <figure data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">Overdash Club is a very simple event meant to showcase <em>Wuthering Waves’ </em>robust parkour system. In this event, you’ll be free-running through pre-determined tracks on a timer, navigating obstacles using the parkour system. Once you reach the end of a track, you’ll be rewarded with a small amount of Astrite. There are several tracks to run, but they won’t all be unlocked at the same time, instead unlocking on a pre-determined timer. </p>
 <h3 id="h-alloy-smelt" data-injectable="false">Alloy Smelt</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">Based on information gathered from the official Livestream, Alloy Smelt is a combat event focused on fighting many enemies at the same time. Unlike with Depths of Illusive Realm, you’ll be using a full team lineup to defeat as many enemies as possible to earn points. Based on the wording, I suspect you’ll be able to use your own account characters or have access to trial characters to participate. This is merely speculation, however, so take it with a grain of salt. Earn enough points during the event, and you’ll be rewarded with Astrite. </p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">More combat events are always good and my book, and, from what I’ve been told, this event appeared inspired by <em>Punishing Gray Raven’s </em>Norman War event, which is a permanent mode in that game. Considering <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and <em>Punishing Gray Raven</em> are developed by Kuro Games, I’d expect this one to be permanent with updates as well.</p> <h3 id="h-second-coming-of-solaris" data-injectable="false">Second Coming of Solaris</h3> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="false">Second Coming of Solaris is a simple event where you’ll be accepting item commissions for delivery. Maqi, the NPC in charge of the event, will be requesting daily item deliveries. Successfully delivering commissioned items to Maqi will reward pull currency, among other small trinkets. While this isn’t the most exciting event, more pull currency is always a good thing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valorant-replay-prototype-demonstrated-but-dont-expect-it-soon.877512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-replay-prototype-demonstrated-but-dont-expect-it-soon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games released a new <em>Valorant </em>Dev Update and shared with everyone some very important information, including the community's most requested feature: replays.</p>

<p><em>Valorant </em>replays have been a request from before the game was even fully released, as players want to look at and examine what happened in their game to understand and improve in the highly competitive tactical shooter. It's a feature that <em>Counter Strike</em> has, and so one that players feel should be in the game, especially now that we're four years into its lifespan. Today we got the first demonstration of a <em>Valorant </em>replay system, however, it is tempered by the fact that it is a prototype.</p>

<h2>Why is it taking so long to get a Valorant replay system?</h2>

<p>A common question, or meme is why it's taking so long, which was addressed in the video by Marcus Reid, the <em>Valorant</em> Tech Lead. A lot of the problem is that <em>Valorant</em> wasn't built with a replay system in mind, which means making it requires a lot of work. For a replay system to be of use to players after all, it has to be accurate, and not show things like doors floating to nowhere, or be a second off on how it resolves all the action.</p>


<p>Getting everything to process properly in a replay, as well as handling elements like pausing that are important to it are hurdles for them, though they are working on it. According to Reid, they are focused on getting it right, so for now it looks like it will be a while until we see <em>Valorant </em>replays, but the prototype demonstrated today at least serves as proof it is on the way. It doesn't appear that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees-riot-forge-will-cease" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" League of Legends Developer Riot Games Laying Off 530 Employees, Riot Forge Will Cease Development">Riot Games layoffs</a> have halted, or slowed down the progress on replays.</p>

<h2>What is coming to Valorant in 8.11 and Beyond?</h2>

<p>Of course, the replay was only part of the whole Dev Update, although by far the most consequential part in the long term. Map rotation was given a discussion, and the team promised that there would be more transparency in how they are doing rotation going forward. In that spirit, they mentioned that <em>Valorant </em>8.11, coming in early June, will rotate Breeze and Split out, while Haven and a new map will come in.</p>

<p>On the balancing front, they explained a bit about their general philosophy and the reason why they don't focus on just buffing everyone to the upper power that is there now, but also nerf is so that they can maintain the balance of Agent powers with tactics, and gunplay. A focus right now is on making more agents able to fill any particular role, even if it means nerfing the best agent for that role right now.</p>

<p>For balance changes, 8.11 will be focused on the Duelist role. In it, Riot will be nerfing Raze because it is too much of a dominant pick right now for their preference. On the other side though, they'll be buffing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-iso-gameplay-trailer" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" New Valorant Agent Iso Wants To 1v1 You With His Ultimate">Iso (who joined the game last year)</a> and Neon by making them better at what makes them unique, the shield for Iso, and Neon's sliding ability.</p>



<p>Raina is also going to get worked on, as they have found that while she's been very strong in ranked play, she has a poor win rate in higher-level team play situations. While they didn't discuss how they aren't going to do it, the goal for the changes to Reyna will be to make her better in those team play higher level matches, while weakening her in ranked. These will be the last major balance changes likely before Champs, so if you were hoping for something else, it is unlikely to be soon.</p>

<p>After champs, Riot is promising larger balance updates, and mode changes coming to <em>Valorant</em>, with more details to come later this year. Over the summer, they'll also be revealing some map-related things that will be released after Champs.</p>

  <p id="qLULNa">You, too, can try your hand at pulling King Arthur’s Excalibur sword from the stone where it’s stuck in three different Disney parks — Disneyland, in front of King Arthur Carrousel; Walt Disney World, near Prince Charming Regal Carrousel; and at Disneyland Paris, by Le Carrousel de Lancelot. <em>The Sword in the Stone</em> attraction is a small but popular experience at the parks largely because it’s so mysterious. Many try to pull the sword from the stone, but not many can get it out.</p>

<p id="m3LQdi">And it makes sense: Excalibur is the sword in <em>The Sword in the Stone</em>, and as the movie’s story (and Arthurian legend) tells it, only the rightful king of England can pull it out. The parks <em>used</em> to do a little show everyday where Merlin would choose several people from a crowd to test their might, and, <em>maybe</em>, one of them would pull out the sword. The show doesn’t run anymore, but the swords stuck in their respective anvils remain. </p>
<p id="U3Fxkl">Pulling the sword out is so elusive, so rare, that people have started analyzing videos of park-goers’ attempts, drumming up theories on how to up your chances as one of the worthy ones. I know this because, despite never seeing <em>The Sword in the Stone</em>, this park attraction is somehow all over my TikTok feed. </p>
<p id="dnpOJo">Some people believe that you should scope out the area before attempting to pull. If there are two or more Disney cast members standing around, it means a higher chance of pulling the sword up. Why? Because, according to one of the leading theories, a Disney employee has to be around to push a remote-controlled button to make the sword rise. (It’s seemingly on a motor, because you aren’t actually pulling it up at all. If it unlocks, you can take your hands off and it’ll still rise, then go back down on its own.) The other reason is that people believe someone has to be around to give you a certificate, but this one’s been debunked: Disney hasn’t done certificates since the Merlin show stopped. Some people have reported being given a sticker, but the majority of people get nothing but the pride of pulling the sword out.</p>

<p id="kdMfDl">The next most popular theory is that there’s a little light in one of the windows at the nearby castle; if it’s red, you won’t be able to pull it. But when it’s green, you may be able to. Or maybe it’s the placement of the hands — some people believe you have to use the side handles, not the hilt’s grip. But the best tip of all is to just be strong enough to break the mechanism and forcefully release it. <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/01/photos-the-sword-in-the-stone-makes-a-triumphed-yet-unexpected-return-at-disneyland/">According to Disney news site WDW News Today</a>, someone at Disneyland ripped the sword from the stone and broke it so badly that Disney removed the sword entirely for a few days. No sticker for that guy!</p>
<p id="NVtLOK">These theories all have a logic to them, but because of Disney parks’ secrecy, we’ll never really know. Excalibur may be a cool sword, but it’s also an elusive sword — and that actually makes it even cooler.</p>

However, the platform that recovered the most and saw the biggest increase in revenue was traditional PC gaming. </p><p>In Newzoo’s report, PC game sales, microtransactions, and other digital purchases grew 8.4 percent in 2023 compared to 2022. That’s pretty good alone, but compared to other platforms it’s even more impressive. During that same time period, consoles only saw a 0.3 percent increase, and mobile gaming shrank by about 2 percent. </p><p>It should be noted that mobile and console gaming profits are still bigger overall than PC, with Newzoo estimating that 2023's total mobile gaming revenue landed at around $89.9 billion and consoles were at $52.4 billion. Meanwhile, in 2023, PC gaming was “only” hovering around $39 billion. </p><p>“PC revenues from publicly listed companies were up nearly 9% year over year,” reported Newzoo. The market research firm attributes PC gaming’s growth in 2023 to publishers embracing the platform. </p><p>“On the private company side, Valve, Epic Games, and miHoYo showed strong performances. We also saw that successful gaming companies pursuing cross-platform strategies acted as a beneficial catalyst for the PC market,” explained Newzoo. </p><h2 id="h2956"><a id=""></a>Will anybody want a PlayStation 6 or next-gen Xbox? </h2><p>This new report is more evidence of something that’s seemed obvious over the last few years or so: Consoles are becoming less important. </p><p>As modern video game consoles evolve more and more into mini-PCs, supporting mods, keyboards, and crossplay, the reason to buy consoles is becoming less and less clear. It doesn’t help that Sony and Microsoft seem unable to ship as many big console exclusives as before.

ReedPop had been behind the planned relaunch of E3 in 2023, partnering with the ESA to produce the show. However, it was subsequently canceled and E3 was killed off for good the following year.</p><p>ReedPop's Popverse comic book and geek culture site was not included in the sale to IGN. Additionally, ReedPop will maintain its EGX and MCM conventions in the United Kingdom in addition to its domestic comic conventions like New York Comic Con.</p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re reaching the end of your journey towards a shiny new Anima weapon, you’re going to need to farm for Aetheric Density, often mistakenly called ‘Light’ due to its similarity to one of the steps in the Zodiac Zeta relics.</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Aetheric Density is needed to complete the “Born Again Anima” quest of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/">Anima relic grind</a>. It’s one of the last quests and while the requirement may seem daunting, there are some easy ways to hoard this Density very quickly. In total, you’ll need to gather 2,000 Aetheric Density, but don’t worry, it’s not as bad as it seems.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-aetheric-density-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get Aetheric Density in Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">If you’re looking for Aetheric Density, you’ll need to complete any duty that was introduced during the Heavensward expansion, including everything from FATEs to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-ffxiv-raid-unlock-guide-coil-alexander-omega-eden-pandaemonium/">Savage Raids</a>. Of course, the more difficult the duty the higher the reward, so if you’re wanting to do this quickly you’ll need to be prepared for some challenging fights. Thankfully, you don’t need to complete these fights synced, so you can get through even the hardest of the duties with relative ease.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">To see how much Aetheric Density you currently have, or how much you still need to get, you can use your Enhanced Anima Glass to open up the interface. There are 10 runes here, surrounding Anima itself, and a new rune will fully illuminate each time you collect 200 Density.</p> <p data-characters="74" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">Here’s the full list of duties and how much Aetheric Density they offer:</p> <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="968" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Density rewarded</strong></td><td><strong>Duties</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Vague (4)</td><td>Heavensward FATEs</td></tr><tr><td>Meager (8)</td><td>The Limitless Blue (Hard or Extreme)<br>Thok ast Thok (Hard or Extreme)</td></tr><tr><td>Vigorous (16)</td><td>Containment Bay S1T7 (Extreme)<br>The Minstrel’s Ballad: Nidhogg’s Rage<br>Alexander Raids</td></tr><tr><td>Robust (32)</td><td>Heavensward Dungeons<br>A Realm Reborn level 50 Dungeons (Excluding Pratorium and Castrum Meridianum)<br>Alexander Raids (Savage 1-4)<br>Containment Bay Z1T9 (Extreme)</td></tr><tr><td>Sturdy (64)</td><td>Heavensward Alliance Raids<br>Possible bonus from anything which offers Robust Density</td></tr><tr><td>Hardened (96)</td><td>Alexander Raids (Savage 9-12)</td></tr><tr><td>Stalwart (128)</td><td>Possible bonus from Alexander Raids (Savage 9-12)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

Thanks to the massive number of levels between the duty itself and the current level cap of 90, you can steamroll through this Raid solo in a couple of minutes with ease, even with the much lower iLvl Anima weapon equipped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">With its guaranteed 96 Aetheric Density and the possibility of getting 128 for any run, you only need to run A9S a maximum of 21 times. This will allow you to get all the Aetheric Density you need in under an hour, without the need to drag anyone else into the duty with you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/still-wakes-the-deep-voice-cast-revealed-in-story-mini-documentary/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re just a month away from the release of Still Wakes The Deep on 18th June, and developer The Chinese Room has now revealed the full voice cast for its oil rig horror with a new story mini documentary.</p>
<p><iframe title="STILL WAKES THE DEEP | Voice Cast Reveal | Story Minidoc" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuvVm2w49GA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With top billing as main character Cameron “Caz” McLeary goes to Alec Newman, the Glaswegian actor who will be familiar to fans of Cyberpunk 2077 as Adam Smasher. Also joining the cast is Neve McIntosh as Suze, Caz’s wife, while the rest of the cast list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alec Newman as Caz</li>
<li>Neve McIntosh as Suze</li>
<li>Karen Dunbar</li>
<li>Michael Abubakar</li>
<li>Clive Russell</li>
<li>Shaun Dooley</li>
<li>Stewart Scudamore</li>
<li>Nicholas Boulton</li>
<li>Duncan Pow</li>
<li>Sandy Batchelor</li>
<li>Alan Turkington</li>
<li>Noof Ousellam</li>
</ul>
<p>As a first person horror, a lot of emphasis will be put on Alec’s voice acting chops to carry you through the story, but the cast as a whole will get to really lean into the thick and coarse regional accents from the north of the UK, given the setting.</p>
<p>Set in 1975 on the Beria D oil rig off the coast of Scotland, players will have to survive as the rig is torn apart by an otherworldly horror that has been unwittingly released in the unending quest for oil. The Chinese Room is getting to return to their roots as a studio both in terms of gameplay – it’s a narrative horror, so expect “walking simulator” to be bandied about a bit – and with filling this setting and narrative concept out with touches and details to really ground the player.</p>

<p>Newman says in the mini documentary that “The thing was so well written, and so well-conceived, that I don’t recall having very long conversations about what Caz should sound like. With this, you can feel the writing, you can feel the characters.”</p>
<p>Still Wakes The Deep is out on 18th June for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> and PC – it will also be available day one with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

There aren't any more details about this new game, such as whether it's another entry in the Hellblade series or an entirely different IP.</p><p>Project Mara is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hellblade-dev-shows-off-photorealistic-graphics-for-project-mara/1100-6486453/" data-ref-id="1100-6486453">billed as a psychological horror game</a> that focuses on photorealism and takes place in one apartment. There is no release date for it yet.</p><p>Earlier this month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut down several of its studios</a>, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks. There were worries that other Xbox studios such as Ninja Theory could potentially suffer the same fate after the release of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, since Arkane Austin was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-austin-was-pitching-immersive-sim-prior-to-closure-more-cuts-at-xbox-coming-report/1100-6523286/" data-ref-id="1100-6523286">reportedly pitching a new game</a> before it was shut down.</p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is now available for PC and Xbox Series X|S. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-hell-and-high-water/1900-6418229/" data-ref-id="1900-6418229">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II review</a>, we said, "Hellblade 2 is perhaps the most visually remarkable Xbox title to date, but is ultimately undermined by its emphasis on fidelity over story and gameplay."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-pity-system-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wuthering-waves-pity-system-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you’ll receive new Resonators by participating in gacha events and pulling for weapons and characters. However, it’s&nbsp;not uncommon&nbsp;to run into a dry streak that has you wondering when you’ll get the Resonator or&nbsp;weapon&nbsp;you want.</p> <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false">Fortunately, this is where the pity system guarantees you’ll get the five-star character you’re looking for.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-pity-system" data-injectable="false">What is the Pity System?</h2> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">Pity in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is a system that allows you to get a guaranteed five-star character or weapon after 80 convenes. While you can get a five-star before this point, reaching 80 guarantees ensures you&nbsp;won’t go&nbsp;without a reward for hundreds of pulls. While you’re not initially guaranteed to get an event’s featured character from the pity system, the odds increase to 50 percent once you get a pity roll. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio (YouTube)</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">There’s also another layer to the pity system. If you activate the pity system and don’t get the featured Resonator on your first go, the next activation guarantees your next five-star will be the featured one. In other words, if you’re determined to get a particular Resonator from an event, such as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-pull-for-jiyan-or-yinlin-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jiyan or Yinlin</a>, you’ll eventually get it if you reach pity twice. </p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">The exception to this is the Novice Convene, which grants you a guaranteed five-star Resonator for every 50 Convenes. That way, if you’re a beginner player who wants a head start on obtaining powerful five-star characters or weapons, it’ll be much easier to reach pity if you don’t have the best luck with your gacha pulls.</p> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio (YouTube)</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-guaranteed-5-star-character-or-weapon" data-injectable="false">How to get a guaranteed 5-star character or weapon</h2> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Alongside the pity system,&nbsp;<em>Wuthering Waves</em>&nbsp;has targeted Convene events, allowing you to choose the character you get after 80 Convenes. That way, if you want a particular Resonator, you can guarantee you’ll get that specific character once you activate pity.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">The first time you’ll encounter this is during the Beginner’s Choice Convene, which offers the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-5-star-selector-character-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five following Selector Resonators</a>:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Jianxin</li> <li>Calcharo</li> <li>Verina</li> <li>Lingyang</li> <li>Encore</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Game Studio (YouTube)</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">By picking one of these five characters during the Beginner’s Choice Convene, your next pity roll will include your chosen Resonator. You can also do this with&nbsp;Weapon&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;Convenes if you need a particular weapon for one of your characters.</p> <h2 id="h-all-wuthering-waves-event-types-and-wishes" data-injectable="false">All Wuthering Waves event types and wishes</h2> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true"><em>Wuthering Wave’s</em> pity system applies to all Character and Weapon Convene events, allowing you to reach pity in either. Below is each event type and their required currencies:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Convene Tide</th><th data-align="center">Banner Event</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Lustrous Tide</td><td data-align="center">Novice Convene and Standard Convene</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Radiant Tide</td><td data-align="center">Character Event Convene</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Forging Tide</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Event Convene</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">You’ll receive Lustrous, Radiant, and Forging Tide from log-in rewards, ongoing events, and by purchasing using Astrite, a premium currency in <em>Wuthering Waves.</em></p>

<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-voice-cast-and-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>&nbsp;has yet&nbsp;to make a console debut, players wonder whether or not controller support will be available. Thankfully, a developer update has given us some insight into this feature, and we’re here to explain what to expect.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-can-you-play-wuthering-waves-with-a-controller" data-injectable="false">Can you play Wuthering Waves with a controller?</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">During a special broadcast, the game’s development team states, “We are largely done with the gamepad controller support,” indicating that <strong><em>Wuthering Waves&nbsp;</em>will have controller support</strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>However, it’s important to note that the availability of this feature at launch is still&nbsp;uncertain, depending on the game’s progress.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Wuthering Waves | Special Broadcast Program | 2024/03/29" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRIl3JqxfVk?start=1509&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><em>Wuthering Waves’&nbsp;</em>controller support has undergone significant development. Initially absent during the beta tests, it was a feature that players were keen to see. In response to their feedback, Kuro Game Studio finally worked on a new update to implement this mechanic, including customizable key settings. The studio also aims to improve experiences across all platforms for a much more responsive and smoother gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Considering that&nbsp;the special broadcast was revealed&nbsp;some time ago, controller support could be ready for the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-the-exact-release-time-of-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official release</a>. It will likely include PlayStation 4 and 5 controller support, given that these devices will be available at a later date. Xbox may not&nbsp;be included, as <em>Wuthering Waves</em> has only been involved with PC, PlayStation, and mobile.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="false">We’ll update this guide to confirm controller support availability upon launch. However, it may not arrive until afterward, possibly with a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-all-confirmed-launch-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new update</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24160618/cool-sword-day-phantom-blade-world-of-warcraft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wRh9fc">The coolest sword I ever obtained in a video game is the Phantom Blade in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/world-of-warcraft"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>. In fact, it’s so cool to me that I never parted with it. It’s still sitting in my original character’s bank vault, some 19 years after I first got it — even though its stats have been squished almost to nothing by the multiple math resets the venerable online game has had over the years, and even though that character has now far outleveled the point at which the sword would be useful.</p>

<p id="oISITC">What makes the Phantom Blade cool? It’s not a special weapon, although it’s not bad. It’s not some Legendary boss drop earned through the blood, sweat, and tantrums of a raid party. It’s not even Epic — just a run-of-the-mill blue Rare. It doesn’t hold a special place within Warcraft lore, it’s no Ashbringer or Frostmourne. It’s just… a sword. But to me, it’s not just any sword.</p>
<p id="c3xC8b">Back in 2005 — or now, if you’re playing on Blizzard’s Classic servers that (more or less) replicate the game as it was then — the Phantom Blade was a decent, crafted weapon for mid- to high-level characters, though definitely not endgame gear. It could be used from level 44 (the cap was then 60), at which point it was pretty nifty, and would stay competitive until probably the early 50s.</p>

<p id="DedtEi">The damage stats are OK, and it has a useful “proc” (a chance to trigger an effect on hit): it decreases the target’s armor for 20 seconds, and prevents them from entering stealth or turning invisible during that time. This made it a coveted weapon in <em>WoW</em>’s player-versus-player community for dealing with annoying Rogue players (and was thus hated by Rogues). The thing is, I never played PvP.</p>
<p id="KURPAU">My original <em>WoW</em> character was a Warrior. I didn’t want to play a Warrior, really; I fancied either a Hunter or a Druid, but when I joined the game, my friends’ guild already had plenty of those and was short of tanks, so it was deemed that a Warrior I should be. I did not take to it — I’m terrible at tanking, and when it comes to playing a damage-dealing role, <em>WoW </em>has other classes I prefer. I moved on to a Hunter main eventually, but that Warrior still has a special place in my heart. In my headcanon he has an endearing, good-natured ineptitude about him, and the adventures we went on, discovering Blizzard’s extraordinary creation together, are unforgettable. Anyway, while not a specifically great weapon for Warriors, the Phantom Blade’s armor debuff was quite handy when tanking.</p>
<p id="qfeUKD">But that wasn’t why I coveted it either. No, I wanted a Phantom Blade for two, very shallow, reasons. One: true to its name, it is a ghostly sword with a curving, translucent blade that gives off a soft, bluish glow. It looks <em>sick</em>. Two: unlike almost every other one-handed weapon in the game, the Phantom Blade shows across the character’s back when at rest, rather than at the side as if hanging off the belt. For a tanking warrior, that means it’s carried diagonally underneath a shield. This looks unique — and <em>sick as hell</em>.</p>
<p id="smmrgY">Man, I wanted a Phantom Blade so much. Have you ever gotten like this, when you covet a virtual item with an intense, almost painful hunger, just as much as you could want something in real life? That’s how much I wanted a Phantom Blade.</p>

<p id="Sr62pZ">The only way to get a Phantom Blade is for a character with the blacksmithing profession to craft one. I couldn’t afford the prices it was going for at the auction house, and my Warrior character was an engineer, so I needed our guild blacksmith to make it for me. These things weren’t that easy or cheap to make — you needed mithril <em>and </em>truesilver bars, several aquamarine gems, some rarish Breath of Wind drops, plus two lesser invisibility potions, meaning an alchemist needed to get involved too.</p>
<p id="0e3iv0">As I remember it, I mined the raw metals myself, but my guildmates pulled together the rest of it as a gift to me. Maybe they knew I didn’t really enjoy the tanking they’d made me do, and were making up for that. Maybe they were just being nice. We would do stuff like that for each other, in those days before every <em>WoW </em>expansion became a ruthlessly optimized race to the finish line. One reason my Warrior-engineer leveled slowly and wasn’t a very good Warrior is that I set myself the goal of crafting an entirely pointless mechanical squirrel pet for every single member of the guild. This took <em>ages</em>, and it was a real chore, but also maybe the most fun I ever had playing<em> WoW</em>.</p>
<p id="UIGgjK">So that’s why I still hang on to my Phantom Blade. My friends made it for me, and it reminds me of them — and of a time when this incredible game was an all-consuming engine of wonder for us to discover together.</p>
<p id="tyLBHJ">Also, it looks really fucking cool.</p>

In his typical joking manner, Reynolds said Deadpool and Wolverine is nothing more than a paper-thin sequel that will lower your IQ. It should be fun and raise your heart rate, though, so that's something.</p><p>"We're very excited to be joining you July 26, but we should set the table correctly. This film is as paper thin as a sequel to Battlefield Earth. We're mostly going to beat each other senseless, make enemies with Disney, tell a few dick jokes, make a few jokes at my expense, make a lot of jokes at Hugh's expense, and completely sidestep Marvel's mandated after-credits sequence, which if you haven't figured it out yet, is always just a commercial for another movie which will invariably end with a commercial for another movie," Reynolds said.</p><p>He added: "So sit back, relax, let us lower your IQ and raise your heart rate while we travel to a vapid Dreamland, a place where grown men and grown women walk around in tights, and act like it's not a giant cultural cry for help. This is cinema."</p><p>While a lot of this statement is pretty funny and silly, the line about Deadpool and Wolverine not having an after-credits sequence is noteworthy (if Reynolds was being serious here). Most Marvel movies have a post-credits sequence that tees up the next Marvel movie, but it seems Deadpool and Wolverine won't do this, for whatever reason. Or maybe Reynolds was joking about this too.</p><p>Deadpool and Wolverine releases on July 26, and it is Marvel's one and only film in 2024. Some of Marvel's upcoming films for 2025 include Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts, and The Fantastic Four.</p><p>In other Deadpool and Wolverine news, ticket-seller Fandango recently announced that the movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-and-wolverine-has-strongest-day-one-ticket-pre-sales-in-franchise-history-at-fandango/1100-6523599/" data-ref-id="1100-6523599">broke first-day sales records</a>.

The business also holds shares in <em>Outside Xbox, Digital Foundry</em> and Hookshot (which operates <em>Nintendolife, PushSquare, PureXbox</em> and <em>Time Extension</em>).</p>
<p>IGN Entertainment is the division of Ziff Davis that includes <em>IGN</em>, <em>MapGenie</em>, <em>HowLongToBeat</em>, and Humble Bundle. It has acquired the websites from PAX and New York Comic-Con organiser ReedPop, which initially bought the Gamer Network business in 2018.</p>
<p>Not included in the sale are UK-based events EGX or MCM, or the digital brand Popverse, which remain with ReedPop.</p>

In the game, you cannot progress without restoring the wetlands: they have a carbon capture gauge and a biodiversity score, and you need those two for the frog collecting aspect both because rare frogs will only show in restored wetlands but also for collecting insects that you feed your frogs with.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/the-very-best-way-the-games-industry-can-reduce-its-carbon-footprint" target="_self">The very best way the games industry can reduce its carbon footprint</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The same is true the other way around: you need the reputation points that your frog refuge generates to unlock more effective wetland restoration tools. This way, the two aspects are carefully balanced and complementary. We do not try to impose an eco-friendly message on players; we follow the rule “show, don’t tell.” The wetlands are restored and beautiful, and the cute frogs are happy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into creating so many different types of cute frogs for players to collect? How did you develop such a variety of fun frogs for players to find?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of people ask us if the frogs’ species are based on real-life frogs, but unlike most of the rest in the game, the answer is no. With the collecting aspect, and with a video game with a lot of tiny elements, you need the patterns to be very distinctive from each other so that you immediately know if it’s already part of your collection or not. And because we want the game to be fun and appealing, we needed big, recognizable, cute frogs that pop on the screen and catch the players’ attention. We thus had to invent fantasy patterns for the frogs that would be easily recognizable and combine them with a certain number of colors to have a wide range of possible frogs while maintaining a certain level of readability. Right now, the full game contains eight patterns of frogs, with eight possible colors for primary and secondary colors, which puts the frog count at 512.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>LIkewise, how did you decide on the various biomes and places across the world where players would collect their frogs?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted the different biomes to be quite distinctive from each other, from the color palette to the different types of native vegetation you would find. We also thought it would be fun for players all around the world to discover other types of biomes than the ones they know and meet all sorts of local characters. Luckily there are tons of different wetlands around the globe!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first biome is kind of a Western peatland that you would find, for example, in the northern parts of Germany. The second biome is a Billabong, a certain type of Australian wetland based on dead river arms that flood in winter and get dry in the summer. The third one is an Indonesian mangrove located near the coastline, with trees and vegetation adapted to a mix of saline and sweet water.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each is restored differently, but they all contribute to carbon capture in their own way and need to be preserved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us a bit about the research that went into the game? How did you learn about wetlands and other environmental elements and how those shaped the development of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game remains a game; it is not an educational game on frogs or wetlands, so we did some research, but not at a scientific level. The frogs being fantasy frogs helped a lot in this aspect!</span></p><p>Images via Armor Games Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into picking the ways that players would interact with those biomes in order to draw frogs to them? How did you design a variety of different environmental activities players would take part in to teach them about biodiversity while making them light enough that the game would not get bogged down in complex ideas?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We kept the environmental activities really light and drew inspiration from common city-building games where you just place elements along a grid and watch them interact. The biodiversity part was trickier: we wanted players to restore a wetland, but not by just planting a ton of the same crop. We had to account for the balance between the crops and convey that to the players in the most simple way. So, we came up with what we call a “Bioscore,” which is how biodiversity influences your carbon capture to come up with a unified score. If one of the crops is lagging behind, we nudge the player to plant more of it through a simple set of icons in the wetland dashboard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there are more optional environmental activities, like picking up nettle to make powder, installing beehives and insect hotels, etc. But they’re not as crucial as the biodiversity aspect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Your environmentally conscious message is carefully run through not just the game, but how you developed it to be lightweight and work on older computers as well. Can you tell us what appealed to you about creating a game that would work on a wider variety of computer specs? What challenges did you face as creators in getting </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> to be able to work on more machines?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We are developing the game with Godot Engine, which is naturally built for lightweightness and performance on low-tier machines. It also allows us to target a lot of platforms all at once, thanks to the thousands of open-source contributors working together to achieve that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because the game is in the cozy genre, one of our biggest goals was to port the game to the Nintendo Switch, which has specs that do not compare well with high-end PCs, so we were mindful in each of our design decisions that it didn’t impact performance too much.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We are also quite a small team, with a small budget, strong 2D expertise, and developing the game on our own old-ish computers, so all of that makes us savvy in every way!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What effect do you hope your game has on the player? What thoughts do you hope your game inspires?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As is probably the case for every game developer out there, we would be glad if we could bring joy to as many players as possible. More specifically, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kamaeru</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is designed to make players feel good and relaxed after a long day, bringing them some peace to their busy minds. We hope that through the story, they feel reinvigorated about working together with others for the greater good, and that they see how beautiful wetlands can be. And maybe—and that would be the cherry on the cake—build a small pond in their yard or contribute to local wetlands or biodiversity initiatives!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players must capture scenes as they unfold (for better or worse) in the guise of a producer-meets-director, honing in on certain shots to placate specific demographics (like 'Butt Guys' or 'Foodies') and casting characters to spark dramatics or genuine affection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The interactions responsible for nurturing or torching relationships, however, are the product of Rigmarole. He explains Rigmarole represented the "biggest technical challenge" because it had to be a narrative system capable of accounting for a myriad of factors such as character traits, background details, audience preferences, and more. She says Rigmarole really only began to take shape over the past year, and notes that in the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> prototype all conversations were hard coded to provide some early flavor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the project finally moved forward, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> writing team began cobbling together dialogue in a tool called Scripto, which she says is a "very nice web interface for writing scripts." Nerial then devised a tool that could easily pull those scripts into Unity and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As He explains, it was a "priority for us that our writers were able to write freely."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those scripts added more depth to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> roster of housemates, which features 12 "wild, sexy singles" each with their own unique personality traits. Although only four can compete in each season, players will be able to mix-and-match characters with repeat playthroughs to see who might fall in love—or perhaps become sworn enemies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We reduced them to personality traits," says He. "Those are the things that are important about them. So we spreadsheeted it all our to ensure there's a good mix of people being attracted to each other, or not attracted to each other. Then, one thing Francois did was come up with a system for us to design all the individual scripts that would happen based on the relationships and different types of attractions [in play.]"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="In reality television, every contestant has a role to play">In reality television, every contestant has a role to play</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That system is Rigmarole. It has to manage around 50,000 lines of dialogue and in the words of Alliot is "quite complex."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's a system that takes the characters and their traits and defines whether they're attracted to each other and their basic dynamics," explains Alliot. "Then we have what we call the 'saga,' which are groups of events spread across a schedule. Within that saga we have protagonists with defined roles—so [one cast member] Damien might be 'the seducer,' for example."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those factors will impact other characters depending on their respective traits and roles, letting Nerial create melodrama that's very "granular" based on specific, but fluctuating, attributes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier in our chat, He explains there's potentially 400 ways to combine those 12 cast members, and that means balancing has been a gradual—but critical—process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have a very definitive point at which the game goes from 'doesn't work' to 'it works.' There's no building up scene after scene after scene," explains Alliot. "It's more about building up all the possible matches to make things fully defined and add some flow."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That slow refinement informed Nerial's decision to keep the project—which has been in development for around five years—under wraps for so long. "It's not the type of game where you can have a vertical slice early on, where everything is super polished and nice and then you just build it out from there," says He.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Especially because of the procedural aspect and the big systems that needed to be build from the ground up. So we're finally at a stage where it's ready to be shown."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for how Nerial hopes the game will resonate with players, He claims </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> aims to replicate the power fantasy of producing reality television while also posing a few "existential questions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of my core pillars creatively is that [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] gives you the feelings you'd get from watching reality television—which is things that are silly and funny. But also an important emotion when watching reality television is cringe leaning into fear, dread, and horror," she adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A lot of the dark aspects and mystery of the game plays into that. I think people seek those types of emotions when they watch reality TV. It's not easy viewing. It's actually very painful to watch. You have really heightened emotions, and that's one of the things we wanted to emulate."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re not far out from the release of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, the first DLC expansion for 2022’s excellent <em>Elden Ring</em>. Today, we got a story trailer detailing just what’s in store, including some pretty significant story for one of the leading players: Miquella.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">Called “Miquella the Kind” in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uT8wGtB3yQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a>, the offspring of Radagon and Marika, twin to Malenia, the demigod is a focal point of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. In today’s trailer, we hear about a seduction, and betrayal; an “affair from which Gold arose, and so too was Shadow born.”</p> <figure data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">The ensuing, unseen war highlights the “tyranny of Messmer’s flame,” which seems to coat the royal city of Leyndell. We’re also reminded of Miquella’s sacrifice, giving up his flesh, strength, and “even his fate” for a cause. But as the trailer asserts, “we” are not deterred, implying Miquella’s followers still persist in the Lands Between.</p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">There’s a lot to unpack here. I have no doubt the lore folks will pore over this trailer in the coming days, as it hints towards information on one of <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s still-lingering threads in Miquella <em>and </em>hints towards history we might not have been directed to, before now. This war that could not be sung sure seems chaotic.</p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, we won’t be waiting long. <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is only about a month away, arriving on June 21, 2024. Though it’ll cost <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$39.99</a>, the expansion is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dlcs-map-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-limgrave/1100-6521275/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also set to be fairly big</a>, so it seems like FromSoft fans will have a lot to chew on near the end of June.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From Software and Bandai Namco have released a new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>story trailer that sets up the narrative for the upcoming DLC expansion.</p>

<p>As the trailer begins, a voiceover speaks about "the seduction and the betrayal" that gave rise to both Gold and Shadow. It's all preceded by a mention of "Miquella the Kind", the central figure around which&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>will seemingly revolve.</p>

<p>Following this introduction, we hear about a "war unseen" as giant flame constructs march across a city. The voiceover describes the war as "a purge without grace or honor", led by "the tyranny of Messmer's flame".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer-messmer.jpg?itok=GXpXyTi3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer-messmer.jpg?itok=UGMCgfNP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Messmer will play an important role in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We then hear that Kindly Miquella has "abandon[ed] everything" as we see a series of marks that look a lot like one of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Great Runes. Since these are usually held by gods and demigods, we can perhaps infer that this is Miquella's Great Rune.</p>

<p>Miquella has seemingly stripped himself of his "Golden flesh" and "even his fate" in order to venture into the Land of Shadow, although we're still not sure exactly what he's doing there.</p>

<p>The voiceover says that "we", presumably referring to the group of Tarnished we see in the trailer, "are not deterred". It seems, then, that you'll be following in Miquella's footsteps as he roams the Land of Shadow, and you'll presumably find out what happened to the realm along the way.</p>

All we knew then was the DLC would take place in the Land of Shadow and feature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158964/fromsoftware-just-debuted-their-bloodiest-monster-yet">a bunch of new horrors</a> straight from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18272238/hsekiro-shadows-die-twice-idetaka-miyazaki-interview-dark-souls">slightly warped imagination of game director Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>.</p></div><p>This new Land of Shadow was connected somehow to Miquella — the dude in the egg with the withered arm. The trailer mentions him prominently, giving the impression we’ll learn more about him, his connection to the Land of Shadow, and what events led him to abandon the place to its fiery fate. </p><p>Speaking of fiery fate, the trailer also spends its short runtime on Messmer, the red-haired hottie with the snakes who seems like he’ll be the DLC’s final boss. (Although you never can tell with FromSoftware games. Once you think you’ve beaten the final boss, some cosmic entity arrives and blows up your last flask of healing.) Messmer is apparently responsible for the great purge of the Land of Shadow, and I’m curious to know why. </p><p>The story trailer was short and light and cryptic, as FromSoftware stories tend to be. I’m looking forward to the <em>hours</em> of YouTube deep dives I’ll digest as creators (shout out to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fc%2FIronPineapple">Iron Pineapple</a>) extrapolate the deepest of lore from the smallest of moments. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> launches on June 21st on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a> is out now, and on PC, it’s a demanding but visually dazzling experience if you’ve got the hardware (check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessio’s review of the game running on an RTX 4090 here</a>), but what about consoles? Before launch, it was revealed that Hellblade II would only have a single 30fps visual mode on Xbox Series X/S, but at least that narrow focus would mean the game would consistently nail that 30fps, right? Well, about that… the folks at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> have taken the Xbox versions of Hellblade II for a spin, and the results aren’t quite as solid as you might hope. Check out the full analysis below if you have around 15 minutes to spare, or scroll on down for our rundown of the salient points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hellblade 2 | Xbox Series S/X - PC  | Graphics Comparison | Analista De Bits" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UNwO6WZD0cg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the above analysis, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II runs at a dynamic 2560x1070p with an average res of around 2304x963p on Xbox Series X and a dynamic 1920x803p with an average of 1472x615p on Xbox Series S (the resolutions are rather wonky due to the game running in “cinematic” 2.39:1 widescreen mode with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen). In terms of visual quality, the Series X looks very similar to the PC on higher settings, while the Series S is a bit lower quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither the Xbox Series X or S seems to be able to maintain a consistent 30fps. While both hit 30fps perhaps 80 percent of the time, dips look to be common during more visually lush and action-packed scenes. The Xbox Series X can drop into the mid-20fps range, and the Xbox Series S can plunge all the way down to the low 20s. Oddly, the two systems seem to struggle at slightly different points, perhaps tied to how each system handles its dynamic resolution.</p>
<p>At least for now, it seems like Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II may be the game that’s just a bit too pretty for the Xbox Series X/S. Here’s hoping a bit more optimization can be brought to the table in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is available now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161532/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8WR4Aw">FromSoftware released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> expansion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079297/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-release-date-editions-messmer-impaler"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> on Tuesday, giving fans of the open-world fantasy adventure a fresh look at the DLC’s story. That includes new details on its imposing new villain, Messmer the Impaler, a powerful demigod who appears to have a strong connection to characters from the original <em>Elden Ring</em> story.</p>
<p id="tDgdhG"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s new trailer also hints at what sent the demigod <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131400/elden-ring-dlc-miquella-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Miquella</a> to a new land, one that was crushed under the tyranny of Messmer’s flame, and for which Miquella sacrificed himself. The trailer ends with the followers of Miquella joining forces and beckoning new warriors to join them on their journey to depose Messmer and his burning legions.</p>
<p id="tHLtXA">Our latest look at <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is something we’ve come to expect from FromSoft: a CG trailer that dives deeper into the opaque lore of <em>Elden Ring</em> and doesn’t offer anything in the way of new gameplay. But for students of <em>Elden Ring</em> myth, it’s a rich vein of information about characters and their allegiances in this complicated family story.</p>
<p id="TMAuFL"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23991138/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-release-date-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> will send players to an unexplored region known as the Land of Shadow, just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24087766/how-to-start-dlc-access-point-location-miquellas-cocoon">a short egg ride from Mohgwyn Palace</a>. There, in a landmass roughly the size of the game’s Limgrave region, they’ll explore the dark realm and follow in the footsteps of the mysterious Empyrean Miquella.</p>
<p id="8UmUEq"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will be released on June 21. The expansion is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via Steam, just like the original <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-delta-force-hawk-ops-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new trailer has been published online ahead of Summer Games Fest, showcasing around one minute of stunning vistas and sumptuous visuals from Delta Force: Hawk Ops. This is a game that’s fast entering mythical status, as despite a few teaser sequences surfacing online and the developer – TiMi Studio – hyping the game up, we’re yet to see tangible evidence that it’s a real thing that we’ll be able to play any time soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-hawk-down">Black Hawk Down</h2>



<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops looks like a fever dream for a Battlefield fan. It boasts large-scale combat fused with vehicular warfare, destructible environments, and real-world, gritty gunplay reminiscent of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield, which were often considered the peak of the franchise. In one recent Delta Force trailer, we looked at some concerning content, such as a ‘specialist-based’ operating system and some bizarre, out-of-place in-game abilities bordering on the ‘basically out of place’ kind of level.</p>



<p>In the most recent Delta Force: Hawk Ops trailer, we’re given a one-minute-long look at some in-game locales, as well as a slew of weapons. The short video shows some tasty lighting elements and some dynamic weather effects, but aside from the character doing the ‘super slow trailer walk’ through what might be a series of multiplayer maps, there isn’t much to take away:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Delta Force: Hawk Ops | Official Summer Game Fest 2024 Teaser" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kl-Hgelwc9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It looks good, but it’s hard to see it being anything more than a Battlefield clone at the moment. Even some of the naming conventions for the multiplayer modes (‘Hazard Operations’) are a bit close to the line. On June 7, we’ll get a deeper look at Delta Force: Hawk Ops as the game gets <strong>yet another trailer </strong>at Summer Game Fest.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Official Switch Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The original Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/1900-6110235/" data-ref-id="1900-6110235">glowing praise even back in 2004</a>. This enhanced HD remaster on Switch can be bought digitally and physically for $60.</p><p>You can see a few review scores for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2024). For more reviews, be sure to visit GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Game:</strong> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2024)</li><li><strong>Platform:</strong> Nintendo Switch</li><li><strong>Developer:</strong> Intelligent Systems/Nintendo</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 23, 2024</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $60</li></ul><h2>GameSpot -- 9/10</h2><p>"The Switch version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive way to play the best turn-based RPG starring Mario. More of an enhanced HD remaster than a full-fledged remake, The Thousand-Year Door has small yet meaningful quality-of-life features that ease some of the bloat from the original GameCube version. The catchy remixed soundtrack wonderfully complements the thoroughly entertaining and dynamic turn-based battle system. Throw in a stellar cast of characters and consistently playful writing, and The Thousand-Year Door has all the ingredients of an incredible turn-based RPG. Well, it always had them, but now they are blended a bit better." -- <em>Steven Petite </em>[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/" data-ref-id="1900-6418230">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Digital Trends -- 9/10</h2><p>"If you were hoping that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Nintendo was a thorough remake that redefines a classic, you may come away from this Switch remake disappointed. Thankfully, The Thousand-Year Door still holds up 20 years after release, thanks to some hilarious dialogue, timeless visuals, and an approachable RPG battle system." -- <em>Tomas Franzese</em> [<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-nintendo-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Shack News -- 9/10</h2><p>"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door might be ever so slightly dated in its first two chapters and its insistence on loading every area with too many enemies. Its bizarre cast, excellent writing, and inventive battles mean it earns its reputation as one of the best and most inventive RPGs, though, and it’s just as fresh and imaginative now as it ever was." -- <em>Josh Broadwell</em> [<a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/139935/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-switch-review-score" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>TheGamer -- 8/10</h2><p>"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door will probably be the last Mario game to release (solely) on the Switch. While Wonder will take the plaudits, porting this cult classic means that a new generation of players can experience it. New fans will have a ball, laughing along with Mario &amp; co., even if their experience will be slightly marred by the backtracking and pacing. Old fans will enjoy the quality of life improvements and some new additions. Whether you’re a Paper Mario veteran or this is your first time entering his origami world, this is the definitive way to experience The Thousand-Year Door." -- <em>Ben Sledge</em> [<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Wccftech -- 8/10</h2><p>"While I may have come off somewhat critical of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in this review, there’s still an undeniable richness and depth to its world that no other game in the series has quite managed to achieve. Rogueport, with its varied cast of ne’er-do-wells and weirdos and countless secrets, is still one of my favorite locales I’ve ever visited with Nintendo’s plumber. Even with its minor streamlining, the new TTYD still serves up a solid 25-hour story with plenty of side content to clean up, including perhaps some small new post-game treats. This papery adventure definitely isn’t a lightweight." -- <em>Nathan Birch</em> [<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Jeuxvideo.com -- 7.5/10</h2><p>"This remastered version maintains the excellence of its pen with a cast of characters each as striking as the next with a combat system that has already proven itself. The modernized artistic direction works wonders, both visually and aurally. But form is not everything. The structure of the game can quickly weigh on anyone who is allergic to the multiple forced back and forth, especially since the features to relieve this archaic architecture are too little impactful to relieve its heaviness." -- <em>Charlanmhg</em> [<a href="https://www.jeuxvideo.com/test/1886203/c-est-l-un-des-meilleurs-jeux-video-mario-de-son-genre-et-il-arrive-sur-nintendo-switch-20-ans-apres-paper-mario-la-porte-millenaire-est-il-toujours-indemodable.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow. The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.</p>
