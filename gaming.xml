			<p>A new datamine points from <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611">X (formerly Twitter) user ModernWarzone</a> points to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/">the battle royale mode</a> for Battlefield 6 shadow-dropping next week when the game's Season 1 update arrives on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, the new mode which is codenamed "<em>Granite</em>" will be fully revealed first on October 27 with a trailer before it goes live the next day on October 28. It's worth noting that we've heard nothing concrete from EA and Battlefield Studios about when the battle royale mode will arrive, and that it has not been included in any promotional materials for the game's Season 1 roadmap.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: A new content drop for Battlefield 6 that is NOT Season 1 codenamed “Granite” with release date of October 28th has been datamined from the EA App. 🗓️</p><p>Think it’s safe to say this is the BF6 Battle Royale. 🪂</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/onebattlefield?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@onebattlefield</a> for sending the info over to me 🫡 <a href="https://t.co/H3xaZpWmne">pic.twitter.com/H3xaZpWmne</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, this is partly due to EA not wanting to immediately pull focus away from Battlefield 6's core offering, its multiplayer modes. If that's true, then that's likely because the coming battle royale will be free-to-play and likely a separate offering compared to the core Battlefield 6 game. Essentially, it'll be just like how you can play Call of Duty: Warzone for free, but to jump into the multiplayer for the new annual Call of Duty release, you'll have to buy the latest entry.</p>



<p>Just yesterday from the time of this writing, Wccftech and several other media outlets <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">shared hands-on impressions with the Season 1 content set to arrive next week</a>, including the new maps and game modes, the first batch of which arrives on October 28, the second on November 18, and the third on December 9.</p>



<p>The new maps both look stunning and like they'll be solid additions to Battlefield 6, but the new game modes, both the permanent one arriving next week and the limited-time mode coming in November failed to impress, and at least in their current state, are rather stale and boring.</p>



<p>If this battle royale mode does arrive next week, then that certainly gives Season 1 a huge boost compared to what it already has available. </p>

            <p>Watch out. There's a musician mystery afoot. They've gone missing, mysteriously. So says Silver Pines, a Twin Peaks-inspired survival horror puzzler that's set to arrive next year, according to an announcement trailer that's just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">barged into my house</a> in a trench coat, waving a gun about and demanding to know whether I did it.</p>
<p>No, I respond calmly, there are no missing musicians around here. For a moment, I fear he might notice the outline of a guitar's headstock buried under the carpet. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, he says, as all detective-ish types do. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...</p>

<p>I try to distract him by asking for more information about Silver Pines. It's by developers Wych Elm, he says. You must roam the small town filled with horrors to survive, doing puzzles to unlock different areas and managing your resources. Arrrrrrggghhhhhh, I scream, resource management! Shhhhh, he replies, let me read you the plot synopsis to calm you down:</p>
<blockquote>Private investigator Red Walker finds himself in Silver Pines, a place half-abandoned, half-forgotten, in the middle of nowhere on a job to track down vanished musician Eddie Velvet. As the case begins to reveal a dark past, Walker soon slips into a strange and nightmarish descent beyond his control.</blockquote>
<p>The exploration's a bit Metroidvaniay, he claims, and you'll need to find better tools and weapons to open up more bits. Ok, I reply, the roaming around a small town as a moody investigator clearly going through some shit intrigues me, even if this certainly isn't pitching itself to be as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>y in an RPG sense as my brain sort of wishes it was.</p><p>It's set to arrive at some point in 2026, he says, and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333000/Silver_Pines/">Steam</a>. Nice, I respond, hoping the ensuing awkward silence will drive him away. He turns towards the door, takes a few steps, and brutally stubs his toe on the telltale head. Watch out, I whisper as he writhes on the floor.</p>

            <p>Looking back on it, when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockbeasts-is-about-managing-an-animal-band-in-a-bojack-style-world-but-itll-need-to-do-more-than-horse-around">played a preview build</a> of zoological band management game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rockbeasts">Rockbeasts</a> earlier this year, I think I went along with it a bit too easily. I didn't question why people were now animals, how those animals had acquired the opposable thumbs necessary to play Black Sabbath riffs, or whether the bulldog version of Simon Cowell I signed up with at the end might have any ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Luckily, the clearly Bojack Horseman-inspired game about trying to get some musicians you've dubbed Pearl Spam to their gig on time, so they can jam out in their silly hats, has a gotten a fresh trailer at today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies showcase</a> that asks some of those questions for me.</p>

<p>I'll admit, I didn't think too hard about the whole furry angle. Mainly because I was afraid of potential retaliation from the unaccountable security services they operate in order to support their efforts to bend the will of the world to their own greedy purposes. Actually, wait, maybe I'm getting them mixed up with the billionaires.</p><p>Either way, this trailer offers a few quick peeks at stuff and scenes that weren't in the opening chapter of developers Lichthund's game that I've played. I, regretfully, am yet to pick a colour for a guitar or meet the llama version of Lemmy from Motorhead. I did, however, meet the cat guy who sings towards the end. He was cool. Here's an excerpt from my musings:</p>
<blockquote>All in all, there’s potential here, and some indication in the intro - which scored big GTA 4 nostalgia points with me by having Iggy Pop host a rock radio station - that the events of you guiding the band to superstardom in the 90s will echo into what they’re up to nearer the present day. If Rockbeasts is to properly sell out stadiums, though, it’ll have to prove it’s more than just a tribute band.</blockquote>
<p>Rockbeasts remains release dateless for now, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1445880/ROCKBEASTS/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dualsense-edge-controller-playstation-5-review-kotaku-1850018508"><span>agreed to review the DualSense Edge</span></a><span> for this here </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>period com, I didn’t know I was getting ready to break my brain from decades of video game muscle memory habits. I hadn’t used a modular controller before, and I wanted to approach the PS5 premium controller from the perspective of someone who maybe didn’t see what all the fuss was about. Every video game I play already has button assignments for any action I could do. What was the point of putting two extras on the back? But once I saw the light, it became nearly impossible for me to go back to a standard DualSense, and when I do hold one of the default controllers, I feel my fingers scratching at the back for back paddles that are no longer there.</span></p> <p><span>This came up today because Sony is selling a </span><a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-god-of-war-20th-anniversary-limited-edition"><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>20th anniversary DualSense controller</span></a><span> stylized to look like the titular god Kratos’ ash-white skin and blood-red tattoos. I like the design of the controller a lot, and even if I didn’t love </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-release-date-ps4-ps5-spear-1849734382"><i><span>Ragnarök</span></i></a> <span>(the excellent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244"><i><span>Valhalla </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> really brought me around on it, though), Kratos still occupies a cozy little place in my heart. In another life, I would have scooped it up, even at the whopping $85 price point. But that hefty chunk of change gave me pause. That’s grocery money for a controller that, in all likelihood, I wasn’t going to use. I’ve become so accustomed to having back paddles after two years of playing games with my DualSense Edge that the standard PS5 controller feels almost like a toy in my hands. So if I did buy this Kratos-themed controller, it would probably just be a display item. And that’s a pretty expensive thing to stick on shelf space I don’t have here in the Big Apple.</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve bought controllers I don’t use before. I own an Xbox Pride controller that sits on my shelf next to all my </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>stuff because </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lgbtq-games-mass-effect-romance-options-overwatch-pride-1850586480"><span>Kaidan Alenko made me gay as a teenager</span></a><span>. But that was a special case where I saw something covered in rainbows and reacted accordingly. Nowadays, I default to my DualSense Edge whenever I can, so I’m not just picky with my money, I’m picky with my controllers. The Edge isn’t even the best version of a modular controller, as it’s pretty limited compared to its contemporaries like the Xbox Elite, but it has rewired my brain to reach for back paddles in shooters and action games.</span></p>

 <p><span>The moment it all changed for me was when I was testing the Edge for our review while playing </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>. As I described in my review, a Pharah was flying behind my team’s backline and shooting rockets down upon my helpless supports. As Soldier: 76, I reloaded while turning around to shoot down my airborne foe. I had mapped the square button to the right paddle and could turn the right analog stick with my thumb to change where I was facing, rather than having to pick between the two actions. That split-second difference saved me from getting blown up, and it was all thanks to this bougie-ass controller. It’s such a small change, but I’ve gotten so used to having the option that my brain defaults to it now. I usually have jump mapped to the left paddle and either reload or dodge on the right. For the longest time, I would have to remap buttons in action games to the default </span><i><span>Devil May Cry </span></i><span>control scheme because I spent so much time playing the old PS2 games that the layout had hardwired itself into my brain. The circle button is the dodge button, right? It’s supposed to be! Now, my hands naturally search for a back paddle to move out of the way. Even when I’m playing games on my Switch 2 like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, I’m wishing I had an easy dodge button on the back of my Joy-Cons.</span></p> <p><span>I know it’s an unreasonable ask, but I would be so much more inclined to buy these special controllers if Sony made Edge variants, so I didn’t feel like I was sacrificing function for the sake of the aesthetic. And now it’s hard for me to justify buying collector’s items when my tiny apartment only has so much room. You think I didn’t want that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ps5-controller-last-of-us-dualsense-ugly-price-sony-1851768135"><span>kinda dumb-looking </span><i><span>Last of Us </span></i><span>controller</span></a><span>? Although now that I’m looking at it, I probably could have fit it on my </span><i><span>TLOU </span></i><span>shelf next to the Joel statue. Actually, never mind, I looked at the price again. Maybe I should look into modding these controllers myself. There’s gotta be some sicko out there who’s willing to mess with all the circuitry and put these back paddles on the Kratos controller.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tormented-souls-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tormented-souls-2-review.1333390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With its unsettling backdrops and detailed worldbuilding, Tormented Souls 2 may <em>look </em>like a contemporary horror game, but don't let that modern dressing fool you. At its core beats the blackened heart of stone-cold classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, with all the treats — and tricks — that both endeared me to and enraged me about these formulaic survival horror games when they first gained popularity. Fixed camera angles? Check. Tank controls? Check. Insanely complex puzzles and an even more bizarre story, complete with cheesy dialogue and a manual save system? Check, check, check, and check. It makes Tormented Souls 2 a surprisingly faithful homage, bringing back all the stuff I loved about old survival horror games… as well as many of the things I loved to hate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tormented Souls 2 picks up right after the events of its 2021 predecessor, but you don't have to have met the Walker sisters before to make sense of this sequel. That’s partly because it tells a standalone story, and partly because it's so fantastical that nothing makes sense anyway. Sure, you may have questions about Caroline's fetching eyepatch, but all you really need to know is she’s searching for answers about her little sister Anna's terrifying visions and reality-bending drawings. For reasons that seem to exist exclusively in schlocky horror tales, that answer apparently sits somewhere in the depths of a creepy convent nestled in a far-flung location. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before Caroline even gets the chance to shrug off her (exceedingly 90s) leather jacket, though, Anna goes missing, and it's up to the older sibling to both find her sister and figure out what the hell is going on before it's too late… with an emphasis on the “hell” bit, naturally. As stories go, it's not unique, no, but the twists and turns of Tormented Souls 2's roughly 20-hour campaign are delightfully over-the-top in the same way the original Resident Evil games are. It’s packed with cheesy dialogue, curious flavor text, and some truly bizarre encounters I couldn’t help but smile at. Caroline's stay in the remote town of Villa Hess will take you to a number of wonderfully grim places, including a processing plant, spooky school, abandoned mall, bunker, and the sprawling convent you start off in, keeping the creepy environments feeling fresh.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those environments are so detailed! Stuffed with interest and plenty of lore, Villa Hess and its surroundings are such fascinating, atmospheric places to explore. You never know when a key item or a helpful tool may be secreted away in a hidden room somewhere, so it's always best to keep your curiosity piqued. While your investigation is sometimes interrupted by a bladed demon or shambling zombie, you'll find that enemies have a tendency to stay dead in Tormented Souls 2 — once you've cleared out an area, you're usually left to explore at your leisure. With little more than a flickering candle to guide the way, though, it's a little too easy to miss things; I've been caught out a couple of times by overlooking a key clue or item, even in areas I <em>thought</em> I'd examined pretty closely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is seemingly the law for old-school survival horror, the more you play, the more you'll find yourself opening up new routes to old places, providing access to rooms and entire areas that were previously blocked off. I suspect the backtracking will irk some — there's a lot of it, particularly early on — but as the levels and fetch-quests are well-designed and usually rewarding, I couldn't begrudge it. That said, there's a reason fixed camera angles and tank controls are considered relics of the past. I grew up playing the games Tormented Souls 2 pays homage to (Resident Evil, Silent Hill 3, Parasite Eve, Alone in the Dark), but moving around Villa Hess is frustrating even when there isn't a demon on your tail, with tight corridors and dead ends that make getting from one side of a building to the other unduly long-winded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add in Caroline's fear of the dark: she'll freeze and start to hyperventilate if plunged into darkness for even a split second, dying completely if you leave her there too long. You can’t even put away your lighter to shatter a porcelain pot or smash open a wooden crate unless there's an ambient light source nearby… which there very often isn't. The lighter sure does add to the atmosphere, though, which is almost continually tense and unnerving. As the primary source of light quite often, you'll have to proactively step into a room to illuminate what, if anything, is hiding in the shadows, which inevitably means unwittingly getting up close and personal with the denizens skulking around the place. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Vikki's List of Classic Horror Games That Deserve a Remake</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It all falls apart a bit when there <em>is</em> something hiding in the dark, though. Tormented Souls 2's combat isn't clumsy as much as it is enraging. The reliance on Caroline's lighter means you're often unarmed when something lunges at you, and the fixed camera angles and stiff character movement make it harder than it should be to retreat or create a little distance. Caroline protects herself with a range of acquired and improvised weapons, from a shotgun to a nail gun. Some of them can be upgraded to improve their rate of fire or reload speed, but they're still slow to use and difficult to wield accurately in a panic. I know it's kind of a genre convention to ensure we feel weak and underpowered, but this could've been achieved through scarcer ammo or by throwing more enemies at us; inefficient weapons and fixed cameras don't ramp up the tension as much as snap the immersion entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, that jankiness follows you into boss fights. One of the first you'll encounter, a giant nun, stomps around the room trying to batter you with a gigantic steel cross. But in that one single room, there are at least <em>three</em> different fixed camera angles, which means you may find yourself inadvertently sprinting <em>towards</em> your foe if the camera shifts while trying to put distance between you. This wouldn't be so bad if your shotgun held more than two shots at a time or if the nun flinched with each hit, but she'll keep galloping like an aggravated rhino, which made the camera feel like the real boss I was fighting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, for every underwhelming boss fight you're forced to endure, you'll happen across a good half-dozen puzzles which confuse and delight in equal measure. I never felt closer to an old Resident Evil or Silent Hill game than trying to figure out how to open a door, or decode a cipher, or prise open the jaws of a dead shark for reasons I still don't quite understand. Often deeply cryptic, maddeningly illogical, or completely unsolvable because I stupidly missed a clue somewhere, these puzzles were exactly what I want from a game like this, all the way down to the mini-puzzles that ask you to combine specific items in your inventory. Yes, I'll admit one or two (or five) brain teasers truly stumped me for an embarrassing amount of time, but if that isn't old-school survival horror, then what is?</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If you're nostalgic for the survival horror games of old, Tormented Souls 2 can provide a modern-looking trip down memory lane, with all the good and bad that brings. It has a tense atmosphere to soak up and some gorgeously spooky locations to explore, but you’ll need to push through janky combat and a bit of backtracking to enjoy them. Its esoteric puzzles really test your brainpower in a way that could sometimes frustrate, but also delighted the part of me that missed smashing key items together to see what would happen. There's a lot to enjoy here, as well as plenty that perhaps should have remained in the past, but Tormented Souls 2 still manages to stand as an entertaining callback to the adventures that made contemporary horror gaming what it is.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tormented-souls-2-review]]></content:encoded>

Indeed, there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed).

"The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

It’s a sentiment shared by many Fallout fans, especially given the surge in interest following the breakout Fallout TV show, which heads to New Vegas for Season 2 in December.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"> <u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"> <u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"> <u>Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during<a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

        <p>You’re changing the world of music. Your band’s tracks are the kind of art that redefines genres. That’s why you signed with a label that cares about creative freedom, right? You didn’t become sellouts, did you?</p><p>The road to success is a tricky one, and being a manager is a complex task. Will you help your band become rock rebels or sellouts?

<p>Save those caps</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IZm-Hws334">Fallout Day Broadcast</a> delivered a very nice surprise to Switch 2 owners: Bethesda is bringing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/fallout_4">Fallout 4</a> to the hybrid console in <strong>2026</strong> in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>.</p>
<p>The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and all six official add-ons — Automatron, Far Harbor, Nuka-World, and the three Workshop expansions. Plus there's over 150 pieces of Creation Club content to discover. New weapons, different breeds of Dogmeat (that's your dog companion in-game, in case you've never heard of this good boy), new quests... it's a big ol' package, let's just say.</p>
<p>The teaser above doesn't really tell us much about this port, so we'll likely have to wait until next year for some more info on how it looks and runs. We've popped some screens from the Steam version of the game below just so you get an idea of what the game looks like.</p>
<p>For now, here's a brief rundown of the plot — taking place a decade after Fallout 3, you are the sole survivor of Vault 111. After your spouse is murdered and your son is kidnapped, you step out into the world of the Commonwealth, a huge post-apocalyptic wasteland region which encompasses Boston and other parts of Massachusetts. Your goal? To save your kid, of course.</p>

<p>The fourth numbered <strong>Fallout</strong> game was praised for its world, customisation, and amount of freedom available, but many thought it wasn't much of a step forward compared to Fallout 3, and many of the game's RPG elements were toned down slightly. Still, it garnered a fair amount of acclaim and has grown in many people's estimation in the 10 years since.</p>
<p>We're now suddenly realising that Fallout 4 is a decade old on 10th November. How did that happen?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>RocketWerkz and GRIP Studios have just announced that ICARUS, the sci-fi co-op survival game created by former DayZ lead Dean 'Rocket' Hall, is coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p3h2pvzzpsd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a> in Q1 2026. </p>



<p>ICARUS <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-the-co-op-survival-game-from-dean-hall-just-got-delayed-to-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on Steam in late 2021</a>. It was initially quite rough, but over time, it secured a very dedicated fanbase, partly due to the continued support of the development team.</p>



<p>Console gamers can look forward to a much-improved version of the game that also includes the New Frontiers expansion, which added the alien region of Prometheus for an additional 64 square kilometers of terrain to explore (on top of the base game's 64 square kilometers). Prometheus also introduced three deadly biomes, a host of mutated apex predators, over 30 additional workshop items, the ability to craft over a hundred new items, and six narrative-driven missions across a single story arc.</p>



<p>As part of this announcement, I had the pleasure of interviewing Dean Hall about ICARUS: Console Edition, but we also discussed the game's four-year journey on PC, the evolution of the survival genre since DayZ, and more.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>First of all, Dean, it's a pleasure to have you on Wccftech for the first time. Can you walk us through today's news?</strong></p>



<p>Sure. ICARUS is coming to consoles. It's something that people have asked me about a lot on social media. In fact, there's people who still contact me every few months on the ICARUS subreddit, which is kind of awesome. A lot of work has gone into getting the game ready for that, and we had to actually partner with another studio because we just didn't really have the experience with even just basic stuff like a controller. That's something that's actually been missing from ICARUS, controller support, and there's a lot of specialty knowledge in there. </p>



<p><strong>As far as I understand, it will be developed by GRIP Studios for console, right?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we partnered with them. A number of their staff I actually worked with on DayZ, and I ran into them a couple of years ago at the 10th anniversary of DayZ and they had set up their own studio and were doing a bunch of good work. I was familiar with their work and obviously knew them. So, we hung out and just kind of hit it off from there. It felt like they were a team that we could partner with, a team that understood survival games and could help us in all the areas we weren't experienced with.</p>



<p><strong>Can you tell me if there are any major differences between the PC and console versions, or will they be largely the same?</strong></p>



<p>Certainly, if you're coming from the PC, it's very different in terms of the controller versus the mouse. There's been a lot of work that had to be done in terms of how you navigate around. But broadly speaking, it plays the same as on the PC, except you can sit down and play on the couch. That's really I think the miracle of it: the experience has been able to be ported very nicely to consoles. The biggest difference for me at least is the controller and just learning to jump around the different menus, because ICARUS has a lot of menus. It has a talent tree, it has inventory, it has all the interactions with deployables and placing things and all that kind of stuff. How the game gets put together is a little different as well. We packaged stuff a bit more to make it easier for console gamers to get into it. That's in terms of some of the content.</p>



<p><strong>Will you also port this controller-based UI to PC for those who may want to play ICARUS with the controller?</strong></p>



<p>That's something that we'd really love to do. There's also a number of optimizations, fixes, and other things like that that the GRIP team has done. We're very interested in pulling those things off. In a way, I'm a little jealous of console gamers because their first experience of ICARUS is going to be the product of over 200 weeks' worth of updates. They're coming in with this refined experience, so we're hopeful that some of the changes that GRIP have made will actually be able to make it back to the PC game as well. There's certainly a lot of PC gamers who contact me about having really good controller support.</p>

<p><strong>Yeah. It's even my preferred way to play on PC nowadays because I have my PC connected to a big OLED TV. So it's much more relaxing to play with the controller. A lot of PC gamers have this kind of setup.</strong></p>



<p>True. It's very frustrating that we haven't been able to put the controller support in before. It's something we've long wanted to do, but we just haven't had a lot of experience with that. And I think too often a PC game implementing controller support poorly leads to a very bad result and vice versa, where a console game is ported to PC. I think it's very important that the teams doing that have experience with it. Being able to partner with GRIP, get their advice about how we approach controller support and integrate it with the menus. Now that work's done, it is much easier for us to look at that on the PC.</p>



<p><strong>The press release says ICARUS is launching on Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5, but several Unreal Engine games are also being ported to the Switch 2. Do you think that's potentially feasible, and if so, would you like that to happen?</strong></p>



<div><p>I know the Switch 2 is something that's been talked about. I think it's already a minor miracle that GRIP has been able to do the fantastic work getting ICARUS to run as it does on consoles, just because the game is very RAM hungry. It's very memory hungry, very resource hungry in general, and this is largely just because of the scale of the worlds and the content in them. I think sometimes it is lost on people just how big it is as a survival game. That all adds up to a lot. So GRIP has done a pretty fantastic job at being able to port to that. I certainly know they're very keen to get it to as many platforms as possible, but I guess we'll have to see how it goes on PlayStation and Xbox first. One thing I should add is that we've really tried to focus on improving the performance of the game over the last 200 weeks.</p><p><strong>Sometimes, with other games that were first released on PC and later on consoles, the optimization that had to be made for the console ports was eventually backported to the PC version. Do you think that might happen here, too?</strong></p></div>



<p>Definitely, I think there is stuff like that. We were very particular, though, to make sure that both the console and the PC version run sort of branched. That's very important to me, because I don't like it when a game comes from PC to console and it just feels like a PC game on console, or vice versa. We really wanted each version to live sort of free and able to best utilize what each platform gave it. So that means that when we want to port something between them, we actually really sit down and say, "Hey, is this appropriate? Does this work? Does this best utilize the hardware?" Obviously, with a PC, you get a massive breadth of hardware available to the consumer. You have some people with insanely good graphics cards who want to turn everything up to a million. With consoles, you're getting a much more standardized experience. So, we wanted to make sure that each of those was able to go in its direction. We're definitely hopeful that we'll be able to pull across some really good stuff on the PC, but we also want to make sure that on the PC, people can utilize the latest and greatest hardware they have. That does limit some of those things we pull across from consoles.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be crossplay between PC and consoles in ICARUS?</strong></p>



<p>Crossplay was something we really wanted to do, but because there are those two separate versions, it's just not something we can deliver at the moment. The biggest challenge is simply that we've been updating the game every week on PC, which would just make that absolute hell for GRIP to try and deal with. Either we would have had to stop those weekly updates or figure out a way to try and do weekly updates on the consoles. which just isn't possible at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Is there crossplay between consoles?</strong></p>



<p>No, not even then. Multiplayer sessions are hosted natively on each console platform, which prevents cross-platform connectivity between PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p><strong>ICARUS has been live for nearly four years on PC. It's been quite a long journey for you. Can you walk us through it and all the expansions that you've made? How important has the community's feedback been to get these updates right?</strong></p>



<p>When we launched, it was a little rough. We went straight to Mixed reviews on Steam. We had broken localization. That was one of the biggest issues. We actually released to Mostly Positive reviews in the United States, but there was a simple bug with a drop-down combo box for the language settings that meant the language settings didn't get applied. So, a whole bunch of people weren't able to play the game in their language, which was super frustrating. We did get that fixed within hours, but there was that and there were a bunch of other bugs, not to mention a lot of optimization concerns. That's where we really committed to that idea of doing an update every single week just to build trust with the community and turn that around a bit. And we did an update every single week. We didn't miss one. We did it through the floods of Auckland, the city we live in, which got flooded twice. There was basically a cyclone, too. We went through many different natural disasters and still managed to deliver an update every week. That community feedback was intensely important through both Steam as well as Discord and Reddit. There's actually two ICARUS subreddits, so we hang out in both of them. They really helped us head the game in the right direction.</p>



<p>Probably the biggest example would be bringing in the open world. We still really love the idea of the session-based survival, but I think for that to really hit it off, we would have needed to have put a lot more work into the orbital side of it, which we just weren't able to do and deliver to the level of quality we wanted. However, we were able to bring in a full open world, which means that people could do the missions in one session. That came from a lot of discussion and a lot of working with our community veterans, who got early builds and gave us a lot of feedback. It has been a really long journey, very difficult, especially the first two years, and also when we removed our backend. Some people don't realize this: when we launched, we had this huge backend and we were spending like $100K a month running it. It had some good features, but it meant people couldn't run their dedicated servers. Eventually, we were like, look, this is really bad. If we get into financial trouble, the game will stop working. What we did was sit down and look at it. It was an enormous amount of work, but we changed it so it didn't have that backend. So if the company stopped running, it would still be totally playable as it is today, and that lets people run their own dedicated servers.</p>



<p>Again, we worked really heavily with the community on that one as well, so it was a long journey. But the last two years have been just a lot of fun as we've added a lot of content and things we really wanted the game to have.</p>



<p><strong>Now that ICARUS has been out for a while, are you happy with how it's done commercially on PC?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. By all rights, a game that is this old should have tailed off. Actually, all the games we released with have disappeared off the radar, which is sad in its own way. But we actually had a resurgence, particularly in Europe and Germany, after Gamescom. For a while there, Germany was our top-selling region. In fact, one out of every two copies of the game was being sold in Germany. We just had a sale recently on Steam that really reinvigorated things as well. It's always been a little bit of a surprise in a good way. I like to think a lot of that is just because of the work we've put in to really turn things around, try to address some of the community's concerns, and sort of almost meet in the middle. We obviously have our vision for what the game should be and also what the game is capable of doing, but the players are the ones who actually play the game. We also really like to try and play the game a lot ourselves and try and experience it as a customer and then see where we can take it from there. I would say ICARUS has been commercially successful in terms of us being able to keep developing it for all this time and we hope to keep on developing it as well.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>By all rights, a game that is this old should have tailed off. Actually, all the games we released with have disappeared off the radar, which is sad in its own way. But we actually had a resurgence, particularly in Europe and Germany, after Gamescom. For a while there, Germany was our top-selling region. In fact, one out of every two copies of the game was being sold in Germany. We just had a sale recently on Steam that really reinvigorated things as well. It's always been a little bit of a surprise in a good way.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Regarding future content additions, I know you have been working on a map called Elysium, right? Can you share the status of this map? How far is it in development?</strong></p>



<p>The first thing I'd say is that there's a lot of DLC for ICARUS, and that's a good thing and a bad thing. Some people get pretty nervous, quite rightly, when they see so much DLC. We kind of identified when ICARUS launched that we didn't want to just leave the game where it was. We wanted to keep making stuff, and also, I get a bit frustrated with sequels. We tried to divide the content into three parts: expansions, which are almost like another whole game and they're priced accordingly. Those are for someone who plays ICARUS and goes, "Man, this is just the game for me." That is definitely not going to be everybody, but that's how we tried to position that. And then the content packs and outposts, they're more for people if they want to support the studio. The outposts are kind of a fun little thing that some people really like, and a chance for our map designers to show off some of their skills. With that in mind, we treat our next big expansion really as approaching almost like another version of ICARUS. We actually do a map review session every week, and the last two weeks have been fantastic as it's really been coming together. I won't give out any spoilers. But I think you will see the progression that we've had in the team with our technology around worldbuilding.</p>



<p>This new area just brings in a lot of those map design lessons that you started to see in Null. There are also a lot of art improvements in terms of how we design and approach areas, and a heck of a lot of new creatures, a few new mechanics, and quite a few surprises. The narrative chain I'm very happy with as well. I think it builds on the experience of New Frontiers and tries to give you this fun, interesting mission chain that you can play with your friends in the open world.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think it will be available in the first half of next year?</strong></p>



<p>It's definitely going to be the first half of next year. We'd really love to get it out this year, but it could end up being pretty tight. The internal target for the studio is to finish it this year, but people in the community who follow us a lot will remember that with Null and with Prometheus we did hold them back just to get the quality and stability we wanted. Actually, I think the real turnaround of ICARUS was when we released the New Frontiers expansion, which was the Prometheus map, because I think people saw, hey, that's what they wanted the studio to do. We were able to finally hit our stride, and then we went back and reworked the base game content as well. So yeah, the target would be the end of this year, but it will be pushed if we need to get that performance and quality we want. For example, very recently while we've been playing through it, we just realized we wanted more missions, so we are actually going back and adding more side missions.</p>



<p>Anyone who follows a lot on Discord will know that we push stuff if we have to. I'm so glad that now the studio has a bit of financial security that we can do that. It was looking very grim with the ICARUS launch as to whether we would be able to continually push it. The fact that people have bought those DLCs has meant that we could take our time with a lot of this content and updates.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The expansion is definitely going to be released in the first half of next year. We'd really love to get it out this year, but it could end up being pretty tight.

<p><strong>People want to know if they can get a power switch in the game!</strong></p>



<p>It's something that we've talked about a lot. I'll bring it up at the steering group and we'll see what the team says. A lot of our decisions around what we do with ICARUS are really made just by talking with the team from a technical perspective. I'm hopeful we can. I'd recommend that people post about this on Feature Upvote, where people can actually upvote different features they want to have. It doesn't mean we necessarily deliver it. But yeah, I will go back and check out and see if we can do that one.</p>



<p><strong>Did you ever consider adding vehicles to the game? Was that something you discussed internally?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. When we were developing ICARUS, we went all the way and we actually made a whole vehicle system. You could drive around in vehicles. You could actually assemble the vehicles from parts. But we noticed it just destroyed performance, particularly back then. The traversal of the terrain just got that stutter that many people have seen in Unreal Engine games and we worked extremely hard, to the point we nearly ran out of money at the studio, to try and bring that one and make that one work, and it just didn't. Additionally, it really affected how we were designing the maps. The speed at which you wanted to move around when you were in the vehicle just didn't really work, and we had a lot of technical problems, physics problems, etc. We'd even developed our building system so that you could build bridges to support this. If you have a mount and you stand on a structure, you actually add extra weight to it, and that was actually intended to be for a vehicle system. What we ended up doing instead of that was focusing on the mounts, and that seemed to work well, so we've just leaned into that. It also means we can deliver those talent trees per mount, which has worked out very nicely. So, what you're going to see particularly with uh you know the new expansion and in fact, there's a new mount coming to the game, the Ibis.</p>



<p>Vehicles are something we've thought about and we keep looking at again, but our maps are handcrafted and a lot of effort goes into them. As we found with our other game, Stationeers, if you have vehicles and the terrain doesn't handle them, it gets intensely frustrating for players. You get your vehicle jammed up in a corner every ten seconds or so.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be any updates to the pathing/pet AI?</strong></p>



<p>If people haven't checked the game out in, say, six months or so, it's definitely worth checking it out now because we've already done some updates to this all the time. If people do encounter problems or issues with the pathing, if they've managed to get a video of that, throw it on Feature Upvote. We have some really good programmers who then just look at those edge cases, particularly if people can report where they have pathing issues on the map. There are some spots that are just difficult for even the player to path, which is deliberate, particularly some of the areas in Null are designed to be quite tricky to navigate. We do a lot of work on the AI stuff, but it can be a sort of work that can take three to four months, and then we test it and we're like, okay, it's actually causing problems, so we have to go back and do some more work. It's the kind of thing that people might be like, why are they not working on pathing? It's just because it's not linear from how much work you put in to what you get out. It's almost a bit like prospecting, really. You're exploring to see if something is going to help and work. </p>



<p><strong>You've been making survival games for a long time, since the days of DayZ. What do you think about this genre and where it is today compared to when you started? How has it evolved in your opinion?</strong></p>



<p>It's evolved awesomely. You can tell there's features in ICARUS that are a result of playing Valheim. Valheim came out in our development and I remember that I went like, oh man, we made some bad decisions. We tried to change some of the things we could. There were just some fantastic things in Valheim. It can be such a cozy game sometimes, and I really love that push and pull and the feeling of the biomes is just so consistent. Our food system and that stacked buff system came as a direct result of us putting about 400 hours into Valheim. We were playing Valheim to the point that it almost delayed the project. I wish we could have gotten more in-world interaction. It's something we've done an enormous amount on with Stationeers and we had intended to do with Icarus. You know that idea, like in Minecraft when you walk up to a door and you just whack the door and it opens, or you walk up to a switch and you whack it and it moves.</p>



<p>Stationeers does a fantastic job of all that in-world stuff, but we never quite got into Icarus. But yes, there has been a lot of new survival stuff. There's <a href="https://wccftech.com/popular-survival-game-enshrouded-launch-update-november-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enshrouded</a>. I'm actually pretty keen to get back into playing Project Zomboid's new build. I mostly play multiplayer, so I like multiplayer survival games, but with Project Zomboid, there's just so much good new innovation in terms of its experience. Some people would say that there are probably too many survival games out there. Players do have a difficult time finding the time to try them.</p>



<p><strong>True, even though the new kind of hotness is PvPvE games, right? With some extraction and survival elements thrown in.</strong></p>



<p>It is. Many people asked me, "Why did you make a PVE game after making Day Z?" The thing is, I'd love to look at another PvP game. But with Icarus, I didn't want to look at a PVP game until we had learned to deal with performance stability, quality, and particularly antisocial-type issues like hacking and stuff like that. I really feel that the survival genre hasn't dealt with this enough: how do we deliver these consistent experiences that aren't getting destroyed by other people?</p>



<p>I actually think I made a mistake with DayZ where I tried to solve it all just in terms of everything on the server. If you look at Minecraft communities, I think a lot of it can actually be solved by the communities themselves if you give them the tools to do so. So, giving people a lot of support for how they run and control dedicated servers, logging, and stuff like that. That's super important. I'm still extremely interested in PvP. I just think it's really important that we deal with the ability for the games to scale. Even Icarus suffers from this a lot. I saw people posting on Reddit about performance. We have done an enormous amount of work to try and improve the performance with large bases. In fact, in the last month or so, we actually released an update, well, two updates focused entirely on performance, particularly for large bases and stuff like that.</p>



<p>That's a very long-winded answer to your question. I'd say I'm very interested in survival and PvP, but I think it has to be done right, and it is something that we're not doing a very good job at, including myself, which is why I kind of needed to get back to basics and develop technology and approaches that would deliver those experiences.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We really love all the effort we put into it. There's still heaps of people playing it. I think there's like 8,000 people playing Icarus right now at this at this very second. We really want that to continue and we want to keep paying our staff, and pay them well. We don't have any plans to stop.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Do you plan to support ICARUS for years to come?</strong></p>



<p>Absolutely. This is probably a good segue to another controversial topic: DLC. Broadly speaking, I think the community is very positive towards the DLC in Stationeers but also in Icarus, because we kind of said to the community, hey, we want to keep developing this game as long as we can. We really love all the effort we put into it. There's still heaps of people playing it. I think there's like 8,000 people playing Icarus right now at this at this very second. We really want that to continue, and we want to keep paying our staff and pay them well. The content approach we came up with delivered on that and I think we managed to find a really nice sweet spot instead of doing a whole bunch of bad stuff. We split it into those three parts, and that actually allowed us to keep the base game cheaper and also allows us to put it on discount while still being able to fund the studio. We don't have any plans to stop. We've done an update every week and they're pretty meaty updates. Last week, it was the farming backpack, and this week, it's a new, combat-focused mount too.</p>



<p><strong>Just a final question about AI and its impact on game development. What's the opinion within RocketWerkz? Did you discuss the possibility of using it in some way or are you just against it? What are your feelings?</strong></p>



<p>I'm part of that micro-generation that first had the Internet at school. It just sort of came in, and all the adults lost their minds over Wikipedia coming out and Google and it's going to be the end of information. It feels a little bit like that. I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really then it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is. We handcraft our maps and a lot of stuff. We like to say games are played, not made. For us, there's not really a lot of stuff that we use AI on for ICARUS because the whole idea of it is we want to sit down and handcraft an experience. That's not a judgment against AI. It's more, that's what we really wanted to do. We wanted to sit down and sketch a big map out on a whiteboard and then see it come to life. Our lead world builder actually worked at Bethesda for a while and just loves worldbuilding. We do utilize AI for some of our other projects as a coding support tool. We get an AI model, expose it to our codebase, and that means you can ask it questions, which is really helpful because one person can't easily have the whole codebase in their head so that we can expose the codebase to it and then ask it questions. As to getting it actually to do work, I don't think we are necessarily quite there yet.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing back some fan-favorite Black Ops 2 maps for Season One of the game.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Black Ops 7 continues the Black Ops series name, as well as its story. Players will finally reunite with the Mason family from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a> and witness another mind-bending narrative, now with friends. However, it seems the story isn’t the only thing coming back, as two remastered maps from Black Ops 2 are returning for the new entry, as said by Activision.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-2-s-standoff-and-meltdown-return-as-season-one-maps-in-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2’s Standoff and Meltdown Return as Season One Maps in Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Season 01 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> will be the biggest post-launch content drop in our history, and we're just getting started. Get your first look in our new Dev Talk:</p><p>✅ 7 signature 6v6 maps<br>✅ 7 new &amp; fan-favorite weapons (Maddox! 😍)<br>✅ 3 Zombies maps<br>✅ S01 remasters confirmed<br>✅ MP… <a href="https://t.co/VoKWLqycLW">pic.twitter.com/VoKWLqycLW</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Dev Talk</a> with the team at Treyarch, the team revealed two Black Ops 2 maps returning for Black Ops 7 as part of Season One: Meltdown and Standoff. Each map will be remastered and available as part of the next batch of maps, though a release date was not given. Standoff did join Black Ops: Cold War’s roster of maps during Season Three, acting as both a Multiplayer map and Zombies map. However, Meltdown has not been in the series since Black Ops 2 back in 2012, so fans will be excited to return to the nuclear powerplant.</p>



<p>The Season One roadmap for Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revealed today</a> as part of the Dev Talk. Seven maps, including Meltdown and Standoff, will will release during the season, with more to come later. Three other Zombies maps, two being Survival, are also coming in Season One. The team is calling the new season its biggest yet and based on what we can tell, it sure seems to be. Either way, both new and returning players are in for a treat when it releases on November 14th.</p>



<p>Are you excited to return to Standoff and Meltdown? Any maps you hope make a return for Black Ops 7? Will you be getting the game at launch?

The console versions, branded <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em>, will not support cross-play.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Grip Studios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Land on Icarus, a planet broken due to failed terraforming. Once meant to be humanity’s second home, it is now a hostile frontier of toxic skies, savage wildlife, and relentless storms. Every drop from orbit is a fight for survival. Build shelter, craft weapons, hunt for food, and seek your fortune in exotic matter.</p><p>Survive alone or with up to four players in this uncompromising player-versus-environment survival game from the creator of <em>DayZ</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The “New Frontiers” expansion is included from the start, transforming <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> into a larger, deadlier but more rewarding survival experience. Discover new maps, missions, creatures, and rewards.</p><p><strong>A Planet That Fights Back</strong></p><p>Icarus resists your presence; poisoned air, lightning storms that tear apart structures, wildfires that spread unchecked, and predators that stalk in the shadows. It feels like the planet itself wants to drive you back into orbit.</p><ul><li>With New Frontiers added from the start, you can explore two 64 km2 maps of handcrafted terrain across forests, mountains, deserts, and caves.</li><li>Harvest every tree, rock, and creature.</li><li>Adapt to extreme weather and natural disasters.</li></ul><p><strong>“New Frontiers” Included</strong></p><p>The Prometheus region, once sealed off by the UDA, is now open. Terraforming failed here completely, leaving raw alien landscapes intact but warped. This expansion expands Icarus far beyond its original borders:</p><ul><li><strong>New Map and Biomes</strong> – Alien grasslands, volcanic wastelands of molten lava, and dangerous swamplands.</li><li><strong>Six Narrative Missions</strong> – A chained story across Prometheus as you pursue a mysterious whistleblower for the UDA.</li><li><strong>New <a title="Companies > Creature [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Face Needlers, Dracs, Dreadwings, and other mutated apex predators, evolved to dominate these zones.</li><li><strong>New Exotics</strong> – Discover a volatile new exotic with unique effects on the flora, plus new exotic plants and over 30 additional workshop items.</li><li><strong>New Items and Resources</strong> – Mine obsidian, clay, scoria, crystallised miasma, and super-cooled ice; craft 100+ new items including weapons, food, recipes, and building tiers.</li></ul><p><strong>Three Ways to Survive</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open World</strong> – Establish permanent bases and explore freely.</li><li><strong>Missions</strong> – Timed contracts where extraction is everything.</li><li><strong>Outposts</strong> – Low-pressure zones for creative building and experimentation.</li></ul><p><strong>Progression and Reward</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tech Tree and Talents</strong> – Advance from primitive tools to advanced tech.</li><li><strong>Specialization</strong> – Focus as a hunter, builder, or survivalist.</li><li><strong>Orbital Workshop</strong> – Trade exotic matter for permanent upgrades and equipment. Exotic matter remains the ultimate prize; rare, unstable, and deadly to pursue.</li></ul><p><strong>Solo or Cooperative Play</strong></p><p>Up to four players can share each drop, combining skills and resources to endure. Prefer to go it alone? Survive solo with a Solo Talent Tree for maximum challenge.</p><p>(Note: <em>ICARUS: Console Edition</em> does not support cross-play.)</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ICARUS: Console Edition – Official Announce Trailer | Coming to Xbox &amp; PlayStation in 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/luKC7WUOKOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/icarus-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Embark Studios recently wrapped up a big Server Slam test for Arc Raiders ahead of its public launch on October 30, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-server-test-put-up-some-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535545/" data-ref-id="1100-6535545">the test was <em>huge</em></a>. Given that, Embark got a lot of feedback, and the developer has now disclosed some of what's it's working on addressing ahead of release.</p><p>The developer said player feedback, along with the team's own internal data, provided "crucial insights" into how Arc Raiders can be improved for launch. Here are the key points, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-thank-you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as written by the developer.</a></p><ul><li><strong>Stability:</strong> You helped us quickly identify and resolve stability issues across all platforms during the test. We’ve locked in even more solutions leading up to launch day to ensure a smooth launch experience.</li><li><strong>The Flying ARCs:</strong> It turns out their awareness was a bit too high, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we’ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</li><li><strong>The Dam Tower:</strong> We watched many of you bravely, and perhaps a little too easily, access the Dam Control Tower on Dam Battlegrounds.

The developer's latest Dev Talk video confirmed seven new multiplayer maps, three zombies maps, new weapons, seasonal events, and more for Season 1 of Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">This new Black Ops 7 <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996" rel="nofollow ">Dev Talk video</a> boasts that Season 1 is packed with content across multiplayer and Zombies. "This will be the biggest season we've ever done in franchise history," said senior director of production Yale Miller.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAcJLh2tE2o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LAcJLh2tE2o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are seven 6v6 maps confirmed for multiplayer, and this will be a mix of new and remastered maps. The video shows a brief look at Fate, which is a brand-new map inspired by the game's campaign mission called Time and Fate. This features a trippy setting of fractured and floating building pieces from a city in Nicaragua. Other maps briefly shown are Odysseus, which is based on the campaign mission of the same name, and Utopia is a futuristic Guild facility based in Australia. For the season's remasters, Meltdown from Black Ops 2 will return in Season 1 of Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also confirmed map changes were being made based on community feedback from the beta. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce said that the team is looking at all the doors across Black Ops 7's entire map pool to see where it can reduce automatic doors without disrupting gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Seven weapons are coming in Season 1. Scronce confirms the fan-favorite Maddox assault rifle from Black Ops 4 is included in the lineup. A crossbow and the ballistic knife are also returning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589841" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589841"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 launch content and Season 1 roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for game modes, the return of Treyarch's crossbow and ballistic knife also means the popular Sticks and Stones party mode is packed into the Season 1 update.

Season 1 is confirmed to have one brand-new round-based map and two survival maps based on locations from the Ashes of the Damned launch map. The update will add more augments, field upgrades, ammo mods, and other Zombies content. Players can also expect two limited-time holiday modes for Zombies on the season's new round-based map.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Black Ops 7 variant of Nuketown arrives on November 20, so players won't need to wait long after launch to start receiving more content.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's previous Dev Talk video discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-highly-requested-changes-to-aim-assist-perks-and-movement/1100-6535601/">multiplayer changes players can expect at launch</a>, including adjustments to the game's movement, aim assist, and perks.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

He'll soon be tearing into games, though, as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/terrifier-the-artcade-game">Terrifier: The ARTcade Game</a> is launching on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam next month on November 21.&nbsp;</p><p>Publisher SelectaPlay and developer Relevo revealed this news with a new gameplay trailer highlighting the special occasion. This trailer also features Terrifier: The ARTcade Game's theme song, which is composed by Cody Carpenter, the son of horror legend and <em>Halloween </em>creator John Carpenter. Not surprisingly, Carpenter follows in his father's footsteps with a nightmare-inducing synth-fueled theme for Art the Clown in video game form.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the latest Terrifier: The ARTcade Game trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNZp1zCvGTA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNZp1zCvGTA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, Terrifier: The ARTcade Game features vibrant pixel art, but it's still full of the blood and guts you expect if you've seen Art the Clown on the silver screen. While you can go it solo, the game also features local co-op for up to four players, and you can work together (or against each other) in various game modes while using a variety of weapons like chainsaws, cleavers, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>SelectaPlay says players can expect multiple stages with different paths to explore, plenty of enemies to defeat, boss battles at the end of each stage, a chiptune soundtrack, finisher attacks, and six game modes when Terrifier: The ARTcade Game launches on PlayStation 5 and PC on November 21.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out Terrifier: The ARTcade Game next month?

            <p>Icarus, the survival game made by Dean Hall of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> fame, is coming to console. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions of the game will be released in Q1 2026, and a trailer for the ports was aired during the Galaxies showcase today.</p>
<p>The console ports are being handled by a separate team to Hall's RocketWerkz studio in New Zealand. They're being developed by Grip Studios in the Czech Republic, which helped make games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> and more in the past.</p>

<p>Icarus, a PvE survival crafting game for up to eight players, was released four years ago on PC and got off to a rocky start. But three expansions and many content updates later, it's in better shape. The console ports arriving later in the game's lifecycle means Grip has the benefit of cherry picking the best additions, and notably, the console version will include the New Frontiers expansion released in 2023.</p><p>There won't be cross-play, though, because the two versions of the game, PC and console, are different and therefore incompatible. Hall explained this to me in a separate interview which I've written into a bigger piece to be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hall said: "Instead of holding PC development back because of console, and holding console development back because of PC - personally that bothers me <em>intensely </em>as a consumer; I really, really, really don't like that... I wanted the console version to be the best console version that could be, and I wanted the PC version to be the best version it could be, and that means there are some content differences and some of the content on the console was packed differently."</p>
<p>Cross-play incompatibility "was unfortunately one of those casualties" caused by this.</p>
<p>One of the upsides of console development, however, has been proper controller support for everyone, finally.</p>

<p>Now that's a shock</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yes, Nightdive Studios is bringing yet <em>another</em> game to the Switch later this year — and Switch 2 as well. This time around, the developer has revealed that it's porting its acclaimed 2023 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake to both consoles in 2025 with the full game on the cartridge.</p>
<p>The news dropped during the Indie Horror Showcase, and it makes for a rather nice surprise, especially as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> only just launched earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version of the game, which is a remake of one of the most-influential first-person RPG shooters of all time, will support mouse controls, and come with 1080p and 60fps out of the box. Both Switch 1 and 2 releases will also be fully playable with gyro.</p>
<p>Nightdive Studios have remained extremely faithful to the 1994 original, instead focusing on updated controls, updated interfaces, and updated music and sounds. But really, we're all here to face off against one of gaming's greatest villains in SHODAN, right?</p>

<p>Many absolutely loved the remake back when it launched on PC in 2023, with a console port following the year after. Over <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/system-shock">on Push Square</a>, however, they were a little more critical, citing that the game was "showing its age" a little. So be prepared for a bit of a blast from the past there!</p>

Under this new “AI First” strategy, Krafton plans to use agentic AI to help automate work and implement an “AI-centered” management system, <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-ai-first-%EA%B8%B0%EC%97%85-%EC%A0%84%ED%99%98-%EC%84%A0%EC%96%B8-1000%EC%96%B5-%EC%9B%90-%EC%9D%B4%EC%83%81-%ED%88%AC%EC%9E%90/">according to a translation of a press release</a>.</p><p>The company also plans to spend more than 100 billion Korean won, a figure that equates to nearly $70 million, to build a GPU cluster. Using its infrastructure, Krafton will pursue “AI workflow automation, as well as strengthen AI R&amp;D and in-game AI services,” the translated release says. Krafton aims to complete its AI platform by the second half of next year. The company is also going to invest about ₩30 billion every year to help employees apply AI tools into their work and it will also restructure its “HR and organizational operations” in support of the “AI First” strategy.</p><p>Tech companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644943/shopify-ceo-memo-ai-hires-job">Shopify</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657594/duolingo-ai-first-replace-contract-workers">Duolingo</a> have made AI a key part of their internal operations as well, and Krafton may not be the only big gaming company to make big structural changes due to AI. The investors that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787723/ea-private-deal-buyout-future-games-layoffs">plan to take EA private</a> are “betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in the coming years,” the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133"><em>Financial Times</em> reported</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805509/krafton-pubg-ai-first-developer-agentic-gpu-cluster]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> has some laborious achievements. I know because I’ve been chasing them for weeks and still haven’t satisfied all of the necessary criteria to 100-percent the game in that regard. How tempting then to discover there’s a bug where you can pop every achievement in the remake and claim a complete Xbox gamerscore in just a couple of minutes. How fitting for an RPG about making deals with the devil!</p> <p>The trick was discovered by achievement hunter VidGamiac and shared on the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=1654991&amp;anchor=12598482#m12598482">True Achievements forum</a> earlier this week. It’s a weird one and I still have no idea why it works the way it does. It revolves around starting a fresh save file, choosing English, selecting the Enhanced version, and then later changing to Japanese after you finish the tutorial battle. You can skip the initial cutscenes and fast-forward through all of the dialogue and most of the combat, letting you complete the glitch in just a few minutes. The precise steps are laid out in the video below:</p>

  <p>“Confirmed,” wrote fellow hunter Vudix. “Works. Hat tip to you, Gamiac.” Not everyone is so impressed. “Kinda sad and pathetic tbh,” wrote OldMateClown. “Appropriate Gamertag,” Vudix responded. All of these people have gamer scores of over 1 million.</p>

 <h2>The<em> FFT</em> achievement glitch does not work on PlayStation</h2> <p>Sorry trophy hunters, this is an Xbox exclusive and won’t work for the PlayStation 4 and PS5 versions of the game. Bad news for any Sony sickos looking for easy Platinums, but good news for anyone like me who might be easily seduced by the allure of being able to finally finish this game off. Unlocking every achievement and trophy in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> requires doing close to everything in the game, including all of the errands you can sign up for at shops, even the ones that only appear on random days of the in-game calendar year.</p> <p>But the one that’s really stopped me in my tracks is called “Master of All Trades” which requires one party member to learn every ability in the game. I’ve spent a handful of nights setting up auto-battles to grind for JP points and chip away at it with Ramza but it’s taking a while. Setting up <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-guide-xp-jp-grind-tips-2000633724">those XP fog farm arenas</a> is harder than it looks. I didn’t think I’d ever get sick of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> and yet, well, we’re getting close!</p>
