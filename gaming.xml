              <p>If you dig strolling through empty, abandoned places, immersing yourself in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">backrooms vibes</a>, and enjoying all that’s weird and liminal, then do I have a game to recommend for you. <i>Dreamcore</i> came out in January of this year and it’s a perfectly good time if you love spooky vibes but aren’t too jazzed about screaming monsters and jumpscares.</p>  <p>Developed by Montralulz, <i>Dreamcore</i> is a directionless, HUD-free wandersim that takes you through strange, abandoned levels that almost feel endless. The game intentionally tries to make you feel lost with its lack of clear-cut instructions on what to do. Strange symbols written on walls, seemingly innocuous signs, odd music, and audio cues are the only thing you’re given to figure out where to go and what to do.</p>

 <p>The levels are so massive, in fact, that I’m thinking I might need to keep some graph paper nearby to map out these spaces. I’ve only completed one level thus far, “Dreampools” which is a labyrinth of tiled walls, random pools, and the uncanny use of diffused lighting that often makes those <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-graphics-mods-pc-rtx-4090-1851133618">wild <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> mods</a> or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/better-than-dead-trailer-controversial-bodycam-microprose-2000617981">odd bodycam-footage game</a> look disturbingly close to reality.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636652" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636652"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636652">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And though the game has no jumpscares, it’s still plenty capable of freaking you out–especially with some of the odd objects you’ll come across, like a massive smiley-face ball that, while certainly not intimidating, just feels…wrong. Is it watching me?</p>

 <p>With so few things to actually do in these spaces other than walk around, the real challenge here is not losing your mind and staying focused on slowly unraveling where you should go, following what looks interesting in the hope that you’ll find something unique. It reminds me a bit of <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, but with far simpler environments and the narrative elements ripped out. You often have the sense you’re being watched, that maybe someone’s been here before, and that there’s something you <i>should</i> do, but you can’t quite put your finger on it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636647">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There are currently three worlds to explore: the aforementioned “Dreampools,” an endless expanse of empty suburban homes and white picket fences in “Eternal Suburbia,” and “Playrooms,” described as “a sequence of spaces inspired by children’s play areas, recreated with an artificial and silent aesthetic.” More levels are on the way.</p> <p>So if the spooky season has you in the mood for exploring some creepy spaces without things screaming in your face, and you like a bit of the avant garde, <i>Dreamcore</i> might just be up your alley.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-tips-guide-battle-shiny-wild-zone-2000636641</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/13-things-to-know-before-starting-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1328125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>makes some pretty notable changes to the series’ typical formula. Its battles take place in real-time, it makes the Mega Evolution mechanic a cooldown, and it has several different mission types to juggle while you’re catching and training monsters. That means even series veterans are starting from zero on some things, so before you head into Lumiose City, here are a few helpful tips to make the most of your stay at Hotel Z.</span></p> <h2><b>Read up on </b><b><i>Pokémon X</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Y</i></b><b>’s story</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is essentially a direct sequel to 2013’s </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. The entire game takes place in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired metropolis you pass through in the original 3DS RPGs. There are returning characters and storylines that come up in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s stories and sidequests, so if you’ve never played through the original Kalos games or haven’t played them in a while, I recommend either reading a summary or watching a recap as a refresher. That way, you’ll know why it’s significant that AZ is running your hotel, or that Emma has a full-time detective job, among other bigger reveals later on.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636650"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636650">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Prepare yourself: This game is handholdy for a while</b></h2> <p><span>Sometimes I wish </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games would give me the option to interrupt NPCs with a Ron Swanson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEhHEOIYgMY"><span>“I know more than you”</span></a><span> when they insist on tutorializing every little thing. Like, aw, you think I don’t know what a Potion is, or that I’m not on a first-name basis with every Nurse Joy from here to Kanto? And</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s tutorial is particularly time-consuming, essentially taking up hours. You’ll be dragged around the city by your companions for several in-game days as you’re taught the ins and outs of everything </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has to offer. Your Rotom phone will stop you from venturing too far from the intended path, and it will get very, very frustrating. But when it comes to an end, the rest of the city is open to you right off the bat.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Your moves do different things than you’re used to</b></h2> <p><span>Since </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has a real-time battle system, some classic attacks have been tweaked to fit this new setup. For example, buff moves that once affected your Pokémon for a certain number of turns are now calculated in real-time, lasting however many seconds rather than turns. As you teach your party new moves, familiarize yourself with how they work in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, because they might be slightly different than what you’re used to.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Positioning and timing are everything</b></h2> <p><span>When you give your Pokémon commands, they will move to somewhere on the field that puts them in the right spot to execute the attack based on your opponent’s current position. However, if your opponent moves out of the way, the attack will miss. So rather than accuracy being determined by backend dice rolls, you see the attack land or not as you’re executing it. As such, a big part of learning how to best utilize every attack in your arsenal is understanding where you should be standing when you use it, and keeping an eye on your opponent’s maneuvers and cooldowns to make sure it’s timed well. Some enemies know moves like Protect that will shield them from your attacks, but they will be on a cooldown, so if you can bait your opponent into using it on a weaker move, you’ll have an opening for a counterattack.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636648">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Find attack orders that act as combos</b></h2> <p><span>This new position-based gameplay means that simply attacking at random and cycling through your cooldowns is not always the best play. As you cultivate your Pokémon’s movesets, finding attacks that can synergize together to create combos can help you get the leg up on your opponents. For example, right now, my Pikachu knows Quick Attack, Nuzzle, and Spark. One of my go-to strategies in battles is to have him use Quick Attack to get in close to an enemy, use that closeness to Nuzzle them into a paralyzed state, then use Spark to run out of the fight with a destructive, electric dash. This combo lets Pikachu be a bit of a hit-and-run character that can get in, do some damage, then retreat to safety. Knowing how your moves can work together is just as important as type coverage, and discovering those will take some experimentation.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Stop locking on as a pseudo dodge</b></h2> <p><span>To target enemies on the field, you’ll have to lock onto them with ZL. Doing this will make your active Pokémon square up against whoever you’re looking at, and they’ll stay relatively close to this foe so they’re ready to execute any commands you give them. If you find your partner is getting slapped around and should get out of the scrap, simply stop locking onto an enemy, and your Pokémon will run back to your side. Make sure you’re also out of the way of whatever attack is incoming, too, though.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>You can reach any clothing store once you have free rein&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>The fashion in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is pretty great. It’s a definite upgrade from </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which forced all of us to wear school uniforms. New fits are expensive, but the game is pretty generous about letting you buy whatever clothes you want pretty quickly. Once you’re able to freely roam Lumiose City, you can reach every store without issue. Make a shopping day of running around the city and trying stuff on. Clothes are no longer gender-locked in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, either, so you can wear whatever you want.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636651"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636651">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>You’ll unlock time skip later</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>loves to withhold basic functions for several gameplay hours, including a time skip feature that lets you skip to the night of its day/night cycle. You can only engage in trainer battles during the night, and some wild Pokémon only come out when the sun is gone, so there will be times when you wish you could just sit on a bench and wait for nightfall. I can tell you that you will be able to do that eventually, but for the first few hours, you’ll get an in-game warning that it’s not the time to be resting every time you try and sit down. Once you’re able to sit on a bench without someone yelling, you’ll be able to skip to evenings or hang out with your Pokémon friends on the bench and take photos.</span></p> <h2><b>If you haven’t heard already, Shiny Pokémon don’t despawn</b></h2> <p><span>Shiny Pokémon just became a lot easier to capture in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and it’s because they <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142">no longer despawn</a>. These alternate-colored monsters have a low spawn rate, but in Lumiose City, they’ll stay on the map until you either defeat them or capture them, rather than disappearing as the map refreshes. You can lose a battle, leave a wild zone, or shut the game down entirely, and Shinies will be right where you left them. The hunters have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-despawn-afk-exploit-wild-zone-2000636610"><span>already been exploiting this</span></a><span>, but even if you’re a casual Shiny collector, this will be helpful to your efforts.</span></p>

 <h2><b>More Wild Zones will open as the game progresses</b></h2> <p><span>Though you can go just about anywhere in Lumiose City early on, you won’t find some of your favorite Pokémon right off the bat. The Wild Zone areas where Pokémon reside will open up as you progress through the story, and later ones will feature monsters you couldn’t find in the early hours. It does mean that popular Pokémon aren’t available until much later, so if you can’t find a specific one, just know that more of these zones will appear as you keep going.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636649">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Some story missions pause the day/night cycle</b></h2> <p><span>This isn’t a foolproof rule, but it’s something I noticed when I was running around Lumiose City and hadn’t received any notifications that the sun was getting low and the metropolis would turn into a battle zone. I had been neglecting a story mission that was set to take place during the day to do some side quests; then, when it dawned on me that time hadn’t passed, I realized the game world’s clock had seemingly been frozen until I went to deliver a package to a friend. Sure enough, the sun started setting shortly after I completed the quest. I tested this on a later story mission and noticed the sun was moving as it should, so this isn’t a universal truth. Just keep in mind that sometimes you might need to finish a story mission before the evening will come, or you can use it to your advantage to keep the sun shining while you run some daytime errands.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Photo mode is essentially a first-person mode</b></h2> <p><span>There have been times in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>when I’ve wanted to examine some objects in the environment that were a bit far away in the game’s usual third-person camera angle. However, if you open photo mode with the minus button, you’ll shift to a first-person perspective that you can walk around in. This is helpful if you want a closer look at an area </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-arceus-lumiose-museum-ingo-hisui-2000636160"><span>or museum display</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>You can pick up lost Poké Balls from collectors</b></h2> <p><span>Part of Lumiose City’s redevelopment plan is that there are now Poké Ball collectors stationed outside the Pokémon Center. These guys are keeping the city clean by picking up trash and spare Poké Balls that hooligans leave lying around the city. If you throw one of these capturing devices and miss, or a Pokémon breaks out of its hold, these guys will be holding onto them at the Center. Before you go stocking up on Poké Balls, check in with them to see if they have any of your litter on hand. </span></p>

<p>Are you a fan of horror stories set in a post-apocalyptic world where survival through the night is considered a luxury? If so, then Radiant Residents in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> is a game you should check out immediately. Players are given 60 seconds to search a house for any important resources they can find, after which they are moved into a nuclear bunker. The main objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible in the bunker using the resources you recovered from the house. As easy as that sounds, there are some external factors that will almost definitely affect how long you survive. Players are required to manage hunger, thirst, and overall sanity, while also facing the constant threat of monsters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have plenty of Sanity Points to expend during your stay in the bunker, then buying the required resources and keeping everyone in the bunker will be a cakewalk. However, acquiring Sanity Points in the game is not a simple task. Moreover, some additional money never hurt anybody, and that’s where the magic of the Radiant Residents codes comes into the picture. Radiant Residents codes can be used to get extra Sanity Points, which in a post-apocalyptic world could be the difference between life and death.</p>

<p>New Radiant Residents codes are released by the developers during events and updates, so it’s likely not too long before more codes drop. These Radiant Residents codes are often released to players through either the game’s Discord server or the developers’ social media accounts. As useful as these codes can be, having to go and manually find the latest codes can be a bit of a hassle, so bookmarking this page might be a good idea.

<p>If you don’t have too much social anxiety and enjoy engaging with strangers while making new friends, all of this while looking your best, then Berry Avenue might be worth checking out. Berry Avenue is a role-playing game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> platform that places a significant emphasis on fashion. The game lets players get creative with their outfits, in that there are extensive clothing options. Although plenty of items are unlockable by simply playing the game and collecting resources, some free stuff to bolster players’ wardrobes certainly wouldn’t go amiss. Berry Avenue has a large open world map for players to explore, including detailed buildings and services like hospitals, schools, shops, and more. Berry Avenue even allows players to drive cars around the map, making it essentially a life simulator game, albeit on the Roblox platform.&nbsp;</p>

The fun thing is that you pay for those cards with life instead of mana, hence why that lifelink keyword is handy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up in Spidey’s baddies, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l23MO?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Norman Osborn/Green Goblin</u></a> is a 1/1 that can’t be blocked, triggering Connive and giving him the potential to climb in power. Pay the mana cost, and he turns into Green Goblin, able to cheapen spells from the graveyard that you discarded through Connive. He’s $15 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpbNZ?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Anti-Venom, Horrifying Healer</u></a> we’ve already touched on, and he’s now $12 or so. I’m personally planning to pick him up once we get to around the $10 mark I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, the meme-worthy <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBDglJ?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Imposter Syndrome</u></a> has levelled out at around $10. It lets you create a non-legendary copy of a creature that attacked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, if you wanted to build a five-color Spider-Verse deck, <u>Cosmic Spider-Man</u> is just $10 now. He’s got a ton of keywords that he transfers to other Spider Hero characters, and makes an ideal Commander for anyone looking to drop a ton of them into the same deck</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Climbers This Week</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/crashers-and-climbers-template-2-1760711178228.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Number one on our climbers this week is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRMn51?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mortuary</u></a>, a card that’s 27 years old and basically bounces creatures from your graveyard straight to the top of your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s simple enough, and it’s been a few dollars at most. Now, TCGPlayer has it climbing to around $30 thanks to the emergence of Gwenom, Remorseless, which can pay life to cast cards from the top of your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, when is a Turtle Ninja not a Ninja Turtle? When it’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwKJn?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Taeko, the Patient Avalanche</u></a>, of course. Nothing to do with the upcoming TMNT set, this card enters tapped and powers up as cards leave the battlefield without dying. It’s reached $15, having been around $5 just a week or two ago. Turtle power, indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aADgqo?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Attunement</u></a> came out in 1998 and works very nicely for turning Norman Osborn into Green Goblin and causing chaos. Did the designers in 1998 ever anticipate that sentence? It’s unlikely, but the card is up to $11 right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a013g5?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Goryo’s Vengeance</u></a> is a nice bit of graveyard recursion that gets you flinging a big nasty from the graveyard back for one last hurrah, all for just two mana. It’s up to $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/av34rx?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Entangler</u></a> is a very fun one. It pairs with Anti-Venom, Horrifying Healer (more from him shortly), allowing him to block multiple creatures at once. That’s particularly useful given he ends up negating that damage and powering up with counters in return. After being under a dollar, Entangler is now reaching closer to $10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

Dandy's World already launched its Halloween content last week, adding new Halloween toons, skins, and a limited-time Halloween floor. You can expect to see <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8910346076099969655" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even more skins</a> arrive in today's update.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Looking for </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dandys-world-codes"><strong>Dandy's World codes</strong></a><strong>?

For the unfamiliar, the game involves trying to keep your character fed, warm, and sheltered while you rescue missing children and avoid a dangerous deer-like entity at night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, the game is also keen to get into the Halloween spirit. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8114024574934057586" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Halloween: Week 1</a> begins in 99 Nights in the Forest on Saturday, October 18th.

In typical GaG fashion, the event will be extended and continue for a second week. Though it's not clear yet what this will involve, you can always expect new seeds, pets, weather events, and admin abuse before the event starts.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Steal a Brainrot Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/sab-roundup-1760709127161.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Steal a Brainrot is a particularly popular Roblox experience where you'll need to capture Brainrots from a conveyor belt and keep them locked away from other players.

Last weekend PVB launched the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/plants-vs-brainrots/How_to_Get_Cards">Cards Update</a>, and this weekend will also introduce new content.

For those not familiar, PDP released the same guitar for Xbox and PlayStation consoles previously – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pdp-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-review">IGN gave a great review</a> to the PlayStation version, in fact. Like those controllers, this one costs $149.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new controller can hold a connection up to 30 feet from a Switch or Switch 2, and gets up to 36 hours of play time on a charge. (It's rechargeable via USB-C.) Like the other iterations of this controller, it's collapsible and ships with a shoulder strap. The Riffmaster has an analog stick, strum bar, whammy bar, and 10 fretboard buttons – five at the top of the neck and five more near the body for all those sick shreds you'll be doing. On the pickguard – that's the part that holds the strum and whammy bars – there's also a Home button, plus and minus button, capture button, and d-pad. Alas, there is no GameChat button.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PDP Riffmaster Guitar for Switch and Switch 2</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait, where are you going to do all that shredding?

Plus, it's a cheaper controller, <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/lp-black-tribal-multi-platform" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starting at $114.99</a> for the multi-platform (read: Switch-compatible) Encore Edition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller for the Switch and Switch 2 is available now at Turtle Beach's website or on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Riffmaster-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FTZV2JHG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for $149.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wes is a freelance writer (Freelance Wes, they call him) who has covered technology, gaming, and entertainment steadily since 2020 at Gizmodo, Tom's Hardware, Hardcore Gamer, and most recently, The Verge.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a> wastes no time drawing you in. Set amid the beauty of feudal Ezo, its tale of revenge soon gives way to something deeper--a journey of healing and reflection for its protagonist, Atsu.</p><p>Revenge and grief are still powerful motivators in the game, and these are grim themes that PlayStation gamers might be familiar with, thanks to titles like The Last of Us Part 2 and God of War Ragnarok. So what is it about the cycle of violence and anguish that makes it so appealing to developers, who have all put their own stamps on these ideas?</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Ghost of Yotei lead writer Ian Ryan and creative director Jason Connell explained how Atsu's quest might have started with revenge in mind, but over the course of the game, evolved into something greater.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIH3Efr6OOk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BIH3Efr6OOk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>"It's about healing--revenge just sets it off"</h2><p>"I feel like there are a lot of different types of games--that even within Sony--that don't touch revenge at all, but there are some that are about revenge," Connell said. "I can't really speak to why they do it, but I will say some of the reasons why we chose it, and I think some of those will have overlap and I bet some of them won't have any at all. So, for example, it's hard to imagine that any other Sony game has been looking at a bunch of samurai films with revenge [themes] and decided that it was something that they were inspired by. But I could imagine that the second reason, we were going for a game that was going to be very open, a lot of freedom."</p><p>"I've seen people play 40 or 50 hours and haven't gotten to the second Yotei Six member. That is by design. Like we've made the game to be this way, but that really meant that we needed a very simple narrative hook that could get you, propel you into Atsu's journey, and some people are just going to go do it and find out it's a lot more than that. It's about healing--revenge just sets it off. And the people that don't, like, at least you understand that it's not like a hyper-complex thing to understand early on.</p><p>"And I do imagine that it can probably be appealing to storytellers, because storytelling is hard enough as it is, but you put it inside of a giant video game. Both progression, open-world exploration, and all these other competing elements can be really challenging. So the simplicity of it is really beautiful, and I think there's probably something that's very attractive to creators."</p><h2>"We wanted to kind of plant that fire in the player"</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586726" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586726"></a><figcaption>Ezo is a land of unrivaled beauty in Ghost of Yotei.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg"></figure><p>Ryan added that themes of revenge were useful in that they allowed players to hit the ground running, keeping them engaged from the very start of the game. "It's similar in that as we're approaching the story and we know it's going to be so wide, that we just want the player to be able to keep that, track that in their head, and, and not lose sight of that kind of overriding objective and emotional core to what Atsu is going through, even as she's following the golden bird to do any number of of side stories," Ryan said.</p><p>"We also wanted a smaller opening overall so that players could engage in the gameplay and get to the open world early. And part of that means also that we wanted to players to lock into and relate to that core overriding goal. It is just such a visceral, human desire that does have deep roots everywhere."</p><p>"Everyone can relate to it--just to varying degrees--and so we wanted to kind of plant that fire in the player and create that connection with Atsu, that they could carry it out into the open world even if they decided not to engage in the revenge quest for 30 hours, because ultimately going off and doing other things is a form of healing and not getting into that obsession."</p><p>Connell and Ryan had lots more to say about the game, and if you're interested in exploring just how the memorable roster of villains--the Yotei Six led by Lord Saito--helped shape the game, you can watch the video above for fascinating insight on Ghost of Yotei's development.</p><p>"Ghost of Yotei is shaped by Atsu, its new protagonist, as you're propelled on a gripping tale of revenge amidst the backdrop of Feudal Japan's contrasting beauty and violence," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.</p>

Not every home is going to be created equal, but there's a way to get a leg up on your fellow players so you'll have a house full of furniture when the feature launches in early-access on December 2 for those who preorder Midnight.</p><p>Players can earn furniture by completing achievements, and it's all going to be awarded retroactively if you've already finished the ones you need. The full list of housing-related achievements was revealed on WoW's Public Test Realm, and now there's an add-on called <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/home-bound" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Home Bound</a> that makes it easier for everyone to see what they have to earn.</p><p>The add-on was created by a player called Bettiold, and it lays out over 100 different items--complete with 3D decor images--that can be earned by in-game achievements. Players can even filter out achievements they've already achieved to focus on the ones that they want.</p><p>To use the Home Bound add-on, download the file from CurseForge and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Install Home Bound.</li><li>Once the game starts, type "/hb" or "/homebound" in chat.</li></ol><p>From there, players can browse achievements by category. Blizzard has previously revealed that there will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">be neighborhood-wide events</a> called Endeavors, which will allow players to work together towards a common purpose and reap the rewards for cooperation.</p><p>The Midnight expansion is also doing away with combat add-ons, which has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">caused some concern among players</a> because the alpha build rendered nearly every piece of combat information invisible to add-ons without giving them a viable alternative.</p>

Some problems could block your progress in select missions permanently, but there's a new patch that has addressed many of these random occurrences, so you can keep clashing steel and hunting the Yotei Six without a hitch.</p><p>The team <a href="https://support.suckerpunch.com/hc/en-us/articles/42237189337499-Patch-1-010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dropped the patch notes for Update 1.010</a> on Sucker Punch Productions' official website. The patch stabilizes the game by fixing two rare crashes as well as swapping out placeholder assets during a major story beat. But those are somewhat small potatoes when compared to the myriad gameplay tweaks that make the game even more playable than it already is on PS5.</p>

<p>For instance, your progress could be blocked during "The Way of the Kusarigama" mission if you warped into it at a specific point. Or your progress could be halted if you ignored the "armor upgrade" scene and left the area during "The Tale of the Oni" mission. Heck, your progress could be barred if you created a campsite in mission-critical stealth grass during "The Kusarigama’s Shame," didn't have flash bombs during the "Fighting Fire with Fire" mission, or--and this is very specific--saved and exited the game after interrogating the enemy but before defeating Saito's goons during the "Higashi Lumberyard" mission.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mexico’s government has moved another step closer to putting a tax on video games it deems to be violent. On Friday, Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies approved a financial package that includes an 8% tax on violent video games.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://www.finanzaspublicas.hacienda.gob.mx/work/models/Finanzas_Publicas/docs/paquete_economico/cgpe/cgpe_2026.pdf">to the proposal</a>, the tax would apply to games rated “C” and “D” under the Mexican System of Equivalences of Video Game Content Classification. When comparing to the ESRB, a “C” rating is for players 18+ while a “D” rating is for games rated for “Adults Only”.</p>



<p>Back when it was first proposed in early September, the claim was that <strong>“recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of aggression among adolescents, as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and anxiety.” </strong>This was said without providing any examples of those studies.</p>



<p>This new tax would apply to all games, both physical and digital. For free-to-play titles, the 8% tax would apply to in-game purchases and microtransactions.</p>



<p>The bill hasn’t become law in the country yet, as it will now head to the Mexican Senate for debate. Should it continue to move forward and become law, games from popular series like Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat, and others will be subject to this new tax.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/pokemon-legends-z-a</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-switch-mostly-stable-much-less-shiny.1328044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Switch is 'fine'. For a lot of people, that'll be enough. And certainly, even I'm surprised it's as stable as it is after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> had more than their fair share of performance woes — the latter of which is almost a completely different game with the free Switch 2 patch.</p>
<p>But, this should go without saying, If you have the newer console and you want Legends: Z-A, get it on there. You can read my general thoughts on the entire game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">in my review</a>, but performance-wise, 60fps, sharper image quality, and better stability means it's a stronger experience overall by a wide margin on the Switch 2.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:192371 @ 1760727332 -->
<p>I was honestly expecting this version to be a disaster, but I'm happy to say Legends: Z-A maintains a relatively consistent 30fps both handheld and docked. The drop is certainly noticeable coming off of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a>, but if you're playing this fresh, it likely won't bother you.</p>
<p>What <em>might</em> catch you out, however, are some pretty noticeably choppy 'cuts'. There's a lot more camera work in Legends: Z-A, from fast-panning shots to cutaways, and while docked, every single one of these staggered. Zooming into a trainer after defeating them, catching a Pokémon unaware in the Z-A Royale, there's a stutter every single time. I didn't notice it as much while handheld, but it was distracting.</p>
<p>Luckily, things are more consistent in battle, where things can get a little chaotic. Some moves like Brutal Swing and Gust can cause frames to dip slightly, particularly in handheld, but for the most part, things are good enough.</p>
<p>The visuals are one of my bigger issues with the Switch 2 version, and understandably, it's the same story here, despite the fact character models look good. Flat textures are even worse on Switch 1 — blades of grass looks blurry and jagged, bushes and trees are angular, and the cobbles just look fuzzy. Oh, and the shadows are abysmal, pixelated and blurry and sometimes not even there.</p>
<p>Pop-in was an issue on the new console too, but here, it's even worse. Sometimes characters and Mega Crystals will be visible from a fair distance, while other times, they won't appear until you're about 10 steps away from them. It's incredibly inconsistent and distracting. Some building textures will take around 6-7 seconds to load in, despite the fact you're staring right at them.</p>
<p>Longer load times and softer image quality are a couple more (expected) nicks in the older hardware version's armour, but overall, despite my complaints, Legends: Z-A on Switch is.... okay! It's a step up from the last two mainline games, but still far from Pokémon's best-looking titles.</p>
<p>And I think it's the Switch 1 version's fault. I absolutely get why Z-A is on the older console; The Pokémon Company isn't going to give up that huge player base with a mainline game yet. But its limitations hold Lumiose City back from its full potential. What could've been a vibrant, varied city instead comes with caveats, restrictions, and a fair few visual compromises.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last night, as I browsed the Xbox Store on my Series X, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-october-2025-ninja-gaiden-grinch-price-2000633269">I spotted the newly released Grinch game, which is now available on Game Pass</a>. Curious how players were receiving the not-so-great-looking family-friendly Christmas platformer, I decided to check out the user reviews. What I stumbled into was a warzone filled with shots at Xbox’s recent price hikes and way too many people wanting to fuck the Grinch.</p> <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures</em> was a sloppy co-op platformer that had few fans and was promptly forgotten after it launched. But now it’s back and updated and is being sold as a new game with a new subtitle: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-grinch-christmas-adventures-merry-mischievous-edition/9ppjp7x77nnb"><em>Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em></a>. I’m not sure how many people were clamoring for a new version of this bleh Grinch game, but it’s here just in time for Halloween. It is also one of the first games to be added to Game Pass after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">massive price increase earlier this month</a>, which explains why so <em>many</em> user reviews for <em>TGCAM&amp;ME</em> (as the kids call it) are dunking on the subscription service.</p> <hr> <blockquote><p>“$30 A MONTH FOR THIS???? A GAME THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AWFUL 360 MOVIE TIE IN GAME?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣”</p>  <p>“BE ACTUALLY REAL XBOX. Awful clunky game about the grinch in the middle of october????? I AM THE SECOND REVIEW?????? 50% PRICE INCREASE. UBISOFT COLLECTION WITH 50% BOARD GAMES. I AM LEAVING THE SERVICE. THERE ARE FISH HOOKED UP TO WIRES RUNNING EVERYTHING AT THE XBOX H.Q. APPARENTLY IM SUBSCRIBED TO XBOX GAME PASS BABIES WITH DAY ONE DROPS OF THE GRINCH. UNACCEPTABLE . P.S if you dislike this review i’m automatically assuming ur a dev. “It’s for kids” argument DOES NOT WORK AS IT IS SLOP AND WHAT PARENT IS GONNA SPEND 30 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THIS”</p> <p>“Bruh. You’re telling me for 30 dollars a month? I get this?…. Yeah, I’m glad my ultimate ends the 23rd. I got BF6 and multiplayer access all i need.”</p> <p>“Lolz. Ms wants $30 a month for this clunky ****?👀”</p> <p>“$30 4 this?? Cancel Gamepass.”</p> <p>“50% price hike for the Grinch is CRAZY. If xbox is raising the prices they better start putting out games that aren’t this”</p> </blockquote> <p>While these reviews make some sense–people are mad about the price increase and are lashing out at being given a bad shovelware game right in the wake of it–I can’t as easily explain why there are also so many horny reviews for this updated Grinch platformer. Seriously, what the heck is going on? Here’s just some of what I found. Be warned, a lot of this is NSFW. Oh, and the first two reviews below are the very first two reviews you’ll see on Xbox and the website as of this story’s publication. Merry Christmas, kids!</p> <hr> <blockquote> <p>“Grinch took my v card. He sat me down and bounced that grussy on it.”</p> <p>“My Parents Love the Grinch. My parents had a little too much egg nog and stayed up ALL night with Mr. Grinch. They said his heart grew 3 sizes! I woke up once and heard my mom yelling, ‘You’re a mean one, you’re a mean one!’ They must’ve had a good time, though, because I’ve never seen my parents smile so much!”</p> <p>“The Grinch. The Grinch assaulted me in a bad area…”</p> <p>“GOATED. Watched this green ahh hunk o’ junk bounce that mcboy grus ALL OVER max’s red rocket. Best 30 a month”</p> <p>“Grinch grew 3 sizes alright. 3 sizes in my Christmas stocking stuffer if you know what im sayin 10/10 would Grinch again”</p> <p>“Horny. He made me wet”</p> <p>“I stole lakes v card. The Grinch stole Lake v card”</p> <p>“This game gave me hard b0ner. The Grinch turned me on”</p> <p>“Something in my pants keeps moving. While I was playing as the Grinch, a snake kept growing in my pants. I decided to put it in my mouth and it tastes like BBC!”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, I’m not sure what else to add to all of this. I guess this is what I get for reading the user reviews on a Grinch Xbox game. My bad, everyone.</p>

<p>A recent interview with Sucker Punch reveals that Ghost of Yotei DLC is possible, but only if necessary.</p>



<p>Released earlier this October, Ghost of Yotei serves as a spiritual sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Following mercenary Atsu, she travels around Edo to get revenge on those who killed her family. The game, a PlayStation 5 exclusive, is one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles alongside Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. Now, with the game all wrapped up, Game Informer chatted with key members of the development team about what may be next for Atsu, if anything.</p>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-dlc-possible-if-fans-want-one-says-sucker-punch">Ghost of Yotei DLC Possible If Fans Want One, Says Sucker Punch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Ghost of Yotei co-director Jason Connell and lead writer Ian Miles talked about the game’s success and story. While the article itself is full of spoilers, it did come with some good news for fans. When asked about possible DLC, Connell remarked,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I think for us, we are at the spot in the project where we just get to put it out there and see what’s resonating with people and what people love and what people feel like they wish they maybe knew more about Atsu,” says Connell to Game Informer. “And I think for us, this is like the most important part of the project, in terms of making decisions like these, because same thing with Tsushima. You can listen, you can be like, ‘Oh, okay. People seem to want to know a little bit more about that relationship or what happened to the dad.’ </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Connell, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the quote</a>, refers to Ghost of Tsushima’s Iki Island DLC, which launched with the game’s Director’s Cut in 2021. The story in the expansion revolved around Jin’s father, someone who wasn’t explored much in the main game. He continues,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“How do you further that character?” states Connell. “And you get this rare opportunity to actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn’t or what are the holes. And I think that’s the mode that you want to be in. And that’s sort of the gift. Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it’s a great character. And just like with Jin, <strong>if there’s rooms to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative’s sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we’ll certainly take a hard look at that for sure</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Without going into spoilers for Yotei, there are sure to be some paths that potential DLC can take. While the developers do state that they view Atsu’s story as complete, it’s not out of the picture yet. Given the success the title has had this year, perhaps we may return to Edo in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-in-early-access-on-pc-this-november.1328023/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher 505 Games and developer Supernova Games Studios, alongside a technical partnership with KUNOS Simulazioni, have announced a new branch of the Assetto Corsa series with Assetto Corsa Rally, a new rally racing game to expand on the sim racing already established in other Assetto Corsa games. It'll arrive on PC first with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3917090/Assetto_Corsa_Rally/">Early Access release on Steam</a> set for this coming November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>It'll be the second Assetto Corsa release this year, after Assetto Corsa EVO <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/">launched on January 16, 2025, also in early access</a>. It's also still in early access, with the last word on its 1.0 release being Fall 2025. That said, we're more than halfway through October at the time of this writing, and there's no official update.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer went alongside the announcement for Assetto Corsa Rally, which included short clips of in-game footage showcasing how Assetto Corsa is approaching rally racing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ASSETTO CORSA RALLY ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1_7q_gHrTo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally has been built with an adapted version of KUNOS Simulazioni's physics engine, which was tuned to better suit rally-style racing with uneven surfaces, jumps, more variable road conditions, a dynamic weather system, and more realistic vehicle behaviour across all the new variables and terrains found in rally racing.</p>



<p>In a press release, Supernova Games Studios specifically calls out the use of "<em>laser scan technology for every stage in each rally event, enabling accurate reproduction of real-world terrain formations, road surface irregularities and characteristics, and details of the surrounding environment like vegetation positioning</em>."</p>



<p>Alongside the physics engine built by KUNOS Simulazioni, Supernova Game Studios is developing Assetto Corsa Rally using Unreal Engine 5, to ensure "<em>high fidelity and performance</em>."</p>



<p>When Assetto Corsa Rally launches in early access next month, it'll include:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>33km&nbsp;of fully laserscanned&nbsp;real-life roads.</em></li>



<li><em>4 Special Stages&nbsp;with&nbsp;18 variants, set across gravel roads in&nbsp;Wales&nbsp;and tarmac roads in&nbsp;Alsace</em>.</li>



<li><em>10 iconic rally cars, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles</em>.</li>



<li><em>5 game modes, triple screen support, and more</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The full 1.0 version of the game will add six more special stages, a full 30 vehicle roster, new game modes including a career mode, a rally school mode, and VR support. For now, there's no inclination as to when v1.0 is expected to be ready.</p>



<p>"<em>Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we've built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts,</em>" Supernova Game Studios director, Maura Notarberardino, said. "<em>A special thanks goes to KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series, especially in terms of the driving model, in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can't wait to share the journey with you</em>."</p>



<p>KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder Marco Massarutto also added that a rally racing simulator in the Assetto Corsa series has been heavily requested by fans for years, and also shed some light as to why it took the series as long as it did to take this new step.</p>



<p>"<em>A proper rally simulation requires a dedicated approach that can leverage the unique aspects of this motorsports discipline,</em>" he began. "<em>Racing primarily against the chronometer, rather than against dozens of real-time processed AI opponents, frees up noticeable CPU resources, and this allows developers to push the boundaries of physics, as well as mechanical behaviour and tire models, across different surfaces that Assetto Corsa Rally will feature and simulate.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>The result is a dedicated and genuine rally simulation, powered by the Assetto Corsa physics engine, that can fully exploit its potential without compromise. Combining this advanced engine with some of the best real rally stages reproduced using laser-scan technology, the most iconic rally cars, adding up on the passion and competence of the Supernova dev-team, will allow to deliver an ultimate experience that fans have been anticipating for decades</em>."</p>



<p>Notarberardino is not entirely wrong to point out that there's a gap in the racing game genre when it comes to simulation-style rally racing games. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-ceo-ea-is-like-our-cinderella-shoe-a-perfect-fit-they-listen-but-dont-force-us/">EA acquired Codemasters</a>, and gained the rights to publish WRC games, it was expected that we'd get WRC games each year from 2023 to 2027, but that partnership ended after the release of EA Sports WRC 23. Codemasters <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-shows-off-f1-25-gameplay-confirms-wrc-games-are-on-pause/">confirmed earlier that it was pausing work on future WRC and rally games</a>, so fans of the more sim-focused WRC series and the less sim, more arcade-y DiRT were both let down.</p>



<p>A month after Codemasters' announcement, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/">Nacon was taking back control of making WRC-licensed games</a>, but because they're just starting up again, we still have some time before Nacon is ready to release a new WRC title.</p>



<p>Which means that when Assetto Corsa Rally hits PC in November, it'll be something new for rally fans, specifically simulation-focused rally racing fans, to dig their tires into. We'll see how it fares and how Assetto Corsa does with its first rally racing game.</p>

            <p>You've played through countless immersive sims as a cyborg, a thief, and a cyborg thief. Now, try doing it as a scuttling demon dominatrix. Brush Burial: Gutter World is the sneaky and frenetic new dollop of squalor from Knife Demon Software. It casts you once again as Fennel, a swamp devil with a pronged tail you can use as a whip and a grapple, knocking props around and swiping crossbow bolts out of midair. </p>
<p>Fennel seems as agile here as in the previous, excellent <a href="https://knifedemon.itch.io/brush-burial">Brush Burial</a>, pouncing from head to head like a tic, but they've bolstered their moveset with an injection of overclocked koppōjutsu. You can snare foes to perform sinuous, bone-crunching takedowns, the catch being that you're vulnerable during the execution. It's deeply, moreishly unpleasant. Those little fatal jerks at the end of the animation are more visceral than anything in Doom Eternal. I'm not sure I can bear to watch the trailer again. Here it is.

<p>There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594120/Brush_Burial_Gutter_World/">a demo for Gutter World on Steam</a>. The full thing will have four levels, with an emphasis on replaying to experiment with bending spines in different directions, and to unlock cosmetics. I like Fennel's wardrobe. Adam Jensen never got to rock a corset and thigh highs and he was all the poorer for it. 
</p><p>The game's environments are wiry, occult creations in which all the objects look like they've been crushed into shape. Mournful and decrepit spaces that seem both wildly improvised and carefully engineered. This is a realm of ugliness and deprivation, and you are under no obligation to be nice to it. "Lose your way in the slithering guts of the colonial undercarriage," comments the Steam page. "Make wealth out of misery." Here's a bulletpoint rundown from the developer.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Tightly designed and interconnected levels with numerous paths to the objective, full of hostile or friendly NPCs who react to crimes like stealing, trespassing, and murder.</li>
<li>Fast paced, instantaneous combat that is simple but robust, encouraging the use of improvised or stolen weapons, environmental objects, and a unique hand-to-hand takedown system.</li>
<li>Dozens of unique cosmetics to be unlocked through gameplay challenges, as well as progression through the game's levels.</li>
<li>One 'Greater Contract' and Three 'Lesser Contracts' to complete. Four levels in total, built to be replayed.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I caught wind of the new demo from Problem Attic developer Liz Ryerson, who has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ellaguro.bsky.social/post/3m372prihgk24">rounded up a few Next Fest gems on Bluesky</a>. Ryerson also mentioned <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503810/TERRORtypeALCHEMY/">「TERROR」type:【A.L.C.H.E.M.Y.】</a>, which I'm quite drawn to despite its frightful typographical choices. Loosely, it's an immersive sim in which you play a bombmaker, mixing up reagents as you hurry through the shadows.</p>
<p>If you've taken a dislike to immersive sims, after watching Fennel turn guards into pretzels, maybe catch the demo for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3651950/Evil_Egg/">Evil Egg</a> - a coruscating shmup that puts me in mind of the old Macintosh hit Crystal Quest. Thanks Liz.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-pro-plus-microsd-card-with-adapter-drops-to-just-0-07-per-gb-likely-clearing-out-stock.1328014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of space as a creator or gamer is never ideal; it kills your momentum and affects your productivity. An easy way to make sure that never happens is to invest in a high-capacity, high-speed memory card. Right now, Amazon is offering a solid deal on one of the best in the category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD memory card plus adapter is down to $75, which is 38% off its regular price</a>. You’re saving $45 on a solution that fixes your storage problems for the long term, but the deal won’t be around for long. We suggest acting fast to grab it for less while you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Paired With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>1TB capacity is more than enough to house tons of high-resolution media content, games, important documents, programs, and so much more. You get read speeds up to 180MB/s and write speeds up to 130MB/s when used with compatible Samsung readers, meaning you won’t have to deal with frustrating wait times or an overall slow performance. If you’re using it with a GoPro or drone, these translate into smooth 4K UHD video capture and quicker burst shots. Even better, it is UHS-I, U3, V30, and A2 rated, so you can also run apps directly from the card on Android devices.</p>
<p>The included SD card plays nicely with your computer, handheld gaming console, tablet, drone, etc. Basically, if your device has a microSD or SD card slot, you’re good to go. Just note that this version isn’t compatible with the latest Nintendo Switch 2 yet.</p>



<p>The card is also built to last. It’s water, temperature, X-ray, magnet, drop, and wearout proof, so everyday wear and tear won’t affect the performance. It can handle a few splashes and drops without throwing a fit, which makes it great to take with you on the go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese fans playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> have spotted a rare mention of Pikachu pooping. However, the game's English-language translation adjusts the dialogue — and instead simply references Pikachu experiencing "tummy troubles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-dialogue-confirms-that-pikachu-does-in-fact-poop/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, "Pikachu's Poop" briefly trended on X for some Japanese users after the discovery of a Lumiose City NPC who mentions that their Pokémon is unwell. "Pikachu's pooping more than usual, I'm worried," the character reportedly says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no follow-up dialogue, leaving players without any further detail on Pikachu's bowel habits. Nevertheless, the mention is notable, based on how infrequently Pokémon actually references the creatures' need to poop at all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ピカチュウのうんち <a href="https://t.co/rVetTHbftA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rVetTHbftA</a></p>— てそ (@teso_026) <a href="https://twitter.com/teso_026/status/1978541393812291872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon series has occaisonally mentioned Pokémon droppings, suggesting that some species' poop makes for good fertilizer (Diglett), while other species' poop can be dangerously explosive (Turtonator). A particular favorite Pokédex of mine mentions the Fire-type creature Darumaka, whose "droppings are hot so people used to put them in their clothes to keep themselves warm." Lovely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to Pikachu, though, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A's English translation of the above scene. As seen by IGN, the explicit mention of poop has been replaced with the following dialogue: "My Pikachu's been having tummy troubles recently. I'm worried..."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/2025101710511600-406e08c26fae3d61e0fdd492a49b8d8e-1760716640663.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pikachu is experiencing tummy troubles. Image credit: IGN/The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The English dialogue feels something of a santized take on the game's original script, though in keeping with a franchise about wild creatures that tries to skirt around some of the less family-friendly aspects of their lives whenever possible. Breeding, death and Pokémon eating other Pokémon as food are all canon within the franchise — though it's increasingly rare to hear these elements referenced in the series' games or anime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, IGN reported on a viral post <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-there-anything-more-cruel-japanese-pokmon-legends-z-a-players-are-debating-the-rights-and-wrongs-of-eating-food-in-front-of-your-pokmon">discussing whether Pokémon can eat food meant for humans</a> without getting some serious indigestion, sparked by the ability to take in-game photos of your character with their Pokémon hanging out in cafes.

            <title><![CDATA[Keeper Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/keeper-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/keeper-review.1328005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When contemplating the essence of a lighthouse (as one so often does), you might think of words like stoic, isolated, or purposeful. But have you ever thought of them as adorable, quirky, or perhaps even charming? Keeper, the atmospheric puzzle platformer from developer Double Fine, cleverly reimagines the often forgotten seaboard structure, reframing it as a lovably sentient scout on a journey through a living world. Blending a kaleidoscopic art style with nostalgic adventure game mechanics, Keeper hides an emotional story underneath all of its visual pizzazz, delivering a brain-tickling odyssey that’s stuck with me far beyond the credits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After being separated from its flock while evading a flood of evil batlike creatures, a seabird named Twig is drawn towards a dormant lighthouse that sits on the outskirts of a mythic island. Stagnant and alone, the unexpected visitor awakens the slumbering lighthouse, causing it to shoot out a beam of warming light and scare away the evil swarm. Keeper’s story is built around the soul-stirring relationship that evolves between this unlikely duo as they fight the island’s eerie infection, navigate its curious biomes, and attempt to climb its possessed, claw-like peak. Despite there not being a single line of dialogue across Keeper’s approximately six-hour run time, I found myself wholly invested in their plight – a testament to how dynamic the pair felt in motion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Keeper Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It also helps that Keeper is one of the most visually interesting games I’ve ever played. The island's topology is wavy and confusing like an ant farm, with the towering summit somehow sitting at the edge of most frames, teasing you with its proximity. Every nook and cranny of its surreal, painterly world hides vast wells of depth with craggy coral, forgotten cave structures, and vibrant twisting vines intersecting like details in a Where’s Wally book. The use of fixed camera angles in Keeper is particularly inspired and evokes a cinematic atmosphere once cultivated by games like Grim Fandango and Silent Hill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper doesn’t explicitly explain the lore behind its mythical, post-apocalyptic setting, instead relying on visual clues like crumpled houses and rewilded cityscapes to create a sense of danger and scale. It’s helpful that the environments you saunter through blend seamlessly together, too, with a change in the orchestration and colour palette alerting you to a new area or checkpoint more often than a loading screen. This HUD-less approach better allows you to lose yourself in Keeper’s spectacular landscapes, increasing your investment in the twosome and encouraging you to play around with your powers and discover tidbits of lore littered throughout. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The HUD-less approach allows you to lose yourself in spectacular landscapes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of interacting with the world, your lighthouse powers are relatively limited but smartly utilized. You have the ability to shoot beams of light and run through obstacles to knock them down, as well as send your avian mate to pull vines or interact with levers to open doors. At first, the path forward is simple enough and involves using your light to grow vines into bridges or frighten creatures into dropping key items you need to progress. Gradually, though, Keeper increases its challenge, introducing a healthy mixture of logic and platforming puzzles that require you to weave a few interactions together in order to progress. One such puzzle involved finding and pulling a series of hidden levers to create a path through a rushing waterfall – to sniff out the levers, I needed to bound around the space and use my beam to explode fuzzy brain-like nodes, lower platforms, and grow patches of alien plants.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every reaction you can elicit serves a gameplay-specific purpose, though, and you can also wield these powers to impact the Seussian flora and fauna around you, using your light to make trees shift in color or shiver with life. Elsewhere, curious critters react with adorable animations along the edges of paths as you walk by. It can’t be overstated that almost every screenshot of Keeper effortlessly looks like a work of art. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While your base skills remain largely the same throughout the story, the world changes in a way that keeps things fresh. For example, your humble torch can eventually activate strange monuments that twist time forwards and backwards, briefly turning Twig into a ghost that can fly through walls and rotate cogs or an egg that can weigh down pressure plates – who says you can’t teach an old building new tricks? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds a bit surreal, that’s because it is, but somehow it all makes sense in the context of Keeper’s intriguing world. Admittedly, it helps that each new mechanic is so thoughtfully integrated into both the story and the worldbuilding at large, with Keeper peppering in subtle tutorials through a handful of unmissable interactions at the start of each new area. Similar to Cyan World’s groundbreaking puzzle game Myst, Double Fine masterfully teaches you how to solve the puzzles ahead without overexplaining them, which helps maintain a sense of momentum without leaving you totally untethered from the larger plot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jaw-dropping sights are further bolstered by an exquisite soundtrack.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there’s no rush to make it to the top of the mountain. Half the joy of Keeper is in the journey, and there are plenty of jaw-dropping sights to gawk at along the way. Each level is its own microcosm screaming with personality. You’ll visit the ethereal Pollen Fields, which are filled with cotton candy shrubs and cliff faces that look like splodges of paint someone has haphazardly run their hands through, as well as the cleverly named Horologe, a steampunk-esque city that feels architecturally Grecian. These locations are often disorienting, with brush stroke detailing and scratchy textures that reinforce the organic, handmade aesthetic. They are further bolstered by an exquisite soundtrack from composer David Earl, whose twinkling, dreamy arrangements strike a steady balance between calming and eerie, coating the world in a sense of unease. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all, though, as each area is inhabited by its own creatures, too, which range from towering multi-eyed whales to rocks with legs and narrow cylindrical dragons whose coats look like woven quilts. This smorgasbord of oddities made me feel like a kid at the aquarium, using my lighthouse torch to “tap at the glass” in search of reactions. Even with their uncanny designs, the critters all fit into Keeper’s world as if they evolved there over centuries in order to survive – a theme that bleeds into every corner of this existential story. 
</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite games with surreal settings</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The themes at play aren’t overly complex, though understanding them does require you to read between the lines. As a lonely lighthouse, the ideas of evolution and isolation are touched on – but importantly, your interpretation of each conversation-less cutscene or puzzle will surely be influenced by your own experiences in a way that feels intentional. For me, Keeper came across as an exploration of friendship, adaptation, and the inimitable power of self-belief in a world that is struggling to cope under an oppressive force. Maybe it will mean something different to you. While I was occasionally left longing for more concrete answers to its questions, similar to the process of staring at a painting, this tale leaves the door open for you to find meaning in both the artist's intentions as well as your own. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always considered Double Fine the Willy Wonka of game developers, and Keeper feels like a prime example of why. It walks and talks like a fairly digestible adventure game, but there’s also a sense of experimentation and whimsy that makes it hard to put into any one box. Caught somewhere between the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Yqw_f26SvM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>‘Three Course Dinner Chewing Gum</u></a>’ and a <a href="https://youtu.be/lsEPqUmHDTo?t=28" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ratatouille flashback</u></a>, Keeper flooded my senses, leaving me open to contemplate its world as a standalone creation as well as a mirror of my own. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">A surreal painting come to life, Keeper is a stunning puzzle game that carefully balances its moreish mechanics with a heartfelt story. Its levels are teeming with life to interact with and interesting objects to ogle, with each scene framed by a percussive driving score. The leading duo might not speak. But, well-executed animations and a soundboard of affecting chirps and creaks imbue them with a spirit that grows on you fast. Adorable in premise, Keeper is a psychedelic exploration of life packed into a brief runtime that’s well worth experiencing at least once in your lifetime.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/keeper-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Look out below! Team Meat's sadistic meat mascot is finally leaping into the third dimension with Super Meat Boy 3D, scheduled for early 2026 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. It's a bold step forward for a series that originally started its life as a Flash-based sidescroller on Newgrounds, translating the blood-soaked precision platforming that defined the original 2010 cult classic into a fully three-dimensional space. Based on our hands-on time with the newest preview build, we can confidently say this isn't just the same old Super Meat Boy. Instead, it’s shaping up to be a thoughtful reimagining that captures the essence of what makes the series beloved while embracing new possibilities that only 3D can offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the series, Super Meat Boy is a high-speed platformer that follows the adventures of a skinless protagonist attempting to rescue his girlfriend – Bandage Girl – from the villainous Dr. Fetus… a literal fetus in a jar with a perpetual grudge. Unlike the original game and its 2020 sequel, both of which are legendary for their punishing difficulty and death-defying speed, Super Meat Boy 3D feels less unfairly brutal and more <em>chill</em> while retaining some of the harder challenges for those who want to reclaim the series' hardcore platforming roots in 3D.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Super Meat Boy 3D Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The preview build on Steam opens with an eye-catching menu, and the interface is both immediately functional and slick-looking. One quick tap of the A button on your controller and you’re thrust into the action within seconds – but, if you linger in the main menu a bit longer, you may find yourself wandering into the robust settings menu, which reveals decently comprehensive accessibility options and good flexibility in the graphics department as well. It’s cool to see options to toggle on a ground distance helper, for instance, which projects where you'll land when airborne. There's also a replay character slider that determines how many ghostly versions of Meat Boy appear in the post-level replays, watching your recorded run play back alongside multiple failed attempts in swarms of up to 100 little guys.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The controls translate Super Meat Boy's responsive movement into 3D with surprising grace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The controls translate Super Meat Boy's responsive movement into 3D with surprising grace. On an Xbox controller, jumping, sprinting, wall-running, and dashing all feel snappy and precise. Meat Boy does have a slightly floaty quality in midair that took a few untimely deaths to get the hang of, but a midair dash ability (default mapped to X) allows you to correct trajectory mistakes on the fly – a crucial addition given the added complexity of navigating 3D space. Wall-running and wall-jumping work similarly to the original's wall-slides, letting you bounce between vertical surfaces to reach higher platforms. Interestingly, the preview build lacks the punch ability mentioned in the control scheme and features no combat whatsoever, leaving us curious whether enemy encounters will play any role in the final release or if this remains a pure obstacle-course platformer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Bloody Good Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The level design effectively utilizes verticality in ways its 2D predecessors couldn't, with multi-tiered structures that had us jumping upward off walls, dashing across gaps, and ground-slamming down vertical shafts to avoid descending spike balls. The ground slam (mapped to B) proved more useful than we initially expected, letting us rapidly descend to dodge hazards that dropped from above. Environmental obstacles include classic platformer staples, like buzz saws, bear traps, crumbling platforms, and industrial crushers – alongside new physics-based challenges like the aforementioned spike balls, which drop into peculiarly-located chutes that require you first to bypass other obstacles and then properly time your descent to survive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">True to series tradition, death comes frequently and gruesomely. As one might expect, Super Meat Boy 3D’s cube of exposed muscle tissue is prone to meeting countless splattery ends, immediately respawning him at the level start with the timer reset. The blood trail Meat Boy leaves on every surface he touches paints increasingly macabre patterns across the pastel environments with each attempt, and it's darkly comical watching pristine grassy fields transform into crime scenes. The sound design enhances this with squelchy, splattery audio that recalls Splatoon's ink-based aesthetic, while environmental sounds like the whir of saw blades and the mechanical grinding of crushers create an appropriately cartoony yet threatening audio landscape.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Film Study</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance is measured purely by completion time and death count, with letter grades awarded based on how quickly you reach each level's exit. An A+ rank requires finishing under a target time with zero deaths, which is a tall order that demands memorization and flawless execution. There's no score system, no collectible currency, just you versus the clock and your own mortality. We did discover hidden collectible band-aids tucked into secret areas behind destructible wooden walls, though their purpose remains unclear in the preview build. Whether they unlock content, costumes, or bonus levels in the full game is anyone's guess.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of post-game content, the post-level replay system deserves special mention as one of the preview's most entertaining features. After completing a stage, you watch your successful run play back while multiple ghost versions of Meat Boy attempt the same route, most meeting horrible deaths before one mirror-image completes the course following your exact path. It's simultaneously satisfying and hilarious, transforming your hard-earned victories into miniature spectacles of failure. The max replay characters setting lets you crank this up, filling the screen with doomed meat cubes.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Who’s the Boss?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What's less clear is the scope of the full release. The preview build contained no boss fights (though a cutscene showed what appeared to be a giant robot), no multiplayer options, and a theater mode that remained inaccessible. The narrative setup – Dr. Fetus once again kidnapping someone dear to Meat Boy, this time appearing to be Bandage Girl based on her pink coloring – suggests we're returning to familiar story beats, though the series has never prioritized plot, and from what I’ve seen so far, that trend isn’t set to change with its first 3D outing. The linear level structure and lack of significant exploration or secret-hunting may disappoint players expecting more Metroidvania-style progression, though this has always been Super Meat Boy's MO: pure, distilled platforming challenge without excessive baggage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Meat Boy 3D’s decently challenging and often enjoyable gameplay loop settles into a zen-like flow state once you accept the trial-and-error nature of mastery in its colorful world. This is very much a "podcast game" – something you can successfully zone out to while listening to something else, and by the fifth run through the preview build, we couldn’t help but think about how strong a fit it’ll be for Steam Deck owners who like to sneak in play sessions before bed. That's not necessarily criticism; there's value in games that don't demand your complete emotional investment, and this is undeniably one of those games. It’s just a shame that there’s no Switch 2 version currently announced. Half-joking!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nuts and Bolts</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty, while present, didn’t reach the soul-crushing heights the series is notorious for, at least in these early stages, but that’s not such a bad thing to bring in a broader playerbase – as long as the final version still provides ample challenge to series fans. Whether that manifests in later worlds or if Team Meat has softened the challenge for broader appeal remains to be seen, but I’m hoping it's the former.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/smb3d-screenshot-2-1760658237906.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Graphically, Super Meat Boy 3D strikes a pleasing balance between the series' cartoonish aesthetic and modern rendering techniques for an increasingly atmospheric experience as the levels progress. The preview build already teases robust graphics options, including a nice list of anti-aliasing methods, post-processing effects, shadow quality, global illumination, reflections, and foliage density. While DLSS remained grayed out in my build, the game ran silky smooth at near-144fps on an RTX 4070Ti, with excellent optimization even at maximum settings on an ultrawide 3440x1440 display. The environments pop with visual personality: grassy starting areas give way to burning forests with spinning saw blades embedded in charred trees, which then transition into grimy industrial zones filled with crushers, spike-dropping machines, and pools of toxic waste. Everything maintains that high-contrast, storybook-meets-nightmare quality that defined the original, but with added geometric complexity and environmental detail that wouldn't be possible in 2D.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bring the Pain</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Comparisons to other modern 3D platformers are inevitable, but may be a bit unfair to the scope that Super Meat Boy 3D is tackling. What we’ve played so far lacks Astro Bot's inventively kinetic mechanics and character-driven charm, Mario Odyssey's exploratory freedom, or even Crash Bandicoot 4's level design variety. Instead, Super Meat Boy 3D feels more akin to Ghost Runner's fast-paced, die-and-retry philosophy mixed with the geometric verticality and graphical style of Pac-Man World II – and then just heavily distilled from there, down to something much smaller and tighter, like a little cube of tightly-packaged meat in a convenience store freezer. There are no rings or coins to collect here: just brutal platforming, and this reinvention does it smoothly enough to feel satisfying even after several back-to-back runs of the same preview content.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/smb3d-screenshot-5-1760658250512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Your skills will improve with each run, hitting more A+ ranks as your muscle memory develops. At least that addictive "just one more try" quality that defined the original is totally present here. The question is whether Team Meat can sustain that momentum across a full game, and whether enough content, variety, and surprises await in the final release to justify the journey into 3D.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Meat Boy 3D shows promise as a faithful translation of the series' darker cartoon comedy appeal into three dimensions, with responsive controls, strong performance, and level design that embraces verticality while maintaining the tight challenge loops that made the original special. But, at least at this point in its development cycle, significant questions remain about the scope of its content upon release, how well its combat will feel in action, what those hidden collectibles unlock, and if this tight-knit formula can stay fresh throughout a complete game.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/super-meat-boy-3d-makes-great-use-of-its-extra-dimension]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I do also think there is an opportunity for those big players to also look to diversify into double-A and single-A, and then perhaps indie as well right?" she said. "And what size, shape, or form does that take? I don't know [...] but I think we need to look beyond the knee-jerk reaction of the pandemic and post-pandemic couple of years and really think about who do we want to be? What kind of product do we want to put out? We need to plot out intentionally how we're going to get there."</p><p>Morgan Juinio pointed specifically to games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>--two games that fit comfortably within the AA framework due to their smaller scope, shorter development, and scaled budget. Specifically, she mentioned that these games succeeded not just because of their non-AAA connection but also because they provided captivating and innovative gameplay that was more fascinating than what some (or even most) AAA games are currently offering. Also, these two games--Astro Bot and Split Fiction--are a bit cheaper than, say, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which was another enticing element toward their commercial success. Consider that some analysts recently claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-wants-a-100-gta-6-analysts-say/1100-6535494/" data-ref-id="1100-6535494">no one wants to spend $100 on a game</a>, let alone one as hyped as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>.</p><p>"What I believe is that we have to make great video games," she continued. "It doesn't matter what shape. I think gamers right now are a little bit desensitized to beautiful graphics and size and scale and scope. It's almost a given, right? If a game isn't fun, it doesn't matter how pretty it is. If a game isn't engaging or delivering some hook, then it's not going to connect with players."</p><p>There's a lot of doom and gloom around the games industry as of late. Games are becoming more expensive. Developers are losing jobs. And, oh no, shareholders are unhappy with the sales of their expensive games. It's easy to feel defeated as someone who works in the games industry. Still, Morgan Juinio is "an eternal glass-half-full type thinker" and believes that, as long as creativity and innovation continue to persist, there will be structural changes that will benefit everyone writ large--particularly if publishers invest in smaller projects more.</p><p>"I think the very nature of who we are, as developers and creators, won't allow it to stay doom and gloom. They won't accept that state of the world," she explained. "Does that mean, though, that we're going to go back to the types of games that came out five years ago or during the pre-pandemic times? No. I think it's going to be something new. We don't know yet what it is, but I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry. And I believe that even if the powers that be structurally change or completely get upended, there is still a demand out there for great games."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/big-week-for-unions-at-blizzard-as-hearthstone-team-also-votes-%E2%80%98yes%E2%80%99.1327990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard Entertainment's Team 5—responsible for the development of <em>Hearthstone</em>—is unionizing. A group of around 100 workers voted yes to representation with the Communications Workers of America under CWA Local 9510. It's the third union to go public at Blizzard this week, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new units</a> composed of Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net workers.</p><p>The <em>Hearthstone</em> union includes people from many different roles across the game's development, including artists, gameplay designers, and quality assurance testers. Microsoft has recognized the union after workers voted earlier this week; Microsoft and CWA's neutrality agreement, which was signed in 2022 ahead of Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and prevented the company from interfering in union efforts, expired on Monday. Several unions formed under Activision Blizzard before the neutrality agreement was signed, but they faced what workers <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/national-labor-relations-board-finds-merit-charges-against-blizzard-illegal-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called union-busting</a>—attempts to shut down union efforts. Since the signing, workers have voted to unionize across the company; there are at least seven separate union groups at Blizzard Entertainment alone.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Hearthstone</em> workers made a big push to unionize their own department about three months ago, senior 2D artist Uriah Voth told Aftermath. The deadline for the neutrality agreement's expiration was a big motivator to get the union finalized, workers said.&nbsp;</p><p>"One important moment was learning about the neutrality agreement and its deadline, and seeing the union busting that is and has happened at other very large companies," senior game designer Dominic Calkosz said. "Being owned now by Microsoft has always been a looming question of, <em>will things change? How will things change? How should we be prepared or react to those changes?</em> Knowing there is a date where this powerful option of forming a union may become significantly more difficult was a wake up call to me that, alright, we should start moving now."</p><p>Carol Blean, <em>Hearthstone</em> test analyst, told Aftermath that the agreement allowed the <em>Hearthstone</em> workers to openly talk about the union. "You [usually] have to be very hushed about it. You [usually] have to be very secretive," she said. "Fear hasn't been looming as much, because we have been very open about it, very supported, and everyone has been very respectful."</p><p>She continued: "We all share common struggles, so it's easy to keep supporting each other, not just in the product that we create, but in our own choices."</p><p>Workers don't know how things will change for unionizing at Microsoft game studios now that the neutrality agreement has expired. The unions that exist now, including Team 5's, are past the major hurdle of an election and recognition from the company, but neutrality agreements typically don't extend to the next steps of union effort, negotiating for a contract. Now, the <em>Hearthstone</em> union’s organizing committee will poll the group to determine what the most important issues are for staff to guide them in bargaining a contract. So far, just two of the many unions under Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have completed negotiations, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax QA workers</a>. Both groups were in negotiations for years.</p><p>Voth said that layoff protections are something that motivated him to get involved in the union. He's been at Blizzard Entertainment for two and a half years and has experienced three rounds of layoffs that impacted <em>Hearthstone</em> team members. "It was just this every six month cadence of experiencing this traumatic event," he said. "I looked into the union stuff, and I know that we can't fully stop layoffs from happening, but just the feeling that we need to have some say in these massive decisions that are affecting all of us."</p><p>It didn't feel like leadership was listening, the workers said—a union is a collective voice they can't ignore. "I cannot face everything by myself," Blean said. "We all share the same struggles." She described the "passion tax" that people often take when coming to jobs at places like Blizzard, because they're often dream jobs. But these companies, at the end of the day, are still corporations. "We're looking for just treatment," Blean said. "And right now, we don't have much of a say. That's what we're looking for."</p><p>Calkosz listed a number of things the union is interested in negotiating over, including layoff protections like improved severance packages and recall rights, reduced wage gaps, more support for work from home, formal protections for remote workers, accountability for harassment, and protections or limitations on AI usage.&nbsp;</p><p>"More generally, being able to preserve the good things that we have and being prepared to push back against future unfair treatment," Calkosz said. "Over the months and years, there will be things that upper leadership may have done that they choose not to do because they know we have solidarity now."</p><p>The workers said they're very grateful for the unions that came before them at Blizzard. Members of the organizing committees across unions meet weekly to talk and share information. "We were trying to get this done by the end of the neutrality agreement, and it was really because of the work that other unions had done before us," Voth said. "They were able to help us figure out how to best strategize and get the message out to our team."</p><p>Union influence is apparent even outside of that coordination–simply existing is a motivating factor. "It has been tremendously helpful for members of our team, of our unit, to see other teams at Blizzard union and make steps toward the contract and other things that they want," Calkosz said. "It's very difficult to take the first step or take that leap. Just knowing there are others already paving that way, and ready for solidarity with our team as well, has been motivating for a lot of people."</p><p>He continued: "It's been a little scary to not know how the company might react or retaliate. It helps a ton that other Blizzard teams and other developers have paved the way for us, but a bit of fear is still there. It's helped to remind myself that for [the company] to retaliate would be wrong, and so for us to obey in advance would be wrong. The other Blizzard developers helped pave the way for us. I hope we can help pave the way for other companies, especially being such a visible triple A studio."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hearthstone-union-blizzard]]></content:encoded>

At least not the mainline games or direct spin-offs.</p>
<p>For many, especially those who have been with the series since the very beginning, this hasn't really been much of an issue. After all, it was only when Pokémon had properly transitioned into the 3D realm with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X and Y</a> that characters actually started articulating their joints while talking, and even then it was <em>very</em> limited.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, however, it feels a bit different. Yes, visuals are still somewhat lacklustre across the board with this latest entry, but character animation, particularly during cutscenes, is actually pretty good. They move like real people are supposed to, and their mouths are lip-synced with the dialogue.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59xyhtnv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The problem..? There's no verbal audio to go with the dialogue. It's <em>still</em> completely silent.</p>
<p>It's pretty noticeable in the below clip doing the rounds on social media, with many noting that supporting character Taunie animates well, but the lack of any voice-over makes it come off a bit, well... weird:</p>

<p>Heck, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">final verdict</a> on Legends: Z-A even highlighted the lack of any voice-over work, with reviewer Alana Hagues stating the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know this is controversial, too, but voices would help give this game character. I’m not even asking for full voice acting — though monologues and pre-rendered cutscenes feel utterly bizarre as just text on a screen — but I’d love a voice clip or two, along the lines of modern Zelda games. It’d also help give the story a little more <em>oomph</em>, which it needs when focusing on friendship, recovery, and forgiveness. Even with an explosive climax (which I urge you not to spoil yourself on), I felt... nothing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we'd like to put it to you fine folks. Is Legends: Z-A worse off without any voice-over work? Should Game Freak endeavour to add this into future titles? Let us know by voting in the below polls and sharing a comment in the usual place.</p>

			<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/demons-souls-polishing-diamond/"> Demon's Souls PlayStation 5 remake</a> has been updated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">support the system's Power Saver Mode</a>, and the performance and resolution tweaks, and the reduced system power consumption may be the first glimpse at what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">rumored PlayStation handheld could deliver</a> running PS5 games.</p>



<p>The remake developed by Bluepoint Games, which launched with the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, has now been updated to support the new Power Saver Mode, as indicated by the little leaf icon on the system's main menu. Introducing this mode, which reduces the system's power consumption, is SIE's commitment to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html">"Road to Zero"</a> environmental plan launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-screenshots-and-performance">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Screenshots and Performance </h2>



<p>Although Power Saver mode has been <span>officially implemented on PS5 as part of a b</span>igger environmental effort,&nbsp;it has long been speculated&nbsp;that its implementation and limitations could be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">a testing ground for the rumored PlayStation handheld</a>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">allegedly going to run PS5 games as well</a>.</p>



<p>The performance and resolution tweaks introduced in Demon's Souls remake definitely support this theory in part, at the very least. As can be seen from this set of screenshots I have captured from my launch PlayStation 5 at the start of the game, the resolution in Power Saver mode is lower than the resolution of both Performance and Cinematic display modes, even at a quick glance.</p>

<p>The frame rate target of the game's has also been changed for Power Saver mode, going from the 60 FPS of Performance Mode to 30 FPS. The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@user-el8fc5xg9h">?.?</a> accurately represents the experience, which is not the best for a home console for this type of game, but that wouldn't be terribly bad on a handheld gaming system.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-reduced-energy-usage">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Reduced Energy Usage</h2>



<p>Power Saver Mode delivers impressive reductions in energy usage as well. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-to-recieve-power-saving-mode-which-will-scale-back-performance-on-compatible-games-rumored-to-be-used-as-upcoming-portables-power-target.1250814/page-5#post-146505994">In a test conducted by ResetERA forums member vicegold</a>, power consumption went from hovering at ~224 W in the regular operating mode to ~98 W with power saver mode, which is quite a big difference. While this power consumption target is way too high for a handheld gaming system, the fact that the game wasn't horribly downgraded to achieve it with some software tweaks bodes quite well for the rumored handheld, which would require games to be tweaked similarly to run well on it.</p>



<p>The Demon's Souls remake is only one of the PlayStation 5 games that will be patched to support Power Saver mode. Among other titles to support the feature will be Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which will be another interesting game to test, given its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">solid 60 FPS performance and high-quality visuals.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-brawler-absolum-hits-200k-sales-in-its-first-week.1327975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Dotemu has announced that its roguelite brawler&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone in the first week of release.</p>

<p>Per a press announcement,&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>sales have reached 200,000 since the game launched last week, which isn't too bad for Dotemu's "first original IP". The studio is best known for creating new titles in existing franchises like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-slug-tactics-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal Slug</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/streets-of-rage-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Streets of Rage</em></a>.</p>

<p>Dotemu handled publishing duties for&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>, but it was just one of three developers on the project, alongside fellow&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 4&nbsp;</em>studio Guard Crush Games and animation studio Supamonks, which handled "the entire art direction and animation" for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/absolum-sales-200k-combat.jpg?itok=aC_uwC6g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/absolum-sales-200k-combat.jpg?itok=iI-m9JZX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>has racked up an impressive amount of sales for publisher Dotemu.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>is, it's a side-scrolling beat-'em-up in the same vein as the likes of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, but it's also packing "modern roguelite elements", as Dotemu says.</p>

<p>The game takes place in the land of Talamh, where a scrappy band of rebels step up to battle the evil Sun King Azra, who has taken advantage of the panic caused by a "magical cataclysm caused by ambitious wizards".</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, <i>Absolum&nbsp;</i>offers "a mix of rapid combo chains and spellcasting powers" for each of its four playable characters, as well as the "endless replayability" you'd expect from a roguelite.</p>

<p>Despite that, however, the game doesn't feature randomly-generated levels; instead,&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s action plays out across "an array of hand-crafted stages", according to Dotemu, so if you prefer your roguelite level design bespoke, you've come to the right place.</p>




<p>You can tackle&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s levels solo, or you can grab a friend to play through it with you in either local or online co-op, just like the beat-'em-up classics of old.</p>

<p><em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014070" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/absolum-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can read our very own Andrew's preview of the game from back in August <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-features-gorgeous-story-and-flashy-combat-to-keep-you-coming-back-over-and" rel="nofollow">here</a> (as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-preview-very-promising-beat-em-up" rel="nofollow">Austin's preview here</a>).</p>
