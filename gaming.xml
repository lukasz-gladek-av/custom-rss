		<p>During the PC Games Show, tinybuild revealed that Streets of Rogue 2 will be released into Steam Early Access on August 14th. This release has been somewhat delayed, as Streets of Rogue 2 was originally aiming for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/05/streets-of-rogue-2-will-be-entering-early-access-in-2023/">a 2023 early access release</a>. This early access release promises a lot of content, with much more to be added before Street of Rogue 2’s full release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Streets of Rogue 2 - Release Date Trailer (feat. Perturbator)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giKX3jFF47A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the initial early access phase of Streets of Rogue 2, players will be able to play as numerous characters who all have their own skillsets, including a tech-savvy hacker, an agile ninja, and culinary chef. Whichever character you choose, there are multiple ways to approach the procedurally generated open world of Streets of Rogue 2. You can go on a huge destructive spree to topple the President and take over the nation, or help people for rewards. You can build up a criminal empire or a business empire, and use those proceeds to gain power in the world too. There will be ample exploration opportunities by land and sea, using fast cars and fast boats. When it comes to fighting, your weapons arsenal could include flamethrowers and banana peels.</p>
<p>There is no need to play Streets of Rogue to understand the story of Streets of Rogue 2, but the games do take place in the same universe. The game will eventually feature four player co-op both locally and online, with there being scope to potentially increase the number of online players and increase the carnage, though this is likely to happen later on in early access, if not after the full launch of Streets of Rogue 2.</p>

		<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/antistatic-studio-founded-by-ex-cyberpunk-2077-and-bioshock-devs/">Antistatic Studio was founded by ex Cyberpunk 2077 and BioShock devs</a>, and at the time it announced Project Hornet. Now, Antistatic Studio has confirmed the real name of Project Hornet is Phantom Line, and revealing new information about the game as well as giving the chance to register for its playtest.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Line - Reveal Trailer - Join the paranormal SWAT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vf0EsjF4uOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Phantom Line drops players into a version of Eastern Europe which has become embroiled in a global nuclear war. Amidst the chaos of nuclear war, Phantom Line hones in on a different threat, that of paranormal origins, that teams must confront. The game supports up to four players in an open-world setting, where they must navigate and survive dynamic events that will be full of dangers. Within Phantom Line’s lore, players’ consciousnesses are transferred into artificial bodies known as HUSKs, which are essentially avatars for scouting and combating paranormal threats. The game’s home base is set on an icebreaker ship, serving as a hub where players can upgrade and personalise their HUSKs, as well as manage their equipment, weapons, and armour. This ship also serves as the location for mission briefings,where players will learn more about the threats that plague the world.</p>
<p>Antistatic Studios has confirmed that there will be a playtest for Phantom Line, and if you want to join you will need to be part of the studio’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uHheyk2PBA">Discord channel</a>. The playtest is set to be taking place later in the summer, though an exact date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ysbryd Games and developer Necrosoft have announced the&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>release date, so if you're hankering for some&nbsp;<em>Devil Survivor</em>-style tactical RPG action, you won't have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>As announced during today's PC Gaming Show presentation,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will launch across PC and consoles (although not Xbox One, it seems) on September 13th. It'll be playable on Steam Deck, too.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced">announced back in 2022</a>,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will bring&nbsp;tactical RPG action inspired by&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor</em>, old-school&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>games (think&nbsp;<em>Persona 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>rather than more recent entries), and Italian giallo-style horror movies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demonschool-release-date-boss.jpg?itok=Xhb1E0St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demonschool-release-date-boss.jpg?itok=iBWepkD7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will probably bring back warm, fuzzy memories if you're an old-school&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fan.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will revolve around Faye, the last in a line of demon-hunters, as she tries to navigate university life on "a mysterious island".</p>
<p>While doing so, she must also contend with "big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds", which sounds very much like the same kind of supernatural-mundane mix&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>is going for.</p>
<p><em>Demonschool</em>'s tactical battling will allow you not only to plan out moves in advance, but also to rewind actions during the planning stage of combat, giving you greater control over your strategy.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good idea of what to expect from both the game's art style and its tactical systems.</p>

<p>Faye will be assisted along the way by several companions, including kind pugilist Destin, "photography nerd" Namako, and "pragmatic media enthusiast" Knute.</p>
<p>In battle, you'll be able to buff your companions for extra damage and support, and you'll likely need to if you want to overcome some of&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s tougher challenges.</p>
<p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 13th. It's looking like a must-play if you're a fan of Atlus' old-school RPGs and&nbsp;<em>Devil Survivor&nbsp;</em>in particular.</p>

            <p>
Tonight, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">Microsoft announced a trio of new Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>, including a digital-only Xbox Series X.
</p>
<p>
In part, these seemed similar to the consoles seen in leaked plans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-detailed-in-enormous-microsoft-leak">released into the public domain in error last year</a> that awkwardly trumpeted an "adorably all-digital" future for Xbox - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-a-good-thing-microsoft-now-says-its-adorably-all-digital-future-plans-are-outdated">Microsoft's Phil Spencer later said was outdated</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But how much has changed? The new digital-only Series X is white, as expected, with are no major performance upgrades under the hood. It's no longer cylindrical, and keeps the regular Series X's rectangular design. Most importantly, though, it will be accompanied - initially, at the very least - by a new Series X option that retains its disc slot. This "special edition" 2TB Xbox Series X will be available in "limited quantities", Microsoft said.

<p>
All of this prompts several questions. How limited are those quantities, should you want a disc-based Series X? And what will happen to existing disc-based Series X (and for that matter, the current Series S) when these new models go on sale?
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted Microsoft to ask whether the current Xbox Series X/S models will still be manufactured and sold when the new versions join the line-up.
</p>
<p>
"The three new Xbox Series X/S options will join our current console lineup," a Microsoft spokesperson said in response, before listing out all five models set to be available this Christmas.

"This holiday, players will have the choice of Xbox Series S ($299.99 USD ERP), Xbox Series S - 1TB ($349.99/€349.99), Xbox Series X - 1TB Digital Edition ($449.99/€499.99 ERP), Xbox Series X -1TB with ODD ($499.99 USD ERP), and Xbox Series X - 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition ($599.99/€649.99 ERP). Console availability will vary by market."
</p>
<p>
For now, then, Microsoft is clearly only committing to the Xbox console line-up available as of this Christmas, or "holiday". What happens in 2025, or even later into this console generation, remains an open question. But perhaps, six months out from the new consoles' launch and with the sales performance of these new consoles still to be tested, some of this does remain an open question even within Microsoft itself. 
</p>
<p>
If you did want to buy an Xbox Series X with a disc drive (handy, if nothing else, to support your existing Xbox 360/Xbox One back catalogue), you still have time - for now.

            <p>
The god of video games news is vengeful, for this weekend He has sent forth a flood of game announcements to wipe out any remaining game journalists from this earth. Come at me, God! What have you got? Ah. It’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ale-abbey">Ale Abbey</a>, a management game about brewing beer in a monastery of medieval monks, and between making craft ales the priests get tipsy on their own supply. You can’t fool me, god of game reveals, this one has been openly in the works <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/aleabbey/699261">on GameJolt for 2 years</a>. But, yes, I suppose now that the developer is teaming up with the Northgard creators as a publisher, the people must know.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Ale Abbey shares some cute factor with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-dev-story-and-more-kairosoft-manage-em-ups-are-now-on-steam">Game Dev Story</a> and other lite sims ending in “Story”, but it looks more involved than your average Kairosoft clickathon. “No pre-made recipes in Ale Abbey, oh no. It's a canvas for true beer alchemists,” say developers Hammer &amp; Ravens. We're looking at lots of lager, here.
</p>
<p>
“Dive into a vast array of over 20 European styles, meticulously choosing the equipment that best suits your needs. Adjust the quantity, quality, and mash temperature to blend the perfect brew. Decide whether to store it for aging, or sell it at the market.”
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile you’ll have to build parts of the monastery as you go. Digging into the ground below to make space for cellars, while housing your holy folk upstairs, with living quarters, refectories, libraries and offices. There are also hints of some trouble beyond your big wooden doors. “Appease Lords, befriend neighboring abbeys, and handle bandit encounters,” say the developers. 
</p>
<p>
The sloshed seminarian sim was shown off during the PC Gaming Show, part of the fragmentary summer game news deluge. Aka, the slow-motion blood spatter resulting from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-will-miss-e3-for-its-spectacle-but-mostly-because-it-only-lasted-one-week-not-months">E3’s violent death</a>. It hasn't got an exact release date yet, but it's planning to hit Steam some time in late 2024, the creators say. </p>
<p>Like I say, the team behind the frothy friars have already been keeping <a href="https://www.indiedb.com/games/ale-abbey-in-hops-we-trust">a thorough development log</a>, exploring the fine details of their pixel art sim. But now it seems to have been picked up by Shiro Unlimited as a publisher. Shiro are the folks behind very solid viking RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/northgard">Northgard</a> and the equally solid sci-fi strategy of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-spice-wars">Dune: Spice Wars</a>. I guess they publish other people's games now too? Cool. Yeah, no worries. Good on ‘em.

Revealed during today's PC Gaming Show, Our Darkest Days is an upcoming entry in the PC and mobile Into The Dead franchise. In Darkest Days, players are brought to the height of a zombie outbreak during the sweltering summer of 1980 Texas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a side-scrolling shelter survival game in which players attempt to escape Walton City before it's completely overrun. To survive, players must scavenge, craft, fight, and plan their next moves.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days gameplay teaser below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHZO5ugMIWw" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days' PC Gaming Show teaser showcases three cornerstones of the game: planning, adapting, and surviving," a press release reads. "Scavenge various locations for valuable materials, carefully avoiding zombies in heavily infected areas. Balance the needs and well-being of each survivor, and upgrade meager shelters with fortifications and amenities to make it through the night before selecting new locations to explore the following day."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Darkest Days features difficult in-game decisions, survivor permadeath, and of course, plenty of zombies.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some additional screenshots of the game</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>It's due out on PC via Steam Early Access in 2025, but a demo is coming to Steam this October.&nbsp;</p>

The news comes via the PC Gaming Show, which also premiered a new trailer for the open-world sandbox game.</p>

<p>Set in a living, procedurally generated world, Streets of Rogue 2 gives players one task: take down a corrupt president. How they accomplish that is up to them. Whether that means helping citizens with their problems or causing absolute chaos, the game gives players the freedom to twist and bend its colorful, destructible world to their whims. Sporting a variety of playable characters with unique talents, such as a ninja, chef, or hacker, you can cruise around in cars, boats, and other vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's no word on how long Streets of Rogue 2 will be in Early Access, but creator Matt Dabrowski says to expect "multiple exciting updates" as it gears up for a 1.0 launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="369" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Jump Over The Age has released the first gameplay trailer for <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> during the PC Gaming Show 2024. Not only that, but we also know roughly when we can expect to be able to play the game, both of which are enough to give you the drive to hop back into the original and try for another ending to refresh your memory of this universe ahead of time. </p> <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true"><em>Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>will be released in <em>early 2025</em> for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. So don’t worry. There’s no need to clear your schedule just yet. It’ll be a lovely little bonus game you can play when winter rears its head again, right when you think spring has arrived. The new trailer shows that, unlike the previous game, you’re going to be exploring multiple systems across an asteroid belt and picking up a crew who will help you on your journey as you push forward to avoid those hunting you down. </p>

These are artificial bodies that house human minds, and they’re pretty useful in a workforce. The trouble is, not all Sleepers want to be workers forever. Unlike the previous game, this time around, you’re on the run from a criminal gang who wants to capture you. </p>

            <p>Citizen Sleeper 2 is coming in early 2025, publishers Fellow Traveller have announced, and it's also going to be releasing on PlayStation 5 and Switch alongside the already confirmed Xbox Series S/X, Game Pass and PC versions. </p>
<p>Unveiled at tonight's PC Gaming Show during its first proper gameplay trailer, Citizen Sleeper 2 will see you wake up in the body of a brand-new Sleeper android who's fighting for survival out on the Starward Belt on the edge of the Helion System. We've known for a while that Citizen Sleeper 2 is going to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-update-reveals-first-new-location-game-pass-release">much bigger game</a> than the original, but tonight's trailer gave us a taste of just how large the Belt actually is, as it will have its own navigable map screen, along with lots of different space ports and unique locations to visit along the way.  </p>

<p>We also get to see some of the characters we'll be meeting when we get there. Unlike the first game, though, they'll be joining your crew as valuable team mates here, and will live alongside you in your ship as you travel between locations. You'll also be able to draw on their unique skills and character traits when taking on big contract jobs, too, as each crew member you recruit will have their own set of dice rolls to use to help you complete tasks and get the job done.  </p>
<p>Contracts will take place in dedicated locations, too, far away from the hustle and bustle of the spaceports where you'll have heard about them in the first place. As such, you'll need to prepare accordingly before you take one on, as they can quickly blow up in your face (literally, judging by the gameplay trailer) if you attempt them before you're ready. </p>
<p>There looks to be plenty of double-crossing and wavering loyalities to navigate, however, and making peace with all of your newfound stablemates will form a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-is-real-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">big part of Citizen Sleeper 2's underlying story</a>. </p>
<p>Beyond these new additions, Citizen Sleeper 2 will no doubt feel very familiar to returning players. It's still chock full of the same tabletop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-rpgs">RPG</a> inspirations that defined the original game, and you'll still be rolling plenty of dice to determine the outcome of your actions. </p>
<p>Of course, we already know that you won't be dependent on keeping your health topped up with stabiliser shots in this sequel, but there are new systems at play here that you'll need to keep an eye on instead. It's easy to miss from the trailer, but Stress looks to play an important role in Citizen Sleeper 2, and managing this (both across yourself and your growing number of crew members) will no doubt prove to be quite the balancing act when it launches early next year.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/2024/6/9/24173143/generation-exile-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7p8OEf">Steam is flooded with city builders right now (I’m playing <em>Fabledom</em>, for instance), and most of them are relatively similar. Which is why, for me, the excitement of starting a new city builder comes in the form of new art styles, interesting combat mechanics, and compelling stories. But former Klei Entertainment developer Nel Anderson’s new company, <a href="https://sonderluststudios.com/">Sonderlust Studios</a>, is bringing novelty to the genre with its first game, <em>Generation Exile</em>, announced with a trailer on Sunday.</p>
<p id="Qghi8g"><em>Generation Exile</em> is a pretty city builder like any other, but this one has a distinctly anti-colonialist, environmentally sound aspect: Rather than bore into your new land for resources, ultimately destroying what it once was, <em>Exile</em> challenges players to use only the resources they had with them when they left their old world in the last-ever generation ship.  That includes water, food, and even air. Gameplay will also include turn-based combat as well as the typical tasks of creating abodes and amenities, amassing resources, and keeping your residents content.</p>

<p id="ES1gil">Over email, Anderson, who works as Sonderlust’s creative director, aptly explained to Polygon what the game’s trying to do: Lots of city builders, he explained, are “fundamentally extractive and reward — if not demand — growing infinitely.” That means in order to continue in the game, you have to continuously bore into the earth, cut down trees, mine caves, etc. <em>Generation Exile</em>, on the other hand, pushes players to work in tandem with the new environment.</p>
<p id="Aqt8Vc">“Rather than simply ‘number get bigger’ we wanted to make the problem-solving space more about seeking balance,” Anderson said. “Rather than pulling more raw materials out of the ground for refinement, progress might instead look like developing a series of anaerobic lagoons that transform the biological waste (that must be stored and managed regardless) into nutrients for growing food or source crops for bioplastics.”</p>
<p id="MJH2mf">Time will move ultra-fast to account for several generations of your in-game society, which is comprised of procedurally-generated characters so no two games are the same. In fact, the generation of new maps and characters is a major part of how Sonderlust’s developers plan to accomplish that balance.</p>
<p id="gd0HRP">“While the player of course interacts with the map portion of the game from a familiar birds eye-ish viewpoint, they aren’t some disembodied force of civic will or an otherwise nameless and uncharacterized overseer,” Anderson said. Instead, player characters will have reputations and bespoke interactions with NPCs “triggered procedurally in reaction to the game’s state and decisions the player has made.”</p>
<p id="VLWjXK">The premise is enough to pique my interest, but the lineup of devs and designers is even more impressive. Sonderlust is also calling in its chief operating officer, Karla Zimonja, co-creator of <em>Gone Home</em>, and some developers who worked on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23837019/baldurs-gate-3-review-dungeons-dragons"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/26/17164878/far-cry-5-review-ps4-pc-xbox-one"><em>Far Cry 5</em></a><em>. </em>As for sound design, Ben Prunty from <em>Into the Breach </em>will collaborate with the audio team from <em>Celeste</em>, Power Up Audio.</p>

<p id="TnahkF">The early looks at the game are moody in a late-summer-afternoon type way, with an intriguing honeycomb city structure and lots of overgrown ’50s-looking buildings. The UI also looks modern (and <em>big enough to read</em>, ahem) — a welcome change from your average city builder. </p>
<p id="XjAoyD">“The art style of Generation Exile was inspired in part by fauvism,” said Pier-Olivier Desbiens, 3D environment artist for Sonderlust Studios. “It’s a polygonal stab at the bold colors &amp; flat strokes of the movement, with a heavy emphasis on simplifying shapes and objects so only the essential remains. The main goal was to create a world that feels familiar yet mysterious through the use of unusual, saturated color palettes.”</p>
<p id="KEdiy3"><em>Generation Exile</em> doesn’t have a release date yet. When it’s released, it’ll be available on Steam and other consoles to be announced. </p>

<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches, everyone starts from scratch. That means load-outs, skins, weapons, and gear won’t carry forward from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 to Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>“We want to make sure that everybody starts fresh, together, as we move into an all-new experience with the launch of&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-worldwide-reveal-announcement#Carry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision said</a>. “Allowing everyone to experience the&nbsp;Black Ops&nbsp;universe the way it’s meant to be played, learning the era-specific weapons and gear, learning the gameplay innovations like Omnimovement, and keeping that signature&nbsp;Black Ops&nbsp;style is important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Therefore,&nbsp;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare®&nbsp;II&nbsp;and&nbsp;Modern Warfare III&nbsp;content will not carry forward to the&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;Premium experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will be one exception to the rule, however. The Black Ops 6 Vault Edition Woods Operator Pack that includes the Classic Woods Operator Skin will be available in Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 6. Also, Warzone players will still get Carry Forward content for Season 1 of the next game including content from Modern Warfare 2, 3, and Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Game Pass.</p>

<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches in October, players will be required to be online at all times no matter what they want to play. That means even playing the campaign requires an internet connection.</p>



<p>“To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes,” Activision says. </p>



<p>“This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign. If you’re on a console, Campaign can be played without a premium subscription service such as Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus.”</p>







<p>With the need to always be online, that means those in areas with poor network infrastructure, or those who may lose connection for whatever reason, won’t be able to play any aspect of the game.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. It will also be the first Call of Duty game to come to Xbox Game Pass on Day 1.</p>

That’s for Xbox Series X and S, with sizes for the game on other platforms yet to be announced.

IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p>Call of Duty lets players reduce its overall footprint somewhat by picking and choosing which parts of the game are installed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-adds-ps5-and-switch-versions-launches-in-early-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022’s most acclaimed <a title="Genres > RPG [16,345 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</em> takes players to the Starward Belt, a richly realized, ramshackle set of habitats in an asteroid belt full of secrets, stories, and characters trying to make ends meet.</p><p>Players step into the shoes of a Sleeper, an emulated human mind housed in an artificial body. They are on the run from the corporation that made them and the gang that seeks to control them. To stay ahead of their pursuers, the player will have to commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as they seek to build a future for themselves.</p><p>Your crew starts with Serafin, your fellow escapee and a rock-solid pilot. But you’ll need scrappers, engineers and all sorts to take on the contracts that’ll keep you flying. Contracts take place far from the bars and shops of the Belt’s many hubs, and these high-risk jobs each have their own challenges, where failure is just a few bad dice rolls away, so you’ll want to make sure you pick the right crew for work.</p><p>Players will choose a class, configure their skills and assemble their crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Their future depends on the roll of a dice, as they make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of <em><a title="Games > Citizen Sleeper [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a></em>, the sequel is a deep narrative RPG that will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As previously revealed in last year’s animated trailer, this is a different Sleeper to the one you play in the original game. Soon after escaping from their corporate overlords, this Sleeper fell under the control of a local <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal gang and its leader, Laine. After a desperate attempt to free themselves from servitude, they’re on the run again – this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on their head, and no memory of their past.</p><p>Revealed today are details of the brand new and expanded gameplay elements, building on the original’s compelling table-top RPG-inspired systems…</p><p><strong>Reboot / Rebuild / Repair</strong></p><p>Nothing in the Belt ever runs smooth, including the artificial body of a Sleeper. <em>Citizen Sleeper</em>‘s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Players will have to manage their stress or risk taking damage to their dice. They’ll also have to deal with glitches as they accrue in their system.</p><p><strong>Do the Job, Get Paid</strong></p><p>Contracts offer a new kind of focused, tactical gameplay to the <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> experience. Players will need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle high-risk/high-reward jobs – but they’ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.</p><p><strong>Push Your Luck</strong></p><p>Each character class now has a unique “Push” ability, which can help players turn the tide of a difficult job or send them into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when they choose to use it. Push skills are upgradable and customizable, and include abilities like dice rerolls or single die augments. With the addition of Push, each class in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> will offer different tactical possibilities.</p><p><strong>Navigate the Belt</strong></p><p>The Starward Belt offers a bigger, more varied world than the original game. Instead of living on a single station, players will chart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as they see fit. A living world, the Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it’s up to players to decide which locations and stories deserve their time and resources.</p><p><strong>Choose Your Future</strong></p><p>Player choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow players to express their class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask them to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you!</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Revealed during today's PC Gaming Show,&nbsp; Ancient Forge is launching a Kickstarter for Hotel Galactic next month on July 9 that will run through the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Hotel Galactic, players are tasked with restoring a rundown cosmic hotel drifting amongst the stars to its former glory. "Entice alien guests from around the galaxy by dreaming up beautifully quirky designs," a press release reads. "Craft elegant guest rooms, grand dining halls, and other rooms crucial to keep guests satisfied during their stay. Purchase furniture from visiting merchants or build them from scratch using wood, metal, and other materials."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Hotel Galactic reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5PjZNMq6Do" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Elsewhere in the game, you can feed guests by cooking meals created by berries, plants, and cosmic ingredients scattered "throughout the great beyond." You can experiment with new dishes, cater to guests' "sophisticated palates," and perfect recipes for even the pickiest of eaters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must also hire and manage staff to keep the hotel running at its best, and you do so by dragging and dropping workers around the hotel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outside of that, you can "take a reprieve from managing a hotel by exploring an underground complex within the floating island," according to a press release. "Become a part of the local ecosystem by growing plants in the hotel's backyard and raising myriad livestock. Welcome eccentric, alien travelers from across the galaxy, and run the next five-start inn featuring a charming soundtrack and Studio Ghibli-inspired visuals."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some screenshots from Hotel Galactic</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ancient Forge plans to launch Hotel Galactic on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC sometime in the future. The game's Kickstarter campaign begins on July 9 and runs through July 30. The company says that with each milestone achieved, it promises to deliver new content, such as unannounced in-game mechanics, new VIP guests, and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/09/polaris-is-a-co-op-pve-shooter-coming-to-pc-this-year-with-fully-destructible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Polaris is a four-player co-op PvE shooter set in an original sci-fi universe coming to PC via Steam this year. Developed by Polaris Team, an offshoot of Variable State, which is the studio behind 2021's Last Stop and 2016's Virginia, the developer formally unveiled Polaris during today's&nbsp;<em>IGN Live&nbsp;</em>showcase with a cinematic trailer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the trailer, we get a glimpse of this sci-fi world, which takes place in a region of space overtaken by a ruthless force known simply as the Regime. In the game, players must reclaim their homeworlds and bring every enemy stronghold down.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the game's first look in the Polaris reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/esYJY5iSJHQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Polaris Team says, "All in-game structures – installed by the Regime, but not yet inhabited by their indoctrinated citizens – can be crushed, blown apart, and otherwise annihilated over the course of every match, and the same is true of the natural environments and terrain upon which they've been constructed."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players control superpowered freedom fighters who utilize guerrilla tactics to take back their territory while flying through dynamic open levels, destroying enemy infrastructure, and unearthing coveted mysteries that drive the Regime's war of conquest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Since I first played Bullfrog's Syndicate Wars, I've always dreamed of working on a game that featured hi-tech squads of futuristic soldiers, causing mayhem and destruction in an original sci-fi setting," Polaris Team creative director Jonathan Burroughs writes in a press release. "Sprinkle in a deep appreciation for the Halo series – particularly its blend of on-foot and in-vehicle co-op action – and you can begin to get a sense of what we hope to achieve with Polaris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're only a small and scrappy team of 11 people, but have been plugging away at this project since early 2023. Aided by the tools and technologies of Unreal Engine 5, Polaris Team has built a tight 4-player PvE combat game with a dynamic, destructible environment set in our own unique sci-fi universe. With the release date arriving later this year, the team and I couldn’t be more excited to share Polaris with players worldwide!”</p>

<p><strong>Here are some Polaris screenshots to check out</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polaris is due out on PC via Steam sometime this year. You can sign up for a beta playtest starting today.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will require a "continuous internet connection" - even when you're playing its campaign mode. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions">blog post</a> published by Activision today, the publisher advises that the Cold War-set shooter uses "texture streaming across all game modes".
</p>
<p>
"This means you'll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign," Activision wrote.

<p>
Why does Call of Duty require the internet to stream textures? Activision's answer is two-fold, in that it allows "the highest-quality visuals" while also "reducing the game's overall storage space on your hard drive". 
</p>
<p>It seems Call of Duty's typically meaty hard drive footprints are at least partly to blame - and indeed, Xbox's store page for the game reveals Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's install size is an eye-watering 309.85 GB. </p>
<p>
All of which begs the question - how big would it have been without always-online texture streaming? And also, is keeping your console always online even just to play Campaign a better alternative?
</p>
<p>
Other details mentioned by Activision include that the game's Campaign can, at least, be played without an online subscription service, such as Game Pass Core (formerly Xbox Live Gold) or PlayStation Plus. 
</p>
<p>
Split-screen gameplay will also be supported - but not on all consoles. Instead, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 will allow you share a screen with a second player, but Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will not - "to ensure performance integrity". 
</p>

So, they pulled it from Valve’s marketplace to flesh it out even further, and will release it in full later this year. I got a chance to play a little slice of the demo at Summer Game Fest, and it left an incredible impression, one that’s lingering even as I head to other hands-on appointments.<br></p><p><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> is set in a school at night—a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_en&amp;oq=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE4MzFqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_en&amp;oq=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE4MzFqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liminal space straight out of a 4Chan creepypasta</a></span> whose creepiness is only elevated by the game’s VHS grain filter. Vivian and Amy have broken into the school to get a Ouija board out of a locked case in the library while a thunderstorm rages outside (I noticed that the sounds of the storm grow louder as you walk closer to the library’s windows, a tiny little detail that was a delight to discover). You have to hide from the school’s security cameras (<em>Fear the Spotlight</em> has very basic movement mechanics: walk, jog, crouch) and gather things to help facilitate your seance much like you might in a <em>Resident Evil</em> game: to get the key for the display case you need to track down a keycard to get into the librarian’s office.<br></p><p>As the girls sit down to start their séance, you’ve got to light the candles on your side of the table with a box of matches, a small moment that offers an incredibly satisfying tactility.  But naturally, as soon as Vivian and Amy begin to convene with the dead, things go awry—the candles blow out, Amy disappears, a fire breaks out. The quiet, slow-burn anxiety <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> was brewing for the first two-thirds of my hands-on immediately shifts into heart-pounding fear, as you have to run through the library to escape the fire and end up sprinting through a bizarre tear in the fabric of reality.<br></p><p>When my brief hands-on ended, I turned to the duo dev team and simply said, “Fuck yeah.”<br></p><p><em>Fear The Spotlight</em> is shaping up to be a brilliant melding of old and new, a clear marker of Blumhouse’s excellent taste. It’ll relaunch later in 2024 for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The cops are everywhere, and they are mad at you for what feels like no good reason. Though it doesn’t help your case that you keep making friends with people that the cops are mad at for slightly better reasons. But what do we know? </p><p>Talk to people, help them out (or don’t), play huge concerts, and punch cops. And then run away from the cops you punched. Also there are monsters or something. Not sure what’s going on there?!?!</p><p>All of this culminates in massive setpieces where everything is at stake. The music got you here.

There are modifiers, tons of songs (with more to come!), and a whole challenge board to beat, with things to do that range from as simple as “beat a song on easy mode” to, one may presume, something as complicated as “solve an ancient riddle while skateboarding.” That’s not a real example.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

Swiftly jump gaping chasms, deadly spikes, scalding lasers, and more with precise springs and flips in a precise platforming experience. Stay wary of the god’s watchful eye, lest reality shifts underfoot.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Navigate eerie and atmospheric Iron Age landscapes, from ruined castle structures to deep sea caverns to a dark reflection of Maya’s own home, listening to the unsettling tones echoing through the time-worn structures. Face uncanny encounters with Maya’s family, Lacey, and other wandering prisoners to uncover the god’s true motivations.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p data-characters="271" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Strange Scaffold, the developer of the kidnapping simulator <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-life-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life Eater</a></em>, has revealed its next title, <em>I Am Your Beast</em>. It’s a first-person shooter and covert thriller title in which you exact revenge on those asking a little too much of you and learn to hate wasps. </p> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">In <em>I Am Your Beast</em>, you play as returned secret agent Alphonse Harding. The problem is his retirement has been interrupted by ‘one last mission’ a few too many times, and now he’s out for revenge. The latest mission quickly descends into a guerrilla war between Harding and his employers, the Covert Operations Initiative, and will see you shooting through a forest full of enemies while using the weapons aimed at your head to take them down. </p>
 <h2 id="h-take-fast-paced-revenge-to-a-whole-new-level-in-i-am-your-beast" data-injectable="false">Take fast-paced revenge to a whole new level in <em>I Am Your Beast</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="I Am Your Beast - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6wy2jL-5jI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">You can play the <em>I Am Your Beast</em> demo right now by heading to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> and trying it out. The game launches for PC on <strong>August 15, 2024, via Steam, and will come to iOS slightly later on August 28, 2024</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Strange Scaffold’s Xalavier Nelson Jr. revealed<em> I Am Your Beast</em> during the PC Gaming Show 2024. Alongside the trailer, he hinted at his newfound hatred for wasps, and there’s actually a clip in the video that reveals where this might have come from. </p> <figure data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>REASON WHY PC GAMING SHOW HAS EARNED MY ETERNAL RESPECT:</p><p>I pitched them on a vertical format video, and they had me make two–one intro that was a bit normal, and another that was as unhinged as I want.</p><p>They used BOTH, BABY.<br>WASPS ARE EVIL BASTARDS AND THE MESSAGE WAS SPREAD <a href="https://t.co/LDJoA7VbCV">https://t.co/LDJoA7VbCV</a></p></div>— Xalavier Nelson Jr. @ XP Game Summit (@WritNelson) <a href="https://twitter.com/WritNelson/status/1799913687882350932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">The game is designed for you to quickly take down enemies and then use their weapons to keep up your killing spree. In addition to firearms, you can use melee weapons to take out your foes and even drop wasp nests onto them. Just watch out for the inevitable stings because you’ve got to move fast through this game, or you’ll be taken out fairly quickly. </p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true"><em>I Am Your Beast</em> features a fully-voiced story with over 20 levels to shoot your way through, delivering on a ‘he’s-in-the-walls’ power fantasy with head-exploding power to boot. The comic book art style might not be for everyone, but as a fan of the original <em>XIII</em>, I instantly want to dive in. </p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="false">This isn’t a linear adventure, with open sandbox levels to explore and chase down side objectives in as well as the overarching goal. With such a big focus on speed and stealth, it’s hard to imagine how these side objectives will work, but Strange Scaffold has a portfolio of games that subvert expectations and end up giving you some of the most enjoyable experiences. So I’m confident it’s going to get this right as well. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/what-xbox-game-pass-do-you-need-for-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will launch day one into Game Pass on 25th October 2024, but with four different versions of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, Microsoft has given <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Pass">a handy explainer</a> for what version you should subscribe to in order to get access to what for Xbox and PC gamers.</p>
<p>You can obviously buy the game outright as well – and PlayStation gamers will have this as the only option – but Xbox and PC gamers could see Game Pass as a more cost effective way to get into Black Ops 6 at launch.</p>


<p>Essentially, Game Pass Ultimate is what you want for the full experience on console, as it grants access to both the library of games and online gaming, but if you only game on PC, you can just stick with Game Pass PC as multiplayer is not tied to a subscription. Game Pass Console doesn’t include online gaming access, so it’s Black Ops 6campaign only, and Game Pass Core has a limited game library but does grant online console multiplayer, so is required for people buying the game on Xbox still.</p>
<p>Here’s Microsoft’s breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Game Pass Ultimate: </b>This offers the most flexibility as it allows you to play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign as well as the Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles, and on PC. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will have access to the Digital Cross-Gen Bundle on Xbox consoles and the Standard Edition on PC Microsoft Store.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass PC: </b>Play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign as well as Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on your PC. Game Pass PC subscribers will have access to the Standard Edition on PC Microsoft Store.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass Console: </b>Play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign only on your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles. Online console multiplayer access (sold separately) is required to play the Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles. Game Pass Console subscribers would need to upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate or additionally subscribe to Game Pass Core (sold separately) to access these modes. Game Pass Console subscribers will have access to the Digital Cross-Gen Bundle on Xbox consoles.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass Core: </b>Game Pass Core includes online console multiplayer access, which is required to play <i>Black Ops 6 </i>online modes (Multiplayer and Zombies) on Xbox consoles, but does not qualify you to access the full game. Also note that all of the benefits of Game Pass Core are included in the Game Pass Ultimate plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone subscribing to Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console before 25th October you can also snag two preorder benefits: Woods Operator Pack and Open Beta Early Access.</p>

<p>COD Black Ops 6 was given a full reveal during the Xbox Games Showcase today with a Black Ops 6 Direct following on and diving deep into core gameplay changes and revealing new details for both multiplayer and zombies. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/cod-black-ops-6-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Check all those details here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-look-at-assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Tonight's Xbox Showcase brought us a first glance at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> gameplay, and a better look at its feudal Japanese world. 
</p>
<p>
A fresh trailer for Ubisoft Quebec's upcoming action RPG began with quick scenes showing the changing of the seasons - the ubiquitous Japanese blossom of spring, snow in winter, torrential rain on a muddy battlefield full of corpses.
</p>
<p>
Next we saw shinobi protagonist Naoe yanking enemies down into the long grass like raptors picking off tourists in Jurassic Park, then quick shots of her performing the Assassin's Creed series' trademark rooftop parkour, aided by a grapple rope. You also now appear to be able to peer around corners.
</p>

<p>
Exactly a minute in, the trailer switches to show Shadows' samurai hero Yasuke, stomping through scenery then turning another set of enemies into kebabs on his shiny sword. 
</p>
<p>
The trailer concludes with quick shots of both Naoe and Yasuke in combat - the former extinguishing lanterns to strike in the dark, the latter slicing necks as easily as bamboo.
</p>
<p>
A final couple of shots appear to show a black and white (don't call it Kurosawa Mode) version of the game where the only colour on-screen is the claret red of blood. Is this going to be a visual option players can toggle on? 
</p>
<p>
An extended look at Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay is set to arrive tomorrow, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">as part of Ubisoft Forward</a>.

<p><em>Choose your gods from the Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons.

<p><em>Embark on multiple campaigns spanning 50-missions that take you across a vast, mythical world: besiege the mighty walls of Troy, battle Giants in the frozen wastes of Midgard, and discover the mysteries of Osiris in the shifting sands of Egypt. Become a hero of myth—or even a god.</em></p>
<p><em>Play with your friends, either head-to-head or against the advanced AI on dozens of randomly generated maps and scenarios for limitless re-playability</em></p>
