With the ability to climb everything and interact with almost every facet of the world through temperature and forces, players will need to find innovative ways to maneuver through various environments that have been unpredictably affected by extreme weather events—from a flash freeze hitting the lush forest of Glintwood Hollow, to a heat wave spreading across the imposing architectural ruins of Upper Dynevron. The real challenge of <em>Eternal Strands</em>, however, lies in defeating the nine towering bosses that freely roam the Enclave.</p><p>Once awakened, the newly revealed Epic, the Ark of the Stricken Earth, is a formidable adversary with its kinetic powers. Harvesting strands from these giant enemies will allow players to harness new magical abilities as they advance in their journey. Epics wander freely and change day to day between the various maps, all connected by a central hub: the basecamp. There, players can craft and reforge their gear, weave new powers into their Mantle, or learn more about the realm. Choosing and customizing gear wisely is crucial, but mastering the synergies between steel, frost, flame, and kinetic magic is key to success in battles.</p><p>“We are breaking a lot of traditional conventions and giving the tools to the player to overcome the challenges in front of them however they see fit,” said Yellow Brick Games executive producer and chief operating officer Jeff Skalski. “Take our Ice Wall power for example. Sure, you can cast it to pin enemies in place, but you can also use it to create an ice shield against a drake’s breath or carve an ice path safely through a burning forest. Perhaps one of my favorite uses is while climbing an epic and casting ice on its hands so it can’t grab Brynn thus buying her time for a critical blow. Well, that is until it manages to crush the ice in its hand by using its sheer strength or melt it through other means.”</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_909286"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>The Weaverband</strong></p><p>The trailer also revealed the weaverband—Brynn’s unique skilled basecamp characters. Behind these distinct characters, you will hear the voices of famous actors known for their roles in various games such as <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, <em><a title="Games > Baldur's Gate III [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate III</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Stellar Blade [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a></em>, and TV series such as <em>Wednesday</em> and <em>Sex Education</em>.</p><ul><li>Brynn, the Point (voiced by Mei Mac)</li><li>Oria, the Mentor (voiced by Pandora Colin)</li><li>Sola, the Smith (voiced by Luyanada Unati Lewis-Nyawo)</li><li>Sevastyan, the Smith’s Apprentice (voiced by Kris W. Laudrum)</li><li>Laen, the Lorekeeper (voiced by Robyn Holdaway)</li><li>Casmyn, the Quartermaster (voiced by Rebeccca Hanssen)</li></ul><p>And additional characters and talent to be announced at a later date.</p><p>These fully voice-acted companions, with whom players will be able to forge bonds, will help Brynn gear up for her expeditions and guide her along her journey to uncovering the mysteries of the Enclave, a magical and unpredictable land once a thriving center of magic, now left in ruins. Who knows what might be hiding in these undiscovered lands…</p><p>“We started development on <em>Eternal Strands</em> with a gameplay-first philosophy,” said Yellow Brick Games chief creative officer Mike Laidlaw. “The fantastic world of the Enclave was built with that in mind and gives players a sandbox full of flammable, breakable, launchable, and sometimes-explosive ingredients alongside massive creatures to test our player’s creativity.

You can expand that selection to four games for $20 or you can pay $30 for eight games. And for a different kind of Monster Hunter experience, the creature-taming Monster Hunter Stories series is on sale at Amazon. You can grab the recently released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Stories Collection for Nintendo Switch</a> for $40 (was $60).</p><hr><h2>Fanatical Monster Hunter Bundle</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355235-monster-hunter-rise.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355235" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355235-monster-hunter-rise.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355235"></a><figcaption>Monster Hunter Rise</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355235-monster-hunter-rise.jpg"></figure><ul><li>Monster Hunter Rise</li><li>Monster Hunter: World</li><li>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak (Expansion)</li><li>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne (Expansion)</li><li>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Deluxe Kit (DLC)</li><li>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Deluxe Kit (DLC)</li><li>Monster Hunter Rise: Deluxe Kit (DLC)</li><li>Monster Hunter: World - Deluxe Kit (DLC)</li></ul><p>Technically, Fanatical is offering only Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, with the rest of the list consisting of various expansion and DLC packs. The post-launch content for these games was quite good, especially if you enjoyed the base experience, so the best option here might be to grab Monster Hunter Rise and some of its extra content. Monster Hunter World is still a ton of fun, but Monster Hunter Rise hits that sweet spot for roping in newcomers with accessible new features and giving veteran hunters fresh tools to experiment with while out in the wild.</p><p>The Sunbreak expansion features new monsters, new locales, and more, and in total, you're getting dozens of hours of content to tide you over until Monster Hunter Wilds arrives, as that 2025 game is currently getting some very positive preview vibes.</p><p>As mentioned, you can also check out this double-pack of Monster Hunter Stories games for Switch, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">as it has been discounted from $60 to $40 at Amazon</a>. The first game was originally released exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016 and was later ported to iOS. The new release adds some nice updates to the experience, like improved high-definition visuals, full voice-overs in English and Japanese, and extra content. If you just want Monster Hunter Stories on its own, you can grab it for $40 at Target for the Switch version, while PC gamers can get a bigger discount over at Fanatical.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Stories Collection at Amazon (Switch)</a> -- $40 ($<strike>60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmonster-hunter-stories-collection-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-91658443&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmonster-hunter-stories-collection-gets-first-big-discount-for-nintendo-switch%2F1100-6526043%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Stories Collection at Target (Switch)</a> -- $40 ($<strike>60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fanatical.com%252Fen%252Fgame%252Fmonster-hunter-stories&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmonster-hunter-stories-collection-gets-first-big-discount-for-nintendo-switch%2F1100-6526043%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Stories (PC)</a> -- $24.60 ($<strike>30</strike>)</li></ul><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buy-two-get-one-free-nintendo-switch-games-and-preorders-my-best-buy-members/1100-6525928/">B2G1 Free All Nintendo Switch Games - Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom, Mario &amp; Luigi, And More Preorders</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Live Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-anthology-preorders-quakecon-2024/1100-6525656/">Doom Anthology Preorders Are Live - Comes With 6 Games, Steelbook Case, And Replica BFG</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retrorealms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retro-game-preorder-guide/1100-6525752/">Halloween And Ash Vs.

            <p>If you are partial to a freebie (or two), you can currently get your hands on both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> and Gigantic: Rampage Edition over on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>The two games are available to claim until 29th August.</p>
<p>After this time, the store will switch up its freebies, and offer interested patrons the ability to claim the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> Classic Collection and Wild Card Football up until 5th September (honestly, where is the year going?!).</p>

<p>The Callisto Protocol came from Striking Distance Studios, which was set up by Dead Space alum Glen Schofield. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-review-a-dead-space-alike-built-on-simpler-pleasures">Eurogamer's Callisto Protocol review</a>, Vikki acknowledged that while "Dead Space comparisons are impossible to avoid", she felt it made up for some of the missing tension "with production value and bloody-minded fun".</p>
<p>Despite this, however, The Callisto Protocol reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to hit sales targets</a>, which caused publisher Krafton's share prices to fall. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">Striking Distance subsequently laid off 32 employees</a> in August last year - a month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">Schofield left the studio</a> "to pursue new opportunities". More recently, Schofield said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-publisher-krafton-insisted-on-releasing-it-too-soon-says-director-glen-schofield">Krafton forced Striking Distance to release the game early</a>.</p>
<p>You can claim this week's free games <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games">via this link here</a>.</p>
<p>Next week's Fallout offering, meanwhile, will likely spark some interest following the acclaimed reception of Amazon's TV adaptation. The show's success - which saw<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks"> 65 million viewers</a> tuning in in its first 16 days of release - has already seen droves of players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-fallout-games">venturing into one or many of Fallout's wastelands</a>, to find out what delights were in store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a message posted to X/Twitter, Mateusz Lenart hinted that even that kind of run time would likely not include "the new game plus and all the endings".</p>

<p>He then posted a string of six emojis, all of which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> fans will instantly recognise as nods to the game's original six endings.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in response to a comment, Lenart teased there would be "no spoilers - not even through emojis" for any of the other secrets the team has planned.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you like to spent your time searching for everything that we put into the game and things we've hidden for you, it will take you more than 20h for sure 👀! I'm not couting the new game plus and all endings of course. I'm curious how fast will you get all of them👽🐕🚸💧🕯👱‍♀️...</p>— Mateusz Lenart (@Mateusz_Lenart_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1825963159695536274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Asked what he was most proud of later in the same X thread, Lenart <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1826005579493736736">said</a>: "I'm proud of everything truly. But if I would need to chose I think the general flow of the game and new level design/puzzles approach. I believe we've been able to find a nice balance between the memory of the original locations and new content that will be able to surprise even the long time fans of SH2."</p>
<p>On Monday (19th August), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-drops-a-new-story-trailer-and-yes-we-finally-get-to-see-eddie">Konami dropped a brand new story trailer for Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, letting us meet Eddie and Mary for the first time.</p>
<p>The teaser essentially matched the original's acclaimed 2001 E3 trailer, and the script is almost identical, too, all set against a fabulous reimagining of (one of) Silent Hill 2's end themes, Promise.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Tom Morgan shared his thoughts on the opening hours of the remake in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding">Silent Hill 2 Remake preview</a>.
</p>
<p>"In rebuilding such a beloved classic with upgraded visuals and controls, the new combat style fits in surprisingly well," Tom wrote in his excellent summary.
</p>
<p>"What I've seen so far of Silent Hill 2 Remake, though, shows a team determined to stick to the original blueprint first. It provides the game a comfortingly familiar structure - while allowing new detail to flourish around it like a trellis - and I'm looking forward to seeing where it grows past its first three hours."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Striking Distance Studios and publisher Krafton have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]</em>, a top-down roguelike set in the world of survival horror game&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>.</p>
<p>You might know&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>better as&nbsp;<em>Project Birdseye</em>, which is the name under which it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za06-A8-_5w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first revealed back in March</a>. At that time, Striking Distance said that the game was a "side quest", and that the team wanted to "see if the concept clicks with you as much as it has with us".</p>
<p>Well, it looks like that concept has indeed found its intended audience, because now the project is officially called&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>(yes, complete with brackets) and it's set for release across PC and current-gen consoles on October 31st.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redacted-callisto-protocol-roguelike-gunplay.jpg?itok=fDlSSE6A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redacted-callisto-protocol-roguelike-gunplay.jpg?itok=JuaSJlUt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>is set to bring&nbsp;<em>Callisto Protocol</em>-adjacent roguelike thrills this October.</figcaption></figure><p>Each run allows you to experiment with loadouts of different weapons, buffs, and "powerful experiments" as you blast your way through&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/callisto-protocol"><em>The Callisto Protocol</em></a>'s Black Iron Prison.</p>
<p>As you play, you'll gain loot, and you can then use that loot to unlock new permanent weapons and buffs for future runs, and there's even a <i>ZombiU</i>-style mechanic that reanimates your corpse when you die, tasking you with defeating it to unlock a powerful new upgrade.</p>
<p>In a rather unique twist on the formula, at the end of each run, <i>[Redacted]&nbsp;</i>will ask you whether you want to escape or turn back and "risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the prison". Successfully completing said run will grant you new permanent gear.</p>
<p>All of this is wrapped up in an "irreverent attitude" that's a little less serious than&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, as well as an "arcade-punk soundtrack" composed by&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter&nbsp;</em>soundtrack studio Mutato Muzika.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2229940/REDACTED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007288/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/redacted/9p153bg8qmnq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 31st. If you want to know where it all began,&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently free on the Epic Games Store</a> for a week. Just be aware that you'll need a real beast of a PC to run it well.</p>

What you might not know is that it has a sequel, but it isn’t a movie.

While the plot of the game is much more melodramatic and less tightly paced than the film’s, it’s still a damn good time. There are crime syndicates aplenty, kidnappings, and more bullets getting fired that you can possibly imagine. It’s a pulpy action fever dream worthy of Woo’s name. </p><p>That action is exactly what makes <em>Stranglehold </em>so much fun, as the game works overtime to translate the signature style of Woo’s films into something you can actually play. It plays out as a third-person shooter with some unique flair. If you’ve seen a Woo film, you’ll know that the director has a penchant for incredibly choreographed action scenes with slow-motion, dual-wielded weapons, and—yes—lots of doves flying around.</p><p>One of the best aspects of <em>Stranglehold </em>is its decision to forgo the need to reload the many weapons you will use to take down enemies. Instead you start off with a hefty amount of ammo and run through levels, never needing to worry about resource scarcity. This means you can just run and gun to your heart’s content. And you will do a lot of this considering how many enemies each level is filled with. To emulate the action ballet of Woo’s films, Tequila can also dive around in slow motion—a la <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091"><em>Max Payne</em></a></span>—and fire off rounds with more time to take aim in the air. </p><p>To encourage you to play with cinematic flair yourself, there is also a style mechanic during combat, something you might expect to see more in hack-n-slash games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591"><em>Devil May Cry</em></a></span> rather than a third-person shooter. By taking down enemies, using slow-motion dives, and activating special abilities called Tequila Bombs during combat, you build up stars rating how stylish you’ve been. This all combines to make <em>Stranglehold </em>a frenetic and fun action game with a cinematic twist that puts you in the director’s seat of every scene. For two bucks, it’s an absolute steal worth spending a weekend with. Also, go watch <em>Hard Boiled</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The frame rates on Monster Hunter Wilds could be limited on consoles. According to people who’ve played the demo while at Gamescom, the game appeared to be running at 30 FPS on PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p>



<p>“Demo was on a ps5, didn’t run at 60fps but felt like a stable 30fps,” one person (<a href="https://x.com/MH_Canta/status/1826208752078385195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MH_Canta</a>) said about their experience. </p>







<p>In a follow up question about their experience, Canta said said that they didn’t see an option to switch to a performance mode. Thought, it’s worth noting that the game being shown is still an early build without the full feature set. So, for some, that does leave hope that it could be added down the line.</p>



<p>For what its worth, Dragon’s Dogma 2 was 30 FPS during demos ahead of its launch. However, after it was released on console, it was eventually given an update to set frame rate options within the game’s settings.</p>



<p>For clarification purposes, Insider Gaming has reached out to Capcom for comment on the game’s frame rate and if it could be 60 FPS by the time it launches. As of publishing, however, no response was received.</p>

<p>There were numerous rumors surrounding the announcement of NHL 25, with a few leaks indicating the game wouldn’t launch on old systems. It appears they were true. NHL 25 won’t launch on last-gen consoles, which is something of a shock considering some of the most popular titles in the franchise were on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Developers want to look forward, not backward.</p>



<p>In the past, titles in the NHL franchise enjoyed a broad launch to bring in as many players as possible. But this time, EA Sports opted for exclusivity to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s a first, and it’s definitely going to rub some long-time players the wrong way. Unsurprisingly, many have yet to upgrade to the current-gen systems. They’re expensive, so we don’t blame you one bit! Unfortunately, that means missing out on a favorite franchise this time.</p>



<p>For now, check out the official reveal trailer here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 25 Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDHIrnNAWPo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But you may want to reconsider. NHL 25 on current-gen systems features several gameplay improvements, such as the ICE-Q system, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-25-details-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>, which completely changes how players experience hockey firsthand, with a strong focus on authenticity and intelligence on the ice.</p>



<p><span>NHL 25’s official release date is <strong>October 4</strong>, so you won’t have to wait long&nbsp;to play it</span>. </p>

                <p>EA Sports has officially announced NHL 25, and for the first time in the series, the game has not one but <em>three </em>cover stars. And these aren't three all-stars from different teams--they're the Hughes brothers.</p><p>Jack and Luke of the New Jersey Devils, along with Quinn of the Vancouver Canucks, will grace the cover of the NHL 25 Deluxe Edition. Jack stands alone on the cover for the standard edition, while Quinn gets the standard edition cover for Canada and the rest of the world. Luke, sadly for him, doesn't get his own standalone cover.</p><p>"We feel incredibly honored to be on the cover of NHL 25," Quinn said. "Being featured alongside my brothers is the sort of thing you dream about as a kid but could never imagine happening in real life."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4354756-screenshot2024-08-21at3.30.08pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354756" data-ratio="0.57243460764588" data-width="1988" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4354756-screenshot2024-08-21at3.30.08pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354756"></a><figcaption>The Hughes brothers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4354756-screenshot2024-08-21at3.30.08pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355340-standardeditionjackhughes-usaonly.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355341-standardeditionquinnhughes-canadaandworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355340,1300-4355341" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355340-standardeditionjackhughes-usaonly.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355341-standardeditionquinnhughes-canadaandworld.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355340-standardeditionjackhughes-usaonly.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355341-standardeditionquinnhughes-canadaandworld.jpg"></figure><p>Jack added: "It reminded us that on the ice, we're competitors, always learning from each other, but off the ice, we're brothers who love to play hockey."</p><p>Luke said, "We have a one-of-a-kind hockey story growing up together and now a one-of-a-kind cover. We can't wait for fans to experience NHL 25."</p><p>In terms of what's new in NHL 25, EA says the game has a new "logic-driven animation system" that is able to better replicate an authentic NHL experience. One of the pillars is what's called Next-Gen Vision Control, which is a skating mechanic that gives players more freedom and control on and off the puck. The game also boasts improved AI to help teammates respond more realistically. There are also new "Reactive Actions," which include new animations for "critical" moments in hockey games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355327-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4355327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355327-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4355327"></a><figcaption>A first look at NHL 25</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355327-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355330-nhl25_nextgenvisioncontrol_lhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355331-nhl25_onetimer_qhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355332-nhl25_reactiveactions_dahlin_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355333-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_closeup_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355335-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355336-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355338-nhl25_utah_home_keller_001_wm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4355330,1300-4355331,1300-4355332,1300-4355333,1300-4355335,1300-4355336,1300-4355338" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355330-nhl25_nextgenvisioncontrol_lhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355331-nhl25_onetimer_qhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355332-nhl25_reactiveactions_dahlin_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355333-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_closeup_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355335-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355336-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355338-nhl25_utah_home_keller_001_wm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355330-nhl25_nextgenvisioncontrol_lhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355331-nhl25_onetimer_qhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355332-nhl25_reactiveactions_dahlin_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355333-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_closeup_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355335-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355336-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355338-nhl25_utah_home_keller_001_wm.png"></figure><p>What's more, NHL 25 has a new skill-based system for one-timers that will reward players for setting up plays in the right way.

			<p>Avowed is the latest game by Obsidian Entertainment, the masterminds behind Pentiment, Grounded, and Fallout: New Vegas. It is a brand-new action role-playing game set in the same world as Pillars of Eternity, where players explore the familiar world of Eora. While still in development, Game Director Carrie Patel took part in an interview at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqPvOB0cDZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamescom 2024 with IGN</a> where she spoke about Avowed's endings. So far, the Avowed possible endings have reached the double digits, giving the game plenty of replayability, especially for the completionists.</p>
<p>Being published by Xbox Game Studios, Avowed is set to be released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/">February 18, 2025</a>. Originally, it was set to be released this year but has since experienced delays, pushing the game back to the first quarter of next year. Avowed was first announced in 2020 during an Xbox Series X showcase, where excited fans were introduced to this new role-playing game. Since then, Avowed has evolved significantly and is shaping to look better than it was previously.</p>
<p>In the interview, Carrie Patel discussed the number of endings that players can expect to see in the game, with some of them being ending slides rather than full endings. "I can tell you our ending slides number in the double digits; you can end up with a lot of different combinations of them."</p>
<p>How many "full" endings there are for Avowed remains unseen, and how many make up the ending slides. For those unaware, ending slides are contextual slides at the end of the game that tell you what happened to the player and any crucial characters you may have encountered. Plenty of RPGs have this, as well as games that have multiple endings that can be obtained.</p>
<p>"Your ending really is the sum total of your choices in this game," Patel added. Avowed is set to release on Xbox and PC, with no word of whether this game will be introduced to PlayStation 5 later. Players have the choice to play the game either in first-person or third-person, depending on their preference. At the moment, details regarding Avowed are pretty scarce, but there are multiple trailers for curious people to look at, which can give them a glimpse into the upcoming fantasy RPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULsF7B6bFuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you want more context for the upcoming fantasy RPG, jumping into Pillars of Eternity is an option that may help you piece together contextual clues for Avowed when the game is eventually released in February.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-roadmap-promises-new-heist-ui-revamp-and-more.960960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze has finally revealed the&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>roadmap, detailing what's coming to the multiplayer heist shooter in the next couple of months. As the studio itself says, better late than never, right?</p>
<p>You can see the full roadmap over on Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/payday3/medicbag/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>. It's all part of the studio's Medic Bag initiative, which is an attempt to turn around the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance">struggling fortunes</a> of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/payday-3">flagship multiplayer title</a> (which is currently performing significantly worse than&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam player count stakes</a>).</p>
<p>This month, Starbreeze has delivered a new paid DLC pack in the form of Chapter 3: Houston Breakout, as well as a new heist, new animations, and more. There's more to come in the pipeline over September and October, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-september-october.jpg?itok=LnhGCpSc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-september-october.jpg?itok=2B4v4Dxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>roadmap has plenty of goodies in store.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, in September, the new "Fear and Greed" paid DLC will be released, and it'll bring a new heist, new weapons, and a Tailor Pack for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new masks and a new Overkill weapon as part of that month's free goodies, so you'll get those whether you pay for Fear and Greed or not.</p>
<p>October, meanwhile, it bringing a new Year I Edition DLC. It's not entirely clear what this DLC will contain, but it rather sounds like it'll package in all of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s paid DLC so far, plus maybe a few extras for the die-hard faithful.</p>
<p>Free updates coming in October include a UI revamp, a server browser feature, and a VOIP function, as well as new Twitch drops. This is not, perhaps, the comprehensive roadmap that a game which arguably resulted in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down">ousting of its developer's CEO</a> needs, but hey, it's something.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-lasers.jpg?itok=LeUAJSKw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-lasers.jpg?itok=P0IaHGDZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might not quite be over for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Presumably, Starbreeze is planning more new features for <i>Payday 3</i>'s future, so this very much won't be all you've got to look forward to. Hopefully, the dev can squeeze in those responsibilities between idea sessions for its new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026"><em>Dungeons and Dragons&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007263" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/payday-3/9NPZVDCH73SX/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>It is perhaps deeply ungrateful of me that, when presented with the squirrel with a gun of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel With A Gun</a>, my immediate reaction is to thrust out my bowl like a ballsy victorian urchin and ask for <em>additional squirrel information</em>. It’s not that developer Dee Dee Creations haven’t shown off the game in action. It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And look, sure. If I made a game called Squirrel With A Gun, and someone asked me what the game was, y’know, about, then I’d probably just do the equivalent of what these trailers are doing. That is, I’d continuously shout “squirrel with a gun!” until they either left in a huff or started shouting it with me. Maybe we’d start jumping up and down on the spot at some point. Maybe there’d be party poppers.
</p>
<p>And yet, I find myself in the position of - if not a party pooper - at least the equivalent of a commenter on a nice squirrel documentary, writing out a list of horrible diseases you can catch from their bites (salmonelosis, typhus, ringworm). Here’s the launch trailer.</p>

<p>It’s not absent of tangible information, and neither is the game’s<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2067050/Squirrel_with_a_Gun/"> Steam page</a>. We know it’ll be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> of some sort, possibly in the 3D Mario vein - your goal is collecting golden acorns. We know you’ll use the recoil from weapons to pull off tricky navigation challenges. And we know that the title is a slight misnomer, because the squirrel can actually have several guns. One of them is a six-shooter, and it also comes with a little cowboy hat for the squirrel to wear. You'll collect such apparel by doing side quests for strangers. Also, pets.</p>
<p>In truth, I’ve wishlisted games on less information than this. It’s just that, quite unfairly, Squirrel With A Gun’s memey cuteness means I’m expecting it to work twice as hard to fully sell itself to me. Isn’t this the opposite of how appearing cute to humans is supposed to work in nature? I don’t have time to check how tight the evolutionary science is on that, but I also don’t remember harbouring a deep mistrust for any adorable mammals recently. I’ve had my cat less than a week, mind.</p>
<p>What do you reckon? Is this a hollow meme wearing the skin of a devious tree rat, with nothing much going for it beyond a viral-worthy concept? Or will it have some substance to it? “The squirrel that you kill in jest, dies in earnest,” wrote Thoreau. Might we expect the same earnestness from the squirrel that does the killing? One in the chamber isn't enough, squirrel. I need to know your heart's in it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Lara stays booked and busy, even if the next big game isn’t quite in our field of view. But if you’re missing the titular tomb raider these days, Dark Horse has a pretty great statue up for pre-order that marries the look of her original design and the tools of the reboot trilogy.</p><p>Dark Horse is selling a statue of Lara dressed in her iconic teal tank top, scaling ruins overgrown by roots as nature reclaims it. The roughly 9-inch-tall figure comes with two sets of arms, one that has her wielding the dual pistols she was known for in the early <em>Tomb Raider </em>games and another that has the climbing ax she uses in the reboot trilogy. Right now the <em>Tomb Raider </em>series is trying to build a bridge between the origin story of the reboot games and the seasoned version of Lara we meet in the first games, with Netflix’s <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft </em>set to finally fill in the gap between the two. So the statue paying homage to both continuities as part of Lara’s story is a nice detail that captures where the series is at right now.</p><p>The statue itself looks pretty good, especially for the relatively cheap price of $89.99.

"And you can end up with a lot of different combinations of them. This is an Obsidian game, so your ending is really the sum total of your choices across the game, across a lot of pieces of content depending on what you encountered and what you did when you found it."</p><p dir="ltr">What Patel describes sounds similar to endings in other RPGs like Fallout (of which Obsidian has experience working on, having developed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>), where a slideshow of different consequences play out at the end of the game showing the results of a player's actions as they pertain to different factions, storylines, and characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Patel further elaborated more on the choices players will be making in Avowed.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are a lot of choices to be made about where your true loyalties lie, who your allegiance is with in the endgame," Patel said. "We're really excited for players to explore those possibilities and build their own story."</p><p dir="ltr">Obsidian is putting a big emphasis on Avowed's companion characters, having recently <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1823056988814635415" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed the voice cast</a> for the group of characters players will be teaming up with over the course of the fantasy adventure.

<p>According to <a href="https://nikopartners.com/journey-to-success-black-myth-wukong-breaks-records-on-day-one/">Niko Partners</a> analyst Daniel Ahmad, that's a new record to go alongside its newly-minted accolade of being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">the most popular single-player game by peak concurrent users (PCCU) in Steam history</a>.</p>

<p>Ahmad also points out that this success isn't just limited to digital, either.</p>
<p>"Physical editions of the game, including collector's and deluxe versions, sold out within seconds on JD.com, as more than 700,000 gamers signed up for a chance to purchase the limited set of 30,000 copies," he said.</p> <div>

<p>"The broader implications of this success cannot be overlooked," Admad added.</p>
<p>"It signals that Chinese studios are ready to compete directly with established Western and Japanese developers in the premium AAA space. Game Science’s transition from mobile game development to creating a world-class AAA title, backed by heavyweights like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Hero Games, is a path that many Chinese game developers are already trying to follow with growing success."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/08/21/wukong-game-debut-drives-playstation-5-to-top-of-alibaba-tmall/">Bloomberg</a> reports that Black Myth: Wukong has also sparked a demand for PS5 consoles in China, with sales of Sony's system twice that of the same period last year.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now Steam's second-biggest game of all time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">clocking up a staggering peak of 2.3m concurrent players</a>, having pushed both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> down a place. Only PUBG: Battlegrounds boasts a higher concurrent peak of 3.2m, and that's a multiplayer battle royale.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong secured three out of five stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer's Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," Katharine wrote at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
