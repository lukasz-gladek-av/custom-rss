                <p dir="ltr">A new update has arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The June 12 patch notes detail several improvements to Grief mode for Zombies. It also addresses a bug for the recently disabled "Numbers" skin for Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the update focuses on multiplayer and Zombies. However, the patch notes address an issue with Season 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/">Essex Model 07 marksman rifle</a>, which previously prevented the rapid fire attachment from working properly in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-call-of-duty-skin-is-broken-and-temporarily-removed/1100-6532174/" data-ref-id="1100-6532174">Numbers operator skin for Frank Woods was disabled</a> for a visual bug, but this update addresses the issue. This means players who own this skin should be able to use it again in both games.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch details several improvements for Grief mode in Zombies, which are designed to help reduce the match length and intensify the rounds. These includes a five-minute cooldown for Gobblegums, a reduction to salvage drops, and the zombies now deal more damage to players. Treyarch says this damage change means it should only take four hits for a player to go down, assuming they have armor and perks. Additionally, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection streaks no longer drop from special and elite enemies, and the crafting of self-revives is now limited to one per player.</p><p dir="ltr">For another positive change, players who are AFK in Grief mode will be kicked from matches more quickly. This seems to be just the beginning of quality-of-life improvements for the mode. "We've got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all griefs more impactful," the developer wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for Black Ops 6 can be found below, as <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-04-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. This marks the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><h2>CALL OF DUTY GLOBAL PATCH NOTES</h2><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>Essex Model 07</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the Rapid Fire Mod was not functioning as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the “Numbers Woods” Operator Skin for Woods would appear bright red in the lobby.</li></ul><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Liberty Falls</b><ul><li>Addressed an exploit with Shock Charges.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><p><strong>Grief:</strong></p><p>Today, we’ve deployed a new round of Grief tuning changes focused on reducing match length and increasing the intensity of each game. The biggest of these changes boosts the threat of the zombies, so even our base zombies feel dangerous early on and only get deadlier as the rounds go up. When the pace of the game increases, so should the danger of making a mistake! With these new damage values, we’re targeting 4 hits to go down for players who've been keeping up with their Perks and Armor buys.</p><p>We’ve also implemented changes to limit players’ ability to extend a match beyond its intended ceiling. Today’s update limits GobbleGum availability by extending the machine’s cooldown to 5 minutes, with more tweaks to GobbleGum usage potentially planned for the future based on player data. Salvage drops have also been reduced from 100 to 50 per pickup, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection can no longer drop from Specials and Elites, and crafting Self-Revives is now limited to 1 per player. This should all result in more intense sessions for everyone... and ideally fewer multi-hour matches!</p><p>Like you, we've also been bummed out by AFK players in our matches and will now kick them out sooner. We’ve got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all Griefs more impactful. Until then, jump in and let us know how these changes are feeling once you’ve gotten a few matches under your belt.</p><p>P.S.: For those unaware, each victory in a Capture Zone awards that team 2,000 Essence, so get on it!</p><ul><li>Enemy-based melee damage against players now escalates faster than Standard Zombies modes.  <ul><li>Starting at Round 1, enemies will do increased melee damage (1.5x) in Grief.</li><li>Enemy melee damage will continue to scale to a maximum scalar (4x) after round 20.</li></ul></li><li>Increased GobbleGum machine cooldown to 5 minutes.</li><li>Salvage pickup value reduced from 100 to 50.</li><li>Self-Revive crafting limit reduced to 1 per player.</li><li>Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection Support items can no longer drop from Special or Elite enemies.</li><li>AFK players are now kicked after 60 seconds of inactivity.</li></ul><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>AS VAL</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue that prevented players from viewing Barrel attachments for the AS VAL.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><b>UI </b></h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s Equipment and Field Upgrade HUD elements could appear grayed-out when another player activated Mutant Injection.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Addressed various stability issues.</li></ul>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How IO Interactive Is Making James Bond Different From Hitman</p>
      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a> is IO Interactive's first licensed game. Abrak said that the only reason they took the project on is that their partners gave them "freedom" to express themselves within the game.</p><p>"From the get-go we didn't want to do a gamification of a movie," Abrak said. "We really wanted to have a swing at our young Bond and his origin story. It's something a bit more dynamic and youthful."</p><p>Abrak didn't say anything more about their fantasy project during the interview, but he did bring it up unprompted meaning that they may have more to share sometime in the near future. IO Interactive has some details on a page about the project published on their <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-fantasy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website.</a></p><p>"We are building a new world, a new IP--an online fantasy RPG," the site reads. "A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come. It feels familiar, yet at the same time IOI is going on a journey unlike any we have been on before."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/nintendo-switch-2-review-one-week-with-the-new-generation-handheld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launched to somewhat mixed expectations, but it’s safe to say that with record-break sales through its first weekend, Nintendo has knocked this one out of the park. This is a very safe console — a more straightforward upgrade than what we’ve typically seen from this company — but one that expands and refines the original vision for the Switch.</p>
<h2>Screen time</h2>
<p>It starts with the hardware itself. While the Switch OLED was able to improve on the original design — bringing more solidity to the body, a more robust kickstand and better quality screen, the Switch 2 is able to kick on in areas that the OLED couldn’t. The screen is much larger, jumping from the original’s 6.2” and the OLED’s 7”&nbsp; to a more modern 7.9″, increasing the height of the console in the process, and there’s a new profile that’s more gently rounded at the back but has a sharper edge to the flat faced front. The kickstand has iterated on the Switch OLED’s design, using the same adjustable hinges, but having a cutout foot instead of the whole lower half of the back panel. It feels a bit flimsier, but it’s just as sturdy in practice.</p>



<p>Of course, this isn’t an OLED screen, it’s a reversion to an LCD panel. While this might be a downgrade in screen technology,&nbsp; it’s a vast improvement from the original Switch. This is a 1080p panel, it can do 120Hz with VRR, and there is a limited form of HDR – it’s not amazing HDR, but it does have an effect. The laminated screen brings the picture right up to the glass, giving better contrast and blacks, while also being powerfully bright and vibrantly colourful. It’s a nice screen, but one that will almost certainly be succeeded by a premium OLED revision down the line.</p>
<p>Part of the cost of this, both with the new chipset and the larger screen, is that battery life has slid back to a 2 to 6.5 hour range – less than the Switch OLED and roughly equivalent to the original Switch. This is obviously heavily dependent on how taxing the game is, the brightness and volume settings you have and other factors, but it feels about right. You’ll get a couple hour of Mario Kart out of it before wanting to charge, and that can be more convenient with USB-C at top and bottom of the console.</p>

<p>With the larger tablet body comes taller Joy-Con 2 on the side. These have a more rounded, softer feel in the hand, and attach with magnets instead of a metal rail, snapping in and out of place in a very satisfying fashion. We’ll have to wait and see how much creaking and flexing comes to affect these connectors over time, as they did with the Switch, but the initial concerns over their durability can be put to one side. It’s a bizarre quirk, but you can attach Joy-Con 2 upside-down and back to front, and the fact that this is possible through a purely symmetrical design is actually a good thing. Permitting mistakes makes things harder to break.</p>

<p>The increased size of the Joy-Con 2 allows for larger SR/SL rail buttons, so they’re used directly instead of having larger buttons on the wrist strap rail (which also satisfyingly uses magnets), and there’s even space for the optical sensor to enable mouse mode. Time will tell whether Joy-Con drift has a sequel — the Joy-Con 2 does not have Hall Effect analogue sticks — but the analogue sticks do now have full-sized heads to match standard game pads, even if the height is still shrunk down.</p>
<h2>Softly does it</h2>
<p>On to the software, we have a light revision of the Switch’s UI. The games are now rounded squares instead of pointed, the system icons are encased in a unified bar instead of being individual circles, and the highlighted icon now has a more animated colour instead of pulsing.</p>
<p>It is, however, significantly faster in very obvious areas. The Switch could choke and die just loading into the eShop, whereas <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/the-switch-2s-best-feature-might-be-that-the-eshop-doesnt-suck/">the new eShop on the Switch 2</a> just breezes through the massive lists of game icons. And when it comes to downloads, having SSD performance from both the internal 256GB and the new MicroSD Express standard allows you to download at full fibre internet speeds. Whether over gigabit Ethernet or WiFi 6, the Switch 2 can pull down a game at up to 400Mbps (though has more commonly been around 250–300Mbps in my experience) using my gigabit internet speeds. That’s not maxing out my connection, of course, but it’s fast enough.</p>
<div id="attachment_460341"><p id="caption-attachment-460341">The new Nintendo Switch 2 eShop homepage</p></div>
<p>And you’ll want and need that for the larger games that we’re seeing on Switch 2. Hitman: World of Assassination is 58GB, Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut is 45GB, and if they need to patch, prepare yourself for the console to demand enough space to re-write the entire game while updating. That 256GB internal storage can and will feel pretty small after a few of these ported PlayStation and Xbox staples, so the price of MicroSD Express cards can’t come down quickly enough.</p>
<h2>New Nintendo quirks</h2>
<p>The Switch 2 brings two core features to the table: GameChat and GameShare. GameChat is Nintendo finally getting onboard with built-in voice chat — they even dedicated a whole button to it! It works well, within the company’s typically constrained system. The first hitch comes when enabling GameChat, which requires a phone number to be attached to your Nintendo account in advance — without that, you’ll likely get a blank white screen that offers no help, the unstated fix being to add the number via a web browser before try. Then you manually approve which of your friends you like enough to want to talk to, adding a further layer to needing to still use friend codes. But once you’ve jumped through the hoops, voice chat is… fine.</p>
<p>The audio quality from the built-in microphone does an OK job of relaying what people are saying, though you will be best using a headset. What’s curious is the desire to have the chat tiles along the bottom of the screen, shrinking the play screen down above it — It’s like a Zoom call where the main tile is your game. This is acceptable when on a large TV, but you really feel the smaller play area when in handheld. Thankfully there are three layout settings, so you can have smaller thumbnails or just have the game full screen while anyone that’s speaking is highlighted in the top corner.</p>

<p>Of course, the intention is that people have cameras turned on and share their game screen. I do like having the camera enabled — it’s quite a bit of fun for Mario Kart where your face appears in-game — and there’s good Nvidia-powered features to track your face, blur backgrounds and the like… but when everyone’s gameplay is streamed at just 10fps, it’s much more of a distracting judder than it should be.</p>
<p>It could be made more elegant: for example, it could start full screen and indicate whether someone starts us using a camera, while speakers could be represented by avatars instead of names, and the chat icons positioned by the player to avoid blocking the UI. It’s a decent start that I hope will be improved over time.</p>
<p>GameShare, meanwhile, is the Switch 2’s replacement for DS Download Play, and a cleverly adapted take on PlayStation’s Share Play and Steam’s Remote Play Together. The host invites people to join them for GameShare, the Switch 2 then renders and streams the game to everyone else’s devices. But there’s a unique twist in that every player can have their own view, instead of sharing the full screen. In 51 Clubhouse Games, you can all have your own secret hand of cards; in Fast Fusion, you each have a full view instead of having the split-screen. Well… I say “full”, but there’s an infuriating info bar announcing that this is GameShare on the top of the screen that actually shrinks your view. Why, Nintendo? Why is this not just a bubble in the corner of the screen?</p>

<p>It’s an ingenious twist, something that nobody else is doing, even if it’s inherently limited. GameShare has to be enabled by developers on a game-by-game basis, and within that it’s specified whether games can be shared via local WiFi and via GameChat, and whether it can work with the original Switch as well. The encoded stream is good — it’s NVENC, after all — but it can struggle with something like Fast Fusion, where the world is whizzing by at lightning speed.</p>
<h2>Launch library</h2>
<p>Turning to the games, we see where the Switch 2 is currently at its weakest. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> is the only truly essential game for this console right now, though anti-grav racing connoisseurs would argue for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/fast-fusion-review/">Fast Fusion</a>. Aside from that, current Switch 2 gaming is really all about upgrades, ports, patches and backward compatibility, and the future holds plenty of cross-gen games as Nintendo tries to cling onto the vast Switch playerbase for as long as possible.</p>

<p>It’s not as exciting, but the Switch 2 holds up very well in the comparisons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition is a very good port</a> that makes the most of DLSS to deliver 1080p30 consistently on Switch 2, comparing very favourably to the Xbox Series S, albeit with more limited resolution and performance targets. Hitman: World of Assassination is an all-encompassing collection that performs handily, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/yakuza-0-directors-cut-red-light-raiding-in-switch-2s-exclusive-multiplayer-mode/">Yakuza 0 is a good port</a> of a game that really doesn’t trouble the Switch 2 in the slightest.</p>
<p>There’s all the games that have received Switch 2 patches. Lumping the paid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">Switch 2 Editions</a> of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> in here alongside free updates to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>, Super Mario Odyssey, Link’s Awakening, Echoes of Wisdom and more, you’ve got a range of improvements, from resolution bumps, to frame rates, added HDR and the addition of GameShare in multiplayer games.</p>
<p>The difference is more noticeable in some games than others. The stuttering of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening</a> has been vanquished, BOTW and TOTK jump up to 60fps, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> is just a night and day difference — it’s staggering how naff it still is on the original Switch.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Switch 2 Backward Compatibility fixes a lot of bad Switch frame rates" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds3mP6OMM9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But then there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">the rest of the Switch back catalogue</a> — all the games with troubled performance and the “impossible” ports. The Switch 2 runs these games through a translation layer, similar to Apple’s Rosetta and Valve’s Proton, dynamically translating calls to match new APIs and chip capabilities, and the results can lift a lot of games with troubled performance out of the mire. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/bayonetta-3-review/">Bayonetta 3</a> is basically a locked 60fps now instead of lurching back and forth in the 40’s and 50’s; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> locks to 30fps and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/21/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review-switch-musou/">Fire Emblem: Three Hopes</a> shoots up to 60fps with its unlocked frame rate, and on, and on. The impact will be constrained by frame rate caps and resolution limits, so all of these games would benefit from a patch to add Switch 2 appropriate performance profiles, but at a base level this is a major improvement.</p>

            <p>
I feel like every time I write about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, I always have to add a caveat along the lines of, "I don't really like shooters… but!" There often is a but, because occasionally one of 'em rolls around that feels like it just gets me, you know? This week, it's a shooter that feels like it was born to be a Flash game on Newgrounds in the mid-2000s that you'll sometimes bring up to your friends saying "man, remember that one game?" It's called Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion, and as simple as its title is, there's a lot going for it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For one, it's being made by Bubby Darkstar, the same developer behind 2021's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1750570/Subway_Midnight/">Subway Midnight</a>, a game I'm always surprised by insofar that it doesn't have as far reaching an obsessive fan base as I thought it would get. Subway Midnight is already a visually surreal delight, but Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion really looks like it's amping up the balls to the walls zaniness factor. It apparently has over 200 NPCs to "interact and have terrible conversations with," all of which are hand-drawn, a kind of ridiculous feat for what I think might be a dev team of not much more than one.

<p>
You've also got more than 50 unique robots to take on, dozens of bosses, "a guy named 'Donnie' who's a real freak" and six levels to wade through. Gameplay wise it looks like your classic boomer shooter by way of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a>, plenty of regular guns to find and use, alongside a few weirder ones. This thing just looks worth playing through if you're an animation lover alone, the colours are so vibrant and some of the designs on display feel like they were born to be turned into Twitter profile pictures (but like, when Twitter wasn't what it is now, when it was sometimes ok and not a constant hellfire).
</p>
<p>
The trailer also clearly points out that not a drop of generative AI was used to make it, a disclaimer that I wish didn't have to exist, but one I'm glad to see all the same. It's not too far away from release either - currently it's slated to be released next month, July 10th. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763820/Shooty_Shooty_Robot_Invasion/?curator_clanid=4777282">here</a>.

If you have an iPad with powerful enough specs--M1 or better is recommended--you could use the new Kishi V3 Pro XL to play a few of the AAA games that have been ported to Apple platforms, including Death Stranding and multiple Resident Evil games, on a giant Nintendo Switch-like handheld.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL includes a six-month subscription to Apple Arcade for new and eligible returning subscribers.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Kishi V3 Pro for Phones &amp; Tablets up to 8"</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Kishi V3 Pro has the same tech as the XL model, just geared toward smaller mobile devices.

It still has TMR sticks, remappable back buttons, and Hall Effect triggers, but it drops a couple features and makes changes to several components to keep the price down. It doesn't have the claw-grip bumpers or Sensa HD Haptics, and the face buttons and D-pad don't have the mouse-click feel and feedback. The four-way D-pad and buttons are "Quiet-tactile," which is likely a fancy way to say they feel conventional.</p><p>The Kishi V3 should fit most Android smartphones thanks to its "island" design and thicker depth clearance, and it also comes with three months of Apple Arcade for free.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Razer isn't the only player in this game, as GameSir offers its own controller cradle for tablets.

This one syncs via Bluetooth and supports iOS and Android devices up to 8.5 inches. It's also compatible with Nintendo Switch and the new Switch 2, which is a big perk.</p><p>Smartphone owners can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-pro-is-a-larger-more-customizable-version-of-the-best-mobile-controller/1100-6531316/" data-ref-id="1100-6531316">check out the new Backbone Pro</a>, which offers a pro-style setup to mobile gaming. Building off of the foundation established by the Backbone One, this snap-on USB-C controller for iPhone 15/16 and Android phones is an impressive upgrade compared to its predecessor.</p><p>You can also use it as a wireless Bluetooth controller on tablets, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and more devices, and it's highly customizable via the official Backbone App. Overall, this is a comfier and feature-packed successor to the Backbone One. Like Razer's V3 Pro controllers, the Backbone Pro is pricier than many mobile controllers at $170.</p><hr>

This black edition also features grey accents along the edges and a stitched backrest that appears more premium than its price would suggest. Beyond that, you’re getting many of the standard gaming chair features--including a 165-degree reclining angle, a wide seat, and a weight capacity up to 300 pounds. Note that this model is discontinued, so this may be the last chance to grab it before it sells out.</p>                      </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/morsels-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been quite a while since I've played a roguelite where things just click immediately.&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;is quick, intuitive, and delightful to play, which is a breath of fresh air in a genre that's become a bit too saturated for my liking.&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;might just become my new addiction.</p>

<p>We played the upcoming roguelite&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025. Developed by Furcula and published by Annapurna Interactive, this crunchy, grimy game has incredible potential to be the next big roguelite.</p>



<h2>Gotta Collect 'Em All --&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>!</h2>

<p><em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;harnesses the simplicity of&nbsp;<em>Nuclear Throne</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="78d18a36-8b0c-42c8-989d-e750814ff1f1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/enter-gungeon-review-dawn-of-gundead" rel="nofollow">Enter the Gungeon</a>&nbsp;</em>to create a palatable, easily understood gameplay loop that'll have you vying for more. The cornerstone to&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>' gameplay are the eponymous Morsels, these "mystical cards sent from another galaxy."</p>

<p>To put it succinctly, think of Morsels as&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08100bb4-1bd2-48c8-b59b-deb62c955038" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/how-to-understand-pokemon-card-rarity" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;cards</a>. The player character, a little mouse, uses these cards to escape a sewer full of cats and other dangerous monsters. The cards are actually the characters you control here, and you're given a choice to pick one right from the start.</p>

<p>That's your starter Morsel, and from there, you can accumulate experience by defeating foes. Eventually, these Morsels evolve and become more powerful versions of themselves. This is a great way to incentivize players to engage with enemies and fight them, rather than avoid encounters and rush to the end of the level.</p>



<p>You're able to gain other upgrades by finding them naturally as you navigate the sewers, so you have that very basic increase in power that roguelite players are familiar with. Eventually, you'll find more Morsels too, so your roster grows as you progress.</p>

<p>There are slots for three Morsels total, and you can swap those on the fly. If you're running low on health with one, switch to another until you can find health to health the other. It's an intuitive system that means every Morsel has a chance to shine on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Ticket to Winning It</h2>

<p>The way in which Morsels attack are a bit unorthodox, too. Most in the demo attack via directional inputs on the face buttons of a controller. The control scheme feels a little weird at first, but I took to it quickly. Morsels also have a special ability and dodge. Of course, Morsels are visually distinct from one another and it so are all of their attacks.</p>

<p><em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;throws a few challenges in to spice up the run and reward players. For instance, I find a ticket on one level of the sewers and need to bring it to the bus on the next. I didn't find out what giving the bus a ticket would do, but the developer watching me assured me it would be worthwhile.</p>



<p>The thing is, you can't attack while holding the ticket, so bringing it all the way to the end of a level past obstacles and enemies is no easy task. There are a few holes you might find in walls you can go into, and these start little minigames that also give players rewards to benefit you during the run.</p>

<p>I'm certain there's more depth to&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;than what meets the eye; most definitely, we'll be able to play as more Morsels cards in the final product and devise a playstyle based on my preferred cards. I'm sure difficulty will only increase as time goes on, too.</p>



<h2><em>Morsels&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Really, I'm just enamored with the simplicity and quality&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>. Outside of its super tight gameplay, the visuals ooze with personality. The filthiness of the sewers with the crunchy, heavy CRT filter on the pixel visuals have me hungry for more.</p>

These days, making sweeping declarations about something’s quality can feel like a daunting task, as the internet has lost any ability to put opinions into context. If I say something is bad, that must be me making a declarative statement that readers are required by law to agree with. Thus, we get the typical internet defensiveness that follows, and the most annoying person you know starts to nitpick everything you say as being too definitive and not acknowledging that plenty of other people might feel differently. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,195922" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Sometimes I still get self-conscious about making definitive statements about whether or not something is “bad” or if it’s just “not for me,” especially in a preview situation where I’m playing an unfinished game. Carolyn is on vacation right now, so I feel that I must honor her and say flatly that <em>Crimson Desert </em>was one of the most frustrating demo experiences I’ve ever had in over a decade of doing this job.</p><p>One of the hardest things developers have to do in these preview settings is find a concise slice of a game for writers and content creators to experience that gives them a good enough sense of what that game is trying to accomplish, while also giving the player enough guidance to navigate their way through. The only charitable grace I can give <em>Crimson Desert </em>is that a lot of my problems might be alleviated in a final playthrough that affords me more time with its systems and enemy behaviors. But therein lies the problem with the video game industry’s current preview cycle structure. I could give <em>Crimson Desert </em>the benefit of the doubt, considering I’ve had poor experiences in previews with games that I wound up enjoying far more when I played the final product. </p><p>Is it fair to call something bad when I’ve only played it for 30 minutes? One would argue yes, as those are the terms of the unwritten agreement between developers and critics when previews are arranged – show me what you’ve got, and I’ll give my opinion on it. Now, would I keep playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>if this were my first impression of it, freshly downloaded onto my PS5 back home? Absolutely not, because the issues I had with it are the type of thing that would have made me drop it in five minutes. Lastly, am I cognizant that there is a subset of the internet that will take every negative criticism I write here as an albatross around the game’s neck, which it will never be able to relieve itself from, and that might inform why I’m hesitant to cast a dark shadow over it before it’s even out? Obviously yes.</p><p>Like I said, I’ve been doing this a while, and if I’ve learned anything over the third of my time on this planet writing about video games on the internet, it’s knowing that having a stray thought, a knee-jerk reaction, or even publishing the most well-thought-out argument in the history of the written word often opens you up to willful misinterpretation and accusations of some kind of agenda in which you are rooting for a game to fail. </p><p>But despite the game not yet having a chance to speak for itself, it’s not unfair for me to tell the world that <em>Crimson Desert </em>nearly pushed me to the level of Gamer Crash Out that you see in cautionary television caricatures. Developers put their games in these showcases fully knowing they may get a wide range of reactions. But the level of frustration I felt playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>probably goes beyond what anyone involved expected. I could feel my annoyance creeping into other parts of my mind as my thoughts bounced between every other frustration I was feeling in Los Angeles that day. It all coalesced as I fumbled with the game’s unintuitive controls, being pestered by a massive crowd of enemies who never seemed to lose aggro, no matter how far I rode my horse to get away from them while trying to reach my quest objective. All of this exasperation followed me as I tried to reach a boss fight that displayed the game’s combat potential, which was immediately hampered by one of the most frustratingly obtuse video game interaction systems I’ve ever dealt with.</p><p>Question: How many button prompts should it take to pick up an object, in your opinion? One or so, right? <em>Crimson Desert </em>has a system in which you pick up heavier objects by magically lifting them, then holding them on your shoulder before you place (or swing) them. To do this, you press down both analog sticks, aim a reticle at the object in question, repeatedly tap a button to lift it in the air, then, when you’ve done this enough, you can finally hoist your target over your shoulder and do with it what you will. At first, I did this with a fallen flag that needed to be raised once more, and it felt awkward and convoluted under the most mundane circumstances. The next time I encountered this mechanic was during the aforementioned boss fight, in which my foe would knock down pillars in the arena where we were fighting. After smacking him around a bit, I would magically lift these structures off the ground, then bonk him on the head to erase a chunk of his health bar. If I take too long to get this hunk of stone in the air, homeboy gets off the ground and starts fighting again. Do you know how much of a needless struggle it is to beat someone with a pillar when you have to go through an absurd amount of button presses to do something that’s much simpler in most games?</p><p>Getting to this climactic fight was also a pain in the ass because as I was riding past enemies in a warzone trying to reach my objective. Entire platoons of foes would break off from other fights to chase me across a battlefield like I owed them money or fucked their dads. <em>Crimson Desert</em>’s hero is a remarkably sturdy dude, which means he can take plenty of hits if one of these men who may or may not have had their fathers fucked ever caught up to me. If half a dozen of them did, they would hackey sack me around a field. </p><p><em>Crimson Desert </em>feels weighty in that your character moves as if he’s running with an oversized backpack on. That clunkiness intensifies as you get knocked around by enemies, making it difficult to reorient yourself and get back in the fight after a good toss around. All I had to defend myself with was the sword in my sheath and bow on my back, and using them in ways that could fight off multiple enemies at once was just as obtuse as picking up an object off the ground. One of the attacks you have in your arsenal is shooting arrows on the ground to direct an artillery strike to take down, but it’s hard to pull an arrow back on a string and shoot it at a target when I’m busy getting tossed like a Frisbee on a crowded college campus (and not in the fun way!). Some of my sword swings can strike multiple enemies at once, but they, like most actions in <em>Crimson Desert</em>, require more complex inputs than your average action game, making them a pain to execute when I’m surrounded.</p><p>When I started the demo, the developer warned me the game’s systems were “complex,” and in the time I was able to spend with them, “cumbersome” felt like a more apt descriptor. Usually, when a game is complicated or challenging, I can see the vision for why. But playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>just felt like I was trying to hold melting putty in my hands as it slipped through my fingers. Yeah, maybe that’s harsh for a game that’s not out yet, and that I played in a disorienting context most people will never experience, but by the time I was done, the only thing keeping steam from coming out of my ears was the headset I wore at the demo station.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can find Tivela Lythandas, Rythe’s wife, at their home in the residential district of the city. She’ll explain that the man locked himself in his painting studio and hasn’t come out, he’s just gone.

Thanks to the innate sense of direction most gamers have, you should have no trouble following the clear path deeper into the forest.</p><p>But first, trolls! </p><p>The thief didn’t make it far, all thanks to a small horde of Painted Trolls. You can deal with them pretty easily by exhausting all dialogue with Rythe. He’ll provide you with six Turpentines, which buff you significantly. Each one allows you to deal +100 damage to Painted Trolls once applied to your physical weapon.

It doesn’t include 300 media apps nobody uses. It won’t ever support some silly AI co-pilot that can “help” you play <em>Overwatch 2.</em> It doesn’t include NFTs or blockchain tools. </p><p>Instead, the Switch 2 is just a better version of a video game console you already liked, but now it runs faster, looks better, and boasts a few smart improvements. Its store, while still filled with slop, is faster and snappier than ever. GameChat is great! Nintendo seems to have realized that people love Discord and has built a simple-to-use version of that into the Switch 2 OS that kids and non-techy people can use easily. But beyond that, the Switch 2 is just a better Switch. </p><p> Boy, that’s nice, huh?

Yet, in 2025, I’m over the moon about Nintendo’s new console simply because it hasn’t been ruined in the pursuit of profits. It hasn’t been “improved” in the hopes of making the number go up. Business idiots didn’t cram it full of garbage nobody wants. That’s really nice. </p><p>When the Switch 2 was revealed, some complained that it was too safe. That the Switch 2 wasn’t innovative enough. And maybe that’s true, but I don’t really care because the Switch 2 is the rare tech product that doesn’t annoy me. $450 is a fair price to pay for an upgraded product that is actually better, faster, and not annoying to use. I’ll gladly pay that in 2025. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">Though $80 for a game is still wild, come on, Nintendo</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/toy-battle-board-game-review-a-solid-strategy-game-for-two-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Toy Battle might look like a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clash-royale">Clash Royale</a> knockoff, but there’s more in this toy box than meets the eye. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> battler delivers deceptively simple gameplay and lightning-fast matches, with eight unique game boards and strategic troop abilities that keep each round feeling fresh. If you can look past its playful aesthetic, Toy Battle offers some genuinely satisfying moments that players of all ages can enjoy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="24fb6271-c059-4eda-b505-5253aa7e7288" id="221939"><div id="221939" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Toy Battle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Toy Battle comes in a compact box designed to resemble a locking metal toybox, adding a playful touch right from the start. Inside, you'll find a short instruction manual (with a QR code for a video overview), a player aid sheet, and several thick punchboards containing all of the troop tiles. There isn’t much to punch out – just 48 total troops (24 blue and 24 red), with three copies each of the eight unique toy units you'll control during the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two high-quality wooden stands are included to keep your troops upright, organized, and hidden from your opponent during play. A small brown bag holds 16 medal markers used for scoring, and you’ll also find two simple-to-assemble storage boxes (one blue, one red) that help keep your troops separated and secure when the game is packed away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beneath everything are four double-sided game boards, each featuring a distinct terrain for a total of eight themed battlefields. These range from castles and cities above the clouds to volcanic jungles, cemeteries, and space stations. But they’re more than just cosmetic changes; each board has a unique layout and special bases that can be activated to trigger game-altering effects. Every square inch of the game's box is used efficiently, with everything fitting snugly back inside when playtime’s over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal in Toy Battle is to be the first player to either conquer your opponent's headquarters or collect the required number of medals by controlling terrain. To achieve this, players take turns placing troops onto the battlefield, starting near their own headquarters and advancing along connected paths until one of the win conditions is met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To begin, players select one of the eight terrain maps. For your first game, the rules recommend playing on the Castle Field map as it features a symmetrical layout and straightforward special base effect. One player takes control of the blue troops, while the other commands the red. Medal markers are distributed based on icons shown on the map, and each player shuffles their troops into facedown stacks. The starting player draws three troops and places them on their rack, while the second player draws four.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players perform one of two actions on their turn: either draw two troops from their reserve or place a single troop on the terrain. Drawing troops gives you more options to work with, but it also gives your opponent a chance to advance toward victory. When placing troops, you can claim an empty base on the board or cover one of your opponent’s troops if your unit’s power is higher. Balancing the need to maintain pressure with the need to keep your rack full is one of the core strategic dilemmas in Toy Battle.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you can look past its playful aesthetic, Toy Battle offers some genuinely satisfying moments that players of all ages can enjoy.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each troop has a power level from one to seven and a unique effect that activates when played. For example, Skully, the 1-power unit, doesn’t offer much raw strength but lets you draw two additional troops, making it a valuable early-game play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other troops include Cap'n, the 2-power unit that allows you to play an extra troop during your turn; Jumbo, the 3-power unit that lets you discard one of your opponent’s adjacent troops; Hook, the 4-power unit that can be placed onto any base on the board to get behind enemy lines or disrupt your opponent's plans; XB-42, the 5-power unit that allows you to randomly discard a troop from your opponent's rack; and Star, the 6-power unit that lets you draw a troop from your reserve while putting a strong body on the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roxy, the 7-cost unit, doesn't have any effect, but is the strongest standard troop in the game. Then there's Kwak, the joker unit that can be played on top of any troop but can also be covered by any other, making it both flexible and vulnerable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the troops are designed to resemble familiar children’s toys like green army men, dragons, and robots, I never really felt like I was waging an epic toy box war. Most of their abilities didn’t feel thematically appropriate, and they often came across more like generic meeples than distinct characters with charm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three copies of each troop in a player’s stack, but four are removed at random before the game begins. This adds bit of randomness and a layer of uncertainty that carries throughout the game as you try to deduce what you and your opponent might still have in reserve. Anticipating and playing around potential moves becomes a crucial skill in Toy Battle, creating constant micro-decisions that ultimately shape the outcome of the match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another key element to consider is the terrain you and your opponent are playing on. Each of the eight maps offers a unique layout, with multiple paths leading to your opponent’s headquarters, similar to a MOBA. Bases along these paths serve as spaces where troops can be deployed, and with only about five between headquarters, you'll be fighting for control almost immediately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most maps also feature special bases that trigger unique effects, like returning a troop to your rack, drawing from your reserve, or reclaiming a discarded unit. These hotly contested spaces can swing the momentum of a match if used wisely. Some boards introduce variety in other ways, such as an asymmetrical layout with an extra headquarters for one player to defend, or a central zone that nullifies all troop effects. These twists force you to rethink your approach and keep each match feeling distinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned earlier, reaching your opponent’s headquarters isn’t the only way to win. Each map has medal tokens scattered across both sides, appearing as single medals or grouped in twos or threes. If your troops control every base surrounding a medal or medal group, you claim it. Be the first to collect the required number for that terrain, and you win. This alternate victory condition makes for tense moments and forces you to adjust your strategy on the fly depending on the state of the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Toy Battle doesn’t offer the layered complexity found in some other battlers and may not appeal to players seeking deeper strategy, its quick setup and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024">lightning-fast matches</a> make it a fun addition to any collection. It’s approachable for all ages, can be taught in minutes, and ideal for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">families</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">younger players</a>. With most games wrapping up in about 10 minutes, it’s easy to play a few rounds and walk away feeling satisfied without committing your whole afternoon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Toy Battle</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GGPR?object_uuid=aa8aa678-c61a-4223-95e7-a14b4cbf6194&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DWT9J5L3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbbbmo?object_uuid=aa8aa678-c61a-4223-95e7-a14b4cbf6194&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp77eg?object_uuid=aa8aa678-c61a-4223-95e7-a14b4cbf6194&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Asmodee</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Family-Friendly Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 12, 2025 5:54 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Toy Battle is a swift, accessible two-player battler with deceptively simple gameplay. Beneath its playful exterior lies plenty of situational decision-making, thanks to its eight unique game boards and varied troop abilities. While it may lack the strategic depth to satisfy more competitive players, its quick setup and short playtimes make it a fun and flexible addition to any collection.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It was just yesterday that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> in an official capacity that the Nintendo Switch 2 had sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days. That was already billed as the fastest-selling Nintendo console ever, but now IGN has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> with the Japanese manufacturer that the new hardware is selling twice as fast as the original Switch when considering the same timeframe (the first four days on the market). The Switch had sold 2.7 million units in nearly a month since launching in stores.</p>
<p>So far, analyst estimates have been fully confirmed. Shortly after the console's public reveal in early April, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would be a 'resounding success'&nbsp;<span>with 15 million sold by the end of 2025. Last month, they&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also provided</a> a long-term outlook</span>. Calling it the most important console launch ever, they shared the estimate that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell as many as a hundred million units by the end of 2029.</p>
<p>Wccftech friend Rhys Elliott, who recently moved from MIDiA Research to Alynea Analytics, was a bit more tentative when outlining his outlook. In a LinkedIn post, he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhyselliott_switch2-nintendo-pokaezmon-activity-7338479592954884096-8k0A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that this year's holiday season will be crucial for the console's momentum:</p>
<p><em>I was certain the Switch 2 would initially outsell the original. The OG was heavily supply-constrained and was held back at launch (although the FOMO almost certainly added to demand). This time, Nintendo knew what to expect, so it got all its logistical and inventory ducks in a row. The real question is whether Nintendo can continue this momentum once it has reached all the diehards. I reckon it will keep selling well, but there's caveats.</em></p>
<p><em>The comparison with the Switch 1 is challenging. The original was many consumers' gateway to games when we were all stuck at home during the pandemic. Cozy gamers will mobilize in full force when the next Animal Crossing hits, but it likely won't be a success on the level of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</a></em></p>
<p><em>The big litmus test for the Switch 2's long-term success will be calendar Q4 this year. On the road to the holiday season, Nintendo needs a strong content cadence and to fine-tune its marketing for casual audiences. Nintendo's dev teams have been quiet, so I'm expecting a Nintendo Direct soon to begin drumming hype. There's a little uncertainty still, but I'm optimistic about the Switch 2's long-term potential. If Nintendo nails the holiday season this year, it'll probably nail the whole generation.</em></p>

            <p>
Despite having received a plethora of updates, bits of DLC, and expansion packs over the course of the past 11 years, there are still things that featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 3 that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is yet to receive. Seriously, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> has been supported for twice the length of time The Sims 3 was, and yet it's only this year that it's getting a pack that features fairies. They'll be coming in the just announced Enchanted by Nature pack, which includes a bit more than just a new supernatural designation for your Sims.
</p>

<p>
The biggest thing is the fairies though, so let's start with that. Thanks to literal Mother Nature, you'll be able to turn any of your Sims into fairies, with a couple of different paths laid out before them. You can either turn them into a Harmonious Fairy, a "benevolent winged helper who wants to aide other living things find health and balance," or a Discordant Fairy, a "flying mischief-maker that enjoys stirring up a little chaos and making everyday life harder for the Sims around them."

Fairies also come with some unique abilities like being able to nurture plants or change other Sims' moods. Sounds a bit manipulative if you ask me, but The Sims is all about the drama really isn't it? You can customise the fairy version of your Sims too, from wings, to ears, to glowing tattoos and beyond. I'd also like to point out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/maxis">Maxis</a> shared fairies can "even use their Fairy charm to deliver a special WooHoo!" They somewhat know their audience, at least.
</p>
<p>
There's a new area coming with this expansion too, Innisgreen, which looks like something out of the dreams of a 2020-era cottagecore TikToker. This one's made up of three neighbourhoods, a seaside village, a towny sort of area with shops and houses to live in, and a magical forest. There's a bevy of whimsical looking items to build up new homes with too.
</p>
<p>
It seems that your Sims can also get imbalanced when they lose control of their life a bit, which can make them learn skills a bit slower than normal. This can lead to ailments, which actually have both pros and cons, but you can fix these by making cures and elixirs on the new apothecary table. You can read all of this in more detail over in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/enchanted-by-nature-expansion-pack">blog post from EA</a>.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and you've not got long to wait for this one either, as it's currently due out next month, July 10th.

The monster will spawn in the Iceshard Cliffs and Wounded Hollow after you’ve defeated it. Keep leveling up your Hunter Rank, and you’ll soon find its tempered version in the same locations as well as the Ruins of Wyveria.</p><p>Saving Gore Magala investigations is ideal if you’re looking to farm the monster’s parts. This will cost fewer Guild Points than repeatedly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094">resting in your tent</a></span> to force a spawn. More importantly, you’ll end up with multiple chances in case you fail an attempt.</p><h2 id="h745728"><a id="2"></a>How Gore Magala’s Frenzy Virus works</h2><figure id="" data-id="2e23bc82549f048bd6f0b6b9bf8e4ec0" data-recommend-id="image://2e23bc82549f048bd6f0b6b9bf8e4ec0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hunter Ailments screen, highlighting how Frenzy works." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hunter Ailments screen, highlighting how Frenzy works." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e23bc82549f048bd6f0b6b9bf8e4ec0" data-recommend-id="image://2e23bc82549f048bd6f0b6b9bf8e4ec0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hunter Ailments screen, highlighting how Frenzy works." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The strongest monsters always have the most distinctive gimmicks, and that’s certainly the case here. <strong>Many of Gore Magala’s attacks will disperse purple clouds that can afflict your hunter with the two-phased Frenzy Virus.</strong> Phase one is all about battling your exposure to it, while the second phase is dependent on whether you cured it or not. Here’s a handy breakdown:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Phase 1 (Exposure):</strong> Presented as a tiny purple gauge among the other status icons above your health bar. It slowly fills up on its own, although taking more Frenzy attacks will accelerate the progress. Eating a Nulberry can lower the gauge, but the only way to cure it is to land multiple hits on a monster.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 (Infected):</strong> Presented as a swirling red cloud among your status icons. Failing to stop the exposure gauge from filling up results in a temporary halt to your natural health recovery and an increase in damage taken.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 (Cured):</strong> Presented as a swirling blue cloud among your status icons. Landing enough attacks will cure you of the Frenzy Virus and provide a temporary increase to your Affinity.</li></ul><p><strong>Antivirus is a fantastic skill to bring to this fight</strong>. It makes curing the virus a lot easier and provides an increased Affinity bonus for doing so. The one catch is that aside from the Sane Jewel decoration and Sanity Charm talismans, this skill is only available with some of the Gore Magala forged armor pieces. Said armor also has a Set Bonus Skill to self-inflict the Frenzy Virus while fighting any monster, so more confident hunters can use it to their advantage. I’d suggest avoiding the virus altogether if you have trouble dealing with it.</p><h2 id="h745729"><a id="3"></a>Gore Magala’s weaknesses</h2><figure id="" data-id="aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-recommend-id="image://aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-recommend-id="image://aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a lot to keep track of when hunting Gore Magala, and that’s made much harder when it dictates the pacing of the hunt. Utilize the following weaknesses against it to slow the fight down and provide the openings you need:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Elemental Weaknesses:</strong> Fire</li><li><strong>Weapon Type Weaknesses:</strong> Cut, Blunt</li><li><strong>Breakable Parts:</strong> Antenna, Tail (can also be severed), Wings x2</li><li><strong>Susceptible Status Ailments:</strong> Blastblight (most effective), Exhaust (most effective), Paralysis, Poison, Sleep, Stun</li><li><strong>Items and Traps:</strong> Shock Trap, Pitfall Trap</li></ul><h2 id="h745730"><a id="4"></a>How to beat Gore Magala</h2><p>It’s time to put everything into practice. <strong>Gore Magala’s biggest blind spot is right underneath it.</strong> The big monster will likely need to reposition or use an attack with a sizable wind-up to reach you. This is the best place to be without worrying about any long combos locking you into a dangerous situation.</p><p>The camera, of course, will present an issue. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will prioritize visibility for your character, so the giant Gore Magala might turn invisible when you’re under it. Do your best not to lose track of your target. Trust me that you do not want to randomly get hit by an air dive or any Frenzy-related attack.</p><p>Speaking of, <strong>you may notice the wings begin to glow purple throughout the hunt. This is a sign that Gore Magala is about to enter the unique Frenzy State</strong>. You’ll know this state is fully active once two horn-like antennas emerge from its head. Expect a lot more movement and much more aggressive attacks when this happens. Dealing enough damage to the head is the best way to end this state, but you might need to use some traps to keep it in place. Saving your opportunity to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mount</a></span> will also come in handy at this moment.</p><p>I’d be remiss not to highlight the importance of your environment. Both the Ice Shard Cliffs and Ruins of Wyveria have narrow areas that can make this an even bigger pain. Lure the monster to larger areas, or better yet, towards other monsters. Let them fight while you recover and sharpen your weapons. Don’t forget about triggering falling debris whenever possible as well. Any knockdown is a welcome knockdown. </p><p>There honestly isn’t much more to this hunt. Gore Magala simply hits hard and then hits a lot harder while in the Frenzy State and when you’re infected with the Frenzy Virus. Always prioritize not getting infected and ending the Frenzy State as soon as possible. If you’re struggling and not aiming for a particular carving reward, remember that you can always capture the monster once it’s weak enough. That’s a lot easier than finishing the hunt by slaying it.</p><p>Everything above will also apply to its tempered version, but you should expect a much more difficult fight. Tempered Gore Magala is relentless in its attacks and will enter the Frenzy State a lot faster. Seeing huge chunks of your health disappear is a common occurrence. Be prepared with high defense and preferably a level-three Antivirus skill. If you typically use a weapon that can guard, consider switching out to something different. I’ve found dodging is overall more helpful than guarding due to the high amount of chip damage you can take.</p><h2 id="h745731"><a id="5"></a>Gore Magala’s drops</h2><figure id="" data-id="8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-recommend-id="image://8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-recommend-id="image://8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After victory comes the hard-earned spoils.

<p>The nsOne project joins a growing community of homebrew PlayStation 1 hardware developments. Other recent projects include <a href="https://github.com/picostation/picostation">Picostation</a>, a Raspberry Pi Pico-based optical disc emulator (ODE) that allows PlayStation 1 consoles to load games from SD cards instead of physical discs. Other ODEs like <a href="https://shop.terraonion.com/shop/product/terraonion-mode-dreamcast-saturn-ode-ps1-install-kit-pu-18-boards/view">MODE</a> and <a href="https://psio.cybdyn-systems.com.au/">PSIO</a> have also become popular solutions for retrogaming collectors who play games on original hardware as optical drives age and fail.</p>
<h2>From repair job to reverse-engineering project</h2>
<p>To understand the classic console's physical architecture, Brodesco physically sanded down an original motherboard to expose its internal layers, then cross-referenced the exposed traces with component datasheets and service manuals.</p>
<p>"I realized that detailed documentation on the original motherboard was either incomplete or entirely unavailable," Brodesco explained in his Kickstarter campaign. This discovery launched what would become a comprehensive documentation effort, including tracing every connection on the board and creating multi-layer graphic representations of the circuitry.</p>

<p>Using optical scanning and manual net-by-net reverse-engineering, Brodesco recreated the PlayStation 1's schematic in modern PCB design software. This process involved creating component symbols with accurate pin mappings and identifying—or in some cases creating—the correct footprints for each proprietary component that Sony had never publicly documented.</p>
<p>Brodesco also identified what he calls the "minimum architecture" required to boot the console without BIOS modifications, streamlining the design process while maintaining full compatibility.</p>
<p>The mock-up board shown in photos validates the footprints of chips and connectors, all redrawn from scratch. According to Brodesco, a fully routed version with complete multilayer routing and final layout is already in development.</p>

<p>As Brodesco noted on Kickstarter, his project's goal is to "create comprehensive documentation, design files, and production-ready blueprints for manufacturing fully functional motherboards."</p>
<p>Beyond repairs, the documentation and design files Brodesco is creating would preserve the PlayStation 1's hardware architecture for future generations: "It's a tribute to the PS1, to retro hardware, and to the belief that one person really can build the impossible."</p>

The game development team is “less than 10 people,” but the group overall is around 50, “most of whom are volunteers without salaries.”</p><p>The removal of the game in Hong Kong isn’t surprising to the ESC Taiwan team: “True autonomy no longer exists in Hong Kong,” they said.</p><p>Hong Kong’s removal of the game from app stores has been a boon for <em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em>, the representative said. “The Hong Kong government's ban on <em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em> indeed made millions of people, who previously didn’t know about the game, aware of its existence.” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430295/hong-kong-police-video-game-sedition-china" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR reported that</a>, as of Wednesday, the game had fewer than 360 ratings on both the Apple and Android app stores combined. (On Thursday, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reversed-front-bonfire/id6475160606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the U.S. App Store</a>, <em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em> was ranked 45th in the adventure game category, with 35 ratings. The game has <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reversed+front+google+play+store&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1165US1165&amp;oq=reversed+front+google+play+store&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQ2MzNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">328 ratings on the Google Play store</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>Maya Wang, Human Rights Watch’s associate China director, told NPR that it’s no surprise that Hong Kong would make a statement about the game. "Hong Kong authorities must constantly keep finding something and someone to target in order to signal to Beijing that it is diligent and that it is taking ‘national security’ very seriously," Wang said.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo"><h3>Dispatch Is A Superhero Logistics Game</h3></a><p>All the paperwork bits instead of the pew-pew bits</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs"><h3>Good Day To Everyone Except The Senior Management At Electronic Arts</h3></a><p>'The team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">It's more or less agreed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-0/" data-ref-id="5000-295563">Yakuza 0</a> is really good--many will even say the best in the whole series. But with the Switch 2's launch lineup being somewhat sparse, Sega (and Nintendo, which has timed exclusivity on this edition) are likely hoping players want to complement their Mario Karting, Cyberpunk 2077ing, and Street Fighting with a hard-hitting open-world adventure. But is it worth it? It really depends.</p><p dir="ltr">At $50, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is cheaper than many of the other Switch 2 launch games, and there's a lot to do here between the lengthy, dual-protagonist narrative and the surprisingly involving minigames. You can easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, and that's not even taking into account the new content.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Switch 2's Yakuza 0 Director's Cut Is An Upgraded Version Aimed At Old And New Fans</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The first major difference is the addition of new voice and subtitle tracks. Your choice of voice actors is down to personal preference, but for me, the Japanese ones are too iconic to switch away from. Chinese and English voice tracks have been recorded for the entire game. If you're a series veteran, you'll also notice that the demo cinematic features the Japanese rock song "Bubble" by Shounan no Kaze--a song featured in the original Yakuza 0's Japanese release but excised overseas. It's back, it's rockin', and it sets the stage for a grand old time in 1988 Bubble Era Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">At the title screen, there's a mode selectable right off the bat: Red Light Raid, which has you and up to four online or offline companions beating up waves of hooligans for fun and profit. I was intrigued by this mode, hoping it might serve as a callback to classic multiplayer arcade brawlers--some of which were made by Sega itself. What I actually got was somewhat underwhelming: You pick a character out of a massive roster (many of which require a good amount of in-game cash to unlock) and take them into battle with up to four player- or CPU-controlled companions. You'll pick a challenge, fight wave after wave of enemies, sometimes encountering a boss fight, before dealing with a final boss. Finishing a challenge run earns you lots of sweet, sweet yen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751" data-ratio="0.56246961594555" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut looks on par with the original game on PS4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can do all the fun head-cracking, chest-smashing moves here as you can in the base game (though both Kiryu and Majima require you to pick one fighting style and stick with it). It's a way to play as characters who are otherwise uncontrollable in the base game, which is nice. But overall it feels undercooked: Characters vary wildly in usefulness, and the sessions can devolve into messy chaos, especially in dark settings and on the Switch 2's handheld mode. It's obvious this game's combat, which frequently takes place in narrow streets, corridors, and cluttered rooms, wasn't built for multiplayer originally—and it frequently feels crowded and hard to get your bearings even on more open arenas. There’s a mix of character models and moves mostly mashed together from this game and others in the series, including a lot of barely-seen NPCs. Still, if you can get your friend group together in a GameChat channel as you play, you'll have some fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Graphically, I didn't notice any major changes or upgrades compared to the PS4 original--the textures look mostly identical and the character models seem to be a 1:1 port, though the Switch 2 version does include 4K support.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752" data-ratio="0.56149732620321" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut adds five brand-new cutscenes to the game's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the bigger selling points has been the addition of five brand-new cutscenes--almost a half-hour's worth. I got the impression that these new scenes were meant to give some additional screen time to characters who fell by the wayside in the original, along with additional screentime for the Kiryu and Nishikiyama duo. They’re certainly a nice addition, though how much you’ll get from them depends on how invested in the cast you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is definitely an upgrade--but the biggest elephant in the room is that the original Yakuza 0 has <em>frequently</em> gone on very deep discount on Steam and elsewhere; during some sales, you could pick this saga up for well under $10. Even at a lower-than-average price of $50, this poses the question: Do the additional cutscenes, voice/subtitle languages, and other extra content in Director's Cut make up for that big price hike? For me, no--I like this series a lot, but I'm not hungry enough for new Yakuza to want to pay a huge premium for some extras that ultimately don't add all <em>that</em> much. But if you can't get enough of that crime drama, English isn't your first language, or you just have to have an English or Chinese voice track, then go ahead and grab it--it's a fantastic time.</p>

                <p>Though Microsoft never announced an official Xbox handheld device, there were rumors about how such a device <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">might factor into the company's next-gen console plans</a>.

"We'll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SOKm9dDOSC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spencer alluded to a closer collaboration between PC and console in a recent <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox podcast interview.</a> "This is the tightest collaboration I've seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company," he said. Spencer also mentioned how Windows PC is an open platform and that he believes, if managed properly, a PC can be considered "as a game console."</p><p>While Microsoft may not develop its own dedicated gaming handheld device, the company is working with third-party devices like the recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Rog Ally handhelds from Asus.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on the company's plans for handheld devices going forward.</p><p>In February 2024, Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed Microsoft was making new Xbox hardware and went on to make a bold statement about what it could deliver. Bond said this next Xbox, whatever it turns out to be, will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a> That's a bold claim, for sure. Bond didn't offer anything else, like how Microsoft might achieve this, nor did she provide any timetable for the console's release.</p><p>The new Xbox Rog Ally devices launch this holiday, but there is no word on pricing as of yet. The systems can play all types of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-pc-games-run-on-the-new-xbox-handheld/1100-6532289/" data-ref-id="1100-6532289">including PlayStation PC titles.</a></p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is striding purposefully into the verdant splendour of summer with a new nature-loving expansion, which also happens to mark the return of fairies as a playable Sim-type.
</p>
<p>
In fact, for all its talk of the natural world, EA's Enchanted by Nature expansion reveal suggests fairies - last seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>'s 2012 Supernatural expansion - are very much the focus this time around. Mother Nature, it seems, is recruiting Sims to swell her fairy ranks, and players that opt to heed her call will find their Sims graced with abilities enabling them to nurture plants, manipulate objects, change the moods of others, and more.
</p>
<p>
A wide range of wings, skin tones, ears, teeth, head accessories, glowing tattoos, and more are promised so players can create the fairy that suits their whims, and once that's taken care of, they've the option of following two distinct fairy paths. Harmonious Fairies are all about helping others find health and balance, while Discordant Fairy are the chaos gremlins of the fairy world, flitting around and making life just a little more more difficult for other Sims with their mischief.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the path they choose, players will need to be mindful of their fairy Sim's specific needs: rather than food, fairies are sustained on the emotions of others, so you'll be hoovering up all sorts of feelings to avoid Emotional Starvation. On the upside, you get a special fairy WooHoo to impress the neighbours with, so there's that.
</p>
<p>
And speaking of neighbours, The Sims 4's Enchanted by Nature expansion features a new world in the form of Innisgreen, split into three distinct districts. The Coast of Adhmor is a peaceful seaside village, while Sprucederry Grove promises a "vibrant blend of friendly shops, cosy homes, and draping ivy that blur the line between civilisation and the natural world". Fairy focused players, meanwhile, will be wanting to make a beeline for the enchanted woodland sprawl of Everdew. One word of warning: luck is its own force in Innisgreen, and Sims choosing to live here will experience good, bad, and ordinary luck, impacting their career, love life, and more - so luck-modifying charms may come in handy.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, there's talk of new adventures, skills, traits, and a new mechanic in the form of balance. Sim that fail to stay emotionally grounded will gradually grown imbalanced, which can make life a little trickier. They might, for instance, learn skills more slowly, and if their balance continues to deteriorate, they'll enter 'very imbalanced' territory, at which point they'll start developing Ailments like Emotional Void, Simoleon Fever, Sonic Sinuses, and Greenie Meanie - which makes them a better gardener, but really, really angry at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Sims struck with Ailments can get respite by crafting cures and elixirs using the new Apothecary Table. By foraging and gardening for new ingredients, players can follow treatment recipes producing "fantastical effects", and all this ties into the new Elixir Enthusiast Aspiration, and the Naturopath profession, enabling Sims to monetise their newfound Apothecary skills.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much everything EA has revealed so far. The Sims 4's Enchanted by Nature expansion launches for all platforms on 10th July, and costs £34.99/$39.99 USD. Players who purchase the expansion before 21st August get a couple of additional items, including the Lofty Leaf Pond, the glowing Mycena Lantern, and the Disguised Dwelling Fairy Home.
