            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/microsoft-reveal-upgraded-xbox-wireless-headset/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has unveiled an upgraded version of the Xbox Wireless Headset, bringing a handful of key improvements with longer battery life, an upgraded microphone and more.</p>
<p>The new Xbox Wireless Headset is available today for $110 / £100 and regional equivalent pricing – that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/16/xbox-wireless-headset-pre-order-price-release-date-march/">a notable $10 / £5 price jump</a> over the original headset, but there’s actually a good reason for that, as Dolby Atmos is now included without an additional fee (previously an additional £11/$15 purchase)</p>


<p>At a glance, they’re effectively identical to the original headset, just without the Xbox green rims to the ear cups. There’s now a single green nubbin button on the otherwise all-black exterior. Most of the changes have come on the inside, though.</p>
<p>Battery life now gives up to 20 hours of playtime between charges, there’s an upgraded microphone with enhanced auto-mute and voice isolations, and the headset now features Bluetooth 5.3 for connection to PC and mobile devices. Qualcomm S5 Gen 2 tech has also been integrated for lower latency.</p>
<p>As mentioned, premium spatial audio is no longer an additional purchase, with Windows Sonic still a freebie, Dolby Atmos now included at no extra cost, and support for DTS Headphone:X, which is still a separate purchase.</p>

<p>The original Xbox Wireless Headset launched in 2021, and was an immediate favourite of ours – some disliked the audio balance and got to tweaking the output, but it worked perfectly for us. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/26/xbox-wireless-headset-review/">our 2021 headset review</a>, Dom said, “The Xbox Wireless Headset is a remarkable feat of engineering, providing a smart and solid build as well as top-notch audio and comfort that are a rare commodity at this price point.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that this one’s even better.</p>

			<p>A new Alan Wake 2 update went live today, introducing new accessibility options, PS5 Pro support, Xbox Series S improvement, and more.</p>
<p>The October 22nd update is meant to celebrate the game's first anniversary by introducing new features and improvements even for those who have not purchased the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Lake House expansion, also released today. Among the biggest changes introduced in the update are new accessibility options, which include infinite ammo and batteries, immortality, options to change button holds into taps, and more.</p>
<p>The new Alan Wake 2 Anniversary Update also adds, as already mentioned, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing/">PS5 Pro support</a>, optional support for Motion Sensor controls with a DualSense controller on PC and PlayStation 5, refined and additional haptics, and an increased internal render resolution on Xbox Series X, from 1280x720 to 1505x847. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot32-mythologies-histories-prophecies.970347/post-130495653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the beginning</a>, it seemed like the update also added VRR support on Xbox consoles, but the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">current patch</a> notes do not mention it anymore so it's not clear if this has been indeed added or not.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/victoria-3-immersion-pack-dlc-pivot-of-empire<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox's grand strategy game&nbsp;<em>Victoria 3&nbsp;</em>is getting a brand new Immersion Pack DLC next month in the form of&nbsp;<em>Pivot of Empire</em>, which will focus on the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>As outlined in Paradox's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/529340/view/4535779621907257046" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>, the DLC, which launches on November 21st, will bring new narrative for Indian nations, the East India Company, and the Sikh Empire, plus more. It'll be on around the same scale as previous Immersion Packs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/victoria-3-getting-immersion-pack-voice-of-people-next-month">like <em>Voice of the People</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested, the title of the DLC comes from a quote by former Viceroy of India Victor Bruce, who described India as the titular "pivot of our Empire", lamenting that "if [the British Empire loses] India, the sun of our Empire will have set".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/victoria-3-pivot-of-empire-dlc-map.jpg?itok=YRdzXmDN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/victoria-3-pivot-of-empire-dlc-map.jpg?itok=G68AA6kp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Victoria 3</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Pivot of Empire&nbsp;</em>Immersion Pack shifts focus to the Indian subcontinent.</figcaption></figure><p>The DLC will feature new journal entries and events for the various factions and nations outlined above, as well as new historical content including the Indian Uprising and "various historical social and political movements".</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new Harvest and Famines mechanics, which will allow you to "secure India's food supply" and take "advantage of the unique events and narrative content", as well as a new art style with a brand new map inspired by Indian culture.</p>
<p>While this DLC isn't on the same level as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Sphere of Influence</em>, it should still be a pretty substantial addition to what is already a frankly massive grand strategy game.</p>

<p>The new DLC pack will arrive alongside the free 1.8 update, which is set to bring various improvements to&nbsp;<em>Victoria 3&nbsp;</em>including new national and religious movements, company building ownership, the Indian caste system, and more.</p>
<p><em>Victoria 3&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2018, Nintendo invited me to a meeting in New York City to see a mysterious new initiative. It was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900412/nintendo-switch-interactive-experience-feature-announcement">teased as</a> an “interactive experience for Nintendo Switch,” which sent my mind to all sorts of places. This is the company that made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a weird dual-screen Game Boy</a> and <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/DK_Bongos">bongo controllers</a>, after all. It could be anything. Even still, I did not guess that I would spend that meeting folding bits of cardboard — or that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy">those cardboard accessories would turn out to be so awesome</a>. That was the moment I completely gave up on trying to guess what Nintendo would do next.</p><p>That meeting has been on my mind quite a bit over the last few weeks. While much of the game industry has been on edge in anticipation of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">whatever the follow-up to the Switch will be</a>, Nintendo has focused on pretty much anything and everything else. </p><div><p>Last month, I went to visit the company in Kyoto, but not to see new hardware; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">instead, I went on a tour of the just-opened Nintendo Museum</a>. This month, Nintendo did announce a new gadget, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">instead of a console, it was an alarm clock</a>. And just this week, details started trickling out about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266478/nintendo-switch-online-invite-application-beta-playtest">the company’s secretive online test</a>, which some predicted would provide hints at the Switch 2. Nope: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">instead, it seems to be an online game in the vein of <em>Minecraft</em></a>. Three big moments, zero Switch successors.</p></div><p>This isn’t new, of course. Nintendo generally goes its own way. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21534306/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-guide-games-review">Sony and Microsoft ushered in the current generation of consoles</a>, Nintendo launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles">a new version of the Game &amp; Watch</a>, an LCD handheld from the ’80s. But the rapid succession of announcements and reveals from the company over the last few weeks has been surprising and indicative of its idiosyncratic nature. And while it might seem random, the weeks full of museum openings and alarm clock launches are likely part of a very calculated strategy.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>It could mean a few things. Maybe Nintendo is clearing the runway to keep the focus on the Switch 2 whenever it does decide to announce it. In the Switch era, Nintendo has become much more adept at clear messaging, which hasn’t always been the case. Just think back to when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/6/7/2515106/nintendo-wii-u-announced">the Wii U was first announced</a>, and some (myself included) initially confused it for a Wii accessory. So it makes a lot of sense to get this other stuff out of the way before the next console. Nintendo Direct presentations have become huge moments, and the one dedicated to the next console will possibly be the biggest to date. You don’t want to mess that up.</p><p>It could also be an indication of where Nintendo is right now. This is a company that doesn’t want to be only known for games. <em>Super Mario</em> creator Shigeru Miyamoto said as much when I was in Kyoto in September. “A lot of people may see Nintendo as a video game company,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">he explained during a press conference</a>. “But what I wanted to express with this museum is that we are first and foremost an entertainment company.” While it’s been building a new console in secret and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24258654/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-edit-dungeons-links-awakening">sending out its current one on a high note</a>, it has also been branching out in new directions.</p><div><p>That includes bringing Nintendo experiences into the real world through a theme park partnership with Universal — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">an initiative so important that Miyamoto has played a major role</a> — and a (so far) successful jump into feature films with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, created by <em>Minions</em> studio Illumination. It’s relatively early days, but the company is using its long-running success in games to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">transform into an entertainment empire</a>. Which is to say, Nintendo has a lot more irons in the fire than <em>just</em> a new console. Maybe we’ll get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951339/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action-nintendo">a live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie trailer</a> before we see the Switch 2.</p></div><p>Doing things differently isn’t always a guarantee of success, of course, and Nintendo has certainly had its share of failures. These glory days of the Switch, <em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">Super Nintendo World</a> famously happened in the aftermath of the Wii U, Nintendo’s worst-selling home console to date. It took 30 years for the company to follow up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">the infamous original <em>Mario</em> movie flop</a> with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">a billion-dollar film</a>. The industry ebbs and flows, and it only takes one console generation to move from the top of the market to the bottom. That only makes it harder to predict what Nintendo will do; I certainly would have never guessed the Switch was its next system back in 2017 or that it would go on to outsell the Wii and Game Boy.</p><p>This is all a long way of saying that, just like when I sat down in front of some stacks of cardboard in New York, I am currently at a loss trying to figure out what Nintendo’s execs are thinking. I have some ideas, of course, helped along by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">a steady stream of rumors</a>, but no real sense of what the company’s next console will look like or when it will be announced. All I know for sure is that it won’t be boring. But if it is? That’d be another big surprise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Netflix have shut down one of their more trumpeted video game initiatives - a Californian studio known as team "Blue" and stocked with former Halo, God Of War and Overwatch developers. It was a major plank in Netflix's on-going efforts to extend their film and TV streaming empire to what Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/io-interactive-fail-to-mention-if-a-potential-project-007-trilogy-will-feature-hitmans-glorious-queues-so-whos-to-say-whether-its-worth-my-time">insists on calling the "greasy screen"</a>. </p><!--more-->
<p>The news comes via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">Gamefile</a> and Stephen Totillo, who cites a company representative. Netflix have yet to make a formal announcement. Team Blue's members included former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny and former God Of War art director Rafael Grassetti. According to Joseph Staten - an original Halo developer who joined Team Blue in April 2023 after helping 343 Industries polish off Halo Infinite - they were working on "a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP". </p>
<p>Netflix have been trying to establish themselves as a gaming publisher and platform since around the turn of the decade. They began stocking mobile games on their store in 2021, and have splurged on a few studio purchases - Oxenfree 2 devs Night School Studio in 2021, then Next Games and Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022. In 2022, it also emerged that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-are-developing-a-aaa-pc-game-with-no-microtransactions">hiring in Los Angeles to develop a triple-A PC game</a>. </p>
<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-are-testing-their-own-game-streaming-service">trialled game streaming in August 2023</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-has-reportedly-spoken-with-rockstar-about-releasing-a-grand-theft-auto-game-as-the-streaming-giant-plans-to-add-higher-end-games-to-its-library">approached Rockstar about bringing GTA to Netflix</a> (you can now find the Grand Theft Auto Trilogy on the service). As of July 2024, Netflix Games had over 80 games in development, with around 100 available already. Whether they are seeing returns on all this investment is another question. Also in July 2024, co-CEO and president Gregory K Peters <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-has-80-games-in-development-and-plans-to-release-about-one-new-title-per-month">conceded</a> that engagement with games on Netflix remains "quite small".</p><p>As Kotaku's John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">observes</a>, the closure of Team Blue isn't wholly surprising. Netflix do not have much experience of founding and running their own game development teams, and "AAA" multiplatform originals crafted by seasoned blockbuster devs are pricey - the kind of prestige item you get rid of when ol' Mr Projected Profit Curve starts to look worryingly horizontal.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Grassetti, Staten and Sonny get up to now. Given their credits, I'm fairly sure they'll land on their feet. I wish any less established former Team Blue developers the best of luck finding new work. As for Netflix Games as a whole, I don't get the sense that they have much vision beyond "video games now make more money than film and we want a piece of the pie".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-new-xbox-wireless-headset/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At first glance, you would be forgiven for assuming the all-new Xbox Wireless Headset, announced by Microsoft recently, is the same as the old model. On the surface, it is. But underneath, there are a few enhancements and additions that may appear enticing to someone in the market for a new headset or an audiophile. Here’s everything new about the Xbox Wireless Headset.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-about-the-xbox-wireless-headset">Everything New About the Xbox Wireless Headset</h2>



<p>For its price tag, the all-new Xbox Wireless Headset isn’t wholly new. It’s an improved version of the last-generation headset, which means it’s not worth the price tag to some. Others, however, will note the enhancements below and find themselves overly excited about a new piece of technology!</p>



<ul>
<li>Dolby Atmos (free)</li>



<li>Improved battery life, allowing up to 20 hours of continuous playtime</li>



<li>Enhanced microphone with auto-mute and voice isolation features</li>



<li>Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity</li>
</ul>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing the new Xbox Wireless Headset" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7pV7la2_Dw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Now, it should be noted that many within the announcement’s comments profess their love for the previous editions of the Xbox Wireless Headset. But there are criticisms. Some claim the microphone snapped off on their old headset, and others claim the sound design is weak. The inclusion of Dolby Atmos should resolve the latter issue, but we cannot confirm either way for the microphone snapping off.</p>



<p>While not a new feature, the ability to tweak and fine-tune your headset is definitely welcome. Too many headsets these days are plug-and-play affairs, and everyone is unique, so the Xbox Accessories app’s customization suite is welcome.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-much-does-the-xbox-wireless-headset-cost">How Much Does the Xbox Wireless Headset Cost?</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in purchasing the Xbox Wireless Headset, you’ll need to pay $109.99 plus shipping and handling during checkout and the usual taxes. In total, I would expect to pay around $150, but it depends on your region and location.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-buy-the-xbox-wireless-headset">Where to Buy the Xbox Wireless Headset</h2>



<p>Currently, the best place to order the new Xbox Wireless Headset is via the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox accessories website</a>. According to Microsoft, the headset will also be available at local retailers, such as Best Buy or GameStop, so check your nearby shops soon for the headset!</p>



<p>Is the new Xbox Wireless Headset on your radar, or do you have a trusted brand you’ll stick with? I tend to use Corsair, but I’m open to new headsets from others.

            <p>Sports Interactive has released a statement explaining why Football Manager 24 won't receive a current season update, following the delay of Football Manager 25.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-25-release-delayed-until-march-2025">announced Football Manager 25 would miss its original release next month</a> and instead will launch in March 2025 to "ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards".</p>
<p>Since then, fans had called for a current season update to FM24, something the developer has now said it had been "exploring since the initial internal conversation about postponing the game's release". However, assets from the next game cannot be "back ported".</p>

<p>"Having now scoped the work that would be required, and despite a good initial response from many of our licensors, we cannot lift assets that we are using in FM25 and make them work in FM24 without recreating them in full," a statement from Sports Interactive reads.</p>
<p>"The same applies to the many competition rules, translations and database changes that cannot be back ported. The updated assets and data would both be required to obtain licensor approval - they cannot be separated.</p>
<p>"This is a substantial undertaking which would take critical resources away from delivering FM25 to the highest possible quality, which we simply cannot compromise on."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>In its previous statement concerning the delay, Sports Interactive described FM25 as "the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation" and acknowledged it "cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history".</p>
<p>The March release for FM25 will be across all platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>"It's been a difficult year," boss of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">Sports Interactive Miles Jacobson told Eurogamer</a> in September. "[But] it's been a great learning experience!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft has revealed its updated Xbox Wireless Headset, which now includes Dolby Atmos "at no extra cost". 
</p>
<p>
Designed to be comfier, with longer battery life and improved spatial sound, the new Xbox Wireless Headset replaces the previous model.
</p>
<p>
This fresh version of the Bluetooth Xbox Wireless Headset now boasts 20 hours of battery life, auto-mute and voice isolation for its microphone, and built-in support for Dolby Atmos, Windows Sonic and DTS Headphone:X.

<p>
On-ear controls allow you to adjust game/chat audio balance quickly, without fiddling with any in-game or in-app menus, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's fresh model is available to buy now, priced £100 or $110.
</p>
<p>
That means this updated version has a slightly higher price tag - £10 or $10 more - than the previous version.
</p>
<p>
Tempted? It's already up for purchase on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset">Microsoft Store</a> here in the UK if so, though other reputable retailers will also undoubtedly be available.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/netflix-closes-its-aaa-team-blue-studio/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Netflix has closed down its Southern California game studio, known as Team Blue, with the streaming giant seemingly reassessing the most ambitious part of its gaming strategy, if not the wider plan.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">Game File</a>, Team Blue was reportedly charged with making AAA games, and Netflix had made some significant hires to that end, with former Overwatch producer Chacko Sonny, Halo co-creator Joseph Staten, and Sony Santa Monica’s art director Rafael Grassetti, having all been lured to the promise of whatever Netflix had planned.</p>


<p>The closure will naturally affect all of the staff at Team Blue and lead to the cancellation of projects, though these were reportedly still only in the early stages of development – the aforementioned trio joined in late 2022 and early 2023.</p>
<p>They still have their Helsinki-based studio, Texas-based mobile developer Boss Fight Entertainment, as well as Oxenfree develoer Night School Studio and Cozy Grove devs Spry Fox. It was reported this summer that they had <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/netflix-video-games-80-in-development/">more than 80 games in development</a> with both owned studios and external partners.</p>

<p>Team Blue was a bit of an outlier to Netflix’s broader strategy of creating tie ins to their TV series and filling out a library of smaller, predominantly mobile games to fill out a library of distractions for their main TV subscription. Yes, that has included things like Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, Queens Gambit and other tie-ins, but there’s also the GTA remaster trilogy, World of Goo and plenty others.</p>

			<p>If you've been hoping for <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a> to experience some horror this season, then you won't have to wait much longer. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has paired up with Fun World to introduce <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3204800/Hunt_Showdown_1896__Ghost_Face_Rampage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Face</a>, the iconic killer from the slasher movie Scream, to the world of Hunt. The Ghost Face Rampage DLC comes with a couple of items that will make your game a lot of fun, including Ghost Face as a new Hunter. There are also two weapons and a tool that comes with the DLC. This includes the Hush, which is a Frontier 73C Silencer, Whisper, a Bornheim No. 3 Silencer and Life Taker, which is a knife.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost Face® Rampage | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_jvzit55Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As stated in the name of the weapons, they are completely silent, which offers players the opportunity to be a real danger on the battlefield and the opportunity to assassinate other players in close-quarter combat, as well as get some shots in from a distance with the Silencers.</p>
<p>For those who want the opportunity to try out this fun collaboration, the Ghost Face Rampage DLC will be available for $9.99 and will be available via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 as of October 24, 2024. To make sure Ghost Face didn't stick out like a sore thumb, he received a new design that allowed him to fit into the world of Hunt: Showdown 1896. Stefan Heinrich, Lead Art Director had this to say about the creation of Ghost Face:</p>
<p>"The character design was interesting to work on as it had to fit into the gritty, dark corners of the 1890s setting that Hunt is famous for. For example, the iconic mask is now a hand-carved wooded mask, weathered and cracked, a tattered battle worn duster replaces the robe and to complete the look, leather holsters and gear have been added, giving him the tools of a 19th Century Hunter while maintaining his iconic style."</p>
<p>There have been plenty of collaborations over the years of Hunt, and this is the first horror collaboration for Hunt: Showdown 1896, and will also be accompanied by an in-game event named Harvest of Ghosts which will be live until 25 November, 2024.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about the DLC and the event, make sure to check out the trailer, which is just over a minute long, to get more details on what you can expect from the Ghost Face Rampage DLC for Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-finally-revealed-for-november.1016244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-slug-tactics-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Leikir Studio and publisher Dotemu have announced the&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>release date, so we finally know when they're bringing the long-awaited strategy RPG to PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1590760/view/4513261623769734603" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on November 5th, so you won't have much longer to wait if you've been eagerly anticipating the game for a while.</p>
<p><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/all-of-summer-game-fest-2021-announcements">2021 Summer Game Fest celebration</a>, and it was originally intended for launch in 2022 before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-slug-tactics-delayed-until-2023">delayed to 2023</a>. Naturally, it was then delayed further, so it's nice that the release date has been announced at last.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=cC1SfEy9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=9I_XybNc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has the release date been revealed, but it turns out that <i>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</i>is getting a fun little cameo at launch in the form of three characters from the&nbsp;<em>Ikari Warriors</em> (and, by extension,&nbsp;<em>The King of Fighters</em>)&nbsp;series.</p>
<p>Clark Still, Ralf Jones, and Leona Heidern will be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, two of them returning from making cameos in previous&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>titles. Leona was first introduced in 1996 fighting game&nbsp;<em>The King of Fighters '96</em>.</p>
<p>They'll each have a different special power to offer: Clark has "immense strength", Ralf uses "fiery punches" to attack his opponents, and Leona can "replace fallen enemies with decoy afterimages".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, it is, believe it or not, a tactical RPG spinoff of the&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>series. Rather than the frantic run-and-gun action of the main franchise,&nbsp;<em>Tactics&nbsp;</em>will offer a more thoughtful and considered gameplay style.</p>
<p>The game will feature a host of hand-crafted maps across its campaign, as well as "die-and-retry roguelite progression", lots of weapons and mods to choose from, and several iconic&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>characters for your army.</p>
<p><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590760/Metal_Slug_Tactics/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009982" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Metal-Slug-Tactics-2018254.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on November 5th.</p>

The channel’s final video went up today, and Sakurai capped it off with two surprise announcements. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,194842,197298" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The first unexpected reveal was that the content for his channel was almost all created at the start. The Sakurai that many fans thought they were seeing in each new video was actually from the past, as the videos were shot years ago. That Christopher Nolan-esque twist kicked off a final video for the channel dedicated to how it was made and what the famed game director plans to do now. Not surprisingly, it includes going back to making them.</p><p>Sakurai’s second reveal was that he had been pitching a new project back when the channel first started. The time jump means that, assuming the pitch got greenlit, the director’s new game might be ready for an official announcement not too far in the future. Whether it’s a game in the mold of <em>Smash Bros.</em> or something completely different, and whether it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">for the Switch 2</a></span> or another platform entirely, remains to be seen. </p><p>“I received a request to write a game proposal, which I finished at lightning speed,” he said in the final video. “I’m sorry I can’t share more about this project, but assuming we’re able to get it made, it should be announced sooner or later.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the video, Sakurai shared a detailed look at how he organizes his day, plans out his official work and side hustles, and even when he goes to bed and how much sleep he gets (only about six hours on average). He also included some interesting stats about production costs and channel milestones. Sakurai estimated it cost about $600,000 to get all of the channel’s content edited and translated, as well as pay licensing fees for certain footage and crossover episodes with other companies. Had he billed himself for all of his own work and time scripting everything, the costs would have been even higher. But Sakurai confirmed it was all in service of an educational channel that he didn’t make any money from. </p><p>“It really was a silly decision,” he said. “However, and I truly mean this, I consider this an investment toward a brighter future for games.” He continued, “The world is constantly seeing new game releases. Lots of people are doing their best out there. Rather than add one more title to that deluge, I thought the channel might give all games a little quality boost and I hope from the bottom of my heart that I’ve contributed at least a bit of wind to the industry sails.”</p><p>In total, Sakurai released 260 videos, over 19 hours of content, with over 80 million views across it all, totaling 498 years of watch time. His Japanese and English language channels have over a million subscribers combined. Unfortunately, he also points out that given the “volatility” of the YouTube algorithm, there’s no telling when his videos will stop getting recommended and fade into the content background radiation of the rest of the platform. For now though, it sounds like the<em> Smash Bros.</em> icon will have more to share about his future game projects soon. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They point toward the occasional stuttering issue, but primarily the faithful recreation of the original, the superb voice acting, and improved combat mechanics that make the game feel more modern and alive. It’s a tense and frantic experience, and it seems to resonate with most people. Of course, there are even more positive reviews begging for Bloober Team to tackle the other <em>Silent Hill </em>titles, and after this game’s success, that’s a distinct possibility.</p><p>Whether

<p>Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to debut a whole heap of new Mastery Camos and bonus Camos to attain. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears are required to unlock them, so read on for full details about BLOPS 6’s extensive list of unlockable Camos.</p>



<p>Camos don’t just make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-launch-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a> look pretty, they provide an added layer of challenge to an already intense online multiplayer experience. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> not only brings back the classic Prestige System to make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leveling up</a> more fun, but it comes equipped with a backpack overflowing with creative and colorful Camos. </p>



<p>You’re dying to know about the Mastery Camos, I can feel it, and I’m going to delve into Black Ops 6’s most elite Camos, along with everything else you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-mastery-camos-explained">Black Ops 6 Mastery Camos, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hours of content lie in wait. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 6’s Mastery Camos—and Camos in general—are <strong>special weapon skins unlocked by completing challenges and meeting requirements</strong>—such as getting a certain amount of headshots.</p>



<p>The Camo system has been a staple of the Call of Duty franchise dating back to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare where you needed to score headshots to unlock Blue Tiger, Red Tiger, and eventually Gold Camo. Fast forward to recent CoD games, and there are dozens, dare I say hundreds—of unlockable Camos to grind toward now.</p>



<p>The most coveted of all though is Mastery Camos—and they are the best of the best; requiring a lot of time and effort to obtain. I’m going to explain each set of Camos in Black Ops 6 and how to get them.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-6-camos-and-how-to-unlock-them">All Black Ops 6 Camos and How to Unlock Them</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-progression-leveling-prestiging-challenges-intel#weapon-camos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision has explained</a> each weapon is broken up into three distinct Camo categories: <strong>Military Camos</strong>, <strong>Special Camos</strong>, and <strong>Mastery Camos</strong>. Furthermore, the unlock conditions for a weapon’s Camo depend on the weapon itself, as well as which game mode you are playing.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 requires a certain amount of kills, Zombies asks for Critical Kills, and Warzone demands Eliminations.</p>



<h3 id="h-military-camos">Military Camos</h3>

<h3 id="h-special-camos">Special Camos</h3>



<p>When all nine Military Camos have been earned for a weapon, it’s time to pursue the Special Camos. “<strong>Each Weapon has two unique Special Camo Swatches per mode that can only be earned with that weapon only</strong>,” explains Activision.</p>



<p>The publisher is keeping the nature of Special Camos a secret, and it’s a surprise to be discovered for the full launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-mastery-camos">Mastery Camos</h3>



<p>You can earn <strong>four Mastery Camos for each gameplay component</strong> of this year’s main Call of Duty package: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone—giving you <strong>12 Mastery Camos</strong> to earn in total.</p>



<p>Again, these are endgame skins likely to take many hours to unlock—so be patient, you can sport the skin once you’ve put the work in!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-mastery-camos-in-black-ops-6-zombies-and-warzone">How to unlock Mastery Camos in Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6’s Mastery Camos need you to <strong>work your way through each tier of Mastery Camo until you unlock Black Ops 6’s best skins</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s a simple set of instructions making the process easier to understand:</p>



<ol>

<li>Next, unlock the two Special Camos.</li>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kong-survivor-instinct-review-showing-teeth</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kong-survivor-instinct-review-showing-teeth.1016199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kong-survivor-instinct-review-showing-teeth<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a somewhat humorous precedent set with this Monsterverse malarkey. Here we are, a universe with giant sprawling kaiju that simply cannot stand each other, and in the middle of it? Terry Terranceson, 43, is on his way to a 9-5 so he can make ends meet, but Abbadon’s turned his place of work into a ground for spider spawn, and insurance might not cover it. It’s something <em>Kong: Survivor Instinct</em> touches upon if nothing else.</p>
<p>This is the latest release from the Poland-based 7Levels, a publisher and developer of several small, kitschy titles like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/railbound-on-track-for-puzzle-fun">Railbound</a> </em>and <em>Inbento</em>. When compared to their past catalog, <em>Kong: Survivor Instinct</em> is arguably their most ambitious title to date, with explicit tie-ins to the Legendary Pictures Monsterverse movies. With that much riding on it, you’d be sure of an intense adventure.</p>
<p>You play as David, an oil rig worker who is alerted of a Titan attack involving Kong happening in the city. Concerned for the safety of his daughter Stacy, he makes his way towards the inner city, crashing his car and ending up in between Kong and Co. smashing the place up. After butting heads with a rogue organization known as Hyenas, led by Alan Jonah from the Monsterverse films, David attempts to avoid both him and Kong in a race to save his daughter.</p>

<p>This may all sound terribly exciting to you, the reader, but <em>Survivor Instinct</em> is heading towards a more somber, deeper route. Whenever you start the game up, it warns the player that the narrative will deal with serious themes, such as “DISASTERS” and “DEATH”. The rather inexplicable description of these themes made me think the game was to take a much more stern tone, and the gameplay certainly expanded that belief.</p>
<p>It’s a 2.5D realistic platformer, by way of your <em>Flashback</em>’s or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/deadlight-directors-cut-review-lot-more-needed-to-be-cut"><em>Deadlight</em></a>’s, with Metroidvania-esque level design, and some ruff-n-tuff combat that felt reminiscent of something like Ubisoft’s <em>I Am Alive</em>. It’s the combat that’ll get the most focus throughout, as from near the start of the game up until the end, you will be dealing with several Hyena forces, and constantly learning how to effectively work the combat mechanics.</p>
<p>Truth be told, it’s all quite intuitive and balanced to a point. There’s a good mix of techniques to use in order to keep the enemy second-guessing, both melee and ranged combat have their benefits, and certain arenas provide environmental traps. It’s when the option to parry arrives, which is where the game falls apart, difficulty-wise, as nothing stops you from simply spamming the button and getting enough hits in to not worry.</p>

<p>Enemies can also respawn in areas previously visited, a rare occurrence not just through spawn chance, but also because this is the most linear Metroidvania you’ll ever play. It’s more like microcosms of the experience as levels, so… yeah, just linear. It’s hard to explain, but there’s never an instance where you feel <em>Survivor Instinct</em> BEING a Metroidvania elevated the quality of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Progression is a double-edged sword here. On the one hand, the actual growth David has mechanically, against both the forces of Hyena, and the titans duking it out around him, is pitch-perfect. Character upgrades, while tied to story progression, are placed appropriately, tools get switched out with other, better solutions, and the level design does well to implement all of them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, points of no return plague <em>Survivor Instinct</em> right to the very end, to the point where the definition of a Metroidvania is stretched to the point of tearing apart. Almost everything you can acquire in an area is grabbed then and there, there is no desire to return to find more because it’s already been found, or it's tied to a narrative beat nearby.</p>

<p>Still, <em>Survivor Instinct</em> has other ways of providing excitement, like the actual implementation of Kong and his Monsterverse buddies. Every once in a while, David will be forced to escape the gargantuan force of his undefeatable foes, which results in some fairly intense and engaging chase sequences. The levels crumble around you, the scale is recognized, and they vary how you can outsmart and outrun them.</p>
<p>They’re sprinkled all throughout the main story and are indeed one of the few things you’ll look forward to as you progress through the story of <em>Survivor Instinct</em>. I won’t explicitly spoil the story, but it’s a rare case of watching a completely static chain of events play out, one that refuses to move forward or backward, and disregards characterization, motivation, and theming, all for the sake of previously-established LORE.</p>
<p>It’s to the point where I personally feel its dedication to the Legendary Pictures Monsterverse hurts it.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Well, picture it like this. Imagine if, say, Alfred Hitchcock’s version of <em>Psycho </em>stopped at the shower scene, with Marion Crane on the floor. It zooms into the newspaper and fades to black. However, when you search it up, it turns out that Hitchcock had to stop it there, because the original writer, Robert Bloch, had yet to write how Marion’s sister Lila would be involved with the story.</p>

<p>All of this wouldn’t be so bad if David wasn’t such a sack of wet gravel, characteristically. The delivery of his lines is so stilted and awkward against the general tone of the story and always feels like he just stumbled across the narrative by accident. His reasoning or desires never really come to fruition, by will of the writing or otherwise, and Kong’s presence isn’t felt properly.</p>
<h2><em>Kong: Survivor Instinct </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>There are some elements <em>Survivor Instinct</em> gets right. Its touting as a realistic platformer is felt, but the Metroidvania elements are underbaked and compromise the whole package. Kong’s presence, and his rivals, are roaring and appropriately scaled, but not nearly utilized enough throughout the story. Whether it’s through the powers that be or otherwise, you have a game that’s primarily fighting against its own legacy to speak out or make a mark, and it barely succeeds at either.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Kong: Survivor Instinct </strong>was reviewed on Xbox Series S with a copy provided by the developer over the course of 12 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-try-october-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-try-october-2024.1016196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-try-october-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam Next Fest is drawing to a close and I’ve had the opportunity to try out a number of interesting indie games thanks to the over 3,000 demos. Many of them are interesting, and there are so many that I could hardly see them all, but here are 10 that you should definitely be paying attention to.</p>
<h2><em>Dinocop</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187010/Dinocop?snr=1_7_15__13" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Dinocop"><em>Dinocop</em></a> is a charming adventure/investigation game where essentially the plot of <em>Jurassic Park </em>happened in the backstory… and then the dinosaurs all became sapient and are sharing a world with humans. As a specially engineered raptor, you are the first ever dinosaur cop, and you’re partnered with the most cliche, racist cop possible and sent to investigate a case of mystery meat to uncover whether it is human meat, which is illegal.</p>

<p>What follows is an exploration of ideas, with a strong comedic bent as issues of classism, racism, and how we all interact come together with a purposefully ridiculous world to let us examine these ideas from different angles. Investigate and find out what is going at the convention as you try to gather clues about the mystery meat.</p>
<p>Choose what events happen during the conference you will attend, what questions you’ll ask, and what leads are important to you. It’s charming, sharply written, and needing a bit more polish on the UI but is brimming full of potential and promises to be a lot of fun.</p>
<h2><em>Sultan’s Game</em></h2>
<p><em>Sultan’s Game </em>is a narrative board game designed for a digital existence, and it's promising with a lot of interesting ideas. It’s a game you’ll be playing through multiple times to see different endings and paths you could take, as you try to survive the titular <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/Sultan's%20Game" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game?snr=1_7_15__13"><em>Sultan’s Game</em></a>… or even win it. What do you value most, and what choices will you make when you have to make terrible choices?</p>

<p><em>Sultan’s Game </em>adds on a sort of roguelite meta progression element. Because of the nature of the game, you are going to end up with times where the Sultan executes you for failing a task. You can improve your protagonist, or followers at the start, making it easier in future runs to get further when combined with the increased player knowledge.</p>
<h2><em>Knights in Tight Spaces</em></h2>

<p>If you liked <em>Into the Breach </em>or are interested in highly deterministic strategy games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315400/Knights_in_Tight_Spaces/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Knights in Tight Spaces"><em>Knights in Tight Spaces</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>needs to be on your watchlist. As a sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fights-in-tight-spaces" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fights in Tight Spaces"><em>Fights in Tight Spaces</em></a>, it also includes the deckbuilding elements, but it dresses it all up in a much more appealing fantasy setting and style, giving it a very <em>Dungeons and Dragons </em>type feel compared to the previous game.</p>
<h2><em>Ballionaire</em></h2>
<p>Anything can be a roguelite these days as games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" High-Stakes: How Balatro Confronts Gambling Addiction and Roguelikes"><em>Balatro</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>have shown us, with well known games like Poker getting a roguelite glowup. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ballionaire"><em>Ballionaire</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>isn’t the next <em>Balatro </em>necessarily, but it’s drawing from a similar well, with Ballionaire turning Pachinko (or as you may know it from the <em>Price is Right</em>, <em>Plinko</em>) into a roguelite type of game.</p>

<p>Like <em>Balatro </em>you have increasing scores you need to meet, and the deckbuilding type element has you building the Pachinko board that you will drop the balls down with different bumpers and effects. It’s a lot of fun, and surprisingly strategic as you try to set up potential combos and get the highest scores possible.</p>
<h2><em>Commander Quest</em></h2>
<p>Keeping with the roguelite theme, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2697930/Commander_Quest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Commander Quest"><em>Commander Quest</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>is another game that makes use of the tools of that genre, particularly in the deckbuilder style. One can essentially call this a marriage of a <em>Slay the Spire </em>style deckbuilder (the map between battles is clearly based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/slay-spire-review-fearful-synergies" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Slay the Spire review"><em>Slay the Spire’s</em></a>) and an autobattle strategy game.</p>

<p><em>Commander Quest</em> was a lot of fun with the interactions between different units, and the different scenarios that the game tosses at you prompt you to think about how to solve the various battles you partake in.</p>
<h2><em>ColdRidge</em></h2>
<p>Continuing our walk down roguelite lane, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3052500/ColdRidge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="ColdRdige">ColdRidge</a> </em>takes the concept to an exploration board game type feel. In <em>ColdRidge</em>, you are in an odd western type society as a contracted surveyor in a world full of brutal winters. You take different jobs, to survey areas and find certain supplies for the town, seeking to find what you pledged in the run-based game.</p>

<p><em>ColdRidge</em>’s focus on movement economy, exploration, and its lack of conflict make it an appealing different type of roguelite experience. The focus on resource acquisition, finding things in different areas, and weighing risks for what you can uncover make it a fun game to play.</p>
<h2><em>Tower Factory</em></h2>
<p>Continuing our weird walk through roguelites, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707490/Tower_Factory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Tower Factory"><em>Tower Factory</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>marries some roguelite progression ideas and methods to a tower-defense game, with an automation focus. It’s like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/defense-grid-2-review-definition-genre" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Defense Grid 2 Review"><em>Defense Grid</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>met <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/satisfactory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Satisfactory">Satisfactory</a> </em>with some rogue spice tossed in for the relationship.</p>

<p>The enemy and tower variety are cool, and there’s some neat different things you can do with the factory side of resource management, which will be interesting to see expanded out over the whole game. The roguelite side of things is perhaps the clunkiest part, as some of the metaprogression feels like it is holding back the game, like starting resources needing to be unlocked causing a very slow start until you get that. It needs some tuning.</p>
<h2><em>Sulfur</em></h2>
<p>Rounding out our stroll through the roguelites, we go to one that is a more standard actiony dungeon crawling&nbsp; roguelite, but to reduce <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124120/SULFUR?snr=1_7_15__13" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sulfur"><em>Sulfur</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>to that would be to ignore its delightful weirdness. The art style, the vibes, and the general premise of being a priest in a purgatory-type realm seeking a being of darkness that cursed your town, are intentionally cast as weird and give it a unique charm.</p>

<p>Meet odd characters, shoot and slice your way down the depths of the realm, and make sure to go back to town sometimes or when you die, you’ll lose all your supplies. <em>Sulfur </em>is a polished, fun game to play with a unique vibe that releases on Oct. 28, so make sure to take a look at it.</p>
<h2><em>Tiny Bookshop</em></h2>
<p>Admittedly, this game may appeal to you less if you are less of a bibliophile than me, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2133760/Tiny_Bookshop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Tiny Bookshop"><em>Tiny Bookshop</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>appeals to that side of me. This cozy life sim game has you arrive in a town by the sea, with a closed wagon that makes up your shop. Stack it with books, meet people, and figure out what books the people of this town may want.</p>

<p><em>Tiny Bookshop </em>goes for a sort of timeless vibe, with the books in it referencing published works through at least the 2010s, but it lacks any sort of internet or phone in the few days the demo lets you play. It captures the spirit of small town, and like most of these cozy simulation type games, avoids many of the frustrations that real business ownership brings with it. It was fun to hang out, picking out books to sell, matching people to specific books when that came up, and just a chill time over all.</p>
<h2><em>Kill the Shadow</em></h2>
<p>We began the list with a comedic detective game, and we’ll end it with a much more serious one. Shadowlight Sanctuary’s game has you playing as Detective Lucas to solve difficult cases about a variety of things, uncovering mysteries that others may feel were best left buried.</p>
<p>Unlike some games in this genre, you are able to miss clues and make wrong conclusions based on it (like I did in one demo play), without it ending the game--instead it goes on with the consequences of that choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2660230/Kill_The_Shadow/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Kill the Shadow"><em>Kill the Shadow</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>gives you a robust set of tools to uncover the clues and solve cases, so it feels like you messed up when you missed something--not the game. It’s combined with a dark post-war type of setting that gives it a gritty feel that works very well with this type of experience.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Those were my picks for 10 Steam Next Fest Games from October 2024 that you should try, or keep an eye on. With over 3,000 games this time around, there were so many games in Next Fest that I hope I highlighted something that interests you, that you may have missed.

<p>The Axis Unseen, the first title from Just Purkey Games, is a horror game set to heavy metal, focusing on hunting down nightmarish creatures, unlocking unique abilities, and exploring a dark, mythological world. It’s indie, from one of the developers who worked in Skyrim and Fallout, and despite its rough edges, you’ll find a thrilling adventure. But for some, it’s all about unlocking those The Axis Unseen achievements. Here’s how to do it!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-axis-unseen-achievements-guide">The Axis Unseen Achievements Guide</h2>



<p>The Axis Unseen features 46 achievements to unlock, most of which you’ll acquire through normal gameplay means in a single playthrough. A few, however, require you to explore your surroundings, uncover additional powers, and find new equipment to bolster your capabilities. You should unlock most in a single go, though.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kong-survivor-instinct.1016184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kong-survivor-instinct<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>If you’ve ever wondered what the arcade classic <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/rampage">Rampage</a> would be like if you had to play as a puny human rather than one of the skyscraper-smashing goliaths, then Kong: Survivor Instinct might be your answer. This 2.5D Metroidvania platformer takes place amidst a crumbling coastal cityscape while Kong and his kaiju combatants duke it out in the background, making it seem at first glance a bit like a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-complex">Shadow Complex</a> situated within <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>. It’s a novel enough concept, but basic environmental puzzle design and uninspired combat mean that Survivor Instinct is unable to reach the towering heights of its ideas, and as I begrudgingly pushed crates and collected keys to make my way through each ruined urban rabbit hole I could never really shake the impression that Kong seemed to be having considerably more fun than I was.  </p><p>Not that actually playing as Kong would be a guaranteed good time, of course – 2023’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/skull-island-rise-of-kong">Skull Island: Rise of Kong</a> was such an unmitigated disaster that the aftermath of its self-destruction is probably still being studied by scientists from the Monarch organization. Kong: Survivor Instinct is a notably better game than that, but once the novelty of having the iconic angry ape messing about in the middle distance fades it just doesn’t have the level of creativity or player freedom that other superior games of this ilk released in recent years – such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/blasphemous-2">Blasphemous 2</a> – have so expertly displayed.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kong: Survivor Instinct Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It also doesn’t have much of a story beyond “Don’t get smashed by the monkey.” We play as David Martin, a single dad in search of his daughter who’s gone missing in the midst of the spectacular, city-ravaging royal rumble that’s currently sweeping along the west coast of the United States. The elevator pitch of David’s personality is basically a sort of middle-aged Nathan Drake who’s apparently forgotten how to be funny (almost every time he kills a labrador-sized spider he deadpans “I was never fond of spiders”), and the handful of survivors he meets along the way don’t even pretend to be real characters. There are also a couple of appearances from the villainous Alan Jonah, who was last seen in 2019’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-2-legendary-pictures">Godzilla: King of the Monsters</a> – there he was played by a typically cold and ruthless Charles Dance (AKA Tywin Lannister in <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>), but here he’s voiced by a somewhat subdued soundalike. None of these details really matter, though, since Kong: Survivor Instinct’s slight amount of story is stretched thin over its six-hour frame until it suddenly snaps apart during its jarringly abrupt and underwhelming conclusion.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kong: Survivor Instinct’s slight amount of story is stretched thin over its six-hour frame until it suddenly snaps apart.</p></div><h2>Surface Tension</h2><p>The story may be weak, but the look and feel of its crumbling 2.5D environments is undoubtedly its strength. David’s quest leads him from smoldering suburban outskirts to devastated downtown areas and the mysterious subterranean facilities below, and each dilapidated diorama is rich with precise detail and convincing depth. Kong: Survivor Instinct does perhaps try a bit too hard to convince you that every structure you explore is an unstable one with the repetitive routine with which it collapses the floor beneath your feet or drops chunks of the ceiling onto your skull, and that does get old pretty fast. However, it also allows you to scamper along the roofs of cars suspended by the webs of a towering arachnid, and navigate your way through the slanted corridors of an apartment building that’s been violently upended by Kong, so there are some more interesting platforming sections among them.</p><p>It’s just a shame that so much of the exploration is built around the same pushing of crates and shooting of padlocked gates. The very best Metroidvanias – like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a> – gradually empower you with new tools and abilities that incentivise you to backtrack through the world and unlock previously unreachable areas, but Kong: Survivor Instinct is comparatively light-on when it comes to evolving the ways in which you interact with your surroundings. Here, by contrast, David is given a sledgehammer to smash through weakened walls and eventually a grappling hook to scale up to specific anchor points, but otherwise his progression is always painfully obvious and consists of the same rehashed circuit boxes to shoot or generators to repair, copied and pasted along the winding path towards each mission objective.</p><p>This general absence of ingenuity also drains the enjoyment out of its combat, which is primarily geared towards melee attacks since ammunition for David’s pistol is so scarce. There is some nuance to each scrap with Jonah’s soldiers – you can block or parry their blows to open them up for a counter attack or grab them to use them as a human shield when their more heavily armed comrades open fire, and I was pleased to discover that you can even shoot them in the leg to drop them to their knees so that you can deliver a series of finishing blows <em>a la </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. At the same time, there’s a stiffness to each scrap, particularly when David finds himself surrounded, and since he’s unable to jump or climb while he’s locked in a combat stance there were times where I’d knock an enemy off a ledge, only to find myself unable to drop down and continue the fight. Annoyingly, the only way forward was to reload my save.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Furthermore, rather than introduce any interesting new enemy types that require you to adapt your methods of attack, Kong: Survivor Instinct just gradually ups the numbers of foes in each encounter while keeping your combat abilities exactly the same. David’s pistol can be upgraded to carry more rounds per magazine to help counter the swelling hordes, but there are no other firearms to find despite the fact that every other goon you come across in the story’s second half seems to be toting a pump-action shotgun. When you consider that outside of the human soldier types there are only a couple of small spider-like enemies to contend with – and absolutely no boss fights whatsoever – Kong: Survivor Instinct’s combat feels flatter than a kaiju’s couch cushion overall.</p><h2>Raze the Roof </h2><p>While there might not be any traditional boss fights, Kong: Survivor Instinct does feature a handful of sequences that could best be described as boss <em>flights</em>. At specific points during the story, Kong or one of his rival titans will spot you through the window of a structure and you’ll be suddenly forced to flee, with the monster punching wrecking ball-sized holes in your path that require some pinpoint platforming to evade. (Sadly, none of these titans is Godzilla.) These sections certainly inject a burst of excitement and urgency into the adventure, although they also involve a fair amount of trial and error to get around instant deaths, which did lead to some frustrating repeated checkpoint restarts at times. Still, watching one of these monolithic beasts unwrap the building you’re trapped inside of like a kaiju kid on Christmas morning is undoubtedly one of the most spectacular tricks that Kong: Survivor Instinct has up its sleeves – even despite the seismic impact these high-intensity moments seem to inflict on the frame rate while playing on PlayStation 5.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tristan's Top 10 Metroidvania Games</h3><p>Metroidvania? More like Metroid insane-ier!</p></div><p>Unfortunately, those are the only times that Kong and company have a measurable impact on the action. Elsewhere, these goliaths are only ever glimpsed – either having an incidental tussle in the distant background, or when you summon one by collecting the requisite number of biowaves scattered around each level to clear a blocked path towards a level’s exit in a game of supersized simian Simon Says. It’s certainly a treat to watch Kong casually pick up a connected row of train carriages like they’re steel sausage links and violently wrench them apart, but the operative word here is “watch.” Once these path-clearing actions have been performed, it’s straight back to the same plodding puzzle-platforming and uninspired combat. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Setting a Metroidvania-style platforming adventure against a backdrop of building-razing beasts is certainly an intriguing idea, but unlike its towering cast of kaiju cameos, Kong: Survivor Instinct itself simply doesn’t measure up. Its story and characters are underwritten, its ravaged urban playground is eye-catching but not particularly surprising to explore, and its combat fails to evolve enough to keep the fights interesting over the course of the journey. The occasional room-rocking escape sequences do literally shake things up, but they’re few and far between and only distract from the otherwise uncomplicated platforming for short bursts at a time. Kong and his kind may hail from an alternate world hidden deep inside the Earth’s core, but the actual gameplay of Kong: Survivor Instinct is strictly one-dimensional.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Kong: Survivor Instinct</h3></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This gritty first-person shooter franchise saw five games come out from 2004 to 2013 for a range of PlayStation consoles as Sony took on Xbox's Halo, culminating in PlayStation 4 launch title <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/killzone-shadow-fall">Killzone Shadow Fall</a>.</p><p>But fans haven’t heard a peep out of Killzone ever since (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-no-new-killzone-in-sight-fans-at-least-have-a-t-shirt-in-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">save a T-shirt in The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered</a>), with the last decade and, seemingly, beyond devoted to the smash hit Horizon franchise. Based on comments from one of Guerrilla’s developers, perhaps we now know why.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a> to discuss the impending launch of spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, art director Roy Postma, who has worked at Guerrilla since 2000, declared the studio’s preference for the brighter, more vibrant world of Horizon over the dark and violent world of Killzone it had spent the previous decade working on.</p><p>“We were done with it as a team,” Postma said. “As a studio, we needed to refresh the palette. It was, by choice, the opposite of Killzone.”</p><p>That’s clear enough, but Postma added that as far as Guerrilla (and no doubt Sony) is concerned, Horizon is a world with wider appeal than Killzone’s.</p><p>"I think the themes that this story and the characters represent are relatable for all ages and people, like having a found family of friends and finding your place in the world,” Postma added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Killzone fans have, on and off, called for a return to the series, with PlayStation lacking a successful first-person shooter of its own. During the PS4 generation, Sony leaned heavily on marketing deals with Activision for the Call of Duty series, which secured timed exclusive DLC as well as more benefits. That partnership, of course, is now over following Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Will Sony eventually return to Killzone? If it does, it might need a developer other than Guerrilla to revive it, perhaps with a remake of one of the earlier games before a proper sequel or reboot. Guerrilla is currently working on a live service Horizon Online multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off"><u>with Horizon 3 potentially a ways off</u></a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered"><u>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</u></a> launches at the end of October.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-quits-youtube-with-final-video-teasing-mystery-new-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai has ended his popular YouTube channel by teasing the upcoming announcement of a mystery new game.</p><p>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/_qPqBilhEtI?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final video</a> from the Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games YouTube channel, Sakurai revealed that he received a video game development proposal in July 2021, as he was busy putting together the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Kazuya reveal video as well as DLC character Sora.</p><p>Production then began in April 2022, which makes it two-and-a-half years in the making. Sakurai added that, assuming this video game is completed, it should be announced “sooner or later,” though he didn't say anything more specific.</p><p>“I received a request to write a game proposal, which I finished at lightning speed,” he said. “I’m sorry I can’t share more about this project, but assuming we’re able to get it made, it should be announced sooner or later.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/screenshot-2024-10-22-123738-1729597818004.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games: Finale Special / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p>(Sakurai also revealed that until recently, all the footage of him for his channel was recorded two-and-a-half years ago, if you were wondering why he all of a sudden looks older.)</p><p>There’s little to go on, but it’s good news for Sakurai’s army of fans who had wondered what he’d do next having <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masahiro-sakurai-says-his-work-on-super-smash-bros-ultimate-is-now-done">wrapped up work on Switch exclusive Super Smash Bros. Ultimate earlier this year</a>. Some even speculated that Sakurai might have retired.</p><p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launched in 2018 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-ultimate-last-dlc-character-sora-kingdom-hearts"><u>Sora arrived as its final expansion fighter in 2021</u></a>. The Kingdom Hearts character wrapped up an 89 character roster for the game, which includes fighters from The Legend of Zelda, Pokémon, Banjo Kazooie, Dragon Quest, Persona, Mega Man, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, Minecraft, and many more.</p><p>Sakurai said in October 2023 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-director-doesnt-see-how-the-franchise-can-get-any-bigger-than-ultimate"><u>he's not sure where to take Super Smash Bros. next</u></a>, because "it's difficult to imagine an increase of this magnitude happening again.”</p><p>What might Sakurai’s next game be? Nintendo is preparing to announce <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-everyones-talking-about-nintendo-switch-2-leaks-today">its Switch successor console</a>, and there will surely be more Smash Bros. games given the incredible success of Ultimate (34.66 million sales and counting). Perhaps yet another sequel is now in the works, but is Sakurai involved?</p><p><em>Image credit: Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games: Finale Special / YouTube.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
