			<p>Ironwood Studios has announced the first major DLC expansion for Pacific Drive, titled Whispers in the Woods, and it'll launch sometime later in 2025.</p>



<p>The studio revealed the expansion earlier today as the climax of a live stream it started days before, teasing players with a countdown. At the end of the countdown today at 12pm ET, the trailer below debuted.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside its debut, a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/pacific-drive-expansion-whispers-in-the-woods-launches-this-year/">PlayStation Blog</a> post went live revealing more details about the expansion, which takes players on a new journey into the Olympic Exclusion Zone that can be accessed alongside the game's main campaign. </p>



<p>Whispers in the Woods "<em>explores the rise of a terrifying group of anomaly obsessed fanatics hidden deep within the depths of the forests</em>," per the blog post and Blake Dove, communications and marketing specialist at Ironwood Studios.</p>



<p>"<em>From the very beginning, we knew we wanted to take the mysteries of the Olympic Exclusion Zone in a new direction for this Expansion</em>," added Cassandra Dracott, Ironwood Studios' creative director. "<em>We had heard so much feedback and so many stories about the fear people had experienced in Pacific Drive and in With Whispers in the Woods, we knew we wanted to lean hard in that direction.</em>"</p>



<p>There's a new narrative for players to explore that's entirely voiced, you'll also be finding and collecting new artifacts, and there will be new anomalies for you to face in the OEZ. The artifacts "<em>are the expansion’s gameplay centerpiece</em>," according to Dove. </p>



<p>"<em>Inspired by our quirk system, each Artifact is imbued with a condition and an effect said condition creates. Perhaps every time you jump, your car horn honks. Maybe when your car horn honks it also takes damage. While some may grant you strange advantages, others will add twists and turns to how you play. Artifacts can even play off of each other to create chain reactions</em>."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what artifacts add to the gameplay, and what secrets of the OEZ can be uncovered in the expansion. "<em>We see this release as both for our longtime players and a welcome sign for newcomers</em>," says Dracott. "<em>If you’ve been driving through the Zone since day one, Whispers in the Woods is going to add a brand new, more terrifying take on the Olympic Exclusion Zone. And if you’re just starting out, this expansion marks the best version of the game to date with new systems and content to find and explore.</em>" </p>

Keep your hands at 10 and 2, drivers, as Ironwood Studios has just offered up a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive's</a> first big expansion, Whispers in the Woods. Where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game has a sort of Stalker-but-you're-in-a-car kind of feel, this DLC looks like it's fully leaning into some horror vibes. The first half of the trailer has some real '70s era, found footage horror vibes, which feels laser targeted at my artistic proclivities.
</p>
<p>
It's sounding like a pretty meaty expansion too. According to the DLC's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594760/Pacific_Drive_Whispers_in_the_Woods/">Steam page</a>, the full thing runs between 8-12 hours long, with the whole thing fully voiced, complete with new characters and "additional side narrative to discover." I'm quite fond of this ominous line describing the expansion's plot: "They have come to the Zone and left their mark. Travel into the whispering woods of the OEZ - a disturbing vision of the once familiar forests."

<p>
There's new maps and junction types to be found, some fresh parts and cosmetics to kit your car out with designed by this mysterious group, and of course more anomalies and anomaly behaviours. The big addition that's coming with Whispers in the Woods is a new gameplay system called Artifacts. These are mysterious objects that change and affect both you and the world itself, adding a bit of challenge while also being something you'll need to use to not be sent to the scrap heap in the sky.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's more garage stations, route modifiers, garage cosmetics, and a new lot of music from composer Wilbert Roget II - great name by the way.
</p>
<p>
No release date on the expansion, but it is slated to arrive before the end of the year. And the base game is 50% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/">Steam</a>, so now seems like a great time to head out for a test drive.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-is-going-full-star-wars-in-make-or-break-moment-for-the-11-year-old-shooter.1293036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year’s <em>The Edge of Fate</em> is arguably one of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415">worst expansions ever</a>. Some great story beats and cool moments could not salvage one of the most disappointing loot grinds in the history of the game. Less than two months since launching, Steam concurrent numbers for Bungie’s MMO shooter have fallen off a cliff to all-time lows. On Tuesday the Sony-owned studio streamed a deep-dive into what feels like <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s last chance for a major rebound: the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed expansion <em>Renegades</em>.</p> <p>Out December 2, the first crossover-themed campaign in the live service game’s history was originally teased back in May. Fans had been wondering just how deep the collaboration would go. Would it just incorporate <em>Star Wars</em> motifs into <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s world, or be a full-on mash-up that would bleed more deeply between the disparate science fictions? The answer is somewhere in the middle.</p> <p>“<em>Renegades&nbsp;</em>merges&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>’s distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic sci-fi franchise,” Bungie wrote in its announcement. In practice this seems to mean a sci-fi Western with ties to deep <em>Destiny 2</em> lore that features lightsabers, AT-ST walkers, and lots of <em>Star Wars</em> sound effects, if for no other reason than it all sounds really cool. Also an X-Wing jumpship that is literally just an X-Wing.</p>

  <p><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em> will revolve around rising through the ranks of the criminal underworld in a Mos Eisley-like outpost called Tharsis as players confront a new Cabal faction called the Barant Imperium. You’ll perform jobs for competing syndicates to curry favor and unlock new gear and options as the difficulty, rewards, and chaos keep escalating. Following the Drifter’s lead and going rogue, <em>Renegades</em> will ultimately try to tie things back to the mystery of The Nine that kicked off <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s current Year of Prophecy.</p> <p>There’s a lot of ideas that sound interesting, and fun mechanics like a very <em>Helldivers 2</em>-coded option to call down ammo crate drop pods that kill enemies in the process. And there’s also a lot of <em>Star Wars</em> stuff like the lightsaber, which is actually a new weapon called the Praxic Blade that players will collect and customize the parts for across the <em>Renegades</em> campaign and the upcoming dungeon. There will be different colors and even the ability to deflect incoming fire back at enemies like in the movies.</p>

 <p>Will all of this fit together in a way that feels exciting and natural and not like a licensed cash-grab that only further dilutes the mystery and mystique around the <em>Destiny 2</em> universe? I have my doubts. Would I like a mercenary-themed <em>Destiny 2</em> campaign about navigating competing factions and featuring non-linear mission progressions? Absolutely. Do I want to play a <em>Star Wars</em> MMO that functions like a shooter? Hell yeah. Do I want those things thrown into a blender? At this point, definitely not. Hopefully <em>Renegades</em> can prove me wrong.</p> <h2>Fixing <em>Destiny 2</em> starts with<em> <span id="m_4909743708046745216docs-internal-guid-c14c8924-7fff-f225-be60-f8ee97ab0814">Ash and Iron </span></em></h2> <p>Today’s mini-showcase was also the latest milestone on Bungie’s “fix <em>Destiny 2</em>” tour which continues with the free <em>Ash and Iron</em> update. It brings back the <span id="m_4909743708046745216docs-internal-guid-c14c8924-7fff-f225-be60-f8ee97ab0814">Plaguelands from the original </span><em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and adds a new three-player activity called Reclaim, about golden age tech and the Vex. There’s lots of new gear, more lore drops around Maya, and an event coming later called Call to Arms that will see Devrim Kay finally leave his European Deadzone bell tower. There’s a new exotic mission coming as well with Iron Banner, Festival of the Lost, and more that will be detailed in an upcoming roadmap.</p>

 <p>More important are the fixes Bungie is promising leading up to <em>Renegades</em> in December. The studio wants to make the current power climb faster and improve overall rewards from activities. There will be upcoming buffs for supers and subclasses, alongside a pause on nerfs and balance changes as Bungie tries to right the ship. The “road to <em>Renegades</em>” will begin with making the loot chase more rewarding across the entire game, especially in raids and dungeons and for fireteams of three taking on the hardest activities. The proof will be in how that actually gets implemented, though.</p> <p>Bungie is still trying to tinker around the edges of its new systems implemented in <em>The Edge of Fate</em>. It could be an improvement, or it could lead to even more convoluted overlapping systems that foster bad incentives and boring activity loops. <em>Destiny 2</em> is at the point where it needs drastic overhauls that make it more fun but also much simpler. With 10 years of storytelling wrapped after last year’s <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion, it feels like <em>Destiny 2</em> needs to be content with becoming a casual session-based game rather than a weekly second job and build from there. There’s plenty of interesting stuff coming down the road, but I’m not yet convinced hitting the <em>Star Wars</em> button will be enough.</p>

There are over 1000 pocket monsters now, and odds are that each of them is somebody’s favorite. The series’ most popular critters, like mascots Pikachu and Eevee, tend to take up most of the company’s merchandise, so the Sitting Cuties plushes ensure that everyone has at least one piece of merchandise for even the most obscure little guy by creating a sitting plush of each Pokémon. They’ve been released in waves over the past seven years in order by generation. Today, The Pokémon Company released the Alolan line, meaning we’re now seven out of nine generations in. At this rate, there will be a Sitting Cutie for every Pokémon in the next couple of years. However, this good news also comes with some bad news: TPC is sticking with the inflated price.</span></p> <p><span>The Alolan Sitting Cuties are </span><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/sitting-cuties"><span>available to order on the Pokémon Center website</span></a><span>, but they run you $16.99. These plushes were notable for being really affordable back in the day, with the original price being $10.99, but the price jumped in 2023. You can still find old plushes for the original price, but they’re almost all marked as sold out. If you can get past the sticker shock, the Alolan Sitting Cuties are pretty cool, but it’s a much harder sell to get people to buy multiple plushes in each drop, as the cost adds up much more quickly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Generation VII has some of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s most elaborate designs, and the Sitting Cuties squish them into a tiny, chibi form that can sit on your desk or shelf, so it’s a challenge to get massive creatures like the Ultra Beasts to fit the visual identity of the line. Nevertheless, they’re still pulling it off. From a design standpoint, it’s interesting to observe how the Sitting Cuties manage to condense these bigger monsters into something that is roughly the same size as Pikachu. If you want to see some of the highlights, click through. Otherwise, try to get your Alolan fave before they sell out or some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>scalping asshole</span></a><span> grabs them.</span></p>

Alongside the yearly drops of themed cosmetic armor and special weapons, developers mentioned both a new six-player PvE activity and a three-player PvP activity.</p><p dir="ltr">The six-player activity is called Haunted Altars, and according to Destiny design lead Clayton Kisko, it sees the Headless Ones--huge Halloween-themed boss monsters who sport pumpkins where their heads used to be--finally escaping from the Lost Sectors where they've been holed up for previous festivals. As for the PvP activity, it's called Red Rumble. Bungie didn't provide any details as to what the activities will actually be, but they should shake up the formula of raiding Lost Sectors, which has been the mainstay activity since back before the release of the Beyond Light expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">This year also sees the return of "hocus-focusing," which allows you to pick the loot you'll receive during the event. You'll need Eerie Engrams, which drop from Festival activities, and Candy, the currency you'll get throughout the Festival of the Lost period. Hocus-focusing allows you to receive specific weapons from the Festival loot pool, or to grab Exotic gear, as long as you have the Candy to pay for it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564623"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2's Festival of the Lost armor for 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alongside a few new details about Destiny 2's Halloween celebration, Bungie also showed off this year's Festival of the Lost cosmetic armor ornaments, which are themed around pop-culture killers. Players voted between armor sets themed on Slashers and Specters back in January, but it seems as though Bungie combined elements of both groups into the final armor set.</p><p dir="ltr">Hunters can grab armor themed around the look of a ghostly bride (which also blends in some of the Ghost Face-esque look inspired by the slasher from the Scream movies); Titans get a look inspired by hockey mask-wearing murderer Jason Vorhees of Friday the 13th; and Warlocks can dress up as a creature akin to the internet's favorite tall spindly faceless child-stalker, the Slenderman.</p><p dir="ltr">As usual, those armor ornaments will be available through the Eververse Store for Silver, Destiny 2's premium currency--so don't expect to earn them through gameplay.</p><p>Bungie ran down lots of details about Renegades during the livestream, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-power-grind-should-get-less-grindy-in-renegades-expansion/1100-6534592/">changes it's making to Destiny 2's loot and Power grind</a>, based on player feedback.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during its latest livestreamed reveal presentation, Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 and its four different models: iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-17-officially-announced-with-four-new-versions/1100-6534588/">"impossibly thin" iPhone Air</a> has grabbed headlines, each member of this new generation of iPhone features a pair of new tech additions that mobile gaming enthusiasts will particularly find interesting.</p><p dir="ltr">First is the new Super Retina XDR display, which not only features the Ceramic Shield 2 for better protection, but will also support ProMotion up to a 120Hz refresh rate. NetEase's free-to-play RPG Destiny Rising has been confirmed to be among the first iOS games to utilize the 120Hz tech.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564616" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564616"></a><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Next is the vapor chamber cooling technology, which was also a feature of the Xbox One X. This cooling tech is designed to "enhance heat dissipation and performance" thanks to deionized water sealed inside the chamber, which is "laser-welded into the aluminum chassis to move heat away from the powerful A19 Pro, allowing it to operate at even higher performance levels," according to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-unveils-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/" rel="nofollow ">official announcement</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Other gaming-relevant features found in the new set of iPhones include the A19 Pro chip, which sports a 6-core CPU and GPU architecture that Apple says will "deliver up to 40% better sustained performance than the previous generation." The new N1 wireless networking chip, meanwhile, will support Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread for online multiplayer games.</p><p dir="ltr">The iPhone 17 in all of its forms is set to launch September 19, with preorders scheduled to begin one week prior on September 12.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie debuted the first major look at Destiny 2's coming Star Wars-inspired expansion, Renegades, today during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwlUS_JcarQ">a live stream event</a>. It also unveiled and launched the latest update for Destiny 2, Ash &amp; Iron, which is the first major update to the game's current Year of Prophecy.</p>



<p>Renegades was first unveiled earlier this year when Bungie hosted a live stream event for <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest Destiny 2 expansion that released this past July. Renegades is still planned for release later this year on December 2, but ahead of that launch, we got our first look at gameplay for Renegades, and just how closely it looks to Star Wars, complete with lightsabers, Imperial-style walkers, Star Wars-sounding blasters, and X-Wing fighters.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny 2 ViDoc | Infiltrating The Lawless Frontier" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuJXqw4xgCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In Renegades, players will delve into 'The Lawless Frontier,' which will include a series of high-risk, high-reward contracts that'll have players undertake smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage missions that can be completed solo or with a full squad.</p>



<p>The missions will take you to one of three planets across six maps that all have a Destiny foundation with a new Star Wars coat of paint to them. It's all part of how Bungie is weaving Star Wars through Destiny in this expansion.</p>



<p>Besides the new Lucasfilm digs coming in Renegades, Bungie also launched the Ash &amp; Iron update today, which has Guardians travelling back to the Plaguelands for the first time since the original Destiny game.</p>



<p>There's a new three-person fireteam activity to complete, and the rewards pass for Edge of Fate has been given a refresh along with today's update. A new raid will also be added on September 27, with the epic raid for The Desert Perpetual going live.</p>



<p>In other Bungie news, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">Pete Parsons</a>, the now former studio head, left the company and went into retirement after 23 years with the studio. He wasn't studio head for that whole time, but he has been the studio head for all of Bungie's recent woes in the last decade, since he took the role in 2015.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="8BitDo Ultimate 2 wireless review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f7b1cf58cf8e2/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been putting a procession of 8BitDo controllers through the review process since Switch 2 launched. I've covered their excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">Pro 3 controller</a>, whilst Ollie has been all over the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">Arcade Stick for Switch + Switch 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">Ultimate 2C</a>, which is the budget-friendly version of what I'm taking a look at today - the 8BitDo Ultimate 2.</p>
<p>First and foremost, for anyone who doesn't gel with the shape of the Pro 3 controller, what you've got here is one that suits those lovely, soft, Xbox-controller-shaped paws you've developed over the years. I know for some this can be a dealbreaker, especially with how the thumbsticks sit horizontally aligned on the Pro 3, so if that has been holding you back, this may be the pad you're after. Things under the hood aren't showing a lot of difference otherwise.</p>
<p>Indeed, my main positive talking points remain much the same as with the Pro 3. 8BitDo has put a lot of emphasis on having the latest tech in its gear recently, and here we once again get all the big 2025 buzzwords from the exciting world of controllers. TMR sticks make the cut — a feature which still usually sees the cost of a controller rocket — and they are a joy, giving you the smoothest sticks around with all of that fancy magnetic magic that goes into making them free from the bane of stick-drift.</p>

<p>For the triggers, we're looking at snazzy Hall Effect magnetic jobs, too. So you've got all the quality included with regard to sticks and triggers, exactly the same as with the Pro 3, which makes for a solid core. The d-pad sticks to the same style as the Pro 3, too, chunky and responsive and sitting out nicely as it clicks through all of its input points.</p>
<p>Sticking with similarities between this and other 8BitDo products, the number one drawback is, of course, that these controllers don't have the ability to wake the Switch 2 up. There have been some rumblings that they're working on a solution, and the pad received an update to make it compatible with Switch 2, so this is something we could see down the line, as some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/admin/edit/news/2025/08/gulikit-launches-new-budget-controllers-with-switch-2-wake-up-support">manufacturers have already managed it</a>. However, for now, I feel like I'm capping review scores for pads that make me walk to my console to an 8 out of 10. Not out of laziness, you understand; it's a function that simply should be there.</p>
<p>If you can make peace with this — if you can somehow work around the pain of turning the console on "manual-style" — well, there isn't really much more for me to follow up with in terms of negatives. If I had to get picky, NFC support isn't there (something that doesn't interest me at all, but it will do some), and I feel as though the extra programmable 'L4' and 'R4' shoulder buttons up top make the pad a tiny little bit clicky and less solid in form than it could be.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel bad at all. In fact, it feels much like the official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro Controller 2 from Nintendo</a>, and even beats it out in having nice grippy textures on the back of the pad, but they can occasionally feel a bit loose in comparison to the rest of the inputs. You do get a total of four programmable buttons out of this, mind, with two paddles on the grips, so all in all, a very minor issue.</p>

<p>The Hall Effect triggers can be switched between regular and macro-switch modes and there's some snazzy RGB lighting in the rather unfortunately named "RGB Fire Rings" around the bases of the sticks. I'm not a huge RGB guy, as hard as it may be to believe, but these are fine in my opinion - they give off a warming glow and can be switched on and off and cycled through colours and modes via the 8BitDo software available from their site.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of this software, you need to update the controller, should you pick one up, in order to have it work on Switch 2, so be aware of this and know that you'll need a laptop or whatnot to connect for a small download. Once in the 8BitDo app, you can also then set your lighting to whatever colour you want, switch it off, have it follow and change colours to your touch, and so on.</p>

<p>This controller also comes with a big brutalist charging dock, which I have to say I kinda love. Just like the Pro 3's base, here you find your all-important USB-C receiver tucked away in a compartment, and the dock has the same slick little bar of light running along its underside, which is a lovely detail in a darkened room.</p>
<p>Before I wrap up, and with regard to battery life, I drained my controller in about 14 hours, and I believe I could have got a bit more out of it if I had turned off the RGB. So, word of warning, it's not the very best battery out there, and those lights make it ever-so-slightly worse.</p>

<p>Otherwise, in terms of specs and price point ($59.99 / £49.99), features, comfort and design, it's all gravy, even if the budget 2C wins in the value department. Yes, it could be easier to update, there's a tiny little bit of clickiness out of the 'L4' and 'R4' buttons, and the battery is weaker than I'd like, but overall this is still a premium-feeling pad, stuffed full of the latest wizardry, at a reasonable price compared to some competitors.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/loot-boxes-might-be-coming-to-marvel-rivals.1292976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new datamine from <a href="https://x.com/RivalsInfo/status/1964735415929229504">RivalsInfo on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/marvel-rivals-could-soon-be-getting-loot-boxes-1598643/">GameReactor</a>, points to Marvel Rivals getting a new kind of addition in Season 4 that's not a new set of characters joining the roster, a new map, or balance tweaks. It's loot boxes, though in-game, NetEase seems to be calling them 'Mysteries.'</p>



<p>RivalsInfo discovered the loot boxes, codenamed under 'Mysteries,' in a datamine for Season 4, but that doesn't exactly mean they'll be arriving in a few days' time when Season 4 launches on September 12, 2025. It just means that they might be coming in a future update, even if it's not the next update. </p>



<p>"<em>In Season 4, logic for the 'Mysteries' player component was reintroduced</em>," RivalsInfo writes. "<em>'Mysteries' is the codename for loot boxes. Within this component, there are multiple references to mystery box logic, such as "cosmic mysteries number" and "BOX_OPEN_HISTORY_CHANGE", which further confirms that it relates to the old loot box system. The image below shows what it might have looked like when the logic was still in the game.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Loot boxes could be coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarvelRivals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarvelRivals</a> at some point in the future:</p><p>In Season 4, logic for the "Mysteries" player component was reintroduced. "Mysteries" is the codename for loot boxes. Within this component, there are multiple references to mystery box logic, such as… <a href="https://t.co/QjYru0AmI3">pic.twitter.com/QjYru0AmI3</a></p></div>— RivalsInfo (@RivalsInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/RivalsInfo/status/1964735415929229504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As RivalsInfo points out, even if they are introduced, it's not exactly definitive that they'll only be available if players pay real-world money for them. They could also be acquired through gameplay, as is the case with multiple free-to-play titles that have similar systems.</p>



<p>If NetEase does introduce loot boxes, then it'll be interesting to see how it handles their monetization, and reward structures. It could easily create a similar issue that many other free-to-play games deal with, having high-tier rewards locked behind the gamble of acquiring them through loot boxes.</p>



<p>Though if players are vocal enough against them, they might not be introduced at all, or at least altered, or removed entirely, if NetEase realizes it's more of a hassle to have them if players really don't want them.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s loot grind is getting some major changes in its next expansion, including adjustments to make more activities more rewarding and to make gear more viable in the game's new Portal activity scoring system.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie announced several of the changes in its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cwlUS_JcarQ?si=ZeoppwP1tjmrSn4-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a> detailing the upcoming Renegades expansion, noting that many of them are responses to feedback from players in the wake of Destiny 2's Edge of Fate expansion. Several changes to the grind to increase players' Power level--the measure of the strength of their gear that determines the difficulty of content they can handle--are being walked back or adjusted to make the grind less intense.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest of those changes should be an alteration to various activities to make them more viable as part of the grind to increase Power, including activities you'll do as part of the Renegades expansion's content, as well as legacy raids and dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, increasing your character Power beyond a certain level is done almost exclusively with the Portal, Destiny 2's new one-stop menu for various activities, which includes a scoring system that determines what loot you receive based on the difficulty you set for the activity you're playing. That means that players are disincentivized from playing activities on the Edge of Fate destination, Kepler, if they're looking to drive up their Power. Other previously high-level activities, like raids, have been similarly pushed aside by the Portal system. With Renegades, those activities should all be more viable as methods to climb the Power ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is making adjustments to how Portal works too. Bungie is removing the "featured" gear element for many Portal activities with Renegades, allowing for many more builds to be viable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Currently, you get a bonus to your points in Portal's scoring for using featured gear, which right now is exclusively new weapons and armor that were added with Edge of Fate. That means that using old gear and weapons is an automatic disadvantage in the Portal, which has been frustrating for players, since they're forced to chase new gear and create new builds around it to maximize their scores and earn higher-tier loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Some activities will still include a featured gear element, but Bungie is altering featured gear to include all Exotic weapons and armor so players can use more of their favorite builds in the activities.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new adjustment with Edge of Fate is the inclusion of gear "tiers," which run between Tier 1 and Tier 5. Items with higher tiers have better perks and stats, generally, but that has resulted in some endgame gear feeling less rewarding. For raids and dungeons, Bungie will up the tier of all gear that drops to Tier 3, with the higher tiers being accessible from tougher versions like the "epic" version of the Edge of Fate raid, Desert Perpetual.</p><p dir="ltr">In Renegades, you'll also have the option to increase the tier of Legendary weapons using a new currency and mechanic. Bungie didn't include all the details, but the idea is that, if you get a set of perks on a gun you particularly like but it's low-tier, you won't have to throw it away in favor of seeking out the same gun at a higher level. Instead, you can boost the tier of that gun. That'll likely be an arduous process so everyone doesn't immediately blast all their guns up to Tier 5, but it should be an option to make it so you aren't immediately deleting all loot below a certain tier threshold.</p><p dir="ltr">To accommodate hanging onto more good guns in hopes of increasing their tier later, Bungie said it'll increase players' Vault space with Renegades, too--although it didn't say how much more space players can expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie detailed a few balance changes. It's walking back some adjustments it made to Exotics like Queensbreaker recently, and it's putting a pause on all "noncritical" nerfs to weapons and armor while it evaluates its "philosophy" on making those changes. Critical adjustments, like banning certain gear during the world's first completion race for Renegades' dungeon, will still be on the table, but for the time being, developers are holding back on making major weapon changes unless they have a very good reason to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie also means to buff a few things, including the original Super abilities that launched with Destiny 2 and their subclasses. Expect those adjustments to come in waves, with some happening in October and some with Renegades. Bungie said it's putting together a roadmap for those adjustments it'll release sometime in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with balance changes and adjustments, Bungie also detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-regenades-everything-we-just-learned-about-the-star-wars-inspired-expansion/2900-7004/" data-ref-id="2900-7004">what's coming in the Renegades expansion</a> and mentioned some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-festival-of-the-lost-is-getting-new-activities-check-out-the-armor/1100-6534597/" data-ref-id="1100-6534597">changes to Destiny 2's Halloween event</a>, the Festival of the Lost--and showed of this year's spooky armor sets.</p>

Protagonist Hornet differs from the first game's Vessel in a number of ways but also features some familiar-looking animations that might remind you of one of the most influential metroidvanias of all time.</p><p>If you've enjoyed flicking Hornet about on the screen, you may have noticed a curious movement she makes when changing direction. Instead of the character model flipping to the new direction you're moving in, Hornet backsteps and looks like she's turning to face it instead. Line that up against Alucard in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/" data-ref-id="5000-632"> Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>, and it's obvious where this inspiration came from.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I was going to praise Silksong for having animations similar to Alucard's, but seeing them side by side, it's the same character controller lol (I love that, by the way) <a href="https://t.co/gQLJ2yNlwS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/gQLJ2yNlwS</a></p>  — Wallace Pires (@h_wallacepires) <a href="https://twitter.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>More of Hornet's animations, such as her standard and diagonal air attacks, bear some similarity to Alucard's own, but it's the backstep that looks almost ripped out of Konami's classic and endearingly recreated in its modern contemporary. Team Cherry hasn't commented on the comparison yet, but it's a nice touch that longtime fans of the genre are bond to appreciate the most.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong hasn't been out for a week yet, but it's already made a massive impact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">bringing down several storefronts</a> at launch before going on to secure more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-over-5-million-players-after-just-a-few-days-analyst-says/1100-6534584/" data-ref-id="1100-6534584">5 million players in total</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Deep Silver and developer Dambuster Studios have announced that Dead Island 2 has broken through the 20 million player milestone. This comes after the game immediately turned into <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-sales-exceed-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Silver's best-ever launch</a>, with two million units sold in less than two months. Later, the player base expanded even more thanks to the launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Game Pass</a>, and more recently, it was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given away for free</a> during the Epic Games Store 2025 MEGA Sale. Both promotions inevitably greatly helped inflate the player figures.</p>



<p>Still, today, the publisher-developer duo also confirmed that a new franchise entry is already in development. As teased by the image, it will likely take place elsewhere, abandoning the Los Angeles setting for somewhere else.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 was released in April 2023 after a very troubled development. It changed hands not once but twice; the original project was being handled by Yager (Spec Ops: The Line, The Cycle) and was scheduled to launch in Q2 2015. However, that year, Deep Silver announced it had decided to change the development studio. In 2016, that studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/">was confirmed to be Sumo Digital</a>.</p>



<p>That didn't pan out, either. Three and a half years later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was put into the hands of the internal team Dambuster Studios</a>. That was just a few months before the pandemic, which would inevitably delay the project (as it did for literally everything) even further. After all this ruckus, Dambuster's game inevitably raised some eyebrows when it approached the launch window. However, it proved everyone wrong by delivering a solid and fun core experience.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo rated Dead Island 2 7.5 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>Games that go through development hell hardly turn out great, but Dambuster Studio proved with Dead Island 2 that this is not always the case, although the game is far from a masterpiece. While the gameplay works and feels quite fun at the start of the game, things become repetitive very quickly due to the linearity of the experience and the shallowness of the combat system. Offering nothing more than some mindless fun, the game would have been more than fine if launched at a lower price, but at full price, Dead Island 2 doesn't offer that much to justify it.</em></p>

    <p><span>Star Wars-inspired expansion dated.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The <em><a title="Games > Destiny 2 [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: Renegades</em> expansion will launch on December 2, <a title="Companies > Bungie [229 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> announced. Additionally, the latest <em>Destiny 2</em> update, “Ash &amp; Iron,” is available today. <span id="more-990781"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em></strong></p><p>Inspired by the legendary <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy, “Renegades” merges <em>Destiny</em>‘s distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic science-fiction franchise. As the next chapter in <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s <a title="Series > Fate [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a> Saga, Guardians will experience becoming part of a crew of underdogs rising to challenge a powerful Cabal faction, the Barant Imperium, whom Drifter suspects have a connection to the Nine. Defying the Vanguard, Guardians will pursue Drifter and join a cast of new and returning characters as they navigate a world of shadow to build influence and power.</p><p>During today’s livestream, a newly released ViDoc “Infiltrating the Lawless Frontier” showcased new content arriving with “Renegades.” Highlights include the new Lawless Frontier game mode, new characters, and a new social hub, Tharsis Outpost. Players will unlock upgradeable Renegade abilities unique to Lawless Frontier, earn new weapons and gear, and build reputation with shady Syndicate factions through the Notoriety system to expand their arsenal. Renegades also introduces a new weapon archetype, the Blaster, inspired by <em>Star Wars</em> and built for <em>Destiny 2</em>. These energy-based weapons draw ammo directly from your reserves and feature a unique heat management system.</p><p>In the Lawless Frontier, Guardians will take on high-risk, high-reward jobs to complete contracts—smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage—either solo or with a fireteam. These missions span three planets and six maps inspired by iconic Star Wars locations. One feature, Invasion, allows players to opt in for additional challenges and rewards by enabling other Guardians to invade the battlefield. This introduces a layer of strategic unpredictability, where greater risk yields greater rewards.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_990782"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition</strong></p><p>The Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition is now available and includes both “The Edge of Fate” and “Renegades” campaigns, The Desert Perpetual raid, and an upcoming new dungeon. Pre-ordering “Renegades” through this edition instantly unlocks exclusive rewards: the Renegade Leader Exotic ship, the Starside Introduction emblem, the Exotic Sniper Rifle New Land Beyond with its ornament and catalyst, the Dark Side Legends bundle, the Enneachord Exotic Sparrow, and more. Players who already own the Renegades Standard Edition or the Year of Prophecy Standard Edition can upgrade to the Ultimate Edition, which grants access to all exclusive content and rewards included in the Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition. <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em> launches on December 2, 2025.</p><p><strong>Ash &amp; Iron Update</strong></p><p>Today marks the launch of the first major update in the Year of Prophecy, available to all players. “Ash &amp; Iron” brings Guardians back to the Plaguelands for the first time since the original Destiny to investigate Maya Sundaresh’s experiments. Players will earn exciting new rewards by battling through Reclaim, a new three-player Fireteam Ops activity where Guardians hunt for Golden Age tech and complete evolving objectives against Vex and Cabal forces in a race against time.</p><p>The Rewards Pass for The Edge of Fate has also been refreshed, offering 110 ranks of additional rewards for all players, including a brand-new Strand Exotic Pulse Rifle, an armor ornament set, a Legendary shader, and more.</p><p>On September 27, the Epic raid for The Desert Perpetual will launch with new challenges and rewards for players to chase, offering a fresh twist to Destiny 2’s latest raid. Players who complete The Desert Perpetual Epic raid will unlock a new Bungie Rewards for purchase to be revealed at a later date.</p><p>Additionally, a new Exotic mission is coming on October 7, where players will confront Maya Sundaresh’s Vex and Cabal forces, uncovering new secrets unfolding within an old Warmind bunker.</p><p><strong>Festival of the Lost</strong></p><p><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s annual Festival of the Lost event makes its return on October 21, bringing along a host of new weapon holofoils and masks for Guardians to don as they collect candy and pursue ghoulish rewards. Closing out the first major update with Ash &amp; Iron is the new Call to Arms event from November 11 until December 1, available to all players. Call to Arms invites players to go head-to-head across several Portal activities, complete their Seasonal gear collection, earn exclusive cosmetics, and more.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of trailers and an archive of today’s live stream below.

                <p>As part of Apple's big September event today, the company did what it usually does in September: announced a new iPhone. In fact, Apple unveiled four new iPhone models, including the "impossibly thin" iPhone Air and the more powerful iPhone 17 Pro. The others include the iPhone 17 Pro Max and a new base-model iPhone 17. All of them are launching on September 19, with preorders opening September 12.</p><p>Here are the starting prices at a glance, but note that prices go up based on the storage space you choose:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone 17</strong> -- $800</li><li><strong>iPhone Air</strong> -- $1000</li><li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong> -- $1,100</li><li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong> -- $1,200</li></ul><h2>iPhone Air</h2><p>At 5.6mm, it's the thinnest iPhone that Apple has ever made. It features a 6.5-inch screen and is said to be durable thanks in part to being made with titanium (80% of which comes from recycled sources).</p><p>The iPhone Air comes in black, white, gold, and blue. It runs on the A19 Pro processor, which sets new stands for mobile phones, Apple said. The GPU, meanwhile, gets improved with a 5-core setup and baked-in AI acceleration features. Users can expect "Macbook Pro levels of compute," Apple said.</p><p>The camera takes 48 megapixel photos with one lens and an 18mp front-facing camera that includes a "center stage" feature that uses AI to find the best angles. A new feature, dual capture video, allows you to record yourself with the front-facing camera while recording with the back camera.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580" data-ratio="0.56631171345595" data-width="2066" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580"></a><figcaption>The iPhone Air.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of battery life, Apple said the internal design has been "completely redesigned" to maximum space for the battery itself. Apple promises "all-day battery life" for the iPhone Air. There is also a MagSafe battery accessory that people can buy to extend battery life.</p><h2>iPhone 17 Pro</h2><p>The iPhone 17 Pro has the biggest battery in any iPhone, a new camera system with "breathtaking range and resolution," and the most powerful chip Apple has ever made for an iPhone, the A19 Pro. It's designed to be extremely durable, Apple said, with new protections for the front and the back. It also has a better battery that can support up to 39 hours of video playback on a single charge.</p><p>Take a look for yourself:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586"></a><figcaption>The iPhone 17 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of the new cameras, they include the "best camera system we've ever made," Apple said, and they include the 18mp "center stage" camera on the front and three rear cameras--all are 48 megapixels. The "extended plateau" for the camera allows for the longest optical zoom Apple has ever made.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 17 base model</strong></h2><p>The new line of iPhone 17 base-model phones will run on a new processor called A19, which is "faster and more efficient," Apple said. The new iPhones will come in five different colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.</p><p>The new phones support 120Hz ProMotion and a larger 6.3-inch display, which Apple said will be beneficial for gaming. NetEase's Destiny: Rising will be among the games to support the 120Hz feature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576" data-ratio="0.58842443729904" data-width="1866" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576"></a><figcaption>The four new iPhone 17 colors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png"></figure><p>A big part of having a phone is taking photos of your dog with it, and the new iPhone 17 will feature a better camera that should take more impressive photos than before, Apple said. There is a new "center stage" camera, too, to help people take better selfies, videos, and more. You also no longer need to rotate your phone to take a selfie, and the camera uses AI to automatically select the best angles.</p><p>Below you can see a rundown of the iPhone 17 base model.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578" data-ratio="0.58230256898192" data-width="2102" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578"></a><figcaption>A quick look at the special features of the iPhone 17.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png"></figure><p>Also during the Apple event, the company announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Watch Series 11</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-airpods-pro-3-the-ultimate-audio-experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AirPods Pro 3.</a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>The ambitious mod <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672">Skyblivion is still aiming to release in 2025</a>, according to the mod's developers, even as one former developer on the project called it quits after nine years, claiming it's "less of a passion project and more of a crunch project."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, which has been in development for 13 years, looks to recreate Bethesda Softworks' Oblivion in the more modern engine of its sequel, Skyrim. However, far from just an engine port, Skyblivion has been described by the TESRenewal mod development team as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-devs-make-its-case-in-light-of-oblivion-remastered-its-a-full-scale-remake/1100-6533675/" data-ref-id="1100-6533675">"a full-scale remake" of Oblivion</a>, one that features new areas, dungeons, music, gameplay enhancements, item changes, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1961922524700151893" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> on August 30, former Skyblivion level designer Dee Keyes aired a list of grievances against those in charge of the mod's development, stating the 2025 release date first announced in 2023 was a "massive mistake" and that the project was "never in the state that the videos would show off."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Keyes, the team did what he described as "fake" polish on parts of the game featured in the trailers, but it became clear that the team was "never gonna be allowed" to achieve that same level of polish across the entire project. He said voicing concerns to those in charge fell on deaf ears, and that those came from a place of realism rather than pessimism.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are unpaid and part time: This would be a massive undertaking for a paid dev team and yet every attempt we make to beg them to postpone we are ignored," Keyes said. "It's a sad time when even passion projects are getting rushed and have devs crunching."</p><p dir="ltr">Keyes finished his statement by comparing Skyblivion to Game of Thrones' infamous Season 8, stating two lead developers, one of them being project lead Rebelzize, are "forcing it out the door before it's finished despite everyone else on the team looking to do their best."</p><p dir="ltr">While the Skyblivion team has not addressed Keyes' concerns directly, communications lead Evan Flatt said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyblivion/comments/1n4iqne/comment/nbly5os/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> in response to a concerned fan that the project is still aiming to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," Flatt said. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it--our goal has been to have it ready to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now, what is 'ready?' That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7ATiEK31Tqo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest development diary video, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Final Stretch Towards Release"</a>, looked to make a case for the mod's existence in light of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">official Oblivion Remastered</a> releasing in April, emphasizing how the mod "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards." The team most recently released a video spotlighting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first 15 minutes of Skyblivion</a>, once again describing it as an Oblivion remake. The trailer was uploaded a day after Keyes' statement.</p><p dir="ltr">In the video's description, Rebelzize said Skyblivion development has been an "uphill battle."</p><p dir="ltr">"This last leg of development has sometimes been harder than the totality of our previous years combined," Rebelzize said. "The team is not quitting until we have a game for you all to play and neither am I."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, when it does arrive, will be free to download for those who own Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's latest DLC expansion, Legacy of the Forge, is now out across all platforms, alongside a new patch for the game from Warhorse Studios, <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/patch-14">Update 1.4</a>, which includes several quality of life changes, balancing tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes.</p>



<p>The DLC's release also came with a new trailer, showcasing a bit more of the new storyline that players will be able to delve and forge their own path into. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new DLC sees Henry join the Kuttenberg Blacksmith Guild, following in his adoptive father's footsteps by not only taking up smithing, but by attempting to complete what his adoptive father, Martin, could not. Fix the town's broken astronomical clock.</p>



<p>As Henry embarks on the journey to fix the clock and repair his adoptive father's legacy, he brings Martin's colleagues back together to get the job done. Along the way, the forge becomes a new home for players and for Henry, as you're able to decorate and build out your workshop, living quarters, and nearly every inch of the forge to your liking. </p>



<p>The expansion adds at least 15 more hours of game time for players who've rinsed everything else that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has to offer. While Update 1.4 adds a few welcomed balance tweaks, like halbreds being "<em>twice as durable</em>" now, and increased quality for the Trollbane hammer.</p>



<p>If you've purchased the Gold Edition of the game or the Expansion Pass, then all you need to do is update Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to start playing the DLC. Otherwise, you'll have to grab it separately for £11.49.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-ship">Jump Space</a>! It's a game with a name that'll have you thinking, "wait, that's not what it was called, was it?" And you'd be right about that, as due to some trademark problems, the game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363">rebranded</a> from Jump Ship to its new name Jump Space back in August. Later that same month, developer Keepsake Games announced the game would be launching into early access September 19th. And now, as in today September 9th now, Keepsake Games have shared an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506212394141221550">early access roadmap</a> for the game, as well as how much it'll cost you.
</p>
<p>
Right, let's get the pricing out of the way. It'll be a pretty reasonable $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.50, making it the latest anticipated September release to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-cost-nearly-as-much-as-they-could-probably-charge-for-it">priced in a way that'll have you wondering why they're not charging more</a>. On to the roadmap!
</p>
<p>
At launch, the sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> will include nine mission types. These include one where you'll try not to kick the bucket while fending off a bunch of robots, where you have to hunt for loot, and another where you'll be raiding some baddies' bases. There'll be more than 50 sectors to play in four galaxy regions, and you'll have two ships to choose from with 26 ship components to make them a bit more custom.
</p>
<p>
That's all a part of Chapter 1, The Resistance Coalition. Chapter 2: Atira Strikes back will bring a lot more to the game like multiple endless modes, sector modifiers, melee weapons, more story and sectors, new enemies, mission types, a photo mode, offline support and a lot more. These will be coming through multiple updates through to Q1, 2026, but a couple of features from this chapter, text chat and lobby browser, will be available at launch.
</p><p>
Then after that, Chapter 3: Secrets of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/telmari">Telmari</a> will add in a first-person pilot view, a scanner revamp, even more new enemies and mission types, a new ship, ground boss, and again, even more. These will start to be added from Q1 2026 onwards until Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption, which doesn't have a release window or any revealed features just yet. That's a lot of bloody stuff!
</p>
<p>
As of now, Keepsake doesn't know when early access will end and the 1.0 release will release, so you'll just have to join them for the ride in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
Jump Space launches into early access September 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">Steam</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2%E2%80%99s-most-visually-impressive-port-just-got-better.1292892/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> recently landed on Nintendo Switch 2, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-framerate-2000621760">despite some initial fears</a> that it would look and run terribly, the game is a bit of a technical marvel and easily the most impressive Switch 2 port yet. And now, a new update has improved this already wonderful-looking open-world action game on Nintendo’s hybrid console. Plus, a demo is coming, too.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123">Ubisoft and Massive’s open-world <em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em></a>was an incredibly gorgeous game when it launched last year. Sure, stealth sections could be annoying and combat could feel a bit stiff, but getting to walk around a perfectly recreated section of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe freely was amazing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-patch-stealth-speeder-softlock-1851665149">And some later updates improved the game a lot</a>, introducing some visual improvements on top of some significant gameplay tweaks.&nbsp; So I wasn’t sure what to expect when I booted up <em>Outlaws</em> on a Switch 2. Turns out, Ubisoft Red Lynx, who ported the game, did an amazing job. While it’s capped at 30FPS and lacks some of the higher-fidelity assets from the bigger console ports, this version of <em>Outlaws</em> is extremely playable, looks sharp, and feels great in handheld mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/XlKCBGzrB1I">As explained by Digital Foundry, it’s truly an extraordinary port.</a> Now, Ubisoft has made it look even better with the game’s first Switch 2 update.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/5d48mFSwXrfRnDvvBmOl7F/nintendo-switch-2-title-update-1">On September 8, Ubisoft put out a patch for <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> on Switch 2</a> that features numerous visual improvements. Players should now see less “pop in,” less flickering smoke, better shadows, nicer-looking leaves, and a host of other “small visual fixes.” For a game that already felt like it was pushing the Switch 2’s hardware to its limits, I’m impressed by Ubisoft cranking the knob a bit more to eke out an even nicer-looking port.</p> <p>Oh, and if you want to see the game in action on your Switch 2 without buying it, good news: <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1kKhQ1Heps7YmSJdFiV87L/switch-2-release-faq">Ubisoft has updated the game’s FAQ page</a> to confirm that a demo for <em>Outlaws</em> is coming. Ubisoft says it will “share more information soon” about this upcoming demo.&nbsp; Anyway, here’s the full patch list for the new <em>Outlaws</em> update on Switch 2.</p> <p><strong>General Gameplay</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed several issues where NPCs would not spawn, e.g. when chasing Kay during the ‘Crashed’ quest on Toshara</li> <li>Reduced likelihood of Kay being stuck when traversing the environment</li> <li>Improved hiding and detection when in tall grass on Akiva</li> <li>Various stability improvements and other minor fixes</li> </ul> <p><strong>Graphics</strong></p> <ul> <li>Improvements made to visual quality when moving quickly through the world or using binoculars, with less “pop in”</li> <li>Reduced flickering with smoke and lighting</li> <li>Improved shadows at the edge of the screen when moving in cities and stations</li> <li>Improved quality of leaves, cloth and other things that let light through</li> <li>Various other small visual fixes and improvements</li> </ul> <p><strong>Camera</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed camera movement when traversing certain objects in certain ways with Kay</li> </ul> <p><strong>UI</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed controller image types and directional button prompts when switching between Joy-Con and Pro Controller</li> <li>Fixed the gadget inventory HUD not resizing when using the handheld preset custom scaling settings</li> </ul> <p><strong>Wild Card Story Pack</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue where NPCs would not be highlighted when using Nix to plant a card</li> </ul> <p><strong>A Pirate’s Fortune Story Pack</strong></p> <ul> <li>Mynocks are now visible when attached to your ship</li> </ul>

<p>There are a couple of notable additions and changes here, including a new 'pixel perfect' scaling option, and a revamp of the icon for the Switch home menu. Let's be honest, it wasn't exactly the most inspiring design before, now was it?</p>
<p>It's been confirmed that more patches will be released going forward, but this is certainly a good start, hm?</p>
<p>Let's check out the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Icon changed<br>

            <p>I thought it had been rather quiet round these parts lately. It turns out it's been several months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> creator Hideki Kamiya had a tantrum about anything on social media. What are you steamed up about today, Kamiya-san? Ah, of course, Hideo Kojima. Specifically, Kojima's long-lost horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> - a collaboration with movie-maker Guillermo del Toro which Konami banished from PlayStation Network in 2015, after cancelling Kojima's associated Silent Hills project.</p><!--more-->
<p>That P.T. is one of the finest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> ever made and also, no longer officially available online is one of the better arguments for the wholesale nuking of the games industry. Seriously, if this is how you're going to behave, Konami, let's tear it all down and put the cockroaches in charge. Norman Reedus wept like a seal the night you deleted the storepage. Fortunately, he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">found other work since</a>.</p>
<p>How does Kamiya propose to set the world to rights? By making his own new version of P.T., except that his version wouldn't be a horror game, because Kamiya hates horror, even though he directed the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>. Erm.</p>
<p>One inclines to suspect that this Hideki Kamiya man may not be entirely serious in the things that he says on yonder <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633">TwiX</a>. Here's the full quote, anyway, as translated and passed along by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-should-make-a-new-pt-style-game-or-maybe-i-will-says-bayonetta-and-devil-may-cry-creator-hideki-kamiya">IGN</a>. "[I]f it's impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style," Kamiya wrote, adding: "if Kojima doesn't do it, maybe I'll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn't be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</p><p>I'm propagating Kamiya's bullshit because it's an excuse to start a comments thread discussion about P.T. If you never played it, allow me to sum it up the same way I summed it up to some party guests back in 2014, after they had the insolence to defeat me at Scrabble: there is an L-shaped corridor, and all you have to do is exit through the other end. My guests left that night white-faced and falsetto, shortly after getting the initial radio puzzle wrong. That'll learn the bastards to pop a cheeky "Quoth" on a triple-word tile.</p>
<p>P.T. may be long gone, and also, never actually released on PC, but it has spawned many imitators. There are the fullscale fan clones knocked together in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-somebody-recreated-pt-in-vr-using-half-life-alyx">the Half-Life: Alyx engine</a> and, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pt-is-even-creepier-as-an-old-macintosh-game">Hypercard</a>, and also, chilly apartment tours like <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">Devotion</a> that apply something of the same claustrophobia.</p>
<p>Swivelling back to Kamiya in closing, the absolute best thing that can come of all this foolery is for Kojima to respond to Kamiya on Twitter, so that Kamiya can block him immediately. Kamiya does so love doing that.</p>
<p>Further reading: Philippa Warr's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horror-games-silent-hill-2">very old ruminations about trying to get into horror</a>. Fortunately for Pip, Alice O (also RPS in peace) found a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/qt-is-pt-but-cute-see-and-its-free">cute version of P.T. in 2019</a>.</p>
