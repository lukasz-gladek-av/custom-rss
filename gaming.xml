<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1337100/view/523078230806103089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post on Steam</a>, Carbon says that it's delisting the game "as our license reaches its conclusion", and that it'll no longer be available on any storefront. That means you won't be able to buy it on Steam, Meta, or Viveport.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>will first be removed from Steam on January 10th, which is also when support for the game on that platform will be rescinded. Carbon says the timeline for delisting on Meta and Viveport is "still under review" and that an update will be provided "as soon as more information becomes available".</p>

<p>Carbon says it understands that news of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall</em>'s delisting "may come as a disappointment". It sounds like the studio had no choice but to pull the game from stores since the license holders (likely Games Workshop in this case) were unwilling to renew said license.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game based on a major fantasy license being pulled from stores soon.&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">also making its exit from digital storefronts</a> in February, although I imagine that's probably less sad news than&nbsp;<em>Tempestfall</em>'s demise for many.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-delisting.jpg?itok=mNgC54Gi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-delisting.jpg?itok=3kDBuy0g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game being delisted soon.</figcaption></figure><p>These two games join the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween" rel="nofollow"><em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em></a>, racing game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge" rel="nofollow"><em>Forza Horizon 4</em></a>, and PlatinumGames' mobile action game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-demons-delisted" rel="nofollow">World of Demons</a>&nbsp;</em>in the delisting vortex; it's no longer possible to buy any of these games on digital storefronts.</p>

<p>To combat games being delisted and support being removed from said games, digital storefront GOG recently launched its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which guarantees that any game belonging to the Program will be supported forever, regardless of whether its developers or publishers support it.</p>

<p>If you want to buy <i>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall&nbsp;</i>before it's delisted, you can do so via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337100/Warhammer_Age_of_Sigmar_Tempestfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/pcvr/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall/4617889574904734/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta</a>, or <a href="https://www.viveport.com/apps/8e1e49fc-e4df-4c3e-8387-df8cca8a8890?hl=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoq3HWS0qANSe2mG4MZJk1fg5WhBIm24ZN04WPak9As-Q9oUaIjK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Viveport</a> right now. Be aware that you will need a VR headset to enjoy it, though.</p>

But suppose, if only for the space of this article, we pretended otherwise. Suppose we considered “what gamers want” a constructive prompt rather than a rhetorical cudgel. In that case, the best and most honest way to find out what gamers want would be to consider what they read.</p><p>This list contains the 15 <em>Kotaku </em>stories people spent the most “engaged minutes” reading in 2024, per Chartbeat. The data is clear: Gamers want to know when the Nintendo Switch 2 will come out. They want to learn how to make the consoles they already have work better for them. They want to dive deep into whatever weird and wacky thing is happening in corners of the internet that the mainstream media isn’t paying attention to. And, perhaps more than anything, they want to read thoughtful writing about the games they play, the industry that makes them, and the discourse they inspire.</p><p>Don’t let anyone tell you differently.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c632bc42dfaa6eb19a9a8834e97efaa4" data-recommend-id="image://c632bc42dfaa6eb19a9a8834e97efaa4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario thinking, appearing on the screen of a cartoon Switch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario thinking, appearing on the screen of a cartoon Switch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="shutterstock" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->skvalval / Nintendo / Kotaku<!-- --> (<!-- -->Shutterstock<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c632bc42dfaa6eb19a9a8834e97efaa4" data-recommend-id="image://c632bc42dfaa6eb19a9a8834e97efaa4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario thinking, appearing on the screen of a cartoon Switch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>No matter what you’re doing or what you’re playing at the moment, it feels like we’re all just biding our time until the announcement of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-launch-pokemon-games-1851139696&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-launch-pokemon-games-1851139696">follow-up to the Nintendo Switch</a></span>.

Heismay isn’t the bright-eyed optimist that you’d expect to find fighting for a better, more progressive world. He starts off as a recluse, accused of a crime he didn’t commit, all while trying to grieve his lost son. When the one thing that was your whole world is gone, what point is there in hoping for a better day? Heismay is a punching bag wherever he goes. He’s subject to prejudice for being a eugief and his own people have their own reasons for subjecting him to cruel and unusual punishment. If there was ever a person who had a reason to cast all hope and compassion aside, it’s Heismay. But just because one loses their way without a light doesn’t mean they have to stumble through the dark. Heismay doesn’t have his son to care for any longer, but he still finds ways to honor him, telling stories of the child he lost so he never forgets the guiding light he once had.</p><p>Moving forward when you feel like you have nothing to live for can seem impossible, even if you have people who support you through your darkest moments. Heismay was nearly too far gone, feeling too weak to carry on. He was ready to die in the sandworm-infested desert and leave the uncaring world behind him. But finding something to live for in a world that feels rigged against you and makes you face constant heartache and loss is true strength. Heismay is half the size of his teammates but with twice the heart. He is the struggle of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> personified, finding hope in a world that has given him no reason to so much as look for it. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac8ba3187470d69a1e24f86c1e1ba085" data-recommend-id="image://ac8ba3187470d69a1e24f86c1e1ba085" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown talking to a priest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown talking to a priest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac8ba3187470d69a1e24f86c1e1ba085" data-recommend-id="image://ac8ba3187470d69a1e24f86c1e1ba085" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown talking to a priest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Indiana Jones has always had a terrific assortment of friends around the world. Characters like Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) not only make his cinematic adventures more vibrant and entertaining, but they clue us into the fact that Dr. Jones’ work has already earned him the friendship and admiration of many good people all over the globe, so he must be doing something right.

Not some stuffy or stereotypical figure, Antonio’s a three-dimensional person and a delight. A moral figure but not a moralizing one, he’s a man who looks with fear on the turning of political tides around the globe but still wants to be able to savor the good things in life, like that humdinger of an American record that Indy brings him as a gift.</p><p>Played terrifically by Enrico Colantoni, an actor with an impressive resumé who I’m most familiar with from his work in <em>Galaxy Quest </em>as Mathesar, the leader of the Thermians, Antonio is thoughtful and believable, a crucial part of <em>The Great Circle</em>’s wonderful globehopping, pseudo-historical texture. And so, while the game<em> </em>saw me laying my eyes on the pyramids of Gizeh, on ancient statues of the Buddha, and on other wonderful sights and cultural wonders, it may be that the sight I’ll remember most is that of Antonio, this keenly intelligent, kind, wonderful priest who wears hearing aids, dancing with delight to the groovy sounds of the latest hit out of New York City. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70d485342d8ebfaed99edbf7e289d6de" data-recommend-id="image://70d485342d8ebfaed99edbf7e289d6de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sunset Visitor</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="70d485342d8ebfaed99edbf7e289d6de" data-recommend-id="image://70d485342d8ebfaed99edbf7e289d6de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Iris is an enigma through most of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span>, but she’s also the most important character in its melodramatic science-fiction tale. At one point in time, she was just a teenage girl with teenage problems. She had a friend who annoyed her, a mother who thrust her expectations upon her, and like teenagers often are, she was never willing to open up to most people. When an alien invasion and an accompanying disease wiped out the rest of humanity, she was left alone with no one but clones of herself to carry on society. Iris became a god-like figure to her “daughters” and even as she ascended to a throne of her own making, the same anger, resentment, and insecurity she felt as a child grew with her. When the only people around you are copies of yourself, there’s no one there to check you as you rise beyond what any human should ever be. The farther you lift yourself above those you consider beneath you, the harder you’ll hit the ground when you fall. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0f814bab85757361b7398cc559a14cd3" data-recommend-id="image://0f814bab85757361b7398cc559a14cd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="ND-5 and Kay Vess do a cool guy walk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ND-5 and Kay Vess do a cool guy walk." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f814bab85757361b7398cc559a14cd3" data-recommend-id="image://0f814bab85757361b7398cc559a14cd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="ND-5 and Kay Vess do a cool guy walk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Okay look, I’m no <em>Star Wars </em>lore expert—for that, we’d need Zack, but he’s not here today, so you’re stuck with me instead.

Droids in <em>Star Wars</em>, in my opinion, often kind of fall into this uncomfortable space. On one hand, the franchise sees them as unfairly discriminated against, but on the other, it’s long been wary of reckoning with whether or not droids actually <em>are </em>sentient—should we care if a droid is forced to do slave labor or has its memory wiped, or are they actually just robots that may put on a show of having real thoughts and feelings but remain just disposable machines?</p><p>Increasingly in recent years, however, it’s seemed to me that <em>Star Wars </em>no longer wants to treat the sentience of droids with any ambiguity, and ND-5 is one of the best examples yet of a droid whose inner life is clearly as rich and complex as that of any other living being. You can see the ways in which he’s torn between old loyalties and his desire to be a faithful friend to Kay Vess. In other words, he’s a terrific supporting character for a story set in the criminal underworld of <em>Star Wars</em>, one who illuminates all the shades of doubt and conflict that come with existing in that world, and the uneasy way that he and Kay work their way toward a kind of understanding and partnership helps make those elements feel personal. Here’s hoping we haven’t seen the last of these two. I really want to see where their adventures take them next. —Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b20f7391f2aaeac5610e3bf864d1935" data-recommend-id="image://3b20f7391f2aaeac5610e3bf864d1935" data-format="jpg" data-width="1281" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly stares at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Curly stares at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b20f7391f2aaeac5610e3bf864d1935" data-recommend-id="image://3b20f7391f2aaeac5610e3bf864d1935" data-format="jpg" data-width="1281" data-height="721" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly stares at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For most of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span>, Curly is a haunting reminder of the consequences of his own actions. The game frames the captain of the <em>Tulpar </em>spaceship as the instigator of a crash landing that stranded him and his crew. His haunting burnt figure is mummified and he is left unable to speak, though he is kept alive and force-fed painkillers by his remaining crew as they try to survive the circumstances he ostensibly led them to.</p><p>While <em>Mouthwashing</em> adds a lot of nuance to Curly’s role in how everything went down, his design is one of the most striking of any video game character this year. His lone uncovered eye follows you through the room, you have to pry open his mouth to give him pills, and the visceral discomfort <em>Mouthwashing </em>creates every time you interact with him only grows as the psychological horror game goes off the rails in the second half. <em>Mouthwashing </em>turned out to be one of the breakout hits of 2024, and the image of Curly’s burnt figure has become one of the most iconic visual elements of any game this year. Despite its horrifying nature, Curly’s post-crash design has become a surprising cosplay trend online.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac43c1c708abfbc1a66190f20464a8be" data-recommend-id="image://ac43c1c708abfbc1a66190f20464a8be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a yellow Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a yellow Chaos Emerald." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac43c1c708abfbc1a66190f20464a8be" data-recommend-id="image://ac43c1c708abfbc1a66190f20464a8be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a yellow Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Year of Shadow is nearly over, and Sega delivered on bringing Sonic’s angsty rival back into the spotlight. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>did an excellent job of utilizing Keanu Reeves’ soulful performance, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><em>Shadow Generations</em></a></span><em> </em>felt like an apology for flattening one of the <em>Sonic </em>series’ most complex characters for nearly 20 years.

Not one to be daunted, however, she seizes an opportunity to investigate the discovery of a massive diamond in the remote town of Crimson. Her can-do attitude serves her well, too, as she winds up getting much more than she bargained for when the diamond claim becomes a murder investigation.</p><p>Like a good Agatha Christie mystery, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>features a colorful cast of memorable characters as suspects, and Nancy’s good-natured determination and practicality (she takes excellent notes!) make her the ideal person to hold down the center of this narrative whirlwind. It’s great to see the adventure genre get a bold new entry in the form of <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, and to see the genre’s pantheon of female heroes—Rosella, Laura Bow, April Ryan, Kathy Rain, and others—welcome a terrific new member. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="61e603fc85562942879af12aba5857da" data-recommend-id="image://61e603fc85562942879af12aba5857da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks at Davrin as he speaks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks at Davrin as he speaks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61e603fc85562942879af12aba5857da" data-recommend-id="image://61e603fc85562942879af12aba5857da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks at Davrin as he speaks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Characters have always been BioWare’s bread and butter, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> has the strongest collective cast that the studio has ever put into its fantasy RPG series. There are no flops hanging out in the Lighthouse and scheming to stop the elven gods from taking over Thedas. Neve, the Tevinter detective, is a dutybound freedom fighter who still finds time to care about the little guy when the world is ending. The necromancer Emmrich spends hours waxing about the cultural significance of death but can’t just safely depersonalize it through study, instead needing to confront whether or not he’s actually at peace with what it means to manipulate death. Davrin, the elven Grey Warden, has spent so long assuming his life was forfeit that he has trouble conceptualizing a life for himself if he’s no longer doomed by the narrative.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is full of small moments that encapsulate big ideas. Taash struggles with their gender, and it plays into the push and pull they feel between the culture they grew up in and the one they’re drawn to. Bellara is inextricably wrapped up in the history of her people, the Dalish Elves, and she uses that history as a reference for her own fiction which you can stumble upon her writing. Lucanis has a demon inside him that takes over his body when he sleeps, so he drinks more coffee than an overstimulated college student. Harding begins <em>The Veilguard </em>in a drab, unkempt room in the Lighthouse, but as she stays there, her caring nature shines through as it’s gradually grown over by a garden of her own making.</p><p>No, the members of the titular Veilguard don’t bicker or want to kill each other like the characters in previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games; instead, each of them is a beacon of light that shines all its own in a dark world that may grow darker if they don’t save it. Everyone wants to fight for a better Thedas, even as they each occupy disparate areas of BioWare’s fantasy world. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/31/game-of-the-year-2024-overall-winner/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As the end of the year looms large, it signals the close of our awards season, too. We’ve celebrated this year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/game-of-the-year-2024-best-visual-design/">incredible visuals</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/22/game-of-the-year-2024-best-gameplay/">innovative gameplay</a>, and each platform’s best titles, but someone has to be the winner, sitting atop this remarkable pile like a particularly proud mole. Our winner resoundingly stood out as a celebration of PlayStation, and gaming as a whole, focussing on fun, and evoking a purity of vision that is rarely found in AAA games.</p>

<p>It has been a good year for games, but with so many blockbusting new games and genuine surprises, more incredible remakes than you can shake a stick at, even games backed by hundreds of millions could struggle to stand out from the crowd. Diminutive though they might be, Astro did exactly that.</p>
<p>And with good reason — what started out as effectively a tech demo has blossomed into something that shows off the absolute best of PlayStation. Not only is it an absolute nostalgia fest, but it is an incredibly well-designed game.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that you are searching the universe for your missing buddies. Each level is a beautiful and moreish platformer, with upbeat music, colourful enemies and all manner of things to keep you entertained and engaged — like the special weapons and items that are key to your success. The level design is both varied and the right level of challenging, with super-hard optional side levels for those looking for sweaty palms.</p>

<p>As we said in our review, where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">we awarded Astro a very rare 10/10</a>, “Whether you’re an old timer or a young kid with their first console — or better yet, a combination of the two — there are dozens of hours of fun to be mined here. It’s a fun, easy-going romp through PlayStation history, and absolutely impossible to play without a smile plastered to your face.”</p>
<p>Well done Astro, you cute little guy, you are well deserving of TheSixthAxis’s Game of the Year Award for 2024.</p>
<p><em>– Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio – Runner-up</h2>
<p>In other years, Metaphor could easily have been the one taking this prize home, but even though it’s been hopped over by the delightful Astro, it stands out as this year’s most immersive and impressive RPG. Coming from the team of developers behind the iconic Persona series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> could have just been Persona in fantasy land, but it’s so much more.</p>
<p>The new setting of Euchronia let Studio Zero really flex its creative muscles, giving us a world filled with interesting characters, unique races, and some of the most bonkers enemy designs you’ve ever seen. It’s little surprise that it took home this year’s Best Visual Design award, as it looks absolutely stunning. It takes the ‘living anime’ aesthetic and runs with it, bringing creative and fresh ideas to what can often be a staid and conventional genre.</p>
<p>The story, centred on the crowning of a new monarch following the king’s death, takes a series of unexpected turns and asks question after question about race, religion and the nature of democracy, all of which feel incredibly salient in the present day. Metaphor ReFantazio is a remarkable game, and one which everyone should experience.</p>
<h2>Helldivers 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Dropping onto the scene amidst a cacophony of patriotic explosions and grandiose orchestral music to fight bugs, bots and (as of a few weeks ago) the brainwashed masses, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> was a smash hit. Even though it’s a sequel and follows a familiar formula and game design ethos for the team at Arrowhead, it rode the wave of modern co-op gaming.</p>
<p>You see, you’re dropping in and facing off against what often feels like impossible odds, only able to even things out with the use of bombastic orbital support – emphasis very much on the ‘bomb’ there – but when that support is invariably danger close and a delightful mix of massively and minimally effective, and being called in willy-nilly by everyone on your team…. let’s just say it’s a good thing you’ve got some spare clones.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 had some ups and downs through the year, though. Launch was hampered by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/helldivers-2-patch-notes-1-000-12-server-cap-limit-raised/">massive demand on the servers</a>, the early <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/07/helldivers-2-update-1-000-100-brings-inevitably-unpopular-balance-changes/">balance updates took things in the wrong direction</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">there was the whole PSN fiasco</a>, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-is-out-now-a-new-faction-and-trucks/">the most recent update adding a third faction</a> and the balance in a bit of a sweet spot, it’s no wonder that player counts swelled massively once more as people answered the call.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Co-op games are alive and well, and many more are scheduled to be released in 2025 to fraternize with friendships and reinforce relationships—maybe. 2025’s co-op titles ensure plenty of reason to be optimistic if you enjoy playing on a couch with a friend, or online.</p>



<p>I come from a generation of playing PlayStation 1 and 2 games with friends in co-op. The feeling of sitting next to someone and experiencing the same whirlwind of emotions together as you beat a level is something the intangible nature of online co-op can’t replicate. However, I choose online co-op over no co-op at all—which is the way the games industry seemed to be heading for a while.</p>



<p>The art of co-op continues to thrive, and 2025’s biggest partner-up titles are already stirring up emotions again.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-co-op-games-releasing-in-2025">Biggest Co-op Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Who are you? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4 is cutting back on the toilet humor</a>, but this shouldn’t detract from what is sure to be another wild Pandora ride. Co-op has been a big aspect of the series since its debut, encouraging you to team up with other Vault Hunters and take out gun-wielding corporate stooges, and deranged Psychos. Borderlands 4 looks to be more of what we’ve become accustomed to, and I’m so glad I can use a plethora of inane weapons to destroy with friends.</p>



<h3 id="h-killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ew. Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>As an FPS enthusiast, I really can’t wait for Killing Floor 3. If you love first-person shooters with gory action, gratuitous violence, banging soundtracks, and replayability, Tripwire Interactive’s Killing Floor 3 is the answer. Its stylings and gameplay share a lot in common with modern DOOM, sure, but this isn’t a bad thing. In a world rife with hero, extraction, and military shooters, Killing Floor 3 is a gruesome breath of blood-soaked air. Lock and load with a squad of up to six friends to take down Zeds.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Disgusting and delightful. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Low and Alone are the new and curiously named protagonists of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>—with the emphasis being on the plural. There are <em>two main characters</em> to escort through a seemingly inescapable journey of hell this time around; and you can do this on your own, switching between the two, or have a second person join you. It’s probably better for your sanity if you have someone to hold onto during Little Nightmare 3’s decidedly hairier moments.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dual dissection. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Dying Light franchise continues with 2025’s The Beast. This standalone sequel sees Kyle Crane return to the main title role—hero of the original—and it’s set some 13 years later. Kyle is a grizzled, zombie-killing veteran at this point, but a second pair of veteran-like hands doesn’t go amiss. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> supports co-op, and buddying up improves your survival chances during the series’ neverending outbreak.</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</h3>



<figure><figcaption>How to make the best better. Credit to Bandai Namco &amp; FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was easily one of the most shocking announcements from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. A fascinating crossover featuring FromSoftware’s Elden Ring world, and the influence of action experts—Bandai Namco Entertainment. It’s not DLC, this is a fully-fledged game, and one of the biggest differences between Nightreign and traditional Elden Ring is co-op. Nightreign allows you to team up into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trio</a> (not two, sadly) and enjoy the splendor and sickness of an alternate Limgrave in harrowing harmony.</p>



<h3 id="h-stage-fright">Stage Fright</h3>



<figure><figcaption>This ain’t no kitchen. Credit to Ghost Town Games Ltd.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to describe the angst and frustration caused by your fiancé failing to execute a last-minute beef patty throw to earn full stars on a level—but this was part of Overcooked’s charm. Ghost Town Games cooked up magic with the cooking simulation franchise, and the studio is moving to pastures new with Stage Fright. The team’s creativity looks to be in full effect here with Stage Fright promising two distinct worlds playing out side-by-side, and you need to solve puzzles and escape predicaments with a co-op cohort. This is one to keep an eye on for sure.</p>



<h3 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We want a dragon. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, what better way to round out this list? Hazelight Studios is masterminded by the enigmatic auteur Josef Fares. The charismatic director has helmed iconic co-op games, including Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, A Way Out, and It Takes Two—proclaimed GOTY by The Game Awards in 2021. Now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> has the impossible task of trying to one-up It Takes Two, but the early signs are promising, and this task might be possible. It’s designed purely with co-op in mind, and has you taking part in a ton of mini-games and trying out many gameplay-shifting concepts. Split Fiction’s expectations are high, and it includes the lauded “Friend’s Pass” system again—meaning you only need one copy!</p>

			<p>With 2024 nearly gone, Saber Interactive has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500560232665055477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a community update on the Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 for 2025. The developer acknowledged the fans' cries for more PvP content, and they plan to deliver next year, starting with a new PvP map set in a closed environment with plenty of tight corridors, forcing players to engage more often in closed-quarter battles.</p>
<p>Patch 7.0 will also see the addition of custom PvP lobbies, another community request. Users will get to tweak various modifiers and change the number of players (up to 6v6), the timer limit for each match, the maximum score limit, and even to remove the limitation of having more than two players for each class in the same match.</p>
<p>Of course, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is also being expanded with more PvE content, such as the previously announced Horde mode. Additionally, there will be new missions and enemies, a new difficulty level (linked to new rewards), and a brand new Prestige Rank. The latter feature will be introduced in Season 3, allowing players to further upgrade their classes.</p>
<p>When it comes to new Champions, the next addition is the Salamander, a Sniper character available in both PvE and PVP. Saber explained that the Sniper could have just as easily belonged to the Raven Guard, but they have other plans for that Space Marine Chapter.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/a62bc19a1e9e19f11e45fce9f8375b8a7e275d7f-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The developer will also add more customization, like the Mark VI Corvus, and continue to expand the Battle Barge. Next year, a new area called Data Vault will be opened, featuring unlockable information on most enemies from the game. Players can unlock them with a special currency earned through in-game achievements.</p>
<p>Following the game's debut in September, Saber Interactive has been pumping out patches for their game. The Obelisk update <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-obelisk-update-adds-dlss-3-fsr-3-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> two weeks ago, adding the titular PvE co-op Operation, support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 on PC, and support for PlayStation 5 Pro on console.</p>
<p>The aggressive roadmap isn't surprising, given that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has been one of the most successful releases of 2024 with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over five million units sold as of late November</a>. Saber clearly intends to continue striking the iron while it's hot, keeping the fanbase glued to the game for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the game is included in our shortlist for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best shooter of 2024</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/use-the-uchigatana-in-your-new-elden-ring-build-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If your <strong>Elden Ring</strong> build revolves around the Samurai class and move set, chances are you want to track down and equip a second Uchigatana. Even if you’re not playing Samura, knowing where to find the Uchigatana in Elden Ring proves worthwhile, as it is a durable, quick weapon that scales with Strength and Dexterity.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-uchigatana-in-elden-ring"><strong>Where is the Uchigatana in Elden Ring?</strong></h2>



<p>You can find the Uchigatana one of two ways, either as starting equipment for the Samurai class, as previously mentioned, or out in the world via a dungeon.</p>



<p>For the latter, <strong>you’ll find the Uchigatana in Deathtouched Catacombs</strong>, in Stormhill, Limgrave, where you’ll have to defeat a few skeletons and activate a lever to unlock the door leading into the hall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Within the catacombs, fight through the undead until you discover a dead body handing over the edge of the floor. It’s here that you’ll find the Uchigatana.</p>







<h2><strong>How Good is the Uchigatana?</strong></h2>



<p>The Uchigatana in <em>Elden Ring</em> is one of the best early-game weapons, as it is viable for both Piercing and Slash Damage. Furthermore, its Weapon Skill, <strong>Unsheathe</strong>, can help you down most bosses with relative ease early on.</p>



<p>Thankfully, you can <strong>upgrade the Uchigatana using Smithing Stones</strong>, which makes it stronger overall. Over time, the blade will cause bleed buildup, which is ever-useful when dealing with bosses with an increased health pool.</p>



<p>And yes, you can infuse the Uchigatana with <strong>Ashes of War</strong>. These include the likes of Sword Dance, Vacuum Slice, Bloodhound’s Step, Raptor of the Mists, Lighting Slash, Flame of the Redmanes, Carian Grandeur, Bloody Slash, and Seppuku, among countless others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legless-in-london-brings-accessible-victorian-ambition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new board game is bringing more visibility to the disabled community. Focus Games has partnered with an accomplished humanities professor to produce <em>Legless in London</em>, a board game about playing as an amputee in Victorian London.</p>

<h2>The <em>Legless in London</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the game's <a href="https://www.leglessinlondon.com/" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Legless in London</em> is a nuanced board game about disability.</p>

<p>It is a game where players face challenges, opportunities, and choices at every turn. They will navigate the workplace, the marriage market, property ownership, medicine, and the prosthesis market while aiming to achieve their character's personal goals.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legless-in-london-character-card.jpg?itok=KiLoYxbx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legless-in-london-character-card.jpg?itok=G8FuaE5x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The playable characters in Legless in London are all inspired by Victorian amputees and fictional characters from 19th-century literature. Everyone from beloved poet William Ernest Henley to <em>Moby Dick's</em> Captain Ahab are represented here.</p>

<p>In addition to being designed for fun, Legless in London encourages players to think about the various barriers that disabled people face in real life and the different hurdles they confront. Furthermore, the designers hope players will reflect on how disabled people are represented in fiction and popular culture.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> was designed in collaboration with Focus Games and Dr. Ryan Sweet, a Senior Lecturer in Humanities at Swansea University, alongside a focus group of members of the disabled community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disability and disability history are underrepresented in culture—and especially in tabletop gaming. Many mainstream tabletop games also present accessibility problems for disabled players (for example, wordy and/or complex rules, which can be troublesome for neurodivergent users). Legless in London addresses both representational and accessibility concerns as it provides a balanced, researched-informed, positive, and fun portrayal of disability in an inclusive format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That consideration for disability also extends to the game's design. It will launch with a smartphone app, providing a digital alternative to the game's physical components including dice rolls, event cards, health tracker, and in-game money.</p>

<p>As for the physical components, the game will ship with large accessible font text, screen reader-friendly resources, easy-read rules, and more.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> will launch in February 2025.</p>

The premise is a mashup of visual novel and cozy walking sim elements that eventually goes to some much weirder places and begins breaking the fourth wall in the process. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt5Uat93SOY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt5Uat93SOY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markiplier streamed the game a couple of days after it came out</a></span> and, weeks later, the VOD has accumulated over 3 million views. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9Fi7SGm5YY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9Fi7SGm5YY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Special edd</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uR--Rwzlo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uR--Rwzlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xQc</a></span>, and others have since reacted to the game as well.

			<p>Many great platformers were released this year, but one in particular stole the show. This list will compile some of the greatest platforming games released this year if you want a game that's fun for all the family or seek to introduce someone to gaming. Without further ado, here are Wccftech's five best platformers of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Astro Bot (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/">9.3/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It's no surprise that Astro Bot is on top. The game was well-received by critics and users across the globe, and many got to go on a journey of nostalgia and celebrate Sony's expansive lineage. Compared to Astro's Playroom, Astro Bot is a fully thought-out game where you get to jump, climb, glide, and fly across expansive levels while saving bots that are cameos from Sony's iconic games. Below is an excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's review.</p>
<p><em>Everything that Astro Bot touches is filled with whimsy and amusement. The titular hero’s every animation is tinged with a sickeningly sweet charisma, from the way he carries himself throughout the stage on his own two feet or floating through the air via his high-tech jet back, going a few rounds to knock out rogue bots, and the idle animations that are unique to each level. All of the backdrop and tertiary characters of Astro Bot similarly share that wonder and charm and even the simple interactions between one mascot bot to another would never fail to put a smile on my face.&nbsp;</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h2>
<p>For fans of the Sonic franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> was a dream come true. Although fans initially thought it was going just to be a simple remaster, it is evident that the game is much more than that and provides more content than players expected. Not only did the graphics receive a massive boost and give more detail than ever to both Sonic and Shadow, but it seems that a bit of Sonic Frontiers rubbed off on the game, too.</p>
<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations is a great title if you want to introduce your children to gaming or get them to love the Sonic franchise, too. There may be some difficult moments, but you can always step in and complete the boss fight for them if they're struggling a lot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Mario vs. Donkey Kong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-vs-donkey-kong/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>It isn't all that shocking that a Nintendo game has made it into one of the top spots for best Platformer of 2024. If there's one thing that Nintendo does best, it's this genre. Mario vs Donkey Kong was released in February this year.</p>
<p>For those who played the original, this may serve as a sweet hit of nostalgia. For those new to the game, it's still a fun time all around. This game has plenty of value for money, too, as you can play through over 130 levels, experiencing the classic platformer in a new light. Here's what Nathan Birch said in Wccftech's review:</p>
<p><em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong may lack the razzle dazzle of its stars’ more recent games, but this remake still has the power to hook players with its tried-and-true retro platforming and a finely-tuned difficulty curve that culminates in some challenges that will truly test your mind and reflexes. Those who have played the original Mario vs. DK to death may not find quite enough new content here, but lapsed fans and new players are in for a barrel of fun.</em></p>
<h2>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disneys-epic-mickey-rebrushed-what-could-have-been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Disney's Epic Mickey was a fantastic game that was first released in 2010 on the Nintendo Wii. Fast forward 14 years, and we have now experienced the remastered release of Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed. It's a fantastic game and a great way to introduce youngsters to gaming. It takes you on a journey through Disney's forgotten history while you get to wield a paintbrush to help you traverse the terrain, as well as utilize your paintbrush to take on bosses in the world.</p>
<p>For what it is, the game is a pretty great remaster of a Disney classic title and will provide a lot of nostalgia for those who played and loved the original. Some systems were improved, while others fell behind a little bit. While it is a fantastic game, it's undoubtedly no Astro Bot and does have some flaws that may make the game a bit tiresome after a while.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>The Plucky Squire (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-plucky-squire-a-zelda-love-letter/">7/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The Plucky Squire is the perfect game if you want to introduce young children to gaming. While some of the mechanics may seem a little bit complicated at first, it's very easy to get the hang of and really accessible. When it comes to platformers that were released this year, The Plucky Squire is incredibly unique in the way it tackles traversal and movement through the game.</p>
<p>It's more than just a platformer, though, as there's also fun combat to engage in, a storyline to experience, and lots of collectibles to discover as you solve puzzles. The game is a lot of fun and great for anyone of any age.</p>
