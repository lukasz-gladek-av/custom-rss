		<p>Following on from the well received original trilogy remaster, Aspyr Media has announced Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. You love to see it, and that’s probably why they’re releasing it on 14th February 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ow6cM-fgiB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While the first three games were all numbered, the games that came fourth and onwards were all named. 1999’s The Last Revelation sees Lara uncover the lost tomb of the Egyptian God Set, unwittingly setting him free. She’s then presumed dead after saving the world from that danger, with Tomb Raider: Chronicles rounding out the series’ PS1 era with family and friends reminiscing on earlier Lara Croft adventures (which you obviously get to play through).</p>
<p>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness saw the series make the leap to PlayStation 2, coming with a brand new engine and overhauled gameplay – Lara has a stamina meter for climbing, can perform melee attacks, stealth, and more. Unfortunately, this was a real problem project for Core Design, taking three years to produce with multiple delays and content being cut or scaled back to meet deadlines. While it sold a 2.5 million copies, it was not a critical success, and Eidos decided to hand the series over to Crystal Dynamics going forward.</p>
<p>As with the first remastered trilogy, Aspyr is making a number of modernising changes. You’ll have both overhauled and classic graphics that &nbsp;you can switch between on the fly, and there’s a more modern control scheme inspired by later games to give camera controls, or you can still play with the old tank controls. Further quality of life tweaks include boss health bars, and there’s trophies and achievements integrated as well.</p>

<p>The Darkness trilogy will come in at the same $29.99 / £24.99 / €29.99 price point as the first trio.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review-ps5-xbox-switch-pc/">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered review</a>, we said, “Lara’s original trilogy has been lovingly restored with the launch of these remasters, offering a definitive collection that bundles the core games and their expansions. However, dusting off these old relics in the name of nostalgia may come with a nasty surprise. Don’t worry, there are no mummy curses, snake pits, or swinging pendulum axes, though the clunky controls will definitely take some getting used to (again).”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-franchise-sells-over-100-million-units-comes-with-remaster-announcement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/video-games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-reveal-100-million-games-sold-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crystal Dynamics posted</a> that the Tomb Raider franchise has officially reached over 100 million games sold across the entire franchise, a franchise that started in 1996 and is still going strong even today in 2024. Not only did Crystal Dynamics express their gratitude and excitement over the success of the franchise, but they also announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation-remaster/">that Tomb Raider IV-VI are getting their very own remaster collection</a>, which is monumental news for those who have been waiting to see whether Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness would ever receive any special treatment. Angel of Darkness has always been the most controversial game in the series, and it's already taken plenty of Tomb Raider fans by surprise that they've chosen to remaster this game, too. It's possible that by remastering it, all of the bugs that the game ever had will be fixed, and its reputation may finally swing to a positive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered Starring Lara Croft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdQDT7LSPWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Remastering all of the original games in the collection means that they are more accessible than ever, which will definitely help to contribute to the number of sales made in the Tomb Raider franchise. While the numbers for the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection weren't revealed, the <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Embracer Group financial report</a> stated that the collection was positively received and performed above management expectations. The first remastered collection saw a lot of Limited Edition merchandise released for the title, which helped boost and promote the game. Additionally, those working on the game continued to release bug fixes and updates, making the game as flawless as possible.</p>
<p>While Tomb Raider IV-VI are not considered many people's favorites in the franchise, it will bring the entire collection full circle, and will make the entire collection more accessible to those who want to play it on alternative consoles, as well as giving those who create content an easier way to do it, as the game allows you to choose between the original graphics and the remastered graphics.</p>
<p>This will likely help to bolster the sales of the Tomb Raider franchise, especially as the last new game in the franchise was released in 2018, and the next game in the Survivor franchise hasn't received any new information.</p>
<p>Whether this remastered collection will receive the same amount of fanfare and promotion as the first three will remain to be seen, but it will be released on all platforms similar to the first remastered collection. Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered is set to release on February 14, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honkai-star-rail-version-2-6-release-date-unveiled-for-later-this-month.1007277/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.6 release date, with a new five-star character and more coming to the game later this month.</p>
<p>Launching on October 23rd,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.6 follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-25-release-date">last month's Version 2.5</a>, which saw you uncovering secrets within the Shackling Prison, bringing a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to its climax.</p>
<p>This time around, the stakes aren't quite so high. In Version 2.6, you'll be returning to Penacony and visiting the Paperfold University, an academic institution currently preparing for its new semester, as well as its anniversary celebrations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.6-release-date-rappa.jpg?itok=uCPkhcgb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.6-release-date-rappa.jpg?itok=o1zGWXnq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.6 introduces the ninja graffiti artist Rappa, among many other things.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be given the chance to take part in the University's festivities and experience a glimpse of campus life, alongside the likes of March 7th and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-honkai-star-rail-trailer-is-all-about-dan-hengs-super-cool-imbibitor-lunae-form">Dan Heng</a>.</p>
<p>A new five-star character is also joining the roster in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.6. Rappa is a character who "calls herself a ninja" and uses the art of ninjutsu, as well as "rap, graffiti, and comics", in combat.</p>
<p>She can deal area-of-effect damage, debuff enemies, and more, making her an ideal addition to your team if you're looking for some more group-based destruction.</p>
<p>As well as Rappa, you'll also get another chance to obtain the aforementioned Dan Heng, along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-acheron-raiden-shogun">Acheron</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-reveals-new-character-acheron-as-20-reveal-is-coming-this-week">Aventurine</a>, during the course of this update cycle.</p>

<p>Version 2.6 also brings part three of the Simulated Universe DLC, which introduces the Unknowable Domain. You'll collect Scepters, enhance them with Components, and unlock "powerful synergies" in your race to take on a "formidable final foe".</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, it's a turn-based gacha RPG from HoYoverse, the creator of smash hits&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>. It has similar gacha mechanics to those games, but you'll be taking on your opponents in more thoughtful turn-based engagements.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 2.6 arrives across all platforms on October 23rd.</p>

		<p><em>Recently, the entire Remap staff was at the movie theater. We're somewhat of cinema aficionados ourselves, but actually going to a theater is a bit of a special event. You'll hear all about our time taking in Megalopolis on My Turn next week, but the experience left an impression.</em></p><p><em>Cado is fortunate enough to live in a part of New York City where there's a lot of options. Good projection, clean theaters. It's a place where people value movies as movies. That's less true for Patrick, who's subject to whatever the suburbs can offer, and for Rob, finding the best often means hopping in the car for a long time.</em></p><p><em>Movies used to be a pillar of society's media diet, but these days, the so-called Attention Economy has something to say about that, combined with the rise of decent home theater setups and easy access to streaming movies. What is the future of the movie theater, and what would get us to come back more often?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> So I was watching <em>Megalopolis </em>and after a few minutes I noticed, as I often do, a bunch of scratches on the screen that created bright slashes when the light from the projection hit them. This particular theater has a bunch of issues like this, but honestly I cannot remember the last time I saw a projection that was flawless. Maybe the Arclight (RIP) in Hollywood, the one at the Cinerama Dome?</p><p>On the other hand, I was one of three people in the audience at 4 PM on a Friday. Matinees are always slow, of course, and <em>Megalopolis </em>has been a huge bomb, but this is almost always what I find when I catch an afternoon movie. A lobby full of bored employees who look surprised to see someone else there as they prepared for the evening crowds, and then an almost entirely empty theater with two or three obvious maintenance issues that make you question the value proposition of a movie ticket versus watching it at home on streaming in a few weeks.</p><p>It got me wondering: is this just the state of movie theaters since the COVID shutdowns and the shift toward shorter delays for stream releases, or was this something that was always going to end up happening with the multiplex model?</p><p>You and I came of age in a world where the huge suburban multiplex was relatively new and served as an easy default for moviegoing and it was hard to argue with the convenience. Everything was showing there, and for more popular movies you could have your pick of showtimes. Now admittedly, only one or two of those screens was anything approaching the kind of movie theaters my parents had taken me to when I was little but, again, the convenience was hard to argue with. If it felt like movies weren’t hitting the same as <em>Independence Day </em>or <em>Toy Story </em>did when I was little, well, surely that was just because I wasn’t a little kid anymore, right?</p><p>Even if there was a significant difference in experience between the smaller shoebox theaters at the edges of the multiplex versus the larger auditoriums that were the default in the 80s and 90s, it still blew the doors off what you could get at home. HD flat screens were a rarity, and no matter how good an audio system you had, you just weren’t going to have anything approaching a cinematic experience. One of my uncles, after a series of boom years for his construction business, splurged on a huge projection system for a dedicated home theater room and I remember him showing us his DVD of <em>Air Force One </em>on that system and thinking that it was, indeed, awesome… and also still incredibly short of what a movie theater could do. The image always looked a little washed-out, the focus never quite right.</p><p>But it never occurred to me what the multiplex would turn into when it was no longer brand-new, when the equipment and furnishings were aging. Those small, narrow theaters were “good enough” when they were in good shape and a good home theater was beyond the means of most people and consumer technology at the time. But man, when that same theater has a projector that looks like it might have burned its bulb, the screen looks like a used napkin, and half the seats feel like their padding has collapsed, it’s hard to imagine a <em>worse </em>way to see a movie. Vulture <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/03/movie-theater-projector-amc-regal.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>ran a great article</u></a> where they surveyed the stated of moviegoing with a professional projectionist and he detailed point-by-point the ways theaters’ lack of maintenance and poor staffing and cleaning practices have caused these endemic issues but one of the big things that stands out to me is that almost none of the big theater chains can afford to fix what’s gone wrong with their theaters.</p><p>Obviously the pandemic plus the proliferation of streaming were going to pose a challenge to the film industry. But every time I attend one of these eerie “ghost ship” multiplexes, I wonder if they weren’t uniquely vulnerable to the competition that streaming provided. If your whole pitch is convenience, you don’t really have a plan B when something significantly more convenient comes along. And to offer that convenience, a lot of these places had already made some compromises on quality, meaning that they did not have far to fall before they invited unfavorable comparisons to watching movies at home.</p><p>Did your relationship with movie theaters follow a similar arc? I know that living in LA and having access to really good theaters probably woke me up to how lousy theaters were in a lot of other places, but I also wonder how much of my irritation with going to the movies now just reflects being in a different place in my life and relationships.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jeremyyappy?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Jeremy Yap</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>A huge part of what we’re talking about depends on what you’re getting out of attending a movie theater. For the longest time, it was a combination of earliest possible access to a new work, plus an audio and visual experience that could never, ever be matched at home. Movies have adopted a similar arc to arcades, you know? The advent of powerful gaming consoles capable of accepting arcade ports is pretty similar to the one-two punch of perfectly adequate home video equipment and convenient streaming.</p><p>I still attend the movies on a regular basis. When my wife and I have a date night, it’s almost always to attend a movie. In the past, it was superhero spectacles. These days, it’s more likely a horror movie. Just last weekend, I was there with a group of friends for dinner, drink, and the new Joker. We all basically knew the movie was going to blow, but it didn’t matter? We were showing up to an adequate but hardly special AMC in the suburbs, but no one cared? It was an opportunity to get out of the house—and in this case, everyone had children—and spend a few hours together. The theater was a chance for community.</p><p>Community, I suspect, is what’s going to be part of the second act for movie theaters. If we keep the arcade analogy, the rapid expansion of arcades in every mall eventually died out. (So did malls, mostly!) But now, you don’t have to go <em>that</em> far to find an arcade. The difference now is the “arcade” is often dropped into the middle of a fancy adults-oriented experience. There are family-friendly options like Dave and Busters, sure, but increasingly you’re seeing video games as part of a reason to lure adults out.&nbsp;</p><p>In these places, you find brand-new arcade games you can’t find at home. Too many of them are adaptations of mobile games, but between some of the original work still being done, the well-maintained arcade experiences from the 90s and 2000s still kick some serious ass. Sega made so many bangers.</p><p>But ultimately, it’s trying to make a compelling argument for why you shouldn’t just hang out at home.</p><p>Which is all to say that, in my opinion, the future of the movie theater requires a similar reinvention. It needs to become a destination for reasons beyond early access <em>or</em> technological marvels. 4DX, where the chair shakes and water’s spit in your face, is goofily extreme—but it gestures in the right direction of trying to rethink <em>why</em> we sit in a dark theater with other people. I’m sorry, but equipping a movie theater with terrific projection and incredible sound is not going to move the needle anymore. People don’t give a shit.&nbsp;</p><p>You can easily imagine, though, a theater that explicitly caters to people who <em>do</em> give a shit<em>. </em>You could charge them whatever you want. How much would you pay for it, Rob? But for everyone else, for the masses,I think it starts with “why do people want to get together?” and works backwards from there.&nbsp;</p><p>It is, perhaps, a small thing, but what’s been some of the most talked about parts of movies over the past year and change? It’s the fuckin’ popcorn buckets. They’re exclusive. They’re ridiculous. They create a reason to attend the movie. On some level, those popcorn buckets suggest a path forward for theaters.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@felixmooneeram?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Felix Mooneeram</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I could be wrong, but my instincts say that the popcorn buckets are more aimed at getting people who were already coming out to the movies to pay a bit more. Same way a collector’s edition of a video game is aimed at upselling a guaranteed $60 sale into a $100 sale. Looking at the popcorn buckets that get released and seem to move the needle, they seem like they’re either for long-running franchises or the kinds of big movies that once upon a time would have had all sorts of collectible tie-in deals with fast food businesses in the 90s. Which feels like it is the direction a lot of business is going: faced with the awareness that lots of people cannot will not pay more for the same service, you look at ways to sweeten the pot for the ones who <em>are </em>able and willing without massively increasing costs.</p>

There are a lot of systems to keep track of, levels to grind, and time to manage as you travel through the world of Euchronia. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the things to do when actual in-game days pass when you so much as talk to someone.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,196394,196599" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A lot of this will be familiar to <em>Persona </em>fans, but if <em>Metaphor</em>’s fantasy setting has drawn you in or you’re a veteran looking for some tips on what’s different, we have a big round-up of helpful tips to keep in mind as you jump into Atlus’ 70+ hour epic. Here are X things to know before you start <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>.</p><h2 id="h71167"><a id=""></a><strong>Stealth is pretty forgiving</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest changes in <em>Metaphor </em>from <em>Persona </em>is that you can attack enemies on the overworld like in an action game and kill them without switching to a turn-based battle. If you’re powerful enough to take an enemy out it will save you a lot of time grinding levels and exploring dungeons. However, sometimes you’ll encounter foes who you’ll still have to take out the old-fashioned way. But you can ambush them to start the battle with an advantage, and that means sneaking around them and striking from behind. The “stealth” in <em>Metaphor</em> is extremely forgiving. If you’re seen by an enemy, just sprint far enough away and they will forget you were there, then just stab them in the back when they turn around. You can even escape from a battle, run away, then you’ll get a second chance at stealth. - Kenneth Shepard</p><h2 id="h71168"><a id=""></a><strong>Listen to the narrated lore dumps on the map</strong></h2><p><em>Metaphor</em>’s world is pretty elaborate, with centuries of culture and politics to learn about. One way the game weaves in its world-building is with its narrator, who tells you about towns and cities as you head to them on your runner ship. So while the transitional screens can be skipped, you should listen to or read the subtitles for the lore dumps as you head from one place to another. — KS</p><h2 id="h71169"><a id=""></a><strong>You get control of your teammates…eventually</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest shocks when I first started <em>Metaphor</em> was that I couldn’t control my teammates. This was a much-maligned part of Atlus’ previous games like <em>Persona 3</em> that was changed in re-releases and remakes. But don’t panic, this is just a temporary thing-. You’ll fight alongside a few characters before you control them in battle, but you <em>will</em> at some point be able to issue commands and strategize. They just gate that behind the story for a few hours. — KS</p><h2 id="h71170"><a id=""></a><strong>Read the Mythical Scrolls in Akademia</strong></h2><p>Akademia is a safe space where you’re able to change up your Archetype classes, talk with the enigmatic bookkeeper More, and pet his cat Plateau. However, there’s also a scroll next to his desk that hints at some of the game’s biggest mysteries. The dialogue that follows will change throughout the game, so check in on it every now and then. — KS</p><h2 id="h71171"><a id=""></a><strong>If your protagonist falls in battle, it’s not game over…except in the overworld</strong></h2><p>One of the best quality-of-life changes in <em>Metaphor </em>is that if your protagonist falls in battle you don’t get an immediate game over, unlike previous Atlus games. This means you don’t have to spend most of your resources trying to make sure he survives things that might randomly knock him out with one hit. However, this does not apply if you aren’t in a turn-based battle yet. When you’re smacking around enemies in the overworld before a battle has been initiated, they will smack right back. If they’re not powerful enough to initiate a battle with those attacks, you’ll still take damage, and if your HP hits zero while in the overworld, that’s a game over. — KS</p><h2 id="h71172"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t forget you can reset battles if you get a bad start</strong></h2><p><em>Metaphor </em>encourages you to experiment. One of the ways it lets you do that is that you can reset a battle at any point as long as it’s your turn and you’ve got at least one character alive. Just press down the left analog stick and it will take you back to the very first turn of the fight. Keep in mind that if your opponent managed to start the battle with an advantage, they will still have it when you start the battle over. If you’re looking to get a full reset in which you can try and ambush an enemy, you’ll have to escape the battle and attack them in the overworld again. — KS</p><figure id="" data-id="2e378e5206510659d5479a1780a23b29" data-recommend-id="image://2e378e5206510659d5479a1780a23b29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bardon shakes the protagonist's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bardon shakes the protagonist's hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e378e5206510659d5479a1780a23b29" data-recommend-id="image://2e378e5206510659d5479a1780a23b29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bardon shakes the protagonist's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h71173"><a id=""></a><strong>A lot of quality-of-life features are locked behind bonds</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of reasons to get to know the many characters you’ll meet in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. There are, of course, the great stories and relationships you’ll uncover while hanging out with your new friends, but each also has some unlocks as you progress the relationship, such as new Archetypes to play as. Some, however, have quality-of-life features that really feel like they should be in the game by default. One example is More, who unlocks the ability to change your Archetypes in your pause menu, rather than having to go to Akademia. So just be aware that there are some perks to meeting up with your friends, even if they should probably just be available to you by default. — KS</p><h2 id="h71174"><a id=""></a><strong>Skating on your sword is the best way to get around</strong></h2><p>You spend a lot of time walking in <em>Metaphor</em>, but if you’re not in a dungeon or indoors, you can also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-sword-skate-fast-travel-map-1851668165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-sword-skate-fast-travel-map-1851668165">skate on your magical sword</a></span>. It’s a speed boost, looks fun as shit, and is generally the best way to get around as you travel through Euchronia. You’ll save yourself a lot of time if you get off your feet and onto your sword. — KS</p><h2 id="h71175"><a id=""></a><strong>Check your local stores for MP items</strong></h2><p><em>Metaphor </em>is an Atlus game, and that means that MP is a scarce resource. Before you go into any dungeon or big story moment, check your local stores for items that will replenish this so you can use spells and abilities in fights. Some of these are only sold in limited quantities, so look for accessories that can give you even the smallest bit of MP. Otherwise, you’ll probably end up having to leave a dungeon early and come back to it later. So mitigate this as much as you can. — KS</p><h2 id="h71176"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t rely on the same Archetypes the whole game</strong></h2><p>When you’ve found classes that work for your team, it’s easy to get comfortable using the same Archetypes through much of <em>Metaphor</em>. However, you will need to level up other trees to progress even the base Archetype for each character. So give some love to the other ancillary classes along the way. It will give you a new appreciation for the intricacies of <em>Metaphor</em>’s battle system, give you abilities you can “inherit” for the classes you do use, and let you further master the Archetypes you’re already using. — KS</p><h2 id="h71177"><a id=""></a><strong>If you can beat an enemy without getting hit, you’ll get bonuses</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of ways to maximize your grind in <em>Metaphor</em>e. If you manage to take out a group of enemies without getting hit in a turn-based fight, you’ll get an “Unscathed Triumph” bonus to your experience, money, and magla when you’re done. So beat enemies quickly both because you should aim to overpower your foes, but because you’ll also fill your pockets and get stronger because of it. — KS</p><h2 id="h71178"><a id=""></a><strong>Pull up the Memorandum at pretty much any time</strong></h2><p>Taking a page from <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> lets you open up its codex called the Memorandum during most cutscenes. Someone said a proper noun you don’t recognize? Push down the right thumbstick at any time and you can scroll through the codex and brush up on your knowledge. — KS</p><h2 id="h71179"><a id=""></a><strong>Some follower conversations are only available on the runner</strong></h2><p>Throughout <em>Metaphor</em>, you’ll get pinged when your followers want to talk to you. However, even if someone <em>wants</em> to talk to you, that doesn’t mean they will at the moment. Some of these conversations can only take place on your ship, which only moves when you’re en route to a new location. So if you have someone who wants to chat but is being particular about where and when, head to the runner and map out a place to go. Sometimes you’ll even find someone who wants to talk but hasn’t made you aware of it until you start heading somewhere. I missed a new follower bond for several in-game days before realizing that I had to initiate it on the ship. So check in with folks while you’re in transit, as well. — KS</p><figure id="" data-id="1775631c56c0e2f3af86a2211a5fbce5" data-recommend-id="image://1775631c56c0e2f3af86a2211a5fbce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neuras drives the runner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neuras drives the runner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1775631c56c0e2f3af86a2211a5fbce5" data-recommend-id="image://1775631c56c0e2f3af86a2211a5fbce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neuras drives the runner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h71180"><a id=""></a><strong>Check the pantry and use the washroom every day on the runner</strong></h2><p>Another thing to do whenever you’re on the runner is check the pantry and use the washroom. Both of these actions have some benefits, and they won’t take up your travel day. Every time you check the pantry you’ll find some new ingredients to cook with, and the washroom will give you an extra 100 experience each time you use it, which isn’t a lot, but it’s free. You can only do these once a day, but they do refresh multiple times over the course of a days-long trip. So check them both every morning when you wake up on the runner. — KS</p><h2 id="h71181"><a id=""></a><strong>Talk to informants before going into dungeons</strong></h2><p>In almost every town you’ll be able to buy intel from informants. These can give you an edge on big bosses as they’ll let you know things like elemental weaknesses and other strategies. They do cost money, but they’re rarely enough to break the bank. So if someone mentions that an informant might have some helpful intel for you, don’t pass it up. — KS</p><h2 id="h71182"><a id=""></a><strong>Bad weather can offer a greater challenge but extra rewards</strong></h2><p>One thingto keep in mind before you go into a dungeon is that the weather will have a tangible effect on how difficult fights are. Bad weather can fundamentally change your battle strategy, as it will prevent you from getting additional turns when you exploit an enemy weakness, which is typically a key part of your tactics in combat. The trade-off is that you’ll get more rewards for finishing battles. So be mindful of this as you head out on missions. You can talk to a fortune teller in town to tell you what the weather will be like, but you will also meet a character later in the game who can outright change the weather for you. - KS</p><h2 id="h71183"><a id=""></a><strong>Agility is secretly the most important stat in the game</strong></h2><p>You’ll upgrade a lot of stats over the course of <em>Metaphor</em>, but agility/evasion is secretly the most important one. Sure, making your characters a bit more nimble when they need to dodge is standard practice, but dodging attacks is essential in <em>Metaphor </em>because of how it factors into the game’s turn system. <em>Metaphor </em>fights play out in rounds with the player’s team and the enemy team executing a number of actions before it swaps to the opposing side. Managing how many turns you have left is a major part of battles, but finding ways to deny your opponent their own turns is one of the best ways to get the upper hand. If you miss an attack, you’ll lose two turns as opposed to just one, so having characters who can dodge attacks more frequently is one of the easiest ways to end an opponent’s turn and mitigate additional damage, healing, or buffs on their part. — KS</p><h2 id="h71184"><a id=""></a><strong>In the late game, keep your characters on mastered Archetypes to help with the grind</strong></h2><p>As you level up Archetypes, you’ll eventually reach Rank 20, which is considered “mastered,” and can no longer level up. However, you will still receive experience points for your Archetype, you’ll just get an item that can be used to level up other Archetypes each time you hit the end of Rank. One of the most effective ways I was able to level up Archetypes I hadn’t been using all game was not to use those classes I was trying to level up, but to instead farm these items by leveling up the Archetypes I’d already mastered. By the end game, leveling up the classes I needed to in order to unlock some of the later Archetypes became trivial because I just fed them these items. That way I didn’t have to compromise the strategies I’d already mastered just to level up something I wasn’t going to keep using in the long run. — KS</p><figure id="" data-id="088f13db6672e3bd69d2cebb9bf86cea" data-recommend-id="image://088f13db6672e3bd69d2cebb9bf86cea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swings his sword at a goblin enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist swings his sword at a goblin enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="088f13db6672e3bd69d2cebb9bf86cea" data-recommend-id="image://088f13db6672e3bd69d2cebb9bf86cea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swings his sword at a goblin enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h71185"><a id=""></a>Lock on to enemies to execute a dash attack in the overworld combat</h2><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> mixes real-time combat and turn-based battles, but the action side of that equation is admittedly basic. You have an attack button to chain strikes together, a dodge roll, and…that’s about it. That said, it’s easy to forget that your protagonist <em>can</em> execute a pretty fancy dash attack by locking onto a faraway enemy and pressing the attack button. This will almost immediately close the distance between you and your foe, which should help you score a hit or two before the enemy can retaliate.</p><p>This maneuver works with any short-range weapon your protagonist has equipped, so even Mages can charge into a crowd of foes and (hopefully) take care of them all with a few spells. —Timothy Monbleau</p><h2 id="h71186"><a id=""></a>Your main character’s Archetype grants a unique passive skill</h2><p>The classes in <em>Metaphor</em>—called Archetypes in-game—generally feature all the same stat bonuses and spells no matter which party member has them equipped. However, the main character’s Archetype will completely change the way he plays in overworld combat. Each weapon will alter the speed and range of your attacks, and some Archetypes even allow you to snipe enemies from afar.</p><p>Additionally, each Archetype will grant the main character an extra perk that will help out during the real-time combat sections. For example, while the Warrior’s huge greatsword has an exceptionally slow swing, the <strong>Barge Past</strong> passive will prevent enemies from beginning turn-based battles with an advantage. Other Archetypes can benefit your entire party too, such as the Gunner who can heal your party after stunning or defeating enemies in the overworld. — TM</p><h2 id="h71187"><a id=""></a>Use the Mage Archetype in dungeons to refill your party’s MP in dungeons</h2><p>We need to highlight the amazing passive skill the Mage Archetype grants the main character. In short, whenever your main character stuns or defeats enemies in overworld combat as a Mage, your party will heal a small amount of MP. It’s not a lot (usually a couple MP per enemy), but MP recovery in <em>Metaphor</em> is very rare. You’ll find a handful of MP recovery items in the early game, but that stack will deplete quickly unless you’re really optimizing your magic consumption</p><p>Basic enemies can and will respawn in any dungeons that feature multiple “zones” to explore. In other words, it’s usually easy to slap the Mage Archetype on your protagonist and slay a bunch of small fry until your party’s magic reserves are fully topped off. If you don’t want to consume multiple in-game days just to get through a single dungeon, this trick will come in clutch. — TM</p><h2 id="h71188"><a id=""></a>Save your purchases for Idlesday or the 29th of the month</h2><p><em>Metaphor</em> carries over several gameplay mechanics that are synonymous with the <em>Persona</em> series, which even extends to the smaller details of Atlus’ flagship social simulator. Just as you could purchase discounted weapons in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a></span> on Saturdays, “Idlesday” is when almost every shop will discount their goods by 20 percent. All shops throwing sales on Idlesday will appear as red icons on your map.</p><p>Similarly, the 29th of every month in <em>Metaphor</em> will unlock 30 percent discounts at weapon and armor stores. These are harder to plan around than the Idlesday sales, especially if you’re staring down a quest that needs to be completed within a handful of days. That said, several shops feature extra powerful weapons and armor that cost a huge chunk of change to buy, so waiting for a discount can easily save you north of 10,000 money on those bigger purchases.</p><p>If you forget which days are your big sale days, the “Calendar” option on your main menu will specifically list these sales. — TM</p><h2 id="h71189"><a id=""></a>Build your party around Synthesis skills</h2><p>I touched on this when I explained <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-archetype-class-in-metaphor-refantazio-is-all-1851670424?rev=1728649080460&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-archetype-class-in-metaphor-refantazio-is-all-1851670424?rev=1728649080460">which Archetypes are best in <em>Metaphor</em></a></span>, but this is a point that bears repeating. Synthesis skills in <em>Metaphor</em> are your <em>Chrono Trigger</em>-style Double Techs and Triple Techs, in which an Archetype can team up with certain combinations of party members to execute special attacks at the cost of multiple turn icons. These can be hard to take advantage of, since going all-in on a Synergy skill can be less optimal than letting two characters attack individually.</p><p>However, when utilized correctly, Synergy skills can turn the tide of battle overwhelmingly in your favor. In the early game, magic users can only use party-wide attack magic via Synergy skills, which you’ll really want for normal encounters and boss fights alike. Later on, you’ll unlock Synergy skills that can grant huge party buffs or exploit weaknesses that your Archetypes can’t normally take advantage of. Realistically, you probably won’t construct a party in which every character can use every Synergy skill they can. But if you see a Synergy skill that catches your eye, it’s definitely worth the effort to build a team that can specifically use it. — TM</p><figure id="" data-id="6d08d206abfb24d45bd31db03d4cc7bf" data-recommend-id="image://6d08d206abfb24d45bd31db03d4cc7bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maria and the protagonist talk in her bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maria and the protagonist talk in her bedroom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d08d206abfb24d45bd31db03d4cc7bf" data-recommend-id="image://6d08d206abfb24d45bd31db03d4cc7bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maria and the protagonist talk in her bedroom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h71190"><a id=""></a>Use your time to advance follower relationships and complete quests</h2><p>As anyone who has completed an optimized run of a <em>Persona</em> game knows, time is your most valuable resource. <em>Metaphor</em> similarly advances its plot based on the passage of in-game time, and many side quests have rigid deadlines that can pass you by. You’re not <em>obligated</em> to see every corner of <em>Metaphor</em> before you reach the end credits, but if you want to get the most out of your new $70 video game, you probably don’t want to miss anything just because you were careless.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned quests, it’s best to use your afternoons and evenings on pursuits that absolutely require in-game time. Advancing your relationships with your Followers should be a major priority, since every increased rank of their relationships will strengthen your Archetypes and potentially unlock wildly useful perks. Similarly, you can use spare time to increase Royal Virtues that you need to access new quests or gameplay features (such as the option to purify equipment at the cathedral). Meanwhile, using time on activities that increase battle stats like MP is relatively wasteful since you can always level grind for “free” to increase these attributes. — TM</p><h2 id="h71191"><a id=""></a>Don’t bother cooking until you unlock the Speed Cooking ability</h2><p>Cooking in fantasy worlds is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-game-food-real-meat-cooking-cutscene-1851317963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-game-food-real-meat-cooking-cutscene-1851317963">all the rage these days</a></span>, and <em>Metaphor</em> is no exception. You’ll eventually unlock the ability to freely cook up recipes with your party members, but whatever you do, <strong>do not waste your time cooking right away</strong>. On the subject of helpful Follower perks, Maria is one of the first Followers you unlock. By increasing her Follower rank, you’ll unlock the ability “Speed Cooking,” which allows you to cook without consuming any time. This is a <em>huge</em> upgrade!</p><p>Granted, Speed Cooking does have its own limitations. You’re still stuck with preparing one dish before you need to find some other activity to pass the time. Still, if you’re looking to cook every dish in the game, this is the way to do it. — TM</p><h2 id="h71192"><a id=""></a>The autosave in dungeons is generous</h2><p>Look, I’m not going to say that you should save scum your way through <em>Metaphor</em>. That said, even though you can’t save anywhere in dungeons, your game will update your autosave file frequently. For instance, finding treasure chests seems to consistently trigger an autosave.</p><p>I mention this because, occasionally, <em>Metaphor</em> just does not go your way. If an enemy ambushes you, you could find yourself needing to dig deep into your reserve of items and magic just to make it out alive. If you’re <em>really</em> on the back foot, loading your autosave file that’s five minutes old might be more advantageous than forfeiting a ton of resources. — TM</p><figure id="" data-id="7ef35986e24587660cfcbbb9464a7638" data-recommend-id="image://7ef35986e24587660cfcbbb9464a7638" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist squeezes through a hidden passage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist squeezes through a hidden passage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ef35986e24587660cfcbbb9464a7638" data-recommend-id="image://7ef35986e24587660cfcbbb9464a7638" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist squeezes through a hidden passage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h71193"><a id=""></a>Look out for hidden passages in dungeons</h2><p><em>Metaphor</em> isn’t afraid to lean on some classic RPG tropes, and that’s especially true when it comes to its dungeon design. Throughout your adventures—though most specifically in side quest dungeons—you’ll come across rooms hiding hidden treasures with seemingly no entrance. Doors to these rooms won’t have any prompt to use a key, and any stairways you find just don’t lead into these spaces. In situations like these, you most likely need to look for a hole in the wall that you can crawl through. These can be easy to miss since they can look pretty small, but your protagonist is apparently comfortable walking through tight spaces.</p><p>As you might expect, these passageways will <em>not</em> show up on your map until you’ve crawled through them yourself. So if you see a room that you just can’t find a way inside of, check around the perimeter of it and see if there are any spots on your map that look like possible secret entrances. — TM</p><h2 id="h71194"><a id=""></a>Don’t worry, you can fast travel between cities for free</h2><p>With all there is to see and do in <em>Metaphor</em>, you might feel stressed trying to cram in all your objectives in a city before the story whisks you away somewhere else. After all, there are expensive things to buy and Followers to get to know better. You can drive yourself crazy trying to fit all that into a dozen in-game days!</p><p>Fortunately, soon after you progress to the game’s second major hub area, you’ll unlock the ability to freely travel between cities. That’s right, there’s no time cost associated with fast traveling like this, and you can freely engage in any time-consuming activities during the afternoon or evening while you’re away. To be clear, this does not totally alleviate the stress of trying to do everything you can within the constraints of the in-game calendar. But at the very least, it helps. — TM</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The latest video game sales data has been released for the United States (US), and EA Sports College Football 25 is still the best-selling game of 2024. After taking over the top spot from Helldivers 2 in July, College Football 25 has continued to hold that spot, according to the latest sales data from Circana.</p>



<p>The only game that made its debut on the list is Madden 25, which comes in at number 12. What doesn’t appear, however, is Black Myth: Wukong. The game has sold over 20 million copies since its August release, but failed to crack the top 20. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-tops-july-2024-and-year-to-date-best-selling-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one game to drop from the list</a> is Sea of Thieves which sat at 19 last month. Other games on the list did move around like Dragon’s Dogma 2 falling slightly from four to six, and Grand Theft Auto V falling from 15 to 17. In what may surprise some people, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League remains on the list as the 15th-best-selling game in the US in 2024.</p>

<p>The United States (US) video game sales data for August 2024 has been released, and an unsurprising name has found itself at the top of the list. According to the latest data from Circana, Madden 25 was the best-selling game in the US for August 2024.</p>



<p>Making their debut on August’s sales data are Madden 25, Star Wars Outlaws, Visions of Mana, and Gundam Breaker 4. On top of that, three games jumped from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-tops-july-2024-and-year-to-date-best-selling-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outside the top 20 in July</a> to crack the rankings this month. Those games were The Elder Scrolls: Online, Forza Horizon 5, and Gran Turismo 7.</p>



<p>Other things to note is that, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggling to sell 1 million copies</a> overall, Star Wars Outlaws was the third-best seller in terms of dollar sales for August. Also, three of the top four spots are held by EA Sports Football games with Madden 25 at number one, College Football 25 at number two, and the EA Sports MVP Bundle sitting at number four.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five is Elden Ring.</p>



<p>One game to note that was missing in the United States is Black Myth: Wukong. The game, even with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 20 million copies</a>, failed to crack the top 20 in the US.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starship Troopers Extermination - Cinematic Release Date Trailer | Gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>Both games do feature some similarities--like an ongoing galactic war metagame, cosmetics, and cheeky satire--but Helldivers 2 was inspired by Starship Troopers whereas Extermination is a licensed adaptation based on the IP made popular by the 1997 Paul Verhoeven-directed film.</p><p>Another trick up Extermination's sleeve is the sheer amount of carnage that players can experience, as bug bodies can pile up and change the shape of the battlefield. That adds an interesting tactical layer to the experience, as players could find themselves hemmed in by all the corpses or use them as a makeshift barrier.</p><p>The full release of Starship Troopers: Extermination includes a solo campaign starring actor Casper Van Dien reprising his role as Johnny Rico. It's designed to help you learn the ropes as you get acquainted with killing <em>all </em>the bugs you see alongside your fellow Roughnecks. Remember: the only good bug is a dead bug.</p>

            <p>Forbidden Siren - or just Siren, as it was known stateside - is returning to the PS Plus Premium library, raising hopes that more classic games will return courtesy of a new emulator.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Siren has been released on contemporary consoles. Back in 2016, the 2003 horror developed by original Silent Hill director, Keiichiro Toyama, was upscaled and emulated for the PS4. However, as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/10/sonys-porting-ps2-horror-siren-to-its-new-ps5-ps4-emulator">Push Square</a> reports, it was pulled again with several other PS2 games after players complained about poor emulation and PAL/NTSC compatibility problems.</p>

<p>Now it's hoped Siren's return signals Sony has more faith in its refreshed emulation system, which in turn may see hundreds of hitherto unplayable retro games return to Sony consoles courtesy of its digital libraries.</p>
<p>A new selection of classic PS2 games were brought to PS5 as part of PS Plus Premium earlier this year. However, our friends at Digital Foundry remained less than impressed with a "distinct lack of care" about the quality of the emulation.</p><p>"Ultimately, it's hard to accept Sony's efforts when the retro hardware community has collectively solved so many of the issues here - most notably developing a range of genuinely good upscaling methods and filters that you might actually want to use," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-direct-sony-is-wasting-ps5s-emulation-potential">DF's Will wrote at the time</a>.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octobers-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-include-dead-island-2-dino-crisis">October's PlayStation Plus additions for Premium and Extra subscribers have been revealed</a>, and there's a bunch of seasonally appropriate spookiness including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>, Dark Pictures: The Devil Within, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/return-to-monkey-island">Return to Monkey Island</a>.</p>
<p>In total, October brings 10 new PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for Premium and Extra members, and there are a further four Premium-exclusive titles - including the aforementioned cult-classic PS2 horror Siren.</p></div>

<p>"When taking notes, listening, or even just talking, he'd always have the most carefree smile on his face," said Sakurai, reminiscing about his first job interview with Iwata.</p>
<p>"It wasn't forced, either, but a true expression of joy."</p>
<p>Sakurai continued: "Personally speaking, he never told me how I should approach the content of my games. I think he trusted me to handle those decisions how I saw fit."</p>
<p>Iwata contributed prominently to Sakurai's Smash Bros. series, providing code for the initial N64 prototype (the only time he wrote code for one of Sakurai's games) known as Dragon King: The Fighting Game.</p>
<p>"From what others have told me, he <em>really </em>enjoyed his time working on it," said Sakurai.</p>
<p>Iwata also had a hand in the Super Smash Bros. name. Specifically, he picked out the use of "brothers". "His reasoning," Sakurai explained, "was that, even though the characters weren't brothers at all, using the word added the nuance that they weren't simply fighting - they were friends who were settling a little disagreement."</p>
<p>Later, Iwata contributed towards bug fixes for GameCube game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-smash-bros-melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>. "Without his help, I doubt Smash Bros. Melee would have released before the end of 2001," said Sakurai.</p>
<p>He continued: "Of all the people I've known personally, I would say Mr. Iwata was the smartest. 'Smart' can mean a lot of things, but I felt that he used logic rather than instinct to figure out the best way to proceed.</p>
<p>"He was more than simply a programmer - he was a learner, and someone who thought often about psychological topics, like why people think the way they do."</p>
<p>Sakurai concluded: "Mr. Iwata was truly the person who understood me best. He was full of virtue, relentlessly hardworking, committed to service, and a man who changed the game industry."</p>
<p>Sakurai launched his YouTube channel in August 2022 and has since uploaded 268 videos covering all facets of game design.</p>
<p>Perhaps most insightful have been his comments on the Smash Bros. series he's best known for. He detailed, for instance, how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whos-the-best-smash-bros-fighter-they-all-are-sakurai-says">all fighters have an almost equal chance of winning</a> and, in a later video, jokingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-smash-bros-director-so-sorry-to-fans-playing-for-thousands-of-hours">apologised to fans who have played the game for thousands of hours</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the release of Tomb Raider 1 - 3 Remastered earlier this year, Aspyr is now continuing Lara's adventures by also remastering the next three games in the series.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered, as this collection is called, includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a> (1999), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-chronicles">Tomb Raider: Chronicles</a> (2000), and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a> (2003).</p>
<p>As with the original trilogy, each of the next three games will feature improved visuals that bring new life to environments, characters, and artefacts. There will be the option to toggle between classic and modern graphics as well, much like with Tomb Raider 1 - 3 Remastered. You can check out the announcement trailer below.</p>

<p>Angel of Darkness is notorious for being one of the worst reviewed games in the series.</p>
<p>"It's been delayed three times, slapped with a succession of unusually critical previews, and subsequently praised by less than convincing reviews. You could say it's been a rocky road in the build up to the release of the latest Lara Croft adventure," reads the opening paragraph of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-tombraideraod-ps2">Euroagmer's Angel of Darkness review</a>, and that's before we even get to our own thoughts on the game.</p>
<p>But, you know what, I am still incredibly excited to give Angel of Darkness another play when this remastered collection releases.</p>
<p>As for when that will be, Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered is set to arrive on Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009064">PlayStation 5</a>, PS4, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered/9P4ZKKX7V5ZQ">Xbox Series X/S</a>, Xbox One, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525380/Tomb_Raider_IVVI_Remastered/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tomb-raider-ivvi-remastered-0be789">Epic</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_iv_vi_remastered">GOG</a>) on 14th February. That's both Lara's birthday and exactly one year since the debut of Tomb Raider 1 - 3 Remastered. It will retail for £24.99, and pre-orders are available now.</p>
<p>For all you virtual treasure hunters, Aspyr notes trophies and achievements will be available on supported platforms.</p>

<p>As for the original trilogy, on its release earlier this year, we awarded the Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered collection four stars, while acknowledging some of the dated qualities.</p>
<p>"I still love this collection, because it's carefully made and lovingly updated, but also awkward, elbowy, frustrating and prone to leaving me stuck. It's a collection that understands that Tomb Raider was absolutely a game about its controls, and it still should be - even if it doesn't quite know how to deliver on that," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Eurogamer's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered review</a>.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-2-5-update-available-now-adding-three-new-characters/">new update</a> for Honkai: Star Rail is set to <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/pcbranding?utm_source=SNS&amp;utm_medium=CM_YouTube&amp;utm_campaign=YTVer25PGC&amp;is_retargeting=true&amp;c=YTVer25PGC&amp;pid=CM_YouTube&amp;af_adset=CMv25&amp;af_reengagement_window=lifetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release on October 23</a>, taking players on a new journey in the update titled 'Annals of Pinecany's Mappou Age.' As announced by miHoYo, the update will see Trailblazers going to Penacony's Paperfold University, which is one of the most prestigious universities in the region. A new semester is about to begin, alongside anniversary celebrations. In this update, players will get to pull for a new 5-star character named Rappa. Rappa is a Galaxy Ranger and is released in this update in conjunction with the Simulated Universe DLC, which is getting a huge update. All of the new features and news about the upcoming update were announced during the Special Program Livestream.</p>
<p>Rappa is trying to hunt down her nemesis Evil Ninja Osaru, who is hidden somewhere in the Cosmos. To participate in battle, she recites Ninja mantras, which create Dazzling Ninja Seals, and also follows the Way of the Ninja through Ninja scrolls, graffiti, and comics. As part of Rappa's release, players will be invited to participate in the Sound Hunt Ninjustsu Inscription event, where Trailblazers are invited as guests to step in and become band managers for the Dreamlight Anniversary music party.</p>
<p><iframe title="Version 2.6 Trailer — &quot;Annals of Pinecany's Mappou Age&quot; | Honkai: Star Rail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpZFQLWsJlo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the release of Honkai: Star Rail version 2.6, miHoYo released a trailer that is just under three minutes and showcases some of the upcoming features from the update. This update takes place after the adventure in Xianzhou has concluded, and now players will be returning to Penacony to explore the Paperfold University. In addition to Rappa joining the roster of characters, players will be able to try to pull for returning 5-star characters such as Dan Heng, Imbibitor Lunae, Acheron, and Aventurine.</p>
<p>After the release of Swarm Disaster and Gold and Gears, this update will see the third Simulated Universe DLC,&nbsp; where a massive void named the Unknowable Domain has emerged inside the Simulated Universe. At first, it was simulating the Scholars Strife, which was a post-Second Emperor's War event where scholarly factions battled for the Scepter system. In this DLC, players will be charged with the mission of collecting Scepters, building up their power, and enhancing them with Components to make their abilities even stronger.</p>
<p>For those excited to get stuck into the upcoming Honkai: Star Rail update, you won't have to wait much longer. The update is just 12 days away from the time of writing.</p>
<p>Who will you be pulling for in this new Honkai: Star Rail update?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/video-games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-reveal-100-million-games-sold-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>website, Crystal Dynamics celebrates the 28th anniversary of the franchise (which feels like a rather odd milestone to celebrate), as well as revealing that the series as a whole has sold over 100 million units worldwide since its inception.</p>
<p>Per the post, the new collection will include&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</em>, all of which will receive Aspyr's customary glow-up in terms of visuals and controls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announcement-shooting.jpg?itok=QdR3b7HC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announcement-shooting.jpg?itok=lQSxbILY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered&nbsp;</em>collects three more of Lara's classic adventures in February.</figcaption></figure><p>All three games will, according to Crystal Dynamics, include the ability to switch between the classic visuals and the modern overhauls on the fly, as well as a choice between "new modern controls" and classic&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>-style tank controls.</p>
<p>Quality-of-life improvements have also been added across the board, like boss health bars, a Photo Mode, and achievements and trophies on supported platforms (sorry, Nintendo Switch players).</p>
<p>This collection follows on from Aspyr's remasters of the first three&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games, which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-i-ii-iii-remastered">announced back in September last year</a> and released earlier this year.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Aspyr handles porting and remaster work on 2003's&nbsp;<em>Angel of Darkness</em>, which is widely regarded as a drastic misfire among the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>community, albeit one with a huge amount of potential.</p>

<p>This set of remasters is also just one in a long line of classic PS1-era ports handled by Aspyr; others include the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>collection</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-remaster"><em>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles</em></a>&nbsp;and more.</p>
<p><em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525380/Tomb_Raider_IVVI_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009064" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tomb-raider-iv-vi/9P4ZKKX7V5ZQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on February 14th, which means you can pick it up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day">alongside&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day">Date Everything!</a>&nbsp;</em>for a nice change of pace.</p>

In Altus’s <em>Persona</em>-like RPG, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, there are the class options you’d expect from the genre, so you might expect to be told the best possible choice to most enjoy the game. It’s just…it doesn’t work like that here. It’s <em>better</em>.<br></p><p>I’ve been giving tips about video games on the internet ever since I was old enough to type “hellom my name is timoby monbleau XD” on whichever message board my dial-up connection could load first. Over that lifetime of experience, I typically see the same questions appear when it comes to RPGs like <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>: “What are the best characters to use? What are the best builds? Which classes should I pick to make the game easier? Why do I see Mega Man in my dreams?”</p><p>Typically, my advice for questions like these is “experiment and figure out what works for you!” Because, sure, there’s <em>always</em> an optimal build, and there’s <em>always</em> an optimal class to pick. But trying different party configurations is one of the most fun parts of a class system in an RPG, and I firmly believe that it’s okay to do 20 less damage per turn in the name of having more fun with your 70+ hour game.</p><p>I’m here to give this same advice about <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, but not strictly because I value class experimentation more than optimal play. Actually, Metaphor’s classes (called “Archetypes” in-game) are so well-designed that experimentation often <em>is</em> the optimal play. If you’re ready to begin your journey to become king, let’s break down why you shouldn’t worry about whether or not you’re using the “best” class at any given time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bce524b49266aadb2dad0a7f03a9c637" data-recommend-id="image://bce524b49266aadb2dad0a7f03a9c637" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three humanoid characters look bewildered by the ground in front of them as “I?” symbols appear over their heads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three humanoid characters look bewildered by the ground in front of them as “I?” symbols appear over their heads." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bce524b49266aadb2dad0a7f03a9c637" data-recommend-id="image://bce524b49266aadb2dad0a7f03a9c637" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three humanoid characters look bewildered by the ground in front of them as “I?” symbols appear over their heads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’ve played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-free-demo-ps5-xbox-rpg-persona-6-1851657040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-free-demo-ps5-xbox-rpg-persona-6-1851657040">the demo of <em>Metaphor</em></a></span>, you’ll know its battle system is one part <em>Persona</em> and two parts <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>. It uses the “Press Turn” mechanic from the latter series, in which both your party and your enemies can exploit the weaknesses of the other to earn extra moves during a turn. Hitting elemental weaknesses is standard procedure for RPGs, but if an enemy can exploit <em>your</em> weaknesses and chain attacks, the tide of battle will quickly change.</p><p>Your characters’ weaknesses and resistances are determined by their equipped Archetype. And no matter how leveled up a certain Archetype may be, you’re often better off switching to another low-level Archetype if it means gaining a resistance to an enemy’s attacks. Some bosses will even lull you into a false sense of security by having a weakness to an element that one Archetype specializes in, only to use attacks that specifically target that Archetype’s weakness. In cases like these, stubbornly sticking to your established party composition is often more trouble than it’s worth. This is especially true because…</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc1ce6e99b4ada65e26abb0511c71c5b" data-recommend-id="image://cc1ce6e99b4ada65e26abb0511c71c5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A menu screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that shows the character Strohl equipping two skills that his equipped Archetype can’t normally use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that shows the character Strohl equipping two skills that his equipped Archetype can’t normally use." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc1ce6e99b4ada65e26abb0511c71c5b" data-recommend-id="image://cc1ce6e99b4ada65e26abb0511c71c5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A menu screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that shows the character Strohl equipping two skills that his equipped Archetype can’t normally use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’re a fan of games like <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> or <em>Bravely Default</em>, you know that mixing and matching the skills of different classes can create diabolically powerful synergies. In <em>Metaphor</em>, each Archetype can initially inherit one skill from any Archetype the equipping character has leveled up. This does require a one-time fee of the MAG currency, but unlocked skills can be attached to any Archetype that character uses from that point onward. As you advance your Follower relationships (think Social Links from <em>Persona</em>), each of your Archetypes can inherit even more skills.</p><p>With a little planning, this system lets you come up with some incredible combos. For instance, a physical character who bounces between the Warrior and Brawler Archetypes can use skills like Battle Cry and the Heat Up passive to optimize their damage output. Alternatively, you can switch a character to an Archetype that specifically resists a boss’ attacks while still keeping the most important skills you’ll need for the fight. A Mage will struggle against bosses that inflict Piercing damage, but magic users can just switch to the Healer Archetype and keep whichever elemental spell they’d use anyway!</p><p>Even if you don’t want to optimize your party for a specific encounter, inheriting skills lets you fulfill class fantasies that the game might not support out the gate. For instance, I enjoyed equipping Strohl with the Seeker Archetype alongside the Healer’s restorative spells to emulate a Paladin like Cecil from <em>Final Fantasy 4</em>. In a game all about the power of fantasy, it’s fitting that the only limit for your character builds is your imagination. Well, that and the literal limits imposed by the game’s mechanics, but clarifying sentences like this are not how I passed my 9th Grade English class.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="41a31d2b8917bd86556f9bcf69c46a6e" data-recommend-id="image://41a31d2b8917bd86556f9bcf69c46a6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person in heavy armor stands with their arms outstretched as they stand on a carriage being pulled by a horse at high speed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person in heavy armor stands with their arms outstretched as they stand on a carriage being pulled by a horse at high speed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41a31d2b8917bd86556f9bcf69c46a6e" data-recommend-id="image://41a31d2b8917bd86556f9bcf69c46a6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person in heavy armor stands with their arms outstretched as they stand on a carriage being pulled by a horse at high speed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Archetypes do feature a handful of skills that you <em>can’t</em> pass down, but don’t worry, these ones are worth building your team around. Synergy skills in <em>Metaphor</em> are kind of like Double Techs and Triple Techs from <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, which I am legally obligated to call “probably the best game of all time” as per the orders of the All People Of Millennial Age Or Older Coalition™. That is to say, if you have the right combination of Archetypes in your party, characters can use especially powerful skills that cost two or three turn icons to use.</p><p>Even from the earliest moments in the game, Synergy skills can turn arduous encounters into a total breeze. For example, Mages can’t use multi-target skills on their own, but Synergy skills let them use their elemental attacks on every enemy at once. Some Archetypes can learn seriously awesome support skills, such as buffs that affect every party member’s stats with a single cast. The Seeker lineage of Archetypes can even hit weaknesses via Synergy skills that they wouldn’t be able to exploit on their own!</p><p>You do need to be careful with these moves, as consuming multiple turn icons at once can sometimes put you at a disadvantage, compared to just letting each character use their own skills. However, do note that if you hit a weakness with a Synergy skill, it will only consume half turn icons. That is to say, you’ll still get that extra turn with potentially no downside depending on how your party is equipped. If you know a Synergy skill will seriously help you out for any reason, it’s worth the effort to rethink your whole team just to use it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c208b65ab77a2de4a468dd3329b76c2a" data-recommend-id="image://c208b65ab77a2de4a468dd3329b76c2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A menu screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that shows the character Strohl has mastered the Seeker Archetype.

These increases might not individually make a huge impact on your team’s performance, but they do add up as you continue to max out each Archetype.</p><p>If you continue to use an Archetype even after hitting its respective level cap, you’ll instead earn items that boost the EXP of other Archetypes. This is a great mechanic, since you won’t be “punished” for continuing to use your favorite Archetypes. At the same time, the game couldn’t be nudging you any harder to start building different Archetypes once you get to this point. You’re literally wasting those items if you don’t!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fbf7e8e19a8c83ee5e81a00e163e98b" data-recommend-id="image://4fbf7e8e19a8c83ee5e81a00e163e98b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A battle screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that depicts a knight in heavy armor slashing a minotaur with a large sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that depicts a knight in heavy armor slashing a minotaur with a large sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fbf7e8e19a8c83ee5e81a00e163e98b" data-recommend-id="image://4fbf7e8e19a8c83ee5e81a00e163e98b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A battle screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that depicts a knight in heavy armor slashing a minotaur with a large sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Having said all of that, <strong>I’m not going to pretend that every Archetype is completely equal</strong>. You’ll typically need to use a Mage more often than a Merchant, for instance. But even then, Merchants get skills that can debilitate Mimics, and they can learn some valuable passive skills that other Archetypes can inherit. How you’ll fit niches like these into your party is up to you.</p><p>Generally speaking, you’ll often want to run a combination of a physical attacker, magical attacker, healer, and supporter in your party. Because of this, each member of your party should focus on the Archetypes that will help them best serve the role they most often fill. Don’t get me wrong, you’ll still encounter situations where turning your entire party into Healers is your best play. But at the very least, thinking about how your team generally performs will at least save you from needing to level grind because you didn’t realize you’d need someone who can use physical attacks.</p><p>As time goes on, I’m sure the greater video game community will figure out which Archetypes in <em>Metaphor</em> are mathematically the best for each encounter. Heck, that’s the very foundation that speedruns are based on, and I can’t wait to see the first person who can beat this thing in under six hours. But with how much <em>Metaphor</em> continuously rewards you for playing with its class system, the gap between optimal play and casual experimentation isn’t quite as vast as you might think. So get out there, have fun <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-sword-skate-fast-travel-map-1851668165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-sword-skate-fast-travel-map-1851668165">skateboarding on your sword</a></span>, or else the Mega Man in my dreams is going to chastise me about giving ineffective advice on the internet again.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced that&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has been delayed to next year, but I think you'll like the new release date (if not the delay itself).</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>will now launch on February 14th. That's right; what better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than to shack up with a sentient vacuum cleaner or the very air you're breathing?</p>
<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim">announced in July this year</a>, was originally intended to launch later this month. In the new release date trailer released earlier today, Sassy Chap says that while the game is content complete, some work still needs to be done before&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is ready for release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-delayed-reggie.jpg?itok=vM7ulaH- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-delayed-reggie.jpg?itok=Mssz9Bbw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>now lands, appropriately enough, on Valentine's Day.</figcaption></figure><p>That work includes "polish[ing] and perfect[ing] the 3D space", where Sassy Chap says "you're gonna be spending a lot of time".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The QA team is also "hard at work testing thousands of variations and squashing bugs", Sassy Chap says, and there's still a fair way to go until that's done.</p>
<p>As such, Sassy Chap says, due to players' overwhelming support and "benevolent publishers" Team17 (although I'm sure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-employees-allege-harassment-terrible-pay-and-more">some staff would disagree with that assessment</a>), a delay was put into place in order to "avoid crunch".</p>
<p>The devs are promising more information as&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>nears completion, so it shouldn't be too much longer until we hear more about the game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, well, the clue's in the name; it's a dating sim that will allow you to date...well, not quite everything, but a lot of different potential romantic partners themed around inanimate objects and even abstract concepts.</p>
<p>Dateable characters include your bed, your smoke alarm, your vacuum cleaner, and, uh, the concept of an overwhelming sense of existential dread. I can't say I've ever wanted to romance that particular crippling fear, but there we are.</p>
<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on February 14th.</p>

            <p>Fire up the Steam page for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>, one of my favourite space sims, and you will see 28 pieces of DLC, ranging from free character portraits to £35 expansion passes that span a bunch of species and story packs. Stablemate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-iv">Europa Universalis 4</a> has 37 DLC packs under its banner, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities Skylines</a> is streets ahead with a whopping 62. Paradox Interactive have long built their core game business around putative forever-projects that trail an enormous mantle of paid expansions. It's seemingly this, as much as their institutional expertise with 4X, that justifies their commitment to grand strategy games, whose worlds and systems can be fleshed out for literal decades. </p><!--more-->
<p>One drawback of this approach is that Paradox may at least <em>appear</em> to be deliberately withholding features in order to sell expansions down the road. It's certainly a fair conclusion to make when said DLC expansions are later <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-iv-is-folding-four-of-its-dozens-of-dlcs-into-the-base-game">folded back into the base game</a>, which implies that they should have been there to start with. Pretty much every Paradox game I know of has a vociferous group of players who accuse the company of releasing games that must be "fixed with paid DLC". This is especially true of sequels, which inevitably look skinny and malnourished next to their much-expanded and updated predecessors. At the company's Media Day last week, I asked deputy CEO Mathias Lilja how exactly the company assign resources between main game and DLC development, and how they address the perception of "fixing with DLC" - especially given their more recent experiments with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-experimenting-with-a-subscription-service-to-play-europa-universalis-iv-and-its-dlc">subscription models</a>, which arguably bake in the practice of holding material back.</p>
<p>Lilja began by making what struck me as a slightly unhelpful comparison with painting, designed, I think, to illustrate that game development is a messy, open-ended process. "I think that's one of the things that we're trying to do - to address that [perception]," he said. "The reason that our business is sustainable is that we launch a game, that is good enough. But, like a painting - when is a painting done? When you stop painting it, I guess. Game development is quite a lot the same." </p>
<p>More intelligibly, Lilja suggested that Paradox's developers have long had a kind of unspoken agreement with dedicated players that they will build a business around DLC without taking the piss. "That's the deal we have with our fans - we will continue to develop these games as long as you play it, and we can sell DLC. That's our sustainable business, and that's how we get these games that live for - [in the case of] Europa Universalis 4, it's about 10 years now. It's now called Early Access, but we did that earlier and we didn't call it that. We developed as far as we thought would [make for] a good game. And if we have fans that want it, they will play it, and then we can continue to build on it." </p><p>Lilja thinks that "expectations are higher" today with regard to how much goes into the base game - a continuation of sentiments from earlier in the interview about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">how "accepting" players are that technical problems will be fixed after launch</a>. But he still thinks Paradox are walking the line well enough. "If you look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>, it was a really solid game at launch and it now has DLC," he said. "But we also offer another subscription model, so people can come in and at least try content without having to invest as heavily. And some stay in the subscription model, some convert to DLC, when they've had a chance to feel around. So we try to find ways for people to not have to say 'yes, all in' or 'no, never' but to find a middle ground."</p>
<p>Lilja also shared a little about how exactly Paradox first-party divide their resources between developing for the base game and for post-release expansions, including some thoughts on when and where the developers may have gotten the ratio wrong. "We build games of systems - it's a system of systems, that's mostly what our games are," he said. "Not all systems are created equal. So the question is, what systems are core to this game. The experience of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron 4</a> - what is the most important system to have fully fleshed-out to make it a good game, that has to be there? But maybe we don't do everything because again, we would never be done." </p>
<p>"When we fail, it looks something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a>," he went on. "People wanted more warfare. It existed in the game, but it was barebones - you could go to war, but maybe that was not the [focus]. So you had other things, diplomacy, economics, building your country, whatever. But people wanted the warfare. So there we maybe missed it a bit. Maybe we should have focused on that, because that was part of the fantasy that people wanted in this game." Paradox are still "catching up" with Victoria 3, he added. </p>
<p>What does this division of labour and resources translate to in hard numbers, I asked? How do Paradox allocate time between the launch game and post-release development? It's obviously quite a broad question - different projects have different ins and outs, and Lilja didn't give me a very granular answer. But he did estimate that, right now, a Paradox grand strategy game might take around five years to make, versus around a year for a larger paid expansion. </p><p>"Five years to make, depending on the length of the concept phase, which can be quite long as well, and then a DLC takes maybe a year," he said. "So it could be five to one, for the base game versus the first big DLC expansion. We can do smaller content, but it's very clear that people prefer the bigger DLCs. That's what people like - the smaller content pieces are maybe nice to have, but it's the bigger pieces."</p>
<p>The picture is always shifting, however. Echoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-says-almost-all-games-should-cost-more-at-a-base-level-because-they-cost-so-much-to-make">other industry executives</a>, Lilja observed that development costs have gone up dramatically over the past decade. "Generally speaking, the requirements on games, have grown over time," he noted. "People get accustomed to a certain standard, I guess. And they expect that or better. So team sizes over time have grown quite a lot. I think generally that is also part of the problem, right now in the games industry, that teams are huge. Our teams aren't huge, but they're way bigger now than they were a couple of years ago, or 10 years ago. It's a big difference." </p>
<p>Paradox's team sizes have expanded partly because they want their grand strategy games to reach players who might find grand strategy absolutely impenetrable. "We want our games to be more accessible, so we need to focus more on that than just the core features - we need to build out around these things," Lilja said. "But it also means that every piece of content we make becomes more expensive." </p>
<p>The unspoken context here, of course, is that Paradox have been doing a lot of cost-cutting over the past two years, closing studios, cancelling games and laying people off. This seemingly has less to do with the publisher's tentpole grand strategy business than with their outside bets on new genres, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">XCOM-style turn-based tactics games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">life sims</a>. But Paradox's grand strategy forever-games haven't all escaped the guillotine: the publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradoxs-grand-strategy-star-trek-infinite-will-receive-no-further-updates">stopped supporting updates</a> for Nimble Giant's unfortunately titled Star Trek: Infinite the year after launch.</p><p>I spoke to Paradox's chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus after my chat with Lilja. He had less patience for the charge of "fixing games with DLC", arguing that Paradox have a decent track record for overhauling and adding to their games at no further cost. "That's the negative way of looking at it," he told me. "This game will live for a long time and even if I don't buy anything, it's going to keep getting better, right? That's what we're after." </p>
<p>Fåhraeus did caveat that Paradox have gotten a little "lost" recently with regard to their paid DLC strategy. But he also told me that you can't please everyone. "Since this is subjective, there will always be people who think that every game is incomplete, when we release it, and that it needs more of something," he said. "So there's no getting around that, but what we can do is do our utmost to ensure that it feels like a really good game, that the quality is high and that it meets player expectations. What do players expect? Quality."</p>
<p>This news piece is the fourth in what I would have branded the Paradox Files, if the conversations were slightly juicier, or if I had slightly less shame. Elsewhen at the same event, Lilja <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">aired his current expectations for the much-delayed and shuffled-around Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which increasingly feels like it should be called something else. He and Fåhraeus also talked about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">what went wrong with Life By You, and why they're still keen to publish a Paradox life sim</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, Bandai Namco’s latest 3D fighter, is now available on all platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. One of the game’s new features is Episode Battles, where players experience the iconic canon storyline of popular anime series and explore alternative futures depending on their choices. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles Guide will explore all branching storylines for Goku in the Saiyan Saga.</p>



<p>To explore these new paths in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode battles, players must achieve specific goals during their battles. Additionally, you receive 100,000 Zeni and a bunch of XP every time you complete a branching episode in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles. In this guide, we will explore all the different paths you can take for Goku in the Saiyan Saga and what conditions you must meet to get these paths.</p>



<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-attack-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Attack Guide</a></p>



<h2 id="h-canon-story-line">Canon Story Line</h2>



<p>To explore the canon storyline for Goku, players must make choices that match the ones made in the anime. The first choice arrives right after Raditz kidnaps Gohan, and Piccolo offers to help Goku. Here, you must accept Piccolo’s help to follow the original story. This path will lead to Goku and Piccolo confronting Raditz. If you are unable to defeat him before Piccolo intervenes, the story will follow the original events, with Goku sacrificing himself to get rid of Raditz. The last battles will be between Nappa and Vegeta, and these will go down as they did in the anime.</p>

<h2 id="h-pushing-the-limit">Pushing the Limit</h2>



<p>This is the first branching path for Goku in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles. To follow this path, you must still accept Piccolo’s help fighting against Raditz. However, you must defeat Raditz as Goku before Piccolo intervenes to open the alternate route. On this path, Goku survives his battle with Raditz and trains with the Z Warriors ahead of Nappa and Vegeta’s arrival. This is all you need to do to explore the branching path.</p>



<p><strong>Spoilers ahead in the following paragraphs for players who want to explore this path independently. Skip to <em>Side by Side</em> to learn about the next path in Goku’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles.</strong></p>



<p>Once they arrive, Goku can overturn another iconic canon event and save Yamcha from the Saibamen ambush. The following events are similar to the canon story. However, the ending is a bit different. The Saiyan invaders beat Goku, and the Z-Warriors must enter the battle. Chiatzou looks for a Sensu Bean to heal Goku.</p>

<h3 id="h-enraged-goku">Enraged Goku</h3>



<p>Goku manages to heal with that Sensu Bean. However, it is too late as most of the Z Warriors are defeated, and Piccolo falls in battle against Great Ape Vegeta. Looking at the state of his friends, Goku is enraged and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He destroys the fake moon and completely demolishes Vegeta; however, he still allows him to escape Earth.</p>



<p>Goku then travels to Namek to revive his friends with the Namekian Dragon Balls but is faced with Frieze’s Forces. He defeats some of them only to realise that Frieza has already been killed, and the deed was done by Vegeta, who has also learned the Super Saiyan transformation. Both characters then duke it out one last time in their Super Saiyan forms; Goku wins the battle and lets Vegeta survive, stating that he wants to fight him again.</p>

<p>This is the other alternate path in Goku’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles. To follow this path, you must reject Piccolo’s help after Gohan is kidnapped and confront Raditz with the Turtle School. You must quickly bring Raditz’s health down in this battle before Krillin intervenes.</p>



<p>This is the only task you need to complete to explore this path; however, if you don’t bring Raditz’s health down in time, you will be returned to the canon storyline. If you manage to bring his health down, Raditz is defeated again, Goku survives the battle, and the alternate path is opened.</p>



<p><strong>Again, spoilers are ahead for players who want to explore this section independently.</strong></p>



<p>Goku trains with the Z-Warriors and understands the value of teamwork, while Piccolo proposes to train Gohan in the meantime, seeing the kid’s immense potential. Vegeta and Nappa arrive on Earth as they do in the canon storyline but are faced with Rivals who have turned into Allies: Goku, Piccolo, and Tien. The trio somehow manages to bring Vegeta and Nappa down, but Goku dies in the process; however, his last wish is to let Vegeta escape.</p>

<p>Some time passes by, and the Earth’s Dragon Balls revive Goku. Surprisingly, Vegeta returns to Earth, demanding the Dragon Balls make himself immortal to fight against Frieza. Goku denies his request, and Vegeta offers a counteroffer that no one would expect. He asks to team up with Goku to fight against Frieza.</p>



<p>Goku and Vegeta start training together, waiting for Frieza’s arrival on Earth instead of Namek. They then take on the entire Ginyu force. Here, another unique event occurs, where Captain Ginyu takes over Vegeta’s body instead of Goku’s, which is a hilarious exchange between the characters.</p>

<p>Vegeta recovered his body and, along with Goku, took the battle to Frieza. Frieza boasts multiple transformations and proves himself to be a formidable opponent for the duo. However, Vegeta and Goku overcame him with teamwork and the all-mighty Spirit Bomb. Right after Frieza is defeated, Goku and Vegeta go their separate ways, vowing to fight each other again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-becomes-million-seller-on-launch-day/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio has just launched<span>, and Atlus has already&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/stud_zero/status/1844665951431930116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that</a> its cumulative global sales have surpassed one million units. Even <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2679460/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, it's making record numbers compared to the Persona franchise when it comes to concurrent users. It's certainly a great result for a new IP, even though the Persona team had many</span>&nbsp;long-standing fans who were looking forward to playing this new title.</p>
<p>In this fantasy world, the protagonist (Will) travels with his fairy companion, Gallica, to lift the curse from the kingdom's lost prince. Players may awaken the magical "Archetype" powers that lie dormant within their character's heart; awakening to an Archetype unlocks the power to channel and combine the abilities of unique professions. Throughout the adventure, they will strengthen their bonds and level up their party to defeat mighty foes and discover the true nature of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In Wccftech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, Kai Tatsumoto rated Metaphor: ReFantazio 9/10, although he noted it's essentially Persona 6 in all but name:</p>
<p><em>No matter how much I engaged with the core fundamentals of Metaphor: ReFantazio, I couldn’t escape the feeling that this was largely Persona 6 by another name rather than some new IP that could stand on its own merits. That isn’t to say that Hashino’s team hasn’t created another stylish JRPG with broad appeal, but the premise that Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand-new fantasy is dead. If the Persona series left you wanting more, Metaphor: ReFantazio certainly is a tale worth experiencing for yourself.</em></p>
<p>The Atlus team feels a bit different, however. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoG2zH-Pl6o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, Director Katsura Hashino explained how this new game is a departure from the Persona franchise:</p>
<p><em>We really had ideas that we wanted to put in this game that we couldn't put into other games. For example, the Persona series is set in the real world. That means the story we want to tell becomes slightly limited to the place that we're building the story within.</em></p>
<p><em>It also means it's a little bit easier for us to work with because we know the place, we have that baseline to work from. But once again, it does limit our options. Whereas in an entirely new fantasy world that we create, we have the freedom to explore all these ideas and things that we weren't able to do in the past. In the Persona series, the story itself is based around a single location where all the characters hang out. The world that they're living in doesn't change, but the way that they perceive it changes.&nbsp; </em><em>That's one of the major parts of the Persona series that's really interesting in its own way. </em></p>
<p><em>But in Metaphor: ReFantazio, we don't really have that one place where everybody is based out of. We don't have that single location to work with. In a way, we do have one country that the characters are traveling through, so they do have that connection to a country instead of a specific place. But the scale is much larger, so you get the chance to see a broader perspective.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-to-make-games-playable-and-purchasable-via-android-app-in-november.1007145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that come November, you'll be able to buy and play Xbox games directly within the Android app thanks to a recent court ruling against Android owner Google.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Xbox president Sarah Bond says that a recent court decision ruling that Google <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store">must open up its Play Store</a> to third-party apps will "allow more choice and flexibility".</p>
<p>The ruling came as part of a lawsuit brought by Epic against Google, with the former alleging that the latter's dominance of the mobile sphere (alongside that of Apple, against whom Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-apple-lawsuit-escalates-as-developer-accounts-are-terminated">also brought a lawsuit</a>) constitutes an illegal monopoly, a position with which the court clearly agreed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-app-android-purchases-store.jpg?itok=1dDkHXC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-app-android-purchases-store.jpg?itok=lBk_0oKE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to buy games directly from the Xbox app.</figcaption></figure><p>Bond says the decision to incorporate purchases directly into the Xbox Android app is born of Xbox's mission to "allow more players to play on more devices".</p>
<p>Right now, there's no news on whether or not this will be possible on the Apple App Store version of the app; Bond only mentions Android, and since Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24158911/apple-v-epic-evidentiary-hearing-app-store-payments" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wasn't ordered by courts</a> to open up its App Store to third-party storefronts, the iOS situation is unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>
<p>The Epic-Google situation began back in 2020, when Epic decided to allow players to purchase&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s V-Bucks currency on mobile using a proprietary payment method instead of going through Apple and Google's respective payment processes.</p>
<p>This prompted both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store">Google</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines">Apple</a> to remove the game from their mobile storefronts, a decision over which Epic quickly sued both companies, hoping to prove that Google and Apple's mobile dominance constituted a duopoly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-games-store-mobile.jpg?itok=yW-O6qeM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-games-store-mobile.jpg?itok=Qtm86sb5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft is benefiting from a court decision made in Epic's favor.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, close to when Epic first filed both of its lawsuits, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-files-statement-in-support-of-epic-against-apple">filed a statement in favor</a> of the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>developer, although said statement was in support of an injunction adjacent to the case rather than the main lawsuit itself.</p>
<p>It looks like Epic has arguably repaid Microsoft in kind for that support today, whether it intended to or not. You'll be able to buy and play Xbox games directly through the Xbox Android app starting in November this year, although we don't have a concrete date for that change yet.</p>

    <p><span>Journey back to Penacony and visit the prestigious Paperfold University.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Annals of Pinecany’s Mappou Age,” will launch on October 23, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-920793"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update will take Trailblazers to Penacony’s prestigious Paperfold University, which is buzzing with excitement for a new semester and its anniversary celebrations. Players will also get their hands on the newest 5-star character, Rappa, a daring Galaxy Ranger. On top of that, the highly anticipated Simulated Universe DLC will also receive a massive and thrilling update.</p><p>As the recent Xianzhou adventure concludes, players will journey back to Penacony and visit its Paperfold University, a prestigious cosmic institution bustling with activity as it prepares for a new semester and its anniversary celebrations. The campus is alive with clubs recruiting new members, and music performances fill the air. For this special occasion, the university is hosting an exclusive academic seminar, and as notable figures and stakeholders in Penacony, the crew of the Astral Express has been invited as distinguished guests to partake in the festivities. In the Version 2.6 Trailblaze Continuance mission, Banana Outrage: Battles Without Ninja and Humanity, the Trailblazer will step into Paperfold University as an auditing student, fully immersing in the joys of campus life. Alongside peers like March 7th and Dan Heng, Trailblazers will not only delve into the rigors of academic pursuits but also cultivate meaningful relationships, enriching this one-of-a-kind scholastic adventure.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_920794"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As Trailblazers immerse themselves in campus life, they’ll be able to meet a powerful new 5-star ally—Rappa, a courageous and unique character ready to join the battlefield. Rappa calls herself a ninja, attributing everything to the art of “ninjutsu.” Rappa recites ninja mantras, creates Dazzling Ninja Seals, and follows the Way of the Ninja through ninja scrolls, blending rap, graffiti, and comics. With strict self-discipline, she travels the stars upholding justice. As a Galaxy Ranger, Rappa is on a relentless mission to hunt down her nemesis, Evil Ninja Osaru, across the Cosmos. In battle, after unleashing her Ultimate, she will enter Sealform and unleash Ningu: Demonbane Petalblade in a special first-person view. During the attacks of Ningu: Demonbane Petalblade, Rappa is able to deal damage to groups of enemies efficiently, and can even reduce the Toughness of enemies without Imaginary Weakness. This version will bring a wave of exciting events. In “Sound Hunt Ninjutsu Inscription,” Trailblazers will be invited as a guest and step in as the band manager for the Dreamlight Anniversary music party, teaming up with Rappa and leading the band’s electrifying performances in the music party.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>That aside, the limited 5-star characters Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae, Acheron, and Aventurine will make their return to the first and second halves of the Version 2.6 warp event, respectively. Their formidable support ensures they will remain powerful allies in your future adventures.</p><p>Meanwhile, Version 2.6 will introduce the much-anticipated third Simulated Universe DLC, following Swarm Disaster and Gold and Gears. This time, a massive void, the Unknowable Domain, has emerged within the Simulated Universe. It was initially simulating the Scholars’ Strife, a post-Second Emperor’s War event where scholarly factions battled for control of Emperor Rubert II’s legacy—the Scepter system. The Scepter, a cluster of inorganic bionic neurons, served as Rubert II’s external thinking unit with immense processing power. In this Simulated Universe update, Trailblazers will start by collecting Scepters and enhancing them with Components to strengthen their abilities. As the game progresses, players can strategically combine multiple Scepters and Components to unlock powerful synergies, eventually defeating a formidable final foe.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,145 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

		<p>It’s definitely been feeling chillier this past few days, which is handy if you needed an excuse to turn your beefy gaming PC on to heat up the room a bit. My gaming has generally been much lower-powered, with Super Mario Party Jamboree on the go for review, and a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/mario-luigi-brothership-preview/">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, but I did enjoy a little time with Until Dawn over the weekend, and I might fire up the PC this coming weekend for something a little toastier.</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has continued to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, delivering our review at the start of the week, “but I’ll just add this,” he says. “If there’s any scousers out there wondering where their representation was, whe ghot yhahhh!”</p>

<p>Working on a very different review has been <strong>Steve</strong>, whose week has been all about Silent Hill 2, “which is a superb updating of a true classic.” Expect to actually see our review of it sometime soon, but he’s also checked out a few early demos ahead of the next Steam Next Fest, which is coming next week… next.</p>
<p>After deciding that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/undisputed-review/">Undisputed</a> wasn’t enough pugilistic fun, <strong>Aran’s</strong> treated himself to Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. He’s also been playing Final Fantasy XVI and is at the stage where he’s done most of the hunts and is getting closer to the end of the game’s story.</p>


<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been on his e-bike, as it were, for our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/parcel-corps-review/">Parcel Corps</a>. He’s also slipped back into Cyberpunk 2077. “I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve peeled back enough layers of Night City to realise I should be focusing on the main story and I’m determined to see the credits roll by the end of 2024. That would mean I’ve put a cross through Skyrim, New Vegas, and Cyberpunk – the 3 biggest games on my backlog.”</p>
<p>And then he’s loaded up Jade Empire on Steam Deck for something rather different.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> also has been playing the talking simulator that is the opening hours of Cyberpunk 2077 – “OMG SHUT UP AND LET ME PLAY THE F-ING GAME. WHY DO YOU TALK SO MUCH. OH YAY ANOTHER RIDE IN A CAR WHILE SOMEONE TALKS AT ME!” – and I don’t think he’ll be going back anytime soon. So it’s been Destiny 2 and our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">review of Until Dawn</a> for the rest of the week.</p>

<p>You just can’t keep <strong>Ade</strong> away from those sea shanties, as he’s been sailing the seas of Skull and Bones once again. “Season 3 has proven something of a game changer, with the game finally getting out of the way of itself and letting player’s play. If Ubisoft had launched with the game in this form it may have benefited from a more positive reception. Still, glad they are sticking with it.”</p>
<p>He’s also been helping out his son with Mario Odyssey as Cappy, and started a playthrough of Until Dawn with his partner.</p>
<p>Rounding out the week, <strong>Dom</strong> has had his usual bouts of Overwatch 2, but complimented that PvP staple with his own first few steps into the world of Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-upgrading-rtx3060-to-4070/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Upgrading from the base model to the PlayStation 5 Pro feels like upgrading from an RTX 3060 or 3060 Ti to an RTX 4070 GPU, allowing users to access visual features that were previously not available.</p>
<p>In a video shared recently on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">YouTube</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry talked about the upcoming mid-generation system from Sony after having had the chance to go hands-on with it, saying that in games like F1 24, where the developer put plenty of effort into the PS5 Pro update, upgrading from the base model feels indeed like upgrading the GPU in a gaming system. Even in other scenarios where the visual improvements aren't as massive, the PlayStation 5 Pro is definitely worth it for those players who play demanding console games in Performance Mode and wish to experience much better visual quality. On the other hand, the system doesn't offer a whole lot in terms of visual improvements over the base model's Quality mode, whose image quality is still fine at 4K resolution and standard viewing distance, although the system's better ray tracing capabilities could be enticing even for this category of players as well.</p>
<p>As such, even at its high price, the PlayStation 5 Pro can definitely be worth it. While there is an argument to be made about the console's price versus the price of a gaming PC with similar specs, the Sony console offers a completely hassle-free experience compared to a PC.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also highlighted how important the introduction of the PlayStation 5 Pro's PSSR upscaler is. The upscaler not only makes the system a more significant upgrade than what the specs suggest, but it can also be used to improve the visual quality of ray tracing, although not in the same way as DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction does, as Sony's upscaler cannot separate all inputs from the final color value of a scene like the NVIDIA technology does.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Hands-On Verdict: Is The Upgrade Worth The Price?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zvZloAl3kE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't take much longer for players to see for themselves if the PlayStation 5 Pro is a worthy upgrade over the base model. The console launches in less than a month, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>
