I take up the challenge and…I lose the thread. Rigid video game structures and absurd pricing models snap me out of it. I’m not in space. I’m playing a much-hyped yet poorly executed RPG that I just pumped seven bucks into for 20 minutes of immersion-breaking gameplay. I do love a big open world to explore. And I do love science fiction. But is this the future of this game? I certainly hope not. </p><p>Following a round of much-needed updates, including the expansive inclusion of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-creations-mods-best-immersive-1851536437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-creations-mods-best-immersive-1851536437">Creations suite of mods</a></span> ready to download for free or at a premium, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em></a></span> is moving on from what originally shipped on September 4, 2023.

It isn’t just a mod: There’s story content and voice acting. It’s a quest, it’s <em>content</em>, for the price of seven bucks. </p><p>So I’m going to treat this quest and its related faction with the seriousness that anyone should when being asked for money, and give it a solid review.</p><figure id="" data-id="0774f62ceb42c5ddb3fa5760cbd38c13" data-recommend-id="image://0774f62ceb42c5ddb3fa5760cbd38c13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman talks to the player character in Starfield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman talks to the player character in Starfield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0774f62ceb42c5ddb3fa5760cbd38c13" data-recommend-id="image://0774f62ceb42c5ddb3fa5760cbd38c13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman talks to the player character in Starfield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h17131"><a id=""></a>It all starts with the Trackers’ Alliance</h2><p>If you’ve played <em>Starfield</em> at all in recent weeks, you’ve undoubtedly run into a new NPC who, like nearly all Bethesda NPCs for the last two decades, is here to offer you some work. She, like most job-givers in <em>Starfield</em>, wants you to play freelance cop and go hunt down people with bounties on their heads. After chatting with her, you’ll fast-travel-menu-maze yourself to Akila City where you’ll chat with some other bounty hunters, including the either clever or cringe-worthy “No. 1,” who sometimes calls themself “no one.” </p><p>Yes. That is the character’s name. It makes me imagine a backstory in which they come up with that name while listening to some godforsaken emo music as they paint their nails black, softly whispering to themselves that <em>no one understands them</em> before dramatically sighing. Hey, it’s a Bethesda game, headcanoning stuff is almost required (and at least that’s free…<em>for now</em>).</p><figure id="" data-id="82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-recommend-id="image://82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-recommend-id="image://82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Even if you choose not to shell out seven bucks for the new quest, called “The Vulture,” the Trackers’ Alliance grants you two things: A somewhat interesting, free quest that goes unresolved, and the ability to hunt down random NPCs who have bounties on their heads (where you can either take ‘em in or just murder them). </p><p>That free quest, titled “The Starjacker,” sends you out into the stars to hunt down a wanted man named Hanibal. The premise ain’t bad, and while it does boil down to just shooting your way through some random place in space, this bounty hunting concept is a decent way to make use of <em>Starfield</em>’s enormous galaxy.</p><p>Unfortunately there’s not a whole lot of mystery to this. You’ll interrogate a dude and then be given a quest marker to follow before blasting your way through a zero-grav space station. Then you’ll find out Hanibal ain’t on this space station. Your bounty is somewhere out there in the seeming endlessness of space and you’ve got no leads. </p><p>While what you do in this quest isn’t anything special (shoot, shoot, shoot, Starborn power!, shoot, shoot, shoot), the way it leaves you with this unresolved task and no leads to go on in this massive space simulation is kind of neat, and it interrupts the flow of <em>Starfield</em>’s check-list style questing. It makes <em>Starfield</em>’s galaxy <em>feel</em> large as you’re left to imagine where in this 1,000-plus-planet sector of space this guy might be hiding. </p><p>But, then, that’s it. Well, until you fork over seven bucks and buy “The Vulture.” And much like “The Starjacker,” there are some neat ideas here. Hints of promise of how this massive galaxy could be used for interesting quests. Unfortunately, spending seven bucks just gives you more of that hollow potential. </p><h2 id="h17132"><a id=""></a>A lifeless quest fit for a vulture’s feast</h2><p>The quest has you hunting down a colony war vet, the titular Vulture, who has turned his back on the Freestar Collective. This errand will send you to two locations: a planet in the Narion system and the Paradiso resort. (If you used that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-mod-quest-paradiso-kill-npc-essential-1851540229&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-mod-quest-paradiso-kill-npc-essential-1851540229">super cool mod I told you about</a></span> recently and made everyone at Paradiso mad at you, this quest is probably broken now. Sorry.) </p><figure id="" data-id="b8271dd19eb2e45ebe75d3be0fb217d4" data-recommend-id="image://b8271dd19eb2e45ebe75d3be0fb217d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bounty hunter tracker board shows two targets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bounty hunter tracker board shows two targets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8271dd19eb2e45ebe75d3be0fb217d4" data-recommend-id="image://b8271dd19eb2e45ebe75d3be0fb217d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bounty hunter tracker board shows two targets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every “challenge” in this quest, which I finished in about 20 minutes (more powerful builds, I suspect, could clear this in half that time, if not less), just consists of mowing people down. But at least it tries to inject some personality into its very brief runtime.</p><p>After arriving in the Narion system to find the Vulture, you’ll have a chat with a very scared dude who warns you that your quest to track down the assassin has put you “in hot water.” As if to prove the point, this poor sap’s warning is cut off mid-sentence as he’s offed by a shot from the Vulture’s sniper rifle. You’ll then attempt to chase the killer down, which, wouldn’t you know it, involves taking out a bunch of randos in your path.</p><p>Your pursuit will then take you to the resort of Paradiso. There, I accidentally agreed to handle the lost-and-found for the concierge before realizing I needed to go to an upper floor to check out the Vulture’s suite. There’s a neat moment in which, after searching his room, the Vulture, perched somewhere off in the distance, shoots out a window to try and get to you. As you dash out in pursuit, you’ll have to engage in a hallway firefight. </p><p>For a split second, there’s a level of urgency and activity in a place that’s otherwise a static, virtual diorama of a resort. That sort of action is something that <em>Starfield</em> could use more of. Exchanging fire in a place not meant for violence gave me some <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> vibes, and made Paradiso feel like a real place connected to this grander galaxy with competing interests that boil over into violence. All that’s to say, yes, give me a cool shootout in this bougie hellscape. </p><p>But once I got down to the ground floor, that immersion ended. I walked through the lobby of NPCs just standing around, saying random bullshit, undisturbed by the fact that loud-ass gunfire was happening two floors above them just a moment ago. I was once again reminded of how rigid and lifeless <em>Starfield</em>’s environments were. </p><figure id="" data-id="cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-recommend-id="image://cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-recommend-id="image://cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And when I spotted the Vulture up in his sniper’s nest, people around me seemed to care less that I, a fully armed lunatic of a woman, was firing her gun at some random point in the distance. No one went running. No security guards urged me to drop my weapon. Nobody batted an eye as a gunfight raged on in this resort. </p><p><em>Starfield</em> has always sort of been on rails. But “The Vulture” explodes the sheer level of lifelessness coded into this game. I get it, it’s no immersive sim. Still, how am I supposed to roleplay as a star-hopping bounty hunter, pursuing her targets in the middle of public environments and getting into high-stakes gunfights, when the world barely reacts to these events? </p><p>And as far as the actual challenge? I love a good sniper battle. But the game literally gave me Starborn powers that let me suspend enemies in mid-air, go invisible, and slow down time. I’m virtually a god in this allegedly grounded, realistic science-fiction world, and not in a cool way. </p><p>But “the Vulture” doesn’t just suck as a quest. And it doesn’t just suck as an absurdly priced DLC. It, and the Trackers’ Alliance, expose the deep flaws inherent in <em>Starfield</em> that a mere faction quest isn’t going to heal. <em>Starfield</em> needs more than simple content injected into its massive canvas. It needs to consider how its canvas helps or hurts otherwise relatively decent premises like hunting down a renegade war vet hiding in a populated area. </p><figure id="" data-id="074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-recommend-id="image://074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Note: clip has been sped up for brevity.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-recommend-id="image://074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h17133"><a id=""></a><em>Starfield</em> remains a rigid, clunky experience</h2><p>Let’s rewind to the “Starjacker” quest for a second. In this quest, you’re asked to go hunt down this Hanibal guy, and a member of the Trackers’ Alliance tags along, keeping an eye on you and making sure you’re up to snuff for this kind of work. </p><p>You’re given a random ship to go on this job which, as soon as you sit down in the cockpit chair, becomes your “home” ship, thus warping in all of your crew and followers. Here I was trying to immerse myself in the premise of this bounty hunter faction quest, yet the second I sit down, Sarah pipes up with “I have something for you,” and as I get up, I’m once again stuck inside the cockpit because I can’t move past Sam’s damn daughter as she turns to talk to me again about the same damn books she’s reading. </p><p>All of this, combined with the absolutely lifeless reactions of the NPCs in “The Vulture,” make the experience of <em>Starfield</em> itself feel like a kitbashed collection of mods. There’s no <em>authorship</em>, no expression of a vision, no material worth investing your time in. It’s just rigid nonsense with clunkily intersecting systems.</p><p>If <em>Starfield</em> is to grow into something beyond an impressively sized canvas just waiting for you to roll your own space game by way of mods, it needs to have these foundational issues addressed. </p><p>It’s not even a question of whether or not “The Vulture” is worth seven dollars. <em>Starfield</em> itself is not worth investing seven dollars in right now, and based on the review bombing the game has recently suffered on Steam, it’s obvious that a lot of folks feel this way. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A remake of the original Jet Set Radio is in development at SEGA, and screenshots from the game have been leaked online. </p>



<p>The four screenshots come from an early in-development version of the game. They give players a look at the game’s map, environment, art style, and more. Obviously, with it being so early in the development, things are likely — and expected — to change. </p>



<p>According to the poster, the images come from around 2021, and aren’t related to the free-to-play live service game that’s also in development. </p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to SEGA about the legitimacy of the screenshots. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Jet Set Radio first released in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast. Since then, it has been released on PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PS Vita, iOS, and Android. It’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-outlines-segas-plans-for-new-slate-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of a handful of games</a> receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remakes and reboots at SEGA</a>, including&nbsp;Golden Axe, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage. </p>

                <p>Bethesda has published some of the best games over the years, and if you're looking to grab a bargain with an extra layer of convenience, you can pick up several great titles as part of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-up-to-16-bethesda-games-for-only-3-each%2F1100-6524465%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical's Build Your Own Bethesda Bundle</a>. There are some excellent PC games on offer at a very affordable price, starting with two games for $7, three games for $10, or five games or more for $3 each. There are 16 games in all, so you could buy the whole package for only $48. But since most fans probably have some of these games, making a bundle of five games for $15 will probably make more sense.</p><p>The best part? Each game code you buy can be redeemed on GOG, meaning that these are DRM-free titles that you can play without needing to first connect online to authenticate your purchase.

True to his word, the days following Shadow of the Erdtree’s June 21 launch have seen many players take to social media to lament that the new content is simply too hard, while others complained of performance issues, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance?_gl=1*5kif15*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTE0MDgxMzMwLjE3MTkyNDEzNjQ.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTI0MTM2NC4xLjAuMTcxOTI0MTM2NC4wLjAuMA..*_ga_BBZCZLHBF6*MTcxOTI0MTM3OS4xLjAuMTcxOTI0MTM3OS4wLjAuMA..">leading to a ‘mixed’ review on Steam</a>.</p><p>However, its fearsome difficulty hasn’t stopped Karyal from attempting to take on the DLC using a very unconventional method of controlling her tarnished, which also proves that 90 percent of a FromSoftware boss fight plays out between the ears. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/1805008470166450460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Karyal made headlines last year after beating Elden Ring’s base game content while using an electroencephalography (EEG) brain monitoring headset to control specific in-game actions such as attacking, and rolling. EEG technology is ordinarily used by physicians as a diagnostic tool. However, after encountering the brain-scanning headwear while studying for a masters degree in psychology she became curious as to whether the technology could be adapted to control video games as part of a virtual controller.</p><p>To that end Karyal was able to use some fancy coding to train the software that came with her commercial EEG headset to recognize patterns in her brain’s electrical activity that were brought about when she imagined a particular object, action, or emotion. Each pattern was then assigned to an input on a virtual controller, which allowed Karyal to execute actions with her mind by imagining things during gameplay. For example, by imagining herself pushing a cube forward she could execute a roll, or alternatively she could imagine a plate spinning to make her tarnished perform an attack, or simply make herself angry to heal.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WE DID IT</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree, first boss, COMPLETED with mind control, and ZERO HANDS</p><p>I can't believe it.

However, for Shadow of the Erdtree, the streamer opted to attempt a completely hands-free run, by using eye-tracking software to track the movement of her head to control her character's movement, and voice prompts to trigger more nuanced actions, including saying “I choose you” to summon a spirit ash. Navigating to bosses also required a completely different command setup to the one used during the climactic fights themselves, adding another layer of mental gymnastics to the process.</p><p>Impressively, Karyal  has already managed to use her mind-control approach to take down two challenging early DLC bosses in the Divine Beast Dancing Lion, and Rellana, the Twin Moon Knight. Of course this isn’t the first time that FromSoftware fans have employed a non-traditional controller to shame Elden Ring bosses. Just last year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-streamer-missmikkaa-simultaneously-defeated-two-malenias-with-a-dance-pad-and-a-controller">Twitch streamer MissMikkaa managed to beat two Malenias simultaneously in two separate instances of the game while using a Dance Pad and a PS5 DualSense</a>. Another FromSoftware challenge runner by the name <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-no-hit-run-electric-saxophone-controller-playthrough">Dr. Decomposing was also able to complete a no-damage run while using a modified electric saxophone</a> as a controller.</p><p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC?_gl=1*hhybk0*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTcxODI5MzYyNi4xNzE5MjQ3MzAz*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTI0NzMwMi4xLjAuMTcxOTI0NzMwMi4wLjAuMA..">IGN’s interactive map and comprehensive guide</a> for all the tips, tricks, and walkthroughs that you need to get the most out of your time in the Land of Shadow, or read up on how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-have-begun-and-yes-most-make-it-easier">modders are already finding ways to make the game easier on PC</a>.</p><p><em>Anthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A standout puzzler with an enticing story, clever riddles, and a perfectly eerie vibe.</h2></div><div><section><p>A lot of tears have been shed and drinks poured out over the “death” of the classic point-and-click adventure game. While some stalwarts like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-monkey-island-review"><u>Return to Monkey Island</u></a> have valiantly kept the torch burning, the days of walking around 2D environments shoving seemingly unrelated items into your pockets and then pushing them up against equally random objects in cryptic combinations have largely passed. With that in mind, it seems especially fitting that Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, the latest from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/17/sayonara-wild-hearts-review">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> developer Simogo, is a puzzle game very much about gazing back through the tangle of time (in more ways than one). The striking style of this exceptionally clever adventure may not look familiar on the surface, but at its heart, it’s the closest thing I’ve played to a modernization of what a point-and-click adventure could be. Its story is enticingly fresh, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You take on the role of Lorelei, whose story begins in the dark woods outside of a looming manor with little direction beyond a strange invitation to an exhibit there that promises to transcend art itself – one that she might also be a part of? Lorelei and the Laser Eyes prides itself on its obfuscation, rarely giving you a straight answer to any of the questions it raises or telling you what the heck is actually going on – and that’s notable, because it starts at “curiously unexplained” and only gets wilder from there. But that enigmatic attitude never drove me toward frustration over the 13 hours it took me to beat it, always enticing me to uncover the answers for myself in a way that feels natural rather than laborious or obligatory.</p><p>Doing so generally has you directing Lorelei from fixed camera angles as she walks the black and white halls of this manor, bumping up against a cavalcade of locked doors that you’ll slowly but surely figure out how to open. Avoiding spoilers as much as possible, that could involve decoding the meaning behind a nearby poster to decipher the correct combination for a padlock, or it could require circling back much later once you’ve found a key somewhere else. The entire manor is one big puzzle box (with many literal puzzle boxes tucked inside it as well), and figuring out how to move more easily through its halls, which doors to open next, and the right position for each piece to click into place is a consistent thrill. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The entire manor is one big, masterfully assembled puzzle box.&nbsp;</p></div><p>This estate is also a masterfully assembled contraption because it seamlessly weaves in an immense amount of freedom alongside more curated encounters. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is the kind of game that’s a delight to talk about with friends as you compare the physical notes you’ve taken and revel in having solved a particularly tricky challenge – but it’s also a difficult one to discuss, because its relatively open layout means you could be tackling some of its puzzles in very different orders. It strikes an ideal balance between letting you just figure things out and driving you toward key story moments or conversations with its scant cast of characters, all of which are wittily written and tantalizingly obtuse in equal measure. </p><p>The types of puzzles you’ll solve also have an impressive variety to them. Some take the form of literal puzzle books, having you work out straightforward but entertaining number problems to get a solution to an obstacle blocking your path. Others are spatial puzzles that ask you to walk around a room and look at things from a very specific perspective to reveal the answer. Then there are those that will have you deciphering (relatively simple) secret messages in letters or documents, filling your inventory with items and objects that will inevitably be used elsewhere, dialing numbers on a telephone at the manor’s front desk to get outside help, or lots more – many of them asking you to dive into the history of Lorelei herself and the events playing out around her in a way that satisfyingly links all your actions to the compelling story at hand. There are even a few sections that drop you into the spooky, Resident Evil-inspired halls of an in-universe video game, complete with PlayStation-era graphics and hilariously clunky tank control movement.</p><p>However, that joke about the bad controls of olde would be funnier if Simogo hadn’t been so committed to the idea that Lorelei and the Laser Eyes should be a single-button game, a limitation that <em>can </em>be interesting but more often works against it. Apart from moving around with a thumbstick or WASD (and opening the settings), every single button does the same thing: It pulls up your menu when you aren’t near anything, interacts with stuff when you are, selects items in your inventory, cycles through the numbers on combination locks, and attempts to unlock them when you think you have the right answer. There isn’t even a dedicated back button in the menus. While this comparison will come across harsher than I mean it to be, the last game I reviewed to try something like this was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balan-wonderworld-review"><u>Balan Wonderworld</u></a>, and I hate it just as much here as I did there. </p><p>This utterly pointless self-restriction adds unnecessary friction to moving around and solving puzzles. The only way to stop looking at a lock is to intentionally try an incorrect code. If you want to examine an item, book, or note in your inventory while trying to find the right combination, you have to physically step away from the lock before you can access the menu (and if you are in a tight space with other interactable objects, you might walk into their range and select them instead). If you forget where you are going and need to quickly glance at the map, you have to go <em>three </em>menu lists deep before you can then select the map for only a specific floor… and then have to scroll to “exit” buttons on those lists to get back out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Simogo co-founder Simon Flessler said in <a href="https://screenrant.com/lorelei-laser-eyes-interview-challenge-puzzle-simon-flesser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a> that part of the justification for this control scheme was to make Lorelei and the Laser Eyes as broadly accessible as possible – but while that’s a goal I admire, it’s not one that would be compromised in any way I can see by also including the option to use dedicated buttons that quickly exit an interface or pull up the map. The absence of those basic features by no means ruins the experience of playing this otherwise extremely smartly designed game, and if they are the price I have to pay then so be it, but it is an obnoxious blemish on a moody world I was otherwise completely enthralled by. </p><p>That world is at least captivating enough to smooth over most rough edges. This isn’t a horror game, but it does wear the clothes of one occasionally, putting you on edge and teasing at the terrors that bind its puzzles together. There are only a couple of actual “scares,” and the small handful of outright fail states are very explicitly telegraphed, so you’ll never feel like you got something you didn’t sign up for if you’re mostly interested in carefully considered problem solving. But Lorelei and the Laser Eyes does do a fantastic job of <em>unsettling</em> you as you go, using its beautiful black-and-white visual style with pops of neon to create haunting, abstract imagery that can sometimes be as anxiety-inducing as any monster.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Tom's Favorite Puzzlers</h3><p>A non-comprehensive list of some of my absolute favorite puzzle games.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Exploring Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ forlorn manor feels both familiar and novel. Shoving playing cards and letters and other objects into my pockets in the hopes that they’ll help me decode a lock or solve some mystery down the line would fit right at home with the best of the classic point-and-click adventure game genre, but the lovely, low-fi presentation, eerie story, and creative puzzles wrapped around that are all impressively fresh. An unwavering dedication to being a one-button game adds some unnecessary annoyances, but it doesn’t stop it from being a captivating journey just the same. Like all the best puzzle games, it had me frantically scribbling symbols, numbers, and names on physical pieces of paper just to make sure I left no otherworldly stone unturned.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><p>amazing</p><p>Lorelei and the Lasers Eyes' puzzles are clever, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible.</p><a href="https://www.ign.com/person/TomRMarks" title="Tom Marks"><span></span><figcaption><p>Tom Marks</p></figcaption></a></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Three thoughts struck me after my first encounter with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>'s electrifying Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss: "WHAT?", "Ouch!", and, dimly, "What <em>is</em> going on under there?". And one kindly modder has now helpfully answered that last question by derobing the thing and giving us all a peek at how the sausage is made (spoilers: no sausages involved, but also some Dancing Lion-related spoilers ahead so proceed with caution).
</p>
<p>
For the uninitiated, the Divine Beast Dancing Lion is one of the Elden Ring DLC's earliest major boss encounters and is found hanging out at the top of the Belurat tower settlement. It's an impressive sight too; a twirling, soaring, gnashing creation inspired by (as its name strongly suggests) the traditional Chinese lion dance, in which two performers - one controlling the head, the other the tail - mimic the movements of a lion.
</p>
<p>
Keen-eyed Tarnished have doubtless already spotted the human legs poking out from beneath the lion's cloth-covered body - one pair at the front, another at the rear - but the flapping, flailing material makes it hard to see much else while it's in motion. As it turns out, though, developer FromSoftware has gone a little further than just giving the Dancing Lion legs; two fully formed and (mostly) animated human performers are both tucked away under the cloth, and both can be seen thrashing around to control the beast when the cover is removed.

<p>
We know all this thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO8vEHspEdE">sterling work of Youtuber BonfireVN</a> (cheers <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/model-viewer-forensics-reveal-that-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-dancing-lion-boss-is-actually-two-little-guys-piloting-it-around/">PC Gamer</a>), who immediately read everyone's mind and whipped that cloth straight off. And what a sight it is too! The performers themselves are both largely naked save for a loincloth, a protective armour skirt, and, in the case of Mr. Rear, filthy bandages covering his face. Both, too, are properly animated - when their limbs touch the ground at least - Mr. Rear spending pretty much all of his time scrambling around on all fours.
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, the illusion quite hilariously falls apart when the Dancing Lion performs some of its more extravagant moves - its corkscrewing, airborne forward lunge for instance - the pair whipping and flopping back and forth with impossible, physics-defying acrobatic abandon. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, this isn't the first time FromSoftware has gone the extra mile to create something wonderful players wouldn't ordinarily see in Elden Ring - who could possibly forget the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/tyhq8j/apparently_this_is_what_shrimp_guy_looks_like/">dreamboat face-reveal</a> of everybody's favourite masked prawn guy? - but it's always nice to get a peek at the craft behind the curtain. Even if the curtain is hurtling toward you at 100mph, jaws gnashing and lightning bolts coming out of its butt.
</p>
<p>
So, if you're finding the Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss too intimidating, why not follow that classic bit of advice and now (accurately) picture it with no clothes on? Or, if that doesn't work, there's always Eurogamer's Elden Ring: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree guide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/are-modern-horizons-3-collector-boosters-worth-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Released just last week, <em>Modern Horizons 3 </em>is the latest <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>set, in a world where it seems they never stop releasing. While you may be looking ahead to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" The Assassin’s Creed Magic: The Gathering Set Has Me Hooked"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> universes beyond set</a>, let’s take a moment to appreciate <em>Modern Horizons 3 </em>a bit more and take a closer look at it. We will examine the <em>Modern Horizons 3 </em>Collector boosters, and determine if buying these premium-priced packs is worth your time.</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/modern-horizons-3-collector-boosters-breakdown.jpg?itok=E6v8WcGp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/modern-horizons-3-collector-boosters-breakdown.jpg?itok=WmgAXH3c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Magic’s collector boosters change with each set due to the changing card styles, and treatments they do for these packs. Each set has its own showcase looks, oddities, and different things Wizards puts into sets to get players to chase them. Let’s keep it simple here and take a look at what one can expect to open in these $40 (US) packs.</p>
<ul><li>5 Rares
<ul><li>1 Foil Rare or Mythic rare from the main set</li>
<li>1 Rare or Mythic Rare from the Modern Horizons 3 Commander decks new cards (foil, foil-etched, extended art options included)</li>
<li>2 Non-Foil Rares with ‘booster fun’ treatment such as borderless, extended-art, or retro frame treatment.</li>
<li>1 Foil Rare or Mythic Rare that can have any treatment such as extended-art, borderless, retro framed, double rainbow foil serialized Eldrazi, foil-etched, traditional foil Special Guests, textured foil Special Guests or Double Faced Flip Planeswalker</li>
</ul></li>
<li>4 Foil Commons</li>
<li>3 Foil Uncommons</li>
<li>1 Foil full art Basic Lands</li>
<li>1 Retro-frame common or uncommon, or full art Snow Covered Wastes</li>
<li>1 Foil retro-frame common or uncommon, or full art Snow Covered Wastes</li>
<li>1 Foil token</li>
</ul><p>While Wizards of the Coast has an <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-modern-horizons-3" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Collecting Modern Horizons 3">in-depth breakdown of collector packs</a>, and different treatments this should help you get an idea of what you can find in the pack. Of course, this begs the question: what are the best opens you can get?</p>
<h2>The Most Valuable Cards in Modern Horizons 3</h2>
<p>With a newly released set prices are still fluid as sleepers are found, and overperformers discounted. Still, the set has already shown us some of what the most valuable cards are, and it’s adjusted for some early results. If it's mythic rare and eldrazi it's a good sign you have opened some money especially.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eldrazi-concepts.jpg?itok=HBwm6qEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eldrazi-concepts.jpg?itok=vua9An25 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The borderless, concept Eldrazis foiled</figcaption></figure><p>Ulamog, the Defiler has emerged as the chase rare of the set so far as we're seeing even the basic version going for $60.00 or more. While the pricest versions of these cards are the serialized versions, of which there are only 250 of each Eldrzi titan, the normal concept Edlrazi foils catch a pretty penny to with the foil concept version of Ulamog going for $200, and who knows what the serialized ones will go for (though it won't approach <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/post-malone-buys-magic-gathering-one-ring" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Post Malone Buys Magic: The Gathering The One Ring Card">the One Ring's price</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eldrazi-retro.jpg?itok=hriEhZ9b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eldrazi-retro.jpg?itok=ZRa1PU-V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Retro-frame versions of Ulamog and Emrakul, along with a borderless Ugin's Labyrinth</figcaption></figure><p>It’s not only the concept Eldrazi versions that sell well though. As the more valuable part of the Eldrazi trio, Ulamog and Emrakul’s retro-frame versions are also commanding a hefty premium, and are among the most expensive cards in the set. These are cool versions of the cards, showing a pre-eight edition-esq look. Also here is Ugin’s Labyrinth, which you can expect to normally in decks with Eldrazi, and is a ridiculously good land in those decks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flip-walkers.jpg?itok=uFqJKCcS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flip-walkers.jpg?itok=1HsrmQXV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The four most valuable of the dual faced flip planeswalkers here in borderless, textured foil. Grist is not pictured, and is hanging out more around $10-$15</figcaption></figure><p>The flip planeswalkers here show us popular characters at the moment of their sparking as Planeswalkers in the past. Sorin, Tamiyo, Ajani, and Ral have all picked up significant value in these borderless textured foil versions. This style of card was popular back when it premiered in <em>Magic Origins</em>, and it’s no surprise it’s popular here. Being powerful also helps with some even being looked at in competitive play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flare-ocelot-kaalia.jpg?itok=EBNspFEH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flare-ocelot-kaalia.jpg?itok=_fd_enUb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the best cards in the set in their most premium versions sneak up to the top.</figcaption></figure><p>Flare of Denial is a free counterspell, and it’s to no one’s surprise that it is going for a pretty penny with it likely to be played in all sorts of formats. If your blue deck has a decent amount of creatures (like Merfolk), you probably want to run it. Ocelot Pride combines three popular things: life gain, tokens, and cats, in a cool, efficient package for a magic hat trick. Kaalia is perhaps the most upscale version of an already popular commander.</p>
<h2>What Did We Open in Modern Horizons 3 Collector Boosters?</h2>
<p>Wizards were kind enough to send me several <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> Collector Boosters, and I’ve gone through them all. I’ll be showing some of the more valuable things we found through the seven packs, so you can get an idea of what might be inside a collector booster even if you don’t get one of the lottery tickets of a serialized Eldrazi.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kozilek-the-broken-reality_0.jpg?itok=8Fl5flZT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kozilek-the-broken-reality_0.jpg?itok=BQN3fd_b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The most valuable card I opened in my seven packs</figcaption></figure><p>I got the cheapest Eldrazi titans in my packs, in the borderless concept eldrazi form. I think that Kozilek here is being a bit overlooked, as he fits both Eldrazi decks, and colorless decks in general. He provides an army in a box, disruption in a box, and card advantage in a box, all in one easy package. He also makes a great upgrade to the Eldrazi Commander Deck with the +3/+2 boost to colorless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solitude.jpg?itok=gCNtnqDE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solitude.jpg?itok=4o1FJgjH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I solemn swear not to use scam methods with this.</figcaption></figure><p>I started playing <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>in 2003, shortly after Scourge was released, so I have some fond memories of the retro frame, as I got many older cards in cheap bins as well. However, white cards have always seemed to get washed out with it, and it’s a shame for them that they didn’t manage to fix it a bit here, and it is one of the things the new border does well (also: putting the rarity in the corner making life easier for my colorblind self). As for Solitude itself, it’s one of the evoke elementals and is a very powerful card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flare-of-duplication-retro-foil.jpg?itok=QhYnpEmL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flare-of-duplication-retro-foil.jpg?itok=hdCiJeqA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The retro foil still having the old swish brings a small smile to my face</figcaption></figure><p>Flare of Duplication can here be seen as a reminder to check the price of the specific version of a card you have. While the normal version of Flare of Duplication will only run you a few dollars, and the baseline retro version is not too much more, this version has a premium. As for the card itself, it’s a decent new fork variant, and red can often have the creatures to sacrifice to play it for free, but remember it has to be a nontoken red creature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eladamri-portrait-foil.jpg?itok=GlS5dXqR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eladamri-portrait-foil.jpg?itok=8-pi9hD4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Turn 1, Mana Elf, Turn 2, Eladamri, Turn 3, a cheap elf, and Blightsteel Colossus</figcaption></figure><p>As a character, Eladamri is an important part of one of magic’s most iconic storylines: the Weatherlight saga, but he’s been absent in cardboard form since <em>Tempest </em>was released back in 1997. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/224/eladamri-lord-of-leaves" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Eladmari, Lord of Leaves">Eladamri, Lord of Leaves</a> is part of the reserved list so they can’t reprint him, but the chance here for a new card was taken. Eladamri, Korvecdal is a pretty sweet card, fitting right into Elf decks, while also useful in many other decks as a powerful card advantage engine and cost skipper.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echoes-of-eternity-framebreak-foil.jpg?itok=BndKdOIz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echoes-of-eternity-framebreak-foil.jpg?itok=XS4F2xLX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Is this winmore?</figcaption></figure><p>One of the new ‘kindred’ cards as the type replaces the old Tribal card type, Echoes of Eternity requires significant dedication to the colorless cause with three colorless pips. For that though you get a pretty big return with a Panharmonicon-style ability and a free spell double for colorless. This can plug right into an Eldrazi commander deck, and this particular version of it is worth almost triple the cheapest version.</p>
<h2>Is it worth it to buy Modern Horizons 3 Collector Boosters?</h2>
<p>Opening Booster Packs in general is kind of like gambling: you never know what you might get. Looking at the prices of the cards I opened compared to the $40 price tag, only 2 of them ended up worth more than that today on TCG Player. Generally, it is better to buy singles of cards you want than to buy a pack unless you plan on drafting of playing sealed with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rares-from-collector-booster-7.jpg?itok=gJlJlzf3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rares-from-collector-booster-7.jpg?itok=zjalCZMR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For example, opening a booster with under $12 in value would be a downer after spending $30-$40</figcaption></figure><p>That said, there is something special about looking through a pack, and <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> is a set with a lot of great cards&nbsp; The cards in the set should hold good value for a while, especially as people move on because of the high overall power level, and some of the lesser talked about cards will increase in price. The modal double faced cards (with lands on the back) will help the value as the cards in <em>Zendikar Rising </em>are several dollars now, and the same is likely in a bit for some of the uncommons from <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>.</p>
<p>Should you buy a collector booster pack of <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>? No, probably not unless you get a lot of joy out of opening a booster. As far as sets to open collector boosters from though, this is a pretty good one with lots of neat treatments and cool cards.</p>

Much like the puppeted Chinese lion costumes you might see at a parade, there are just a pair of fellas holding up the front and the rear, and for as gnarly as the finished product looks, it’s actually even stranger watching them in action in this stripped-down form.</p><p>The guy at the front fully has his head in the giant lion’s head, but what is mostly obscured in the final incarnation of the fight is that his hands are also clasping the sides of the lion’s face, especially its jaw. In other words, he not only leads the charge, but he’s controlling its maw, and the roars you hear from it are presumably his. You can see this in the cutscene when you first trigger the fight, but otherwise it’s pretty hard to make out when everything’s in motion.</p><p><strong>Order <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree:</em></strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/ELDEN-RING-Erdtree-PRE-PURCHASE-Digital/dp/B0D4TZ1RYK/ref=sr_1_6?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-lion-boss-video-two-guys-1851557574&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D4TZ1RYK" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmn8lfikrvq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmn8lfikrvq" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>The poor guy in the back is another, sadder story. His one job is to be the ass of the lion. He doesn’t get to do much but follow the head. Occasionally he’ll get flung as a tail whip, or offer his back as a jump pad for the guy upfront, and the worst part is that he does this <em>on all fours</em>. He’s hunched over looking directly at the ground and his hands are bunched into fists as he literally white-knuckles the encounter. To make things even worse, he’s got a sack over his head. He’s just kind of <em>the </em>most deeply pitiable guy in the Land of Shadows. If you thought you hated your 9-5, I’m sure this dude’s got it so much worse.<br></p><p>BonfireVN’s video not only strips much of the decorative flair that obscures the two puppeteers, it also shows the fight in this form and it’s kind of hilarious. Again, the guy in the front is entirely responsible for the aggression and attacks, meaning that you just kind of get to watch the guy in the back fly through the air, skid against the ground, and twist and turn like crazy just to keep up. The guy in the back moves much more like an animal than the guy up front, and it’s neat seeing how their animation and movement styles were blended into this singular entity.</p><p>The video is honestly just a great showcase for FromSoft’s animators. It’s deeply impressive watching how fluidly the animations unfold on this level, so if anything, you should give the video a look just to pay some respect to the team that clearly worked hard on the fight. But mostly, pay your respects to the lion’s ass. Nobody wants to be that guy, and it’s often thankless work. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Roguelikes! They’re all the rage lately, whether it’s a pure run-based game like Hades 2, a devilish combination with something like the settlement-management of Cult of the Lamb or the application of the genre’s live-die-live-again loop to add a new bit of spice to a familiar series like The Rogue Prince of Persia. Into that last category comes a new contender: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>, which will soon introduce a new wave-based roguelike mode in its next season.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know#Hordes">Infernal Hordes</a> is a mixture of roguelike progression - here you’ll be collecting the very Diablo-named resource of Burning Aether to buy new gear at the end of a run - and a classic horde mode, with gangs of enemies arriving in 90-second waves. If you survive a wave and mop up any last foes, you’ll get to pick between three Infernal Offers - temporary upgrades for that run that offer potential bonuses for additional challenge - before moving onto the next wave of baddies.</p>
<p>Pulping all the waves in each of the mode’s eight difficulty tiers will let you proceed to the Well of Hatred to battle three random members of the Fell Council (from five possible bosses), which will reward even more Burning Aether. Aether is obtained per player, so you won’t have to argue with friends about what to spend it on. At the end of a run, you’ll be able to cash in your collected Aether by buying Spoils of Hell, offering equipment, materials, gold and ‘greater equipment’ - an item with a guaranteed Greater Affix - for your efforts.</p>
<p>You can jump into the Infernal Hordes mode using the new Infernal Compass item, which will scale with your world tier and difficulty. The compass itself can be upgraded by collecting Abyssal Scrolls, granting access to higher Infernal Hordes tiers that increase the chance of earning legendary and unique drops, as well as Spoils of Greater Equipment.</p>
<p>The Infernal Hordes mode will debut in Diablo 4’s Season 5, which will be available to try for yourself from tomorrow, June 25th, for a week via the APRG’s Public Test Realm. After that, it’ll arrive in Season 5 proper with any necessary tweaks made in response to the test feedback.</p>
<p>Season 5 will debut a new post-campaign questline called The Eyes of the Enemy, which you’ll need to complete to gain the Infernal Compass needed to play the horde mode. Elsewhere in the update will be new legendaries, uniques and items, which can drop anywhere but will have a higher drop rate in the Infernal Hordes mode.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nosferatu-is-coming-to-make-vampires-scary-again.910047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24184946/nosferatu-trailer-release-date-cast-remake<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="z5fuoW">There’s been no shortage of vampire movies and TV shows in the last couple of years. There was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23679108/renfield-review-nic-cage-nicholas-hoult"><em>Renfield</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24133463/abigail-review-horror-comedy-vampires-scream"><em>Abigail</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23439476/interview-vampire-lestat-de-lioncourt-tv-show"><em>Interview with a Vampire</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23792915/what-we-do-shadows-season-5-review"><em>What We Do in the Shadows</em></a>, and more, all exploring different genres (with varying degrees of success) through the lens of everyone’s favorite creatures of the night. But we haven’t had many truly scary vampires recently, and it seems like <em>Nosferatu </em>is here to correct that fact. </p>
<p id="8kGCtu">The latest remake of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22891878/nosferatu-100-years-vampire-movies">classic German horror movie</a> — itself an unlicensed adaptation of Dracula — comes from <em>The VVitch</em> and <em>The Lighthouse</em> director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23020420/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-alexander-skarsgard">Robert Eggers</a>, who seems to be leaning into the oppressively dark and creepy atmosphere of the original film. </p>
<p id="0R6YiE">The movie follows Thomas Hutter (Nicholas Hoult, who was also in <em>Renfield</em>) and all the strange things that happen to him after he visits the castle of the mysterious and vampiric Count Orlak (Bill Skarsgård). In the original story, this includes (arguably) prompting the Count’s move to the city in pursuit of Hutter’s wife, who seems to have already been bewitched by the vampire. </p>
<p id="7qJwDJ">The first trailer for the movie, which went online Monday, is all about establishing a mood, full of dark rooms and pitch-black castles. We see glimpses of Orlak’s castle, but the majority of the trailer is focused on the folks back in London, who seem to be eagerly anticipating his dreadful arrival. Of course, we don’t really get to see much of Orlak, better known as Nosferatu — only his silhouette, giving us a fantastically scary ending to the trailer. </p>
<p id="PAjfps">The movie’s stacked cast also includes previous Eggers collaborators Willem Dafoe and Ralph Ineson, as well as Emma Corrin and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. </p>
<p id="J2iCWx">In the grand tradition of counter-programming that has included movies like <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> and <em>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, <em>Nosferatu </em>is set for release on Christmas Day. So you can take the whole family to meet the Count. </p>

  <p id="lzQIVQ">Valve is kicking off its Steam Summer Sale with an awesome discount on the Steam Deck. Right now, you can pick up either the 64 GB or 512 GB model of the original LCD Steam Deck for their lowest price yet. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">64 GB model</a> is on sale for $296.65 (was $349), while the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">512 GB version</a> is just $381.65 (was $449). Valve is slowly phasing out its launch models of the Steam Deck equipped with LCD screens, so this deal will only be available while supplies last. Both models include a zip-up case for the Deck, but the 512 GB version is unique in that its screen is covered in anti-glare etched glass. </p>

<p id="FobHXr">While these slightly older models don’t include the larger battery or OLED display featured in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23950861/steam-deck-oled-review-valve-handheld-gaming">Steam Deck OLED</a>, the launch version of the Steam Deck remains a formidable alternative to other handheld options like the Nintendo Switch or ROG Ally.</p>
<p id="F3LitN">Valve’s list of Steam Deck verified titles has expanded exponentially since launch, and even includes games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, which is particularly handy if you recently picked up a copy of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>. Of course, if you’re looking for even more reasons to adopt a Steam Deck, you can always check out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22949326/steam-deck-review-pc-gaming-portable">our review</a>. </p>

While these games are generally remembered as great adventures, there was some controversy around many of the brutal death animations featured in them.

Though she may be well-prepared for the Trials ahead, in the Entity’s twisted world, the future is never promised,” said Behaviour Interactive. </p><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094"><em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s current season</a></span> is heavily inspired by <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, so it’s not like the game hasn’t been dabbling in non-horror crossovers already. </p><p>Still, I don’t think Lara Croft is a good fit for <em>Dead By Daylight</em>. Turning such a powerful and badass character famously known for surviving and fighting into a screaming victim who won’t just pull out a pistol and blast away the monster seems silly and out of character for any version of the Tomb Raider<em>.</em> But hey, gotta keep making the number go up and feed people more content. That’s the way things work in 2024.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Before the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion arrived for Elden Ring, director Hidetaka Miyazaki set some interesting expectations for the DLC's map. He basically said the new map would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dlcs-map-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-limgrave/1100-6521275/" data-ref-id="1100-6521275">similar in size to the base game's starting area of Limgrave</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That's definitely underselling the Realm of Shadows, the DLC's map, quite a bit.

It's pretty astonishing viewed this way and shows it's clearly bigger than Miyazaki initially teased.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Shadow of the Erdtree released to critical acclaim. In fact, The Witcher developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-says-its-an-honor-for-elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-expansion-to-break-its-record/1100-6524435/" data-ref-id="1100-6524435">CD Projekt Red congratulated the Elden Ring DLC for breaking the record for best-reviewed RPG expansion</a>, overtaking the throne from Blood and Wine.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about Shadow of the Erdtree, GameSpot has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-things-to-know/2900-5484/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5484">14 things you should know before playing the Elden Ring DLC</a>.

If hunting down Scadutree Fragments isn't your thing, however, there's a mod that gets rid of the feature altogether.</p><p>By now, you're probably aware that you need to amass dozens of Scadutree Fragments to withstand the dangers lurking around the Land of Shadow. But if you prefer the methods of old, user Sereenaty over at Nexus Mods has the answer. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No More Scadutree Grind</a> mod removes the need to collect the fragments, as well as Revered Spirit Ashes, and instead makes it so damage dealt and taken are scaled in a similar way to the vanilla game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Before you install the mod, there are a few notes worth keeping in mind. "The mod was only tested on a fresh character with zero Scadutree fragments collected," reads the description. "No idea how it affects saves that already collected some."</p><p>In addition, the creator mentions that the scaling is similar to endgame areas like Farum Azula. In short, playing Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree with this mod won't immediately become a walk in the park, but there'll be a noticeable difference--especially because you won't need to collect items across the map anymore.</p><p>If you still prefer to play Shadow of the Erdtree as is but you're having trouble finding Scadutree Fragments out in the wild, here are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/2900-5485/" data-ref-id="2900-5485">all Scadutree Fragment locations</a> to help you locate the ones you're missing.</p>

Here are some of the more notable improvements:</p><ul><li>Traders give less dukes and have nerfed rewards that no longer break progression.</li><li>Trader inventories offer sales staged items for sale that are more appropriate for your character’s level.</li><li>The game is a little more crafting oriented than in the past, and legendary items are now craftable.</li><li>The end result is the game feels much more balanced and even in a coop team players will find themselves still engaged on day 70, single players even further.</li><li>Crafting  <ul><li>Quality 6 crafting is back</li></ul></li><li>Tools/Weapons/Armor  <ul><li>Requires new Legendary Parts</li></ul></li><li>Traders/Biome order  <ul><li>Rekt – Forest</li><li>Jen – Burnt</li><li>Bob – Desert</li><li>Hugh – Snow</li><li>Joel – Wasteland</li></ul></li><li>Quests  <ul><li>Quest Progression has been improved so you get higher Tier Quests offered with each trader and can roll back to lower tiers if you want to</li></ul></li><li>Armor  <ul><li>Quality determines perk level</li><li>Basic Example – Q1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50%</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Legendary Crafting</strong></h3><ul><li>We have added new Legendary Parts which can be acquired in high end loot chests, and higher Trader rewards</li><li>With these player can craft Legendary Q6 weapons, tools, and armor</li></ul><h3><strong>Dew Collector Overhaul</strong></h3><p>The Dew Collector has been reworked.

This change makes the Dew Collector available early in game, but it collects murky water without having the filter installed.</p><h3><strong>Enhanced Gore System</strong></h3><p>Along with the new Zombie variants comes the new and improved Dismemberment Gore System, ensuring consistent dismemberment across zombie types, and as a bonus, there are also brand-new blood splatter particles to complete the visceral experience of combat.</p><p>With Version 1.0, the entire zombie lineup has been upgraded with new gore pieces, including a complete overhaul of recently updated zombies from past Alphas. This ensures all zombies are consistent with the latest technology, enhancing the game’s visual impact and immersion.</p><h3><strong>Updated Road Decals</strong></h3><p>Say goodbye to one of our last remaining legacy assets, our original Road Decals.

The very outer layer is a no-go zone, preventing players from walking off the map. Just inside this is a no-build zone, ensuring players cannot build too close to the edge. As players approach the border, the area fogs up, providing a clear visual cue. This system allows more Points of Interest (POIs) to spawn near the map’s edges, increasing the playable area while communicating to the player you can’t go that way.</p><h3><strong>New Upgradeable Player Chests</strong></h3><p>Introducing player writeable storage boxes! Start with a basic wooden box, which can be upgraded to iron, and eventually to steel. Each upgrade increases the storage capacity, providing more space for your items. Additionally, these chests feature writeable areas that display custom text, allowing for easy organization and labeling of your stored goods. Up to three lines of copy can be added. Happy chest placing, survivors!</p><h3><strong>Environment Art Update</strong></h3><p>The environment team has been busy with many new art updates that will further immerse you for 1.0 experience including:</p><ul><li>New movie theater seats, new soda and drink vending machines, new TV studio camera, new mini beverage coolers, new food and candy posters, new retro electric and gas signs, new neon signs, new camping tents, new chemistry set, new modular iron wrought fence set with destructive states.

Including shader and texture optimizations, as well as mesh optimizations to improve game performance.</li></ul><h3><strong>Block Shape Updates</strong></h3><p>The environment Art team has been busy with many new block shapes to build with.</p><p>162 new shapes added to fill in missing shapes to roofs, railings, poles, stairs, and many more.</p><p>A few notable ones include:</p><ul><li>Wedge Stairs Railing Left, Right, Tip Left, and Tip Right</li><li>Wedge Stairs Railing Metal Left, Right, Tip Left, and Tip Right</li><li>6m and 8m long ramp sets</li><li>Wedge60 Windows set</li><li>Broken and Empty versions of all Bulletproof Windows (POI’s)</li><li>Also note the addition of a new Radial Menu option:  <ul><li>Copy Shape And Rotation</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Enhanced Audio</strong></h3><p>Sharpen your ears, survivors!

New functionality includes:</p><ul><li>All traders now have their own unique voice</li><li>Traders have more than 200 lines each with story bits and strong hints to relations between traders</li><li>Subtitles will be translated to all supported languages</li></ul><h3><strong>Gamepad Improvements</strong></h3><p>A ton of work has gone into improving Gamepad Support to make it control better, more intuitive and have native console features including:</p><ul><li>New UI navigation system that removes the virtual cursor</li><li>Overhauled modern camera controls that are easier to use and can be extensively customized</li><li>New aim assist systems for gamepads to aid with quicker targeting when aiming a weapon or swinging a melee weapon, and slowing the camera when passing over small interactable objects</li><li>Greatly expanded gamepad settings in a new controller options menu including:  <ul><li>Joystick layout options</li><li>Separated X and Y camera sensitivity</li><li>Look acceleration</li><li>Deadzone adjustments</li><li>Rumble strength</li><li>Aim assist toggle</li></ul></li><li>Full gamepad remapping support for on foot and vehicle controls</li><li>New controls and shortcuts when using a gamepad, including:  <ul><li>Directly access items on your toolbelt via radial menu by holding either of the toolbelt selection buttons.</li><li>Instantly swap to your previously equipped item with the new quick swap button</li><li>Easier sprinting with tap or hold controls</li></ul></li><li>Expanded controller vibration support that responds to actions triggered by the player and what’s happening around them</li><li>Support for DualSense controller features including:  <ul><li>Track time of day, weather and blood moons on the light bar</li><li>Trigger effects when using certain items and weapons</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Modding Notes</strong></h3><ul><li>Game updated to Unity 2022.3.29f1</li><li>Updated HarmonyX to 2.13.0</li><li>ModInfo: Now requires ModInfo in V2 format, also properties “Name” and “DisplayName” no longer optional as announced in Alpha 21</li><li>XML parsing now supports “conditional” blocks:  <ul><li>Allows switching between different XML blocks based on conditions like game version, whether a certain mod is loaded etc</li><li>Can be evaluated once by the host when loading the XMLs so host and every client will have the same resulting XML or by each game instance separately, so that host and every client can have different effects, e.g. when based on a GamePref</li><li>Also supported on the top level of patch XMLs: These are always applied during XML loading</li><li>Detailed documentation will be added to the game’s wiki</li></ul></li><li>XML patches now feature a new instruction “include” which allows including another XML in place, e.g. to split up large XMLs into smaller pieces or – combined with the usage of conditional blocks – include different XML based on other conditions</li><li>New XML “events.xml”: Allows defining date based events (like christmas, halloween etc) and use them with conditional XML blocks – have the pipe baton automatically use a candy cane shiv model during christmas season or pumpkins use a halloween based model during that time</li><li>Z-Selection box for POI or world building now shows the current selection size</li><li>Updated POI properties windows to reflect the current POI features</li><li>Debugging:  <ul><li>Debug views (F3) now remember the selected elements</li><li>CVar filter box can no longer have the input focus when the mouse cursor is not enabled – avoids accidentally overwriting your filter while running around</li><li>FPS graph and network monitor available in releases</li></ul></li><li>Game assembly gets fully publicized members for easier code modding – each member that has changed access level gets an attribute “PublicizedFrom” attached that will tell you the original accessibility level. Accessing originally not public stuff is still meant to be a last resort if other approaches fail.</li><li>New BlockCompositeTileEntity with respective TileEntityComposite  <ul><li>This is a generic TileEntity (TE) block which allows selecting which features it should have from XML (“compositing”)</li><li>Currently these features are supported:  <ul><li>Lockable: The TE can be locked</li><li>LockPickable: Players can pick the lock on the TE (only usable in combination with Lockable)</li><li>Signable: The TE can be written on. The prefab used for the TE will have to have properly set up TextMeshes – at least one but it supports as many as desired</li><li>Storage: The TE will have container features</li></ul></li><li>These TE properly support up/downgrading, so for example a block that has Signable can upgrade to a block that supports Storage and Signable and keep its text</li><li>Adding new features does not require enumeration modifications so should be easier going forward to add custom TE features from mods</li><li>Example usage of these features can be seen on the new player storage blocks “cntWoodWritableCrate” and similar</li></ul></li><li>File lookup prioritizes files in user data (e.g. LocalPrefabs) over mods</li><li>New game argument “-newprefabsmod=somemod” allows defining a mod in which new prefabs get stored instead of going to “LocalPrefabs”. Mod name is given by its internal name from its “ModInfo.xml”, not the folder name</li><li>XUi changes:  <ul><li>Generic “repeat_content” attribute support for all views. For non-grid views the attribute “repeat_count” specifies the number of clones</li><li>Repeated elements automatically get fed with additional template parameters that can be used with template bindings (“${…}”):  <ul><li>For every parent view: “repeat_count” giving the number of elements as specified by “repeat_count” attribute and “repeat_i” incrementing by one for each created element, starting at 0</li><li>Additionally for grid views only: “repeat_col” and “repeat_row” giving the column and row the element will be in the grid – assuming the grid dimensions do not change later on</li></ul></li><li>New attribute “disabled_tooltip_key” lets you define a tooltip that gets shown when hovering a disabled view</li><li>New attribute “force_hide” allows keeping a view invisible</li><li>New attributes for controller navigation:  <ul><li>“use_selection_box”: Should controller navigation show an outline around the selected view</li><li>“gamepad_selectable”: View can be selected with a controller</li><li>“nav_up”, “nav_down”, “nav_left”, “nav_right”: Manual override which view to select when pressing the respective direction on a controller</li></ul></li><li>Texture views now support: Color tinting (“color” attribute) and for keeping the texture’s aspect ratio (attribute “original_aspect_ratio”)</li></ul></li><li>XML “extends” now allow excluding specified subclasses (like “UpgradeBlock” in blocks) so that all its children are actually excluded</li><li>Changes to quests should no longer kill savegames’ character files – though the affected quests will lose their details in the quest log</li><li>Plants tick correctly when placed on the same position as another plant was growing before – before the timer would potentially not reset thus accumulating the old and new growth times</li><li>Perks can now have LevelRequirements for individual levels only instead of being required to be specified for all levels if done for at least one</li><li>“Inventory.PUBLIC_SLOTS” is changed to be targeted by mods, making it easier to implement custom toolbelt sizes. Also a new property “SHIFT_KEY_SLOT_OFFSET” has been added that allows specifying which slots are meant to be targeted when using Shift + slot hotkey</li><li>World Editor: Previews of POI now match the actual state when rotating them</li></ul><h3><strong>TFP News Screen</strong></h3><p>We have moved the old shared menu news screen into a new skippable in-game News screen that has graphics and link support for all formats. This will be used to inform players on new patch updates and other TFP news.</p><h3><strong>Server Administration</strong></h3><p>Changes to serverconfig.xml:</p><ul><li>Setting “SaveGameFolder” has been removed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered</a> Blue Protocol, the stylized online action RPG developed by Bandai Namco Online, nearly five years ago. Back then, there was no assurance the game would ever launch in Western countries.</p>
<p>That changed in December 2022, when Amazon Games took the stage at The Game Awards to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-confirmed-for-2023-launch-on-pc-amazon-will-publish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a publishing deal with Bandai Namco Online to bring the game to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X outside of Japan.</p>
<p>Blue Protocol eventually got <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-to-launch-on-pc-first-in-japan-may-support-cross-play-additional-features-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut</a> in the Land of the Rising Sun on June 14, 2023. The Western version was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-mmorpg-gets-delayed-to-2024-in-the-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed to 2024</a>, but we haven't really heard any more about it. In fact, Amazon Games continued to mention its publishing deal with NCSoft for Throne and Liberty (<a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now set to launch on September 17</a> in Western countries) in its press releases, whereas Blue Protocol wasn't mentioned any longer. The last blog post on the official global website is dated November 13, 2023.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that may be due to a dire financial situation. A few days ago, Bandai Namco Online (a subsidiary of Bandai Namco Entertainment) <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/388005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> itself insolvent due to substantial losses. That doesn't necessarily mean work on the game is about to stop, but it doesn't incite faith in its future, either.</p>
<p>The developers held a live stream earlier this month, but it didn't provide any news on the global launch. They only talked about upcoming updates, such as the next chapter in the main story, a new region, an increased level cap to 80, and new passive abilities for each class available in Blue Protocol.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on the news from Japan, hoping for the best while preparing for the worst.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/2024/6/24/24183179/netflix-new-tv-bear-season-3-babylon-berlin-4-iwtv<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="yugZzI">The days are officially getting shorter, but there is no less TV to watch — just take it from this week’s new releases. We’re running the gamut from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160862/dropout-make-some-noise-season-3-ben-schwartz">Dropout’s <em>Make Some Noise</em> season 3</a> to Netflix’s dynamic <em>Supacell</em>,<em> </em>all the way to the finales of <em>Dark Matter</em> season 1 and <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> season 2. Personally I’m most invested this week in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23852870/babylon-berlin-season-4-netflix-release-date-when-us">return of <em>Babylon Berlin</em></a><em>, </em>which has switched from Netflix to a new network (more on that below). Thank god you watched <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23947308"><em>House of the Dragon</em>’s latest episode</a> live last night, huh? </p>
<p id="LleI9C">Here’s all the new TV premieres and finales this week. </p>

<div id="M8hHYd"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Frmk94Etedo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="OHuQK7"><strong>Genre: </strong>Superheroes (grounded)<br><strong>Release date: </strong>June 27, with all episodes<br><strong>Showrunner/creator: </strong>Rapman<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Tosin Cole, Adelayo Adedayo, Yasmin Monet Prince, and more</p>
<p id="IlizaR">There’s not a lot in this world that can beat “superhero fatigue,” but Rapman’s <em>Supacell</em> hopes to do so by embracing normal people getting superpowers, “not people that are martyrs, not people that are going to save the world, just people that try to save themselves and their families,” as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/superhero-shows/netflix-supacell-misfits-heroes-exclusive/">he told SFX magazine</a>. </p>
<p id="HoNmjo">And indeed his premise is more complicated than it seems: five people in South London getting powers out of nowhere — and having nothing that seems to link them beyond being Black — with a nefarious organization lurking the background. </p>

<p>When Ubisoft officially unveiled the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition last week, many fans immediately brought up Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. </p>



<p>The game was first announced in 2016, and has since been in development hell. It has seen multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restarts and management changes</a> that has led many fans to just assume that it’s not coming. However, Ubisoft confirmed on Monday that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still on the way.</p>



<p>“Yes, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still in development, and we cannot wait for you to discover more about Jade’s past in the 20th Anniversary Edition,” the studio said <a href="https://x.com/bgegame/status/1805269728262230467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via the game’s official Twitter</a> account. </p>



<p>Obviously a simple post like that doesn’t answer any major questions about the state of the game. That said, it’s at least something to know that it hasn’t been abandoned after a decade in development. When fans will hear anything more about the prequel title remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary launches on June 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>The developers of multiplayer aerial combat sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/war-thunder">War Thunder</a> have apologised after a picture of the real-life Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which killed seven crew members when it exploded just 73 seconds after launch in 1986, was used in artwork promoting the game’s recent Seek &amp; Destroy update.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>Similarities between the unmistakable photo of the explosion, which was broadcast live in many American schools due to the presence of teacher Christa McAuliffe on board, and a section of the key art for War Thunder’s <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/8953-meet-major-update-seek-destroy-en">new Seek &amp; Destroy update</a> were spotted by a number of players, several of whom took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm9oao/challenger_disaster_and_seek_destroy_wallpaper/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the game’s subreddit</a> and forums to criticise the poor taste of using imagery of the real-life disaster to promote a video game.</p>
<p>Gaijin Entertainment community manager magazine2 subsequently <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/26">posted a response</a> expressing “sincere apologies” on behalf of the devs for the “accidental” use of the imagery, saying that “the picture was part of an aerial explosion reference pack used by our artists and the context was lost”.</p>
<p>“We’ll be altering this artwork as soon as we can and will take measures to ensure that this doesn’t repeat again in the future,” they added.</p>
<p>“Things like this shouldn't happen and we'll make sure it doesn't repeat,” another community manager, Oxy, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm7e77/comment/l9vr7e0/">posted on Reddit</a> while repeating the claim that the use was due to the accidental use of the explosion reference pack. They stated that that the artwork would be revised today, Monday June 24th. At the time of writing, the distinctive explosion can still be seen in a thumbnail for <a href="https://youtu.be/DIsdWN78JS4">the update’s rundown video</a> and a <a href="https://staticfiles.warthunder.com/upload/image/0_Wallpaper_Renders/Aircraft/1920x1080_seek_and_destroy_logo_eng_7d40f0ff1f7fc2ef0a2542ea5a3aba6b.jpg">downloadable wallpaper of the art</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that War Thunder has made headlines due to its controversial connections to real life, though usually it's a little more humourous than re-using imagery of a tragic disaster. Dedicated players have taken to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/war-thunder-player-posts-classified-document-to-prove-tank-is-inaccurate">posting classified documents to prove the inaccuracy of some of its vehicles</a> in the past, with the not-irregular leaking of secretive military intel on its forums to one-up rival players and argue about how closely it simulates actual hardware becoming somewhat of a running joke at this point.</p>

The review-bombing and overall discussion of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s difficulty has revived a conversation around Soulslikes as old as the games themselves: Are these games too difficult, or are people just too used to handholding in modern games to appreciate a real challenge?</p><p><strong>Order <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree:</em></strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/ELDEN-RING-Erdtree-PRE-PURCHASE-Digital/dp/B0D4TZ1RYK/ref=sr_1_6?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-reviews-1851557175&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D4TZ1RYK" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmn8lfikrvq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmn8lfikrvq" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><figure id="" data-id="6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-recommend-id="image://6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="788" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-recommend-id="image://6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="788" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In opposition to the review bombers, and other players who are genuinely dissatisfied with the difficulty, some are saying that this is just how FromSoftware rolls. That is true, to an extent, as the studio has a track record of making DLC for its games that are harder than the base game. These expansions are meant as a higher challenge for those who have mastered what came before. This was also the case, for example, with <em>Bloodborne</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodbornes-the-old-hunters-dlc-will-kick-your-ass-1743851464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodbornes-the-old-hunters-dlc-will-kick-your-ass-1743851464"><em>The Old Hunters</em></a></span> DLC (which, in my opinion, remains one of the most challenging experiences FromSoft has made). There is an element of “what did you expect?” from some, aimed at those complaining about the extreme difficulty.<br></p><p>However, the situation is a bit more complex than that. The discussion of FromSoftware difficulty has always had two sides to it. Many people often think of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679">Git Gud</a></span>” crowd, who don’t want to have nuanced discussions and think players complaining just need to be better. But on the other side, there are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steelrising-spiders-soulslike-dark-souls-elden-ring-1849487023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steelrising-spiders-soulslike-dark-souls-elden-ring-1849487023">valid criticisms</a></span> of FromSoftware’s difficulty, especially with respect to the lack of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/accessibility-difficulty-easy-mode-explained-1851261475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/accessibility-difficulty-easy-mode-explained-1851261475">accessibility options</a></span>. This has continued to be a pain point, as it means these games are less available to all players. Furthermore, FromSoftware’s design ethos often demands a high level of perfection, while the games themselves are filled with imperfect designs (such as wonky camera controls) that cause unintended friction the player must also surmount.</p><p>There is yet another layer to the conversation around <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> is arguably the most accessible (and therefore most played by newcomers) game FromSoft has designed to date. The open world is a big reason for that, as players who encounter a challenge they can’t defeat can just go somewhere else. That more accessible design and the popularity it gained created a community of players who have never played a Soulslike before, and are now excitedly diving into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> only to discover FromSoft DLC is hard as hell.</p><figure id="" data-id="6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-recommend-id="image://6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-recommend-id="image://6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This difficulty shock is likely to cause an uproar in disappointment at the perception of an extremely unfair challenge. With so much discussion going on, even <em>Elden Ring</em> publisher Bandai Namco weighed in. “This is a suggestion to level up your Scadutree Blessing,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> on X (formerly Twitter), to urge those complaining about the difficulty to use the expansion’s new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments-1851556790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments-1851556790">upgrade material</a></span>. This highlights another fact of FromSoftware: The developer (almost) always gives players a way to tackle new challenges.<br></p><p>So is <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> too hard? Well, it’s complicated. It is definitely harder than <em>Elden Ring</em>, but there are also ways to deal with the greater challenge. If you are having a hard time with any of the new bosses, take your time, take a break, and you really should collect as many Scadutree Fragments as you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Avowed, an upcoming open-world RPG game developed by Obsidian Entertainment, promises an immersive gaming experience. During the Xbox Game Showcase earlier this month, players were treated to a new gameplay trailer that showcased intense combat sequences, a vast and diverse map, and a rich fantasy world. Now, Avowed’s game directors have also informed us about the game length and it is ‘similar’ to their previous project, ‘The Outer Worlds’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fair-distance">Fair Distance</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/20/avoweds-creators-on-why-romance-was-considered-but-ultimately-not-included-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Avowed gameplay directors Carrie Patel and Gabe Paramo shared intriguing details about the game. They discussed the third-person option, the game’s RPG systems, interactions with other characters, and more. When asked about the game’s length, the directors drew a reassuring comparison to Obsidian’s action RPG from 2019, The Outer Worlds, suggesting that Avowed will offer a similarly substantial experience.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykgkdU1NJUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Patel stated that the “best comparison for Avowed in terms of scope is The Outer Worlds”. She clarified that while Avowed will offer a similar level of depth and content, it will also provide a unique experience. </p>



<p>The game’s length may vary according to the difficulty players choose and the time they want to invest in exploration and side missions compared to the main storyline. According to How Long to Beat, The Outer Worlds’ main story takes around 13 and a half hours, main plus side missions take more than 27 and a half hours, and completionist runs take around 42 hours. This suggests that Avowed will offer substantial content for players to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other Avowed news, the developers recently hinted at the game’s release date, suggesting a possible window in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-accidentally-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 2024</a>. However, it’s important to note that this is a leaked date and has not been officially confirmed. For more information on whether Avowed is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-avowed-coming-to-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to PlayStation 5</a>, click here. We’re curious to hear your thoughts on Avowed’s game length. Do you think it sounds sufficient, or would you prefer more or less content? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of the new resources that arrived with the Sakurajima DLC update in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld </a>is called "Crude Oil." This resource is essential in the production of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-how-to-make-and-use-plasteel/1100-6524418/" data-ref-id="1100-6524418">Plasteel</a>, which creates the best Sphere, armor, and weapons in Palworld. However, the primary way to acquire Crude Oil requires you to construct and use a Crude Oil Extractor, which comes with its own requirements. You can see the entire process of building a Crude Oil Extractor and getting Crude Oil in Palworld in the guide below.</p><h2>Building the Crude Oil Extractor in Palworld</h2><p>To unlock the Crude Oil Extractor in your base build menu, you need to use two Technology Points on the equipment. The Crude Oil Extractor is found at level 50 in the Technology Menu right next to the unlock for Plasteel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322970-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.15.38.96.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322970" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322970-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.15.38.96.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322970"></a><figcaption>The Crude Oil Extractor in the Technology menu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322970-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.15.38.96.png"></figure><p>After you unlock the Crude Oil Extractor, you need the following resources to construct it in your base:</p><ul><li>250 Pal Metal Ingots</li><li>50 Circuit Boards</li></ul><p>Obviously, that's a huge haul of resources, so you might have to spend a few hours getting the right materials to build the extractor. Then, once you have the right number of materials, you can't even build the Crude Oil Extractor in just any location.</p><p>The Crude Oil Extractor <strong>can only be built and placed over an active oil field</strong>. Oil fields are primarily located on the new Sakurajima Island, so you'll likely have to establish a new base there if you want to produce Crude Oil. However, small oil mounds can be found all over the original map as well, but they aren't clearly marked. If you open your map and view Sakurajima Island, you'll see some black spots at various spots. These black spots indicate where oil fields are located, so you have to make your base near one of them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322973" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322973"></a><figcaption>Oil fields are marked by dark spots on the Sakurajima map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png"></figure><p>When you get to one of these dark spots on the map, build a Pal Management Box to establish a base. Then, find a lifted mound in the ground with dark sludge coming out of it. This dark sludge is oil, and it's where you need to place the Crude Oil Extractor. Using the materials you gathered earlier, go into your build menu, view the second page of the "Production" tab, and find the Crude Oil Extractor. Build the extractor right over the oil mound in the ground. Once that's done, you're ready to start harvesting some Crude Oil.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323027" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323027"></a><figcaption>Building the Crude Oil Extractor over the oil mound. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png"></figure><h2>Producing Crude Oil in Palworld</h2><p>While you might think Crude Oil will just start pouring out of the extractor after you build it, Palworld has other plans. The Crude Oil Extractor requires a power source to operate, so you'll have to construct a Power Generator near the extractor in your new base. The Power Generator can be built from the "Infrastructure" tab of the build menu and costs the following resources:</p><ul><li>50 Ingots</li><li>20 Electric Organs</li></ul><p>Once the Power Generator is up and running, you need to head into your Pal Management Box and assign an Electric Pal to the generator. Using a Pal with level 3 or 4 Electricity Work Suitability is essential, as the Crude Oil Extractor requires a ton of power. A level 2 Electricity Pal won't be able to power the generator fully.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323029" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323029"></a><figcaption>Powering up the Crude Oil Extractor. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png"></figure><p>Ensure your Electric Pal is assigned to the Power Generator, which is indicated by the Pal producing electricity near the generator. After that happens, the Power Generator will start storing power and the Crude Oil Extractor should turn on. You'll know if the extractor is working if you hear noises coming from it.</p><p>You can collect Crude Oil from the extractor by going up to it and pressing "Acquire" if one or more Crude Oils Are produced. It's recommended that you have a Transport Pal at your new base so they can take the Crude Oil from the extractor to a storage chest, so you don't have to do that yourself.</p><p>With your new Crude Oil, you can make Plasteel at an Electric Furnace or craft items such as Missile Ammo, Flamethrower Fuel, or other Technology menu unlocks.</p>

                <p>There are dozens of new Pals to capture in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a> following the Sakurajima DLC update, but perhaps none are more sought-after than Mimog. This treasure chest-shaped Pal was spotted in the original trailer for the Sakurajima DLC and immediately became a fan-favorite Pal. However, if you've tried to catch Mimog out in the wild, your feelings might have shifted due to the sheer elusiveness of the Pal. To see exactly where Mimog is located and how to capture it in Palworld, keep reading the guide below.</p><h2>Where to find Mimog in Palworld</h2><p>Fortunately for all you Mimog hunters out there, Mimog isn't exclusive to the Sakurajima Island. In fact, Mimog is found just about anywhere on the Palworld map. There are some areas where Mimog doesn't spawn, which are mainly low-level parts of the map. For the most part, though, you can find Mimog on a majority of the Palpagos Islands and Sakurajima Island.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322932-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-14.20.25.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322932" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322932-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-14.20.25.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322932"></a><figcaption>Mimog's possible spawns in Palworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322932-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-14.20.25.45.png"></figure><p>Mimog can spawn during the day or night as well, so you're not time-constrained in that regard. While Mimog is easy to find, though, catching the Pal is an entirely different matter.</p><h2>How to catch Mimog in Palworld</h2><p>Instead of wandering through a field or water like most other wild Pals, Mimog stays stationary out in the world. The Pal tries to imitate the treasure chests that you can find all over the islands on the map, not moving until you attack them or throw a Sphere.</p><p>When you first attack Mimog, they immediately sprint away in the opposite direction. This isn't a normal sprint either, as Mimog can go out of sight within a second or two. It's imperative that you see what direction Mimog runs away so you have the right heading when you go to chase them down. If you manage to catch up to Mimog, you can likely get one or two more attacks in before they run farther away.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322945-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.05.58.81.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322945" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322945-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.05.58.81.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322945"></a><figcaption>How Mimog appears in the wild</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322945-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.05.58.81.png"></figure><p>The best way I found of catching Mimog is to throw a Legendary or Ultimate Sphere at them right when I find one in the world. While your chances of catching it are low, depending on their level, this ensures Mimog can't run away without you having an attempt to get them into a Sphere. If Mimog breaks out of the Sphere, they will sprint away just like they would if you attacked it.</p><p>You can also try to stun Mimog using the Stun Baton weapon or a party Pal's attack, which subdues it for a few seconds. This gives you a better shot at capturing the Pal and you'll likely have a couple more chances to catch it before it runs away.</p><p>For those of you looking just to capture Mimog for your Paldeck's sake, then it's recommended to look for one in lower-level areas of the map. This gives you a better shot to catch the Pal with a more advanced Sphere. However, if you want to get the full Sakurajima experience in Palworld, then head to the new island and try to capture Mimog there. Mimogs are around levels 45-50 on Sakurajima Island, so you'll have to get lucky with a Legendary or Ultimate Sphere to capture the Pal.</p><h2>Mimog's Drops and Stats in Palworld</h2><p>If you're able to capture Mimog, you'll likely get some Dog Coins or regular Coins as a drop. You also have the chance to earn a Training Manual (XL), which grants the Pal that uses it a massive amount of XP. This item has the potential to increase a level 50 Pal to level 55 instantly, so use it wisely if you're lucky enough to earn the drop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322944-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-14.20.16.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322944" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322944-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-14.20.16.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322944"></a><figcaption>Mimog's Paldeck page</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322944-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-14.20.16.44.png"></figure><p>Mimog is a Neutral-type in Palworld that has the Partner Skill "Unlock." This skill allows you to use Mimig to unlock any locked treasure chest in the world without using a key. Of course, Mimog needs to be in your party for this skill to come into play. The higher level your Mimog is, the more advanced chests they can open. For example, if you have a high-level Mimog, you can freely open chests that previously required a Gold Key.</p><p>Finally, Mimog only has a level 1 Gathering Work Suitability, so they're practically worthless in your base. The best use-case for Mimog is as a party Pal that you use when exploring the map so you can open any chest you come across in Palworld.</p>
