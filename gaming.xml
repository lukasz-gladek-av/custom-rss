            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SAG-AFTRA members under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA), the contract under which video game companies hire voice actors for their games have overwhelmingly voted to approve the new version of the contract that had been negotiated for the last three years, officially bringing an end to the strike that began in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">July 2024</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-video-game-agreement">SAG-AFTRA announced</a> that the deal, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-reaches-tentative-deal-with-video-game-companies-voice-actors-strike-might-be-coming-to-an-end/">tentatively reached last month</a> and marked a suspension of the strike, was approved after 95.04% of members voted 'Yes' to ratifying the deal, with only 4.96% of members voting 'No.'</p>



<p>The core issue that kept negotiations going for so long, and that kicked off the strike, revolved around generative AI tools and actors wanting to ensure they would be protected against video game companies abusing the technology to use actors' voices and likenesses without properly compensating the actors and without the actors' consent. This new deal includes a pay raise for actors, but more significantly, it includes the protections that SAG-AFTRA members and contract negotiators were hoping to achieve.</p>



<p>"<em>The new contract also accomplishes performer safety guardrails and gains around A.I., including consent and disclosure requirements for A.I. digital replica use and the ability for performers to suspend consent for generation of new material during a strike</em>," SAG-AFTRA's statement on the deals ratification reads. </p>



<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said on the deal's approval, "<em>I commend the strong leadership of Interactive Media Agreement negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh, who remained steadfast through three years of hard bargaining while facing many challenging headwinds during a challenging negotiating cycle. This deal achieves important progress around A.I. protections, and progress is the name of the game! My sincere respect goes out to the entire video game performer community and their allies for their solidarity during the strike which provided the necessary leverage to secure this deal's many essential gains</em>."</p>



<p>Chief negotiator and SAG-AFTRA national executive director, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added, "<em>All of us at SAG-AFTRA would like to extend our deepest appreciation to the video game performers and allies who endured a great deal of sacrifice through the 11-month strike. I'd also like to express my sincerest gratitude to the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee, and its chair, Sarah Elmaleh, who have worked tirelessly for nearly three years in order to achieve these necessary gains and protections alongside our negotiating staff and lead negotiator Ray Rodriguez.</em>"</p>



<p>For the part of the video game companies like Take-Two, Activision, PlayStation, EA, and more on the other side of the aisle, spokesperson Audrey Cooling said, "<em>We are pleased that SAG-AFTRA members have ratified a new Interactive Media Agreement, which delivers historic wage increases, industry-leading A.I. protections, and enhanced health and safety measures for performers. We look forward to building on our industry's decades-long partnership with the union and continuing to create groundbreaking entertainment experiences for billions of players worldwide.</em>"</p>



<p>Now that the agreement has been ratified, actors under the IMA won't have to worry about another potential strike or negotiating period for at least a few years.  The conclusion of the strike also means that we won't have to see any games delayed due to companies not being able to hire actors to cast in their games.</p>

And it’s kind of funny, because the [<em>Fallout </em>show] is the furthest into the future. So there’s a lot of room where we don’t necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories, that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple.”</p><p>Rush explained that the show is “great” at telling a <em>Fallout </em>story as it is made by “big fans” of the franchise. As such, the games and shows go “together really well.” And that brings people from the Amazon series to the games. And some of these people will likely be expecting some content from the series, which Rush teased might be happening. </p><p>“Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it’s stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there,” said Rush. “I’m not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another.” </p><p>So I doubt Lucy will appear in <em>Fallout 76</em>, the timeline doesn’t support it. And fans are already mad about the <em>Fallout</em> timeline as it is. But it does sound like everyone involved with the show and games understands this time around how huge the series is and that doing some crossover content would be smart. There have been rumors for a while now about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>or <em>New Vegas</em> remaster. And season two of <em>Fallout </em>will feature New Vegas. Hmmm... something to think about. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-fallout-76-crossover-new-vegas-update-1851786026]]></content:encoded>

Now, Unknown Worlds has officially delayed Subnautica 2's early-access period to 2026. However, the studio also shared a new trailer for the game to tide over fans.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK5Nr1VtJ9Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oK5Nr1VtJ9Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a post on <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the developer's official site</a>, Unknown Worlds attributes the delay to a desire to improve "a few areas" following a private beta test out of a desire to make the game stronger. The devs also stated that the delay will allow Unknown Worlds to include additional biomes, vehicle upgrades, more tools and creatures, and an expanded story.</p><p>Subnautica 2's ousted director and designer Charlie Cleveland recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">his belief that Subnautica 2 is ready</a> for early-release now. A report earlier this week indicated that the delay may be due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">a $250 million bonus that Krafton was supposed to pay Unknown Worlds</a> if the company reached certain financial thresholds this year. Without Subnautica 2's early-access release, Unknown Worlds is unlikely to reach that goal in 2025.</p><p>That's why the YouTube comments under Subnautica 2's latest trailer are filled with remarks urging Krafton to pay the $250 million bonus instead of focusing on the game itself. Whether that show of support for the devs will achieve its goal remains to be seen.</p><p>Subnautica 2 will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>

<p dir="ltr">That's not the only difficulty change coming in the update. It will additionally introduce specific settings for player combat damage and enemy combat damage, allowing players to further fine tune their experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 1.2 is currently only available via Steam Beta (which players can opt into), but will be rolling out to all players at a later date. No specific release date was given for when the update will arrive for other platforms. To download the Steam Beta update, follow the steps below.</p><ol><li dir="ltr">Open your Steam Library and navigate to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li><li dir="ltr">Right click on "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered" and select "Properties"</li><li dir="ltr">In the new properties pop-up window, select "Betas"</li><li dir="ltr">In the beta drop down to opt into, select "\[beta]"</li><li dir="ltr">Wait for app to download new build and launch</li></ol><p>Oblivion Remastered's level-scaling and difficulty have been a major discussion point following its release. Early difficulties like Novice and Apprentice feel too easy, as does the default difficulty of Adept in many cases. However, making the jump to Expert can make it so combat quickly becomes a slog, with enemies capable of withstanding dozens of hits and enemies dealing significantly more damage to players. A middle ground between the two difficulties is a welcome solution.</p><p>Some performance optimizations are also coming alongside the new difficulty options. The patch notes state the update will reduce the "frequency of hitches in the open world" and brings improvements to character animation, weather, water rendering, lighting and shadows within several lairs, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">There are, of course, a slew of bug fixes as well, with remedies for issues like missing textures from Daedric statues and bugged vampire sleeping animations. You can read the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-first-update-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes/1100-6532121/" data-ref-id="1100-6532121">Oblivion Remastered's first major update</a> released in June and largely focused on addressing bugs and various technical issues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Co-op games are having a banner year so far in 2025. Games like <em>PEAK</em> and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere" rel="nofollow">Split Fiction</a></em>&nbsp;have been topping the charts on Steam all year, and don’t show any signs of slowing down. <em>Mycopunk </em>is another co-op focused game dropping in Early Access, and the current build shows a really fun experience for friends, and a promising start for solo players as well.</p>

<h2>Mission Accomplished</h2>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mycopunkhub.jpg?itok=e_0gzLCL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mycopunkhub.jpg?itok=SecSgOJ_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>Though it isn’t a roguelike, it’s hard for me to play <em>Mycopunk</em> without thinking of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/risk-of-rain-2-is-lootin-shootin-good-time" rel="nofollow"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></a>. The gameplay loop of accomplishing the mission, then getting the hell out of there, is simple but will get you hooked.</p>

<p>The major place <em>Mycopunk</em> diverges is the structure of missions. In <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, the mission is the same: get to the teleporter and defeat the boss.</p>

<p><em>Mycopunk</em>, on the other hand, demands something a little different out of your squad every time. Sometimes you’re just defeating swarms, sure. Other times, you need to connect satellites to a power node, prepare a railgun to take out a rival spy, or clear an infection off a planet’s surface.</p>

<p>These missions help keep every adventure out into the wilderness feel different. If the missions don’t make things feel different enough, though, your own equipment you deploy with will.</p>

<h2>Employee of the Month</h2>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mycopunkemployees.jpg?itok=9ZwT1qek 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mycopunkemployees.jpg?itok=fGLA0gZu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>At the launch of Early Access, <em>Mycopunk</em>&nbsp;includes 4 “employees” for you to choose from. I really enjoyed how the game divided the strengths of each character: they all have different mobility abilities, but weapons aren’t tied to any single character.</p>

<p>These movement abilities are all really varied, and while some feel clunky, there are more good than bad. I felt like the Scrapper’s Jetpack and Wrangler’s Rocket Lasso just didn’t click for me, but the highlights were the Glider’s Wingsuit and Scrapper’s Grapple Pole, which felt excellent to use.</p>

<p>One of the lacking features in the movement was momentum. While I could really get going with the Grapple Pole and Wingsuit, it felt like the moment I hit the ground, I was back to square one.</p>

<p>I have much fewer complaints, however, about the gunplay. Every weapon I tried felt pretty satisfying to use and offered unique ways to play with each character.</p>

<p>In particular, I love how ammo works. You will likely run out of ammo at some point, and when you do, to get it back, you must use your secondary weapon. It’s a perfect way to make sure you aren’t using any weapon in particular as a crutch.</p>

<p>One of the hardest tests <em>Mycopunk</em> is facing, and will continue to face in Early Access, is the balance between solo and co-op. I played entirely solo during my time, and it felt like the game was a little more skewed towards a team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of a teammate to revive, solo players get a set of 5 automatic revives. This makes fighting feel fair, but the missions feel pretty skewed towards co-op players. In addition, even with revives, the enemies will far outnumber you, and it can be hard to know which enemies to focus on and when. As a solo player, you might feel overwhelmed and frustrated more than having fun.</p>

<h2><em>Mycopunk </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mycopunkboss.jpg?itok=UIIqF6gR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mycopunkboss.jpg?itok=hz5-T9A1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>At the moment, I think&nbsp;<em>Mycopunk&nbsp;</em>is a strong start with a bright future. There are some pains that I would love to see it shed as it develops. I’d especially like to see some mission adjustments for solo play and some ability tweaks.</p>

<p>Despite that, if you’re looking for a new co-op shooter, you won’t be disappointed by <em>Mycopunk</em>. Tight gunplay, fun movement, and varied missions will keep you exploring the corporate wasteland for a long time. Just make sure to bring a coworker or two for the best results.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After selling out all of its limited stock of First Edition handhelds last year, ModRetro has announced that its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date">Chromatic Game Boy</a> is now permanently back in stock. The company is also introducing a new white-and-purple cloud color option, new game cartridges, and a collection of accessories that includes a rechargeable battery.</p><p>The Chromatic is now once again available for purchase through <a href="https://modretro.com/">ModRetro’s online store</a> in seven different colors: cloud, midnight, wave, inferno, bubblegum, volt, and leaf. Functionality is exactly the same as the First Edition versions of the Chromatic, and the handheld is still made with a durable magnesium alloy case and a pixel-perfect IPS screen that’s color-matched to the original Game Boy’s and Game Boy Color’s displays.</p><p>Pricing now starts at $199.99 and includes a modernized copy of <em>Tetris</em> that adds new gameplay features, but that’s for a version of the Chromatic featuring a screen protected by Gorilla Glass. The original First Edition version of the Chromatic featured more durable sapphire glass, and if you want that same level of screen protection it will now cost you $299.99.</p><p>The Chromatic can still be powered by three AA batteries that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey">based on our testing</a>, provide around seven or eight hours of gameplay with the handheld’s screen brightness reduced to 50 percent. If you don’t want to provide your own rechargeable AAs, ModRetro is also introducing a $29.99 rechargeable battery pack offering up to 16 hours of gameplay. Other new accessories include a $14.99 link cable for connecting two Chromatic handhelds for multiplayer, and a $14.99 Mod Kit letting you customize your Chromatic with swappable parts.</p><p>ModRetro is also <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games">expanding its games collection</a> today with five new cartridges featuring titles like <em>Sabrina: The Animated Series – Zapped!</em>, <em>Wicked Plague</em>, and a puzzle platformer called <em>Gravitorque</em> where you manipulate gravity instead of jumping (you can <a href="https://nikalego.itch.io/gravitorque">try it in your browser here</a>).</p><p>When the Chromatic originally debuted, the handheld’s creator, Palmer Luckey, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date">told <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister</a> that quantities would be limited and he wasn’t sure if he’d make more than what was needed to fulfill preorders. Today’s announcement is welcome news both for those who missed out on getting a Chromatic during its initial run last year and those who did get one, because this will help grow the Chromatic community and potentially encourage other companies to make new games and accessories for the handheld.</p><div><p>What hasn’t changed is that the Chromatic is still tied to a controversial figure. Although the Chromatic reflects Luckey’s past as a Game Boy modder before he created the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4122388/can-oculus-rift-save-virtual-reality">Oculus Rift VR headset</a>, he was an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/23/13025422/palmer-luckey-oculus-founder-funding-donald-trump-trolls">early Donald Trump supporter</a>, and after selling Oculus to Facebook <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/it-turns-out-palmer-luckey-was-fired.html">he was fired</a> following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15366500/palmer-luckey-trump-donations-chrono-trigger-oculus">controversial political donations</a>. Luckey went on to found Anduril, a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/im-a-propagandist-palmer-luckey-on-the-future-of-warfare-2000506276">defense contractor</a> that makes military tech, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/7/23392441/palmer-luckey-anduril-military-first-weapons-loitering-munitions-drones">lethal weaponized drones</a>.</p></div><p>The Chromatic may be one of the best ways to play classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, but if you feel that your enjoyment of retro gaming could be hampered by the handheld’s associations, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Analogue Pocket</a> offers comparable performance and cartridge support without any controversy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/700725/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-handheld-now-available]]></content:encoded>

Their answer was a perfect window into how game development often seems to work at Nintendo, with each new decision occurring as a response to previous ones rather than as a top-down structure superimposed upon the project from the start. While Pauline was suggested as a possible sidekick for the game early on, she wasn’t there from the beginning (<em>Bananza </em>started development as a Switch game, the pair confirmed). </p><p>“I think the moment we actually realized we would go in that direction came about as a result of an artist who created some concept art of the zebra transformation,” Motokura said. “We saw that image and thought it was really fun, so we immediately prototyped it to try it out in the game. And when our composer saw that, they decided to create specific music just for that transformation.”</p><p>He continued, “And the music for it was so good, we thought we could expand on this and turn it into a song and maybe Pauline would be a good choice to sing that song. And so we then asked the composer to create songs for each of the transformations and I think that’s what really cemented Pauline’s place.”</p><p>From there, a lot of other parts of the game started falling into place. <em>Donkey Kong</em> can’t speak but Pauline can, providing a narrative guide to Ingot Isle where the game takes place. Pauline’s music also became a clever way to mask game mechanics like pointing out which direction the player is supposed to go in. Co-op, meanwhile, lets a second player control her voice to stun enemies as DK is running along. Pauline is in the game because her character fits with cool gameplay ideas, not because Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745?_gl=1*wduhkz*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIxNjAyNTckbzQxJGcwJHQxNzUyMTYwMjYwJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745?_gl=1*wduhkz*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIxNjAyNTckbzQxJGcwJHQxNzUyMTYwMjYwJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..">cares about the <em>Donkey Kong</em> timeline</a></span>. </p><p>That doesn’t mean there’s no room for fun speculation about characters and crossovers, like whether <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is secretly a prequel to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>.

The device quickly sold out last year after it initially launched, and ModRetro says that new stock for it is now available.

Two models will be available--a $200 version with scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass and a $300 version equipped with Sapphire Glass that is designed to be extremely durable.</p><p>The Chromatic library will also expand with five new games, ranging from story-driven adventures to nostalgic re-releases. Sabrina: The Animated Series – Zapped is a re-release of the fast-paced platformer that was based on the cartoon series, Wicked Plague is an old-school metroidvania, and Self-Simulated has over 100 levels to conquer with precision platforming. Rounding out the new arrivals is First Contact Protocol--an adventure-puzzle game with branching choices and cinematic cutscenes--and the puzzle-platformer Gravitorque.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529614" data-ratio="0.3734375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529614"></a><figcaption>The new Chromatic colorway options.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg"></figure><p>All Chromatic units also come bundled with Tetris, and ModRetro has pledged to provide ongoing support and updates.

For the new accessories, you can choose from the following extras:</p><ul><li><strong>ModRetro Rechargeable Power Core ($29.99):</strong> A snap-in battery that adds up to 16 hours of gameplay power</li><li><strong>ModRetro Link Cable ($14.99):</strong> Enables couch co-op between Chromatics with head-to-head multiplayer support</li><li><strong>ModRetro Mod Kit ($14.99):</strong> High-quality swappable parts that can be used to customize the Chromatic</li><li><strong>ModRetro Koss Porta Pro ($49.99):</strong> A retro-inspired headset for the Chromatic</li></ul><p>While there are several modern versions of the Game Boy on the market today--most of which provide an emulated experience--the Chromatic is easily one of the best in its class. The $200 handheld console looks and feels like a classic Game Boy, but considering that it makes use of several high-quality parts, it's also an exceptionally well-built handheld overall that can easily run all of your original Game Boy cartridges.</p><p>"ModRetro's Chromatic is a truly superb recreation of the Game Boy Color," Steven Petite wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/">ModRetro Chromatic review</a>. "If you want a near-exact replica of your childhood Game Boy with a backlit screen, this is the handheld for you. At $199, and even if you didn't get a great new spin on Tetris, I'd argue the Chromatic is a bargain due to its ridiculously premium build. But this is a bargain for a <em>very </em>specific type of retro gamer."</p>

                <p>Following a successful four years as a mobile exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-archive/" data-ref-id="5000-527462">Blue Archive </a>released on Steam earlier this month. On face value it seems to have been a successful launch, topping 20,000 concurrent players and 10,000 Steam reviews. However, according to a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Hd10zoJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now-removed Nexon forum post</a>, the developer ran an in-game event incentivizing players to leave reviews on Valve's platform, something which is clearly disallowed in the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steamworks documentation</a>.</p><p>The in-game event description explained that once Blue Archive's Steam review count had reached 10,000, all players would receive five Gift Choice Boxes and five Beautiful Bouquets in-game. The event was due to run from July 4-11, but there is no longer any mention of it when opening Blue Archive. Interestingly, the Steam reviews have exceeded Nexon's goal of 10,000. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529631" data-ratio="0.635" data-width="2000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529631"></a><figcaption>Blue Archive is facing allegations of ignoring the Steam rules.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg"></figure><p>As spotted by one user on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3557620/discussions/0/601909292780678855/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam forums </a>for the game, the Steamworks documentation clearly states that it is not permitted "to abuse or artificially manipulate the review system" nor should anyone "solicit reviews in exchange for any games, DLC, money, or other rewards" with the only exceptions being sending copies of the game to press or creators for previews or reviews. Additionally, developers should not "ask customers to review" games from within the game itself. GameSpot has reached out to Nexon for comment.</p><p>Blue Archive is a tactical RPG with gacha elements, meaning that it utilizes a random draw system which uses the in-game currency of Pyroxene to determine which students, or characters, players receive. Through limited recruitment events, the "drop" rate of specific students can be raised, incentivizing players to use more Pyroxene to try to get the anime girl they're seeking.</p><p>Blue Archive isn't the only anime girl game trending on Steam right now. Following its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-train-and-race-anime-horse-girls-for-free/1100-6532908/" data-ref-id="1100-6532908">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> is also seeing huge figures, topping 50,000 concurrent players at its peak so far.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is once again at the top of the pile with a further 114,106 units sold, putting the total at almost 1.3 million. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is climbing the top ten to land at number four, selling 7,441 copies in the week.</p>
<p>It's a good week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>, too. Despite our rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">negative review of the game</a>, Japan's love for Tamagotchi puts both the Switch and Switch 2 versions in the top ten.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-is-ending-online-support-for-need-for-speed-rivals-in-october-2025.1240482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that online support for Need for Speed: Rivals will be ending later this year on October 7, 2025. The shutdown was spotted by <a href="https://delistedgames.com/ea-returns-today-to-announce-need-for-speed-rivals-will-lose-online-services-october-7th/">Delisted Games</a>, where a reader noticed Rivals had been added to <a href="https://www.ea.com/legal/service-updates/i-q#:~:text=N-,October%207%2C%202025,-NEED%20FOR%20SPEED">EA's list of games</a> that are getting their online services shutdown.</p>



<p>Need for Speed: Rivals launched over a decade ago, on November 15, 2013, and originally launched for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, before coming to Xbox One and PS4 a year later in October 2014. The shutdown of online services is for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, meaning that players on those devices and on current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, will no longer be able to play any of the game's online modes after October 7, 2025.</p>



<p>Racing against other players online is the core driving factor for why most racing fans play racing games, Need for Speed included, but at least in the case of Rivals, there is still an offline mode for players to dig into, if they want to revisit Rivals after October 7. But that's not the case for several online-focused games that have been shut down recently, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/">Anthem</a>, which EA recently announced will have its online functionality shut down in early 2026, effectively making the game unplayable.</p>



<p>Games like Anthem essentially being taken away from players is at the crux of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, which is trying to get legislation passed that prohibits developers and publishers from taking away rights that they sold to players at the point of the game's purchase. </p>



<p>The campaign began last year and has recently been a hot topic of discussion regarding game preservation, as the petition recently surpassed 1 million signatures. In response, several of the video game industry's biggest publishers and developers, many of whom pull in hundreds of millions of dollars each year, some of them even billions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">claimed that the proposals made by Stop Killing Games, if accepted</a>, would make creating online-focused games "<em>prohibitively expensive</em>."</p>



<p>Minecraft creator Markus Persson, commonly known as Notch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-creator-buying-game-purchase-pirating-not-theft/">also recently weighed in on the campaign</a>, saying "<em>If buying a game is not a purchase, then pirating them is not theft</em>," referencing the argument from publishers that players don't actually buy games at the point of purchase, but a license to play them until such time that publisher decides players don't get that privilege any more. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-dlc-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-dlc-delayed-to-later-this-year.1240476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Creative Assembly and publisher Sega have announced that&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC has been delayed to "later this year".</p>

<p>Originally,&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>was intended to launch this summer, but as Creative Assembly reveals in a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/75" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new blog post</a>, the DLC won't be meeting that release window. Instead,&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>will be launching sometime later in 2025, although the studio doesn't commit to a more specific release window than that.</p>

<p>Creative Assembly says that during recent playtesting for&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment</em>, the studio's developers asked themselves if the DLC "met the standards...set in recent releases", and as you've probably gathered from the delay, the answer was no.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-delayed-firebreathing_0.jpg?itok=YsOA1tEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-tides-of-torment-delayed-firebreathing_0.jpg?itok=aGDp_7tf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC is going to take a bit longer to launch.</figcaption></figure><p>As a result of this dissatisfaction, Creative Assembly says it's going to spend some time "working on [<em>Tides of Torment</em>], reviewing the content, and improving the gameplay experiences that it’s set to bring".</p>

<p>That also means that the info shared as part of the Slaanesh and Norsca previews released back in May is probably "no longer accurate", according to Creative Assembly. More will be shared about these factions, as well as the third and final DLC faction, when the final What's Next video for&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>arrives.</p>

<p>The studio acknowledges that this year "has been a slower year" for many&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>fans, and that while <i>Warhammer III&nbsp;</i>"is in a better space" this year than in previous years, Creative Assembly is "currently not meeting [its] commitments" to transparency, pledging to address this issue over the next few months through new updates, hotfixes, and preview videos.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, Creative Assembly closes by saying that "one of the biggest <em>Total War: Warhammer</em> content packs ever created in the trilogy" is coming next year, and that the possibility of smaller DLC packs that include certain legendary lords or hero units is also on the table.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer III&nbsp;</em>is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and you can remind yourself of what our very own Andrew thought of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-warhammer-3-review" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. The&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch sometime later this year.</p>

That feels unlikely, given the strict control developer Rockstar employs over everything related to GTA that is public-facing. Perhaps it’s just an Easter egg, or a joke.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/screenshot-2025-07-10-153846-1752158367371.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Travis Scott’s new music video for 2000 Excursion has sparked GTA 6 speculation.

Perhaps Travis Scott just has a song in the game. Others are joking that the “VI6” part of the license plate means Travis Scott is already excited for GTA 12.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Travis Scott is no stranger to the world of video games. He famously starred in a live virtual concert in Fortnite, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-travis-scott-fortnite-event-is-a-completely-immersive-experience">which fueled huge concurrent numbers for Epic’s battle royale</a> back in 2020.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With anticipation for Fallout Season 2, fans are wondering if Bethesda will capitalize on the smash hit Amazon show in a more significant way this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout Season 1</a> hit Prime Video in April 2024 and was an instant breakout hit. While the show’s popularity sparked a flood of new players across all Fallout games, Bethesda — and by extension parent company Microsoft — failed to make the most of it with, for example, the release of a new Fallout game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-why-not-having-a-new-fallout-game-ready-for-the-fallout-tv-shows-launch-actually-worked-out-for-the-best">Xbox boss Phil Spencer ended up insisting that everyone involved benefited from the show’s success</a>, and that not having a new game lined up for the launch “gave us some creative liberty that [we] wouldn't have had if we tried to coordinate production of two very different creative processes to land at the same time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That mention of “creative liberty” is a reference to the Fallout TV show’s canon status within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-official-timeline-confirmed-how-the-show-fits-in-with-the-games"><u>the Fallout timeline</u></a>, and the fact it takes place after all the existing Fallout games. While this has meant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-fans-are-convinced-a-brotherhood-of-steel-airship-confirms-one-of-two-canon-endings-from-fallout-4"><u>Fallout lore fans have analyzed the TV show to within an inch of its life</u></a>, its creators were able to move on from what’s gone before and tell a brand new story. If a new post-Fallout 4 video game had come out at the same time, Bethesda and the TV showrunners would have faced a tricky job ensuring all their Fallout timeline ducks were in a row.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But will Microsoft and Bethesda fail to capitalize on Season 2 of the Fallout show? When it comes to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, at least, it sounds like tie-in content is indeed planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Fallout 76 creative director Jon Rush said the development team is “always focused on the game,” but confirmed the two teams (TV show and video games) do talk to each other about “lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think a distinct trait of the Fallout 76 game is that we’re the furthest back in time,” he said. “And it’s kind of funny, because the show’s the furthest into the future. So there’s a lot of room where we don’t necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories, that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the show is very effective storytelling, great storytelling, very Fallout, being made by folks that are big fans of the game and the series, and so are we. The two go together really well. So folks see the show and want more of that same kind of story, and they’re going to come into 76, they’re going to come into Fallout 4, or come into Fallout 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it’s stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there. I’m not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Happy Bday Fallout: New Vegas</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we don’t know what exactly Bethesda is planning for the launch of Fallout Season 2, but we do know <em>something</em> is in the works for Fallout 76. There are still a lot of unanswered questions. For one, we don’t have a Fallout Season 2 release date yet. Could Bethesda have a new Fallout video game in the works to go alongside the show? There is about as much anticipation for a new Fallout game as there is for Fallout Season 2 — and the speculation to go along with it as remaster and remake rumors swirl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But perhaps we shouldn’t hold our breath. In June last year, Bethesda development chief Todd Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>he wasn't interested in rushing the next Fallout game out the door</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76... we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, a brand new Fallout game is coming down the pipe, with Howard confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a> is in the long-term plan, potentially after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a> comes out. As for Fallout Season 2, it's off to New Vegas, the setting of Obsidian's much-loved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Greetings, Arsians! We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, and I'm not just talking the latest AAA blockbusters—we love <em>all</em> kinds of games, from modern to ancient and all points in between.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we're trying something different for the next few months to see how it goes: We've partnered with the folks at <a href="https://www.gog.com/">GOG.com</a> to create <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fpartner%2FArsTechnica">a store page featuring a hand-curated list</a> of some of our favorites from GOG's catalog. At the end of every month, we'll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.</p>
<p>(Please forgive the messy affiliate link—it points to <code>https://www.gog.com/en/partner/ArsTechnica</code> if you'd prefer to go there directly, but arriving on GOG's site via that affiliate link gives Ars a small portion of revenue for anything you buy during your session once you're there. This helps us out quite a bit!)</p>
<p>About twice a month, we'll publish an article like this one, where we'll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you've heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go.</p>
<p>This is the first step in what will hopefully be a broader partnership where we'll offer neat stuff like GOG discount codes; keep your eyes peeled and I'll have the second July post in a couple of weeks with more details!</p>
<h2>This week’s game is <em>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</em></h2>
<p>There weren't a lot of great Star Trek gaming options in the early '90s. If you wanted to put on your genuine licensed Starfleet uniform and save the galaxy in a starship named <em>Enterprise</em>, you were limited primarily to janky text-based titles like <em><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1210/star-trek-the-kobayashi-alternative/">Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative</a></em>.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That changed with the 1992 release of <em><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstar_trek_25th_anniversary">Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</a></em>, or <em>ST25</em> to its friends, which brought the original series <em>Enterprise</em> and its crew to life in glorious 256-color VGA. And to players' vast relief, it was not a half-baked effort—locations like the <em>Enterprise</em> bridge were lovingly recreated, with beautiful atmospheric sound effects lifted straight from the TV show permeating every scene. The character art is sharp, and it's easy to tell Bones from Spock. The entire game is like a love letter to OG Trek.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given the time, <em>ST25</em> is a mouse-driven point-and-click adventure game. It's broken up into seven discrete chapters, with each chapter being a self-contained mission with problems to solve and objectives to accomplish. Starfleet Command is always watching—complete the minimum number of objectives and an admiral will give you a middling performance review. Go above and beyond and do everything, even your bonus objectives, and you'll have lavish praise heaped upon you by a grateful admiralty.</p>
<p>The missions themselves tend to follow a pattern. Each starts with the crew of the <em>Enterprise</em> on the bridge as Kirk makes a log entry. Starting with the CD-ROM issue of the game, all the lines are fully voiced by the original cast, so every mission kicks off with Bill Shatner's familiar "Captain's log..." lead-in telling us what we need to examine, investigate, locate, or shoot at. (Sadly, the only major voice cast omission in this one is Majel Barrett as the computer.)</p>
<p>Then there's what I always felt was the weakest part of the game: Most missions kick off with some sort of space battle, where the player has to awkwardly maneuver the <em>Enterprise</em> with the mouse, dodging phaser blasts and photon torpedoes (or just eating them because the controls are just that awful) and trying to blow the other ship up before it does the same to you.</p>

<p>Then, if you survive the mandatory space battle, you'll find yourself as Jim Kirk beaming down to a mysterious planet or over to an abandoned ship or station, scanning things with your tricorder and shooting things with your phaser. You're accompanied by a small landing party, most often made up of Spock, McCoy, and a redshirt, and no, the redshirt does <em>not</em> always make it back to the ship.</p>

<p>The game is at its best during these away missions, each of which is unique and all of which are absolutely swimming in note-perfect TOS nostalgia, from the sound effects to the visual design and intent. Layer on top of that some banter between McCoy and Spock while you work through some good ol' combine-object-X-with-object-Y adventure game puzzles, and you have an engaging and atmospheric little game, with enough complexity to keep you busy for at least a dozen hours or so.</p>

<p>And great news: If you really fall in love with the game, there's a sequel: <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_trek_judgment_rites">Star Trek: Judgment Rites</a></em>. <em>Judgment Rites</em> is essentially a straight continuation of <em>ST25</em>, made with the same engine, voice cast (this time with Majel Barrett), type of missions, and commitment to detail.</p>
<p>Feel like giving <em>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</em> a whirl? <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstar_trek_25th_anniversary">Grab it for $9.99 on the GOG store!</a> The GOG-packaged bundle works out of the box on Windows and Linux, and since the GOG version is powered by DOSBox internally, making it work on a Mac should require only minor surgery.</p>

		<p>Creative Assembly has announced that it is delaying the release of the Total War: Warhammer III Tides of Torment DLC from this summer to later in the year, though no new date has yet been finalised. The reason being is that during playtesting the studio came to the conclusion that Tides of Torment was not meeting the standards expected.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Tides of Torment - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQNKhxbQKuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a post, Creative Assembly said, <em>“<span><span>In recent playtesting, we asked ourselves if this next DLC met the standards that we’ve set in recent releases, and the short answer was no. However, we know it can and so we want to spend more time working on it, reviewing the content, and improving the gameplay experiences that it’s set to bring. </span></span><span><span>These changes will likely mean the content we shared in our What’s Next videos for Slaanesh and Norsca is no longer accurate. As soon as we know the final shape of those changes, we’ll share them to you directly as part of the final What’s Next video to give you the complete picture on our third faction in this DLC and the changes to the other factions.</span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span><span>We know this is disappointing news. 2025 has been a slower year for many of you in our Warhammer communities, and we’re not oblivious to that. We’re proud of the updates that we’ve released for the game this year, but we know that what you love most about this game is the option to experience more of it, especially through the new gameplay styles offered by new Legendary Lords, all of the unique new units , and the focus we give to reworks and core game improvements.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Whilst the game is in a better space than in previous years thanks to the efforts we made through 2024, we are currently not meeting our commitments to be more active on these fronts, and we apologise for not being more transparent.”</span></span></em></p>

<p>Creative Assembly has also detailed what to expect over the coming months for Total War: Warhammer 3. In July, Siege improvements will be released for public testing, with the studio using feedback to tinker with these changes before fully releasing it. In August, update 6.3 will add quality of life improvements for Tomb Kings and Lizardmen, as well as some skill refreshes for orcs and goblins. There are no major updates planned for September, with hotfixes for 6.3 being a priority along with development of Tides of Torment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is yet another game like<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-has-been-in-development-since-the-launch-of-the-first-switch-console/"> Mario Kart World</a> whose development began on the original Nintendo Switch, but development was moved on to the Nintendo Switch 2, as the core mechanics' best implementation could only be possible on the new generation system.</p>



<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with&nbsp;IGN, Producer Kento Motokura and Director Kazuya Takahashi confirmed that the game development began on Nintendo's previous generation system. At the time, the development team was still using voxel technology and going over different ideas for applications, but as soon as they received news of the Nintendo Switch 2 development, they realized that the best implementation of the game's core mechanics would be on the new generation system.</p>



<p>According to Takashi-san, the continuity of destruction, which is an important part of the Donkey Kong Bananza experience, could be expanded on the Nintendo Switch 2. The system allowed the developer to create a rich variety of materials and very large-scale changes in the environment. Besides the system's better specifications, what really appealed to the development team were other features the Nintendo Switch 2 offered, like mouse controls, which can be used in co-op play.</p>



<p>During the interview, the Donkey Kong Bananza producer and director also went over how the game and its central mechanics came to be. The idea for the development of a Donkey Kong 3D game came from Yoshiaki Koizumi, Super Mario Odyssey producer and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat director, a prospect that prompted the team to get to learn more about the character from Shigeru Miyamoto, what makes him unique, and explore how these distinctive features could define a new game. Ultimately, the experiments with voxel technology featured in Super Mario Odyssey gave the development team the idea of destruction as a core mechanic, which worked well together with Donkey Kong's defining features.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on July 17 on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">preview</a>.</p>

Mr. Fantastic and the rest of his crew were long immune to this because it took nearly 20 years to introduce them to the MCU due to 20th Century Fox owning the film rights to the group, but Disney handled that the same way giant corporations always do: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_21st_Century_Fox_by_Disney&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_21st_Century_Fox_by_Disney" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devouring it like a gaping maw</a></span>.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Update: 7/10/25, 11:31 a.m.: </strong>Minutes after we published this story, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>announced a new set of skins based on <em>First Steps </em>in which Mr. Fantastic is looking a lot like Pascal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While I occasionally work as a games critic and editor, my full-time job is telling people to watch <em>Poker Face</em>. Absolutely no one has heard of it, despite its being one of the best things on TV right now. So here I combine my roles into one. Season two of the Peacock show wraps this week, meaning right now is exactly the correct time to start binging it all.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You don’t have to work hard to sell <em>Poker Face</em>. It goes like this: “You know the guy who does the <em>Knives Out</em> movies, Rian Johnson? Well, he also has a TV show, modeled on <em>Columbo</em>, but it’s Natasha Lyonne in the main role.” At this point, most people are already in. For others you need to add, “Yeah, from <em>Russian Doll</em>. And, sure, <em>American Pie</em>.”</p><p>When I say “modeled on <em>Columbo</em>,” that’s not me being cute. <em>Poker Face</em> follows the Peter Falk show’s format from concept through to title fonts. So, as with the ‘70s/’80s classic murder mystery, you know who the killer is from the beginning of each episode, the murder shown in a pre-titles vignette before Lyonne’s Charlie Cale appears. Titles and credits then appear in the familiar yellow text, and in season one, Lyonne is even perpetually holding a cigar and walking with the same peculiar gait. It’s a <em>joy</em>.</p><p>However, <em>Poker Face</em> is also very much its own show, too. Charlie Cale is an itinerant amateur detective, on the run from the mob after getting far too involved in the machinations of a Laughlin, Nevada casino. Cale, you see, has an innate ability to tell when anyone is lying. Not a practiced skill, not something she’s learned from years of the study of micro-expressions or whatever, but just a superpower. She has an almost involuntary response of “bullshit!” whenever she hears a lie. Which makes her an excellent poker player, but not well liked by those trying to keep dark secrets.</p><p>Each episode, Cale shows up in a new town, mostly living out of her car, trying to get work and inevitably becoming entwined in the lives of the murder victim, or indeed the murderer. After the opening scene showing the crime, the episodes almost always skip back some hours or days to then show how Charlie fits into the situation, followed by her reluctantly solving the killing.</p><figure id="" data-id="14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-recommend-id="image://14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-recommend-id="image://14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The show is exquisitely well written, and beautifully directed. Natasha Lyonne is a force, her take on Columbo a constant delight, always feeling like a distinct homage rather than an aping impression. And wow, the rest of the cast. Given Cale’s nomadic impermanence in any one spot, there are only a few occasionally recurring characters, meaning most episodes build the cast up from scratch. The program seems to have its pick of any actor it wants, with massive names appearing week after week. To name very few: Adrien Brody, Awkwafina, Jospeph Gordon-Levitt, Richard Kind, Katie Holmes, Giancarlo Esposito, Nick Nolte, John Mulaney, John Cho, Carol Kane, Lili Taylor, Method Man, Kumail Nanjiani...</p><p>The real skill of the show is to be able to bring in so many famous names, and have no one stick out like a Guest Star, but rather immediately establish deep, meaningful characters. Despite episodes lasting just 45 minutes to an hour, it paces itself so ideally, allowing you to get to know these people and to grow invested in Charlie’s relationships with them.</p><p>Because Charlie’s not a cop, it also frees the show to be far more morally ambiguous. This isn’t necessarily about capturing the evil killer and seeing justice dealt—while it sometimes definitely is that, there’s also room for far more nuance. Or, as is sometimes the case, for Lyonne just to find a resolution within the situation before moving on that doesn’t involve anyone being hauled away in handcuffs.</p><p>The mood of the show can also swing in some deft and impressive ways. While it’s <em>always</em> funny, that humor can become a lot darker, or a lot lighter, with incredibly breezy episodes between storylines that really take their toll on Charlie. She’s not asking for any of this, almost always dragged into a situation after she accidentally (and quite literally) calls bullshit. She hears the lie, and then can’t let it go. Sometimes that leads to excellent shenanigans, other times to losing newfound friendships. And sometimes she’s solving the murder of a school hamster.</p><figure id="" data-id="81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-recommend-id="image://81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-recommend-id="image://81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of the 21 episodes that have aired, with one more appearing today, July 10, there hasn’t been a dud. There’s none that feel like a drag, or that felt phoned in. As such, if you’ve not watched at all, then there’s no need to suggest you begin with a particular highlight, or offer a suggested list—just start with the first and blitz your way through. There <em>are</em> chronological elements to the overall arc, so it benefits from watching through in order, even if each episode also successfully stands alone.</p><p>Rian Johnson’s love of ‘70s and ‘80s crime drama and televised whodunits helped make <em>Knives Out</em> and <em>Glass Onion</em> so incredibly fun, with Daniel Craig’s detective Benoit Blanc a sort of amalgam of all their protagonists, perhaps with the heaviest dose of <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>’s Jessica Fletcher. In <em>Poker Face</em>, he draws from the same well, but with <em>Columbo </em>as that main source instead. And its respect for those programs hides no embarrassment, no sense that it needs to pastiche or satirize, but instead proudly delivers a modern version of the same. Yes, there’s cursing, and it’s perhaps a touch more brutal in some of the murders than you’d have gotten away with on ‘70s network TV, but the spirit is the same. And no, Lyonne doesn’t turn around every episode and say, “Ah, just one more thing...”—although there are very occasional lovely allusions toward it.</p><figure id="" data-id="5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-recommend-id="image://5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-recommend-id="image://5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Likely the reason so few are on top of this incredible show is because it’s on Peacock, and, well, unless you’re after the <em>SNL</em> archives, there’s not a great deal of other motivation to pay yet another monthly subscription. But with the second season wrapping up today, now is the perfect moment to find a free trial, or pay a one-off to get it for a month. (Make sure to set a reminder to cancel it a couple of days before it’s due to renew—you’ll forget otherwise, you know you will.)</p><p>You’ll love it. You’ll love everything about it. It’s so funny, and warm, and just so incredibly well made. It’s kind of unbearable to know that after today, it’ll likely be a year before we get to see any more—and that’s <em>if</em> it’s picked up for a third run, on which there’s no word yet. So, if nothing else, watch it just so you push up the numbers and I get to see some more. For me.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/poker-face-peacock-natasha-lyonne-rian-johnson-columbo-1851786010]]></content:encoded>
