            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has reportedly decided not to continue to market Xbox Consoles in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), focusing solely on marketing Game Pass, controllers, and its Cloud feature instead. This consideration comes after they announced that they are hiking up <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">Game Pass prices</a>, which has caused a huge stir in the gaming community.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been peddling that you <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-dont-need-an-xbox-to-play-xbox-says-new-fire-tv-app-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no longer need an Xbox to play</a> or utilize Xbox services, with many day-one Xbox releases also being released on PC. Alongside this, they promote their Game Pass subscription, offering plenty of offers to new subscribers, especially through the Discord Nitro gifts.</p>
<p>All of the recent changes within the Xbox team have come as Microsoft is beginning to navigate its new financial year, which means plenty of changes are to be expected. We have already seen many Xbox employees being <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-xbox-layoffs-at-microsoft-inbound-this-week-tom-warren-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a>.</p>
<p>A while ago, Tom Warren of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196361/microsoft-xbox-no-console-required-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> received a tip suggesting that Microsoft was shifting its focus on promoting its consoles for the new financial year. As it stands, the tip has not been fully verified, so this information may yet turn out to be incorrect. However, considering the significant changes we've seen Microsoft make so far, especially this week, it doesn't sound so outlandish.</p>
<p>This change wouldn't be a shock, as we have seen declining sales of their Xbox Series X|S consoles across EMEA markets for a while, with plenty of gamers choosing a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, or PC instead. If this change goes ahead, we will see Microsoft focus less on consoles in Europe, meaning we could see a price hike as people would scalp them and then sell them through third parties. While the tip said it would affect the EMEA markets, it specified that it would only be in certain EMEA markets. At the moment, it is uncertain which markets across Europe will be affected.</p>
<p>Additionally, Xbox has released a dedicated app is available on Amazon Fire TV stick, where you can utilize Xbox services without the console. Should Microsoft undergo these changes, it will be interesting to see where the stock allocation goes instead. Especially as they have recently announced their brand-new disc-less Xbox Series X console. What does this mean for Xbox gamers in Europe, and will prices increase as a result?</p>
<p>If Microsoft confirms that it is ceasing EMEA console marketing, hopefully, it will expand and specify which markets will be affected so consumers can make a financial choice before the change.</p>

<p>Intel’s next lineup of CPUs has been confirmed thanks to an update from <a href="https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html#version-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPU-Z</a>. Launching later this year — current rumors range from October to December — Intel will be releasing its Arrow Lake-S lineup of processors. </p>



<p>Based on the CPU-Z update, there will be at least six new SKUs coming. All of them will also feature the new naming convention from Intel for its CPUs.</p>



<p>There will be two SKUs in each CPU tier with the new lineup: Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and 275, Core Ultra 7 265K and 255, and Core Ultra 5 245K and 240. There will be no Core 3 processors with the new lineup.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While we know the CPUs are officially Arrow Lake, what we don’t know are the exact specifics of the new chips. According to rumors, the Core Ultra 9 285K and 275 are expected to have 24 cores and 24 threads. The Ultra 7 CPUs will feature 20/20 while the Ultra 5 245K will have 14c/10t and the 240 will have 10c/10t.</p>



<p>Intel is expected to fully reveal its next lineup of CPUs in the coming months. That will give everyone their first look and the new generation from the blue team.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-2024-viewership-suffer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As the 2024 season has unravelled, viewers have become less interested in the Call of Duty League. Last year, record-high numbers were recorded, but the 2024 season hasn’t delivered against expectations, which wasn’t helped by Activision pivoting to an exclusivity deal with YouTube late last year.</p>



<p>Since Major I took place in January, viewership has declined with each successive tournament, with Major IV – which took place behind closed doors – landing a peak viewer count of just 109,764 users, a woeful low for Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>If this trend continues, the 2024 Call of Duty League Championship could suffer immeasurably from a lower viewer count.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-cod-esports-dying">Are COD Esports Dying?</h2>



<p>Call it a disappointing game or foul decisions made by the tournament organisers, something somewhere has gone wrong with the Call of Duty League. This monopolised, franchised tournament has rubbed fans wrong since day one, with Activision Blizzard opting to scrap the more open-ended COD World League in favour of something stricter and more regimented back in 2020.</p>



<p>This season has been particularly miserable for fans. Here’s the downward trend we’ve noticed in terms of peak Major viewership over the year (data courtesy of <a href="https://escharts.com/tournaments/cod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">escharts.com</a>):</p>



<ul>
<li>Major I: 245,437</li>



<li>Major II: 244,478</li>



<li>Major III: 238,499</li>



<li>Major IV: 109,764</li>
</ul>



<p>Traditionally, things are kicked up a notch when COD Champs rolls around, and this is where all the viewers come out of the woodwork to tune in, watching the best Call of Duty teams in the world fight for the lion’s share of a $2.3 million prize. However, viewership still isn’t back to where it was during the first season of the COD League where Champs is concerned:</p>



<ul>
<li>Champs 2020: 331,000</li>



<li>Champs 2021: 238,794</li>



<li>Champs 2022: 275,244</li>



<li>Champs 2023: 294,178</li>
</ul>



<p>Last season, Major III pulled in record-high viewership figures, with a peak count of 335,170 users tuning in to catch the action unfold in Texas. It was an intense tournament that saw Toronto Ultra win a chip, with controversial rookie, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scrap-cdl-adderall-call-of-duty/">Scrap</a>, securing the MVP award. Modern Warfare 2 proved to be a solid title for the CDL, and the COD Champs Grand Final last year saw records broken and dreams shattered – and achieved – in a monumental fashion.</p>



<p>But there’s just no real appetite for it this year, it seems. Modern Warfare 3 was a disappointment, the map pool isn’t inspired, and a lot of beef behind the scenes and on the stage has led to many feeling a bit bummed out overall. We’ve had concerns about abuse in the League this year, and some sketchy updates have flipped the meta around too inconsistently for most players to track.</p>



<p>Will this year’s Call of Duty League Championship, which is being hosted by OpTic Texas, be a success, or will the viewer count drop yet again? We’ll know soon enough – the tournament takes place between July 18 – 21. There’s also an immense conflict at play there – on July 18, the final stages of the Modern Warfare 3 tournament at the Esports World Cup will unfold, adding more strain to the CDL’s viewer count.</p>



<p>Let’s see what happens.</p>

I like to participate in such events, as making a game from scratch in 48 hours is a great way to relax.</p><p>Based on the theme, I came up with the idea of “people running out of energy” and built a simple character who was slumped on a couch. I posted a screenshot of it and got a lot of likes—not because of my modeling skills, but due to the resonance of exhaustion the character exuded.</p><p>I decided to make a game with this exhausted character—so he couldn’t just stay slumped on the couch, he needed to move. We’re all familiar with how our bodies feel when we’re extremely tired, standing up was not an option, so I made him crawl on the floor.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This crawling animation got even more likes. I tested the crawling maneuver on the ground in real life and it hurt all over. But since people liked it, I kept it.</p><p><strong>Crawling Like a Bug</strong></p><p>To crawl, especially on walls, humans need to learn from bugs. First, we made a ladybug that can crawl on any surface in a 3D environment.</p><p>The character’s head could copy the way the ladybug moves, but there was still a long body behind the head to account for. What bug is like that? Caterpillars. So, we implemented a feature named caterpillar bones, responsible for anchoring the body to the environment based on the head’s position. So, when you see a person crawling in the game, it’s actually based on the inner workings of a crawling caterpillar.</p><p><strong>Soft as Noodles</strong></p><p>For a long time, the character’s body was like a normal person’s, with bendy arms and legs split in two. Although he could only crawl, he was at least somewhat human. Until our artist drew some promo art.</p><p>We liked the art so much that we thought it was okay even if it wasn’t so human-like—after all, he’s exhausted, right? So, we broke each bone into small pieces, giving the character’s limbs a noodle-like flexibility. </p><p><strong>Variable Energy States</strong></p><p>The protagonist needs to complete various events to achieve the goal of the night, and his energy state will change accordingly. For example, eating something raises energy. After eating, the character’s head will shine gold and they’ll gain more speed and strength. On the other hand, when the character fixes a game bug it takes on the opposite effect. The character’s face will become haggard and start to yawn a lot. Yawn bubbles will also knock the character to sleep.</p><p>But no matter the energy state of the character, they’ll never stand up!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Exhausted Man - Teaser Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_xdgYoU-vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

More importantly, the series is so big in part because there are players out there who make it their One release for the holiday season—if not the entire year—and are fine with just handing over $60 or $70 every fall.

		<p><em>It’s July, which means for many parts of the world, it’s hot as hell right now. 75 degrees ain’t always 75 degrees, if humidity has anything to say about it. Your solution to the heat might be huddling in the AC with a video game, or heading to the beach. We all deal with summer—with seasons, really—in different ways. But summer and winter, the most extreme of the seasons, are different beasts.</em></p><p><em>Which got Rob and Patrick thinking about summer itself, and how their relationship has changed with it not only over the years, but the decades. Summer as a kid is not summer as an adult. Hell, it’s not the same as summer as a teenager. It’s only three months, but a long three months.</em></p><p><em>For some, it stirs memories of endless hours on summer break, doing whatever you please. For others, it’s toiling in the yard, whether under the lax supervision of parents vainly attempting a new project or playing soldier in the background. You might be able to guess who did the last one.</em></p><p><em>In any case, summer. It's just a season, Michael. How hot could it get?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Hey Rob, it’s early July. One of the first exchanges you and I had since coming back from the holiday break was about the heat. (It’s okay here right now, sounds like it’s worse by you?) Growing up in the Midwest, I’m used to rapidfire weather changes, and broadly, the heat does not bother me. Humidity sucks, don’t get me wrong, but I think a lot of my indifference—or learned acceptance—has to do with growing up around a pool or lake during huge parts of my life. I associate the warm weather, ironically, with cooling off. I could spend all day in the water, and as we talked about on the HOA podcast this week, chasing that feeling was a huge part of why I poured so much time and effort into getting an above ground pool into our yard this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, when I think back about some of my fondest memories with video games, it’s the summer, especially those years before I was gently—and then more forcibly—encouraged to get a job during those months between school years. It was an opportunity to fully and completely indulge, which is what led me to seeing how far the in-game clock for Final Fantasy VII will keep ticking up and up. For the record, it’s 99 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds, and then you’re on your own. I’m pretty sure I hit that moment while grinding a goofy chocobo mini-game that helped you uncover an ultra-powerful spell in the game, a summon called Knights of the Round.&nbsp;</p><p>Knights of the Round was, in fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9aI5RkoeQ&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>sick as hell.</u></a> Worth it? Who can say. I was a kid, long before I stumbled into the person I am today, who spends too much time trying to be <em>efficient </em>with time. But I miss those days where I’d just give myself over to a game, usually an RPG, and stay up until the wee hours of the morning, because I didn’t have to get out of bed until closer to noon.</p><p>There was a rhythm to those days, as lackadaisical as they were. When I couldn’t escape from the heat in a giant vat of water, I would escape from the heat inside with a stack of video games.</p><p>Now, I associate summer with being out of sync. With two kids and thus, an increasing pool of social obligations, my summer weekends are booked before May ends. This summer has been <em>particularly </em>out of sync, because I was out of town three weekends in a row—Summer Game Fest, then a funeral, and finally our big in-person stream—and now I’m pairing a Remap company break around July 4th with a family vacation soon after. One third of the summer has already passed by, but it barely feels like I’ve found my footing in one of my favorite seasons.</p><p>The one constant, though, has been my Steam Deck. I know this device is only a few years old, but it’s genuinely hard to imagine my life without it at this point. At least, it’s hard to untangle my relationship with video games without the Steam Deck, because it’s become my summer out of sync device. If I’m on an airplane, I can pull out the Steam Deck. If I’m in a hotel, I can pull out the Steam Deck. If I’m at a gymnastics practice for one of my kids, I can—well, you get the idea.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like it helps me have one foot in one world, while I’m existing in another.</p><p>It may seem like a goofy frustration to express, but part of my adoration of the Midwest—and I’m sure this is true for you on the East Coast—is shifting behaviors in the direction of the seasonal changes. There are only certain things you do, or eat, or <em>play</em>, during parts of the year, and especially when fall and spring are so fleeting, time to make good on those can be precious.</p><p>What’s your relationship with the summer months, and how’s that changed over the years?</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Infinite Wealth</em></i><span>. Now there's a game that understands how to enjoy the heat.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I used to really hate the heat, so summer was always my least favorite season. I think part of my hatred, though, was the fact my parents loved to press me into helping with yardwork and home maintenance projects that were always murderously boring and actively miserable in the heat. “Go weed underneath the bushes,” they’d tell me, handing me a bucket and a trowel and gesturing at a forty-yard line of vine-invested shrubs that wrapped around part of our lawn. They’d be stunned how long it was taking me, then they’d show me how they would have done it, and I realized that usually it was because they were doing a bad job, missing most of the new shoots of weeds erupting in the topsoil, which is probably why the weeds were thriving more than the bushes.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, the demands for me to do yardwork were replaced by demands I go get a summer job, which I must admit did give me a lot of valuable experiences and exposure to jobs and types of people I might not otherwise have encountered, but is also what led me to taking up smoking. It was also when I began to suspect that my parents no longer really knew how the world worked, perplexed as they were by the fact that simply walking to various shops or cold-calling businesses in the Yellow Pages and politely asking if they needed help did not immediately yield gainful employment.</p>

It’s good, even. It’s the image that accompanied this heartfelt message that has fans making a ruckus.</p><p>The attached graphic includes Chuck, the yellow bird featured in a lot of <em>Angry Birds</em> movies and TV shows. He’s been in the <em>Angry Birds Toons</em> animated series, and has a starring role in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/angry-bird-movie-trailer-hits-way-after-the-fad-is-over-1732568856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/angry-bird-movie-trailer-hits-way-after-the-fad-is-over-1732568856">CG-animated films</a></span>, where he’s voiced by <em>Frozen </em>star Josh Gad. But behind him in the post on X is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.colorado.edu/cisc/pride-flag-guide&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.colorado.edu/cisc/pride-flag-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Ally flag,”</a></span> which includes a rainbow-colored “A” in front of a black-and-white striped background.</p><p>Whatever the intention was, fans took this to be a declaration that Chuck is only an ally of the queer community, rather than a part of it himself. Meanwhile, here’s a clip from the 2016 film of him fantasizing about another man’s ass.</p><p>Some fans also point to the unhinged 2018 episode of the <em>Angry Birds Toons </em>series called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1T3dAvFeio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1T3dAvFeio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Miracle of Life”</a></span> as evidence of the bird being queer. In the episode, Chuck and <em>Angry Birds </em>protagonist Red are locked in a cage by the evil pigs to make them fuck. This is not an exaggeration, this is literally what happens. They’re trying to get them to make an egg for them to eat. It’s a whole thing. But Chuck blushes at the notion rather than reacting with immediate anger, which some fans read as further evidence of him liking boy birds.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Y’all choose the gayest character to make the ‘straight ally,’” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://@thelameshiver&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://thelameshiver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheLameShiver wrote</a></span>.</p><p>“THAT BOY IS *NAWT* AN ALLY THAT IS A WHOLE ASS FRUIT BASKET RIGHT THERE,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FIeshbook/status/1810372940267221165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FIeshbook/status/1810372940267221165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FIeshbook said</a></span>.</p><p>“So he’s like the straight friend that swears he’s straight but does the gayest things ever,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AShortGuy_/status/1810669118342983724&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AShortGuy_/status/1810669118342983724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AShortGuy_ replied</a></span>.</p></blockquote><p>Some fans elected to just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Mista_Blizzard/status/1810692386026111201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Mista_Blizzard/status/1810692386026111201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“fix” the graphic</a></span> by putting the standard Pride flag in the background instead. Doing so would have both likely felt true to fans’ perception of the character over the years while also giving the <em>Angry Birds</em> brand some plausible deniability if they weren’t ready to commit that hard. Some of the responses claiming Chuck isn’t straight have been hidden by the official account, but they were mostly ones that either had profanity or direct references to bangin’. There are also some predictably bigoted responses in the hidden replies, so look through them at your own risk.</p><p>The <em>Angry Birds </em>brand has been incredibly online over the years, using platforms like TikTok to create its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/angry-birds-red-tiktok-smash-pass-sega-sonic-sex-1850368291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/angry-birds-red-tiktok-smash-pass-sega-sonic-sex-1850368291">own versions of popular memes and trends</a></span>.

So I find it hard to believe that no one was aware that a pretty sizable number of <em>Angry Birds</em> fans read Chuck as queer.

<p>The Esports World Cup is in full flow in Riyadh, and the list of brands and companies sponsoring the eight-week-long competitive showcase grows longer by the day. More brands have partnered with or sponsored the Esports World Cup than you’d see at most super-sized sporting events, marking the prominence and profile of the ambitious showcase for all to see. </p>



<p>With a prize pool worth $60 million and 21 games being featured over the two months, the Esports World Cup certainly is the biggest esports event in history.</p>



<hr>







<p>Plenty of brands have signed up to have their logo represented somewhere during the Esports World Cup. It’s an event that has already pulled in tens of millions of viewers, and as it’s set to run through August, there’s plenty of length left in the road for other brands to get on board.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that the likes of Mentos, Heinz, and Pepsi all stood up to link their labels with the EWC, which is taking place in Saudi Arabia. That’s only a small assortment of big-brand, household names sponsoring the grandest tournament in esports, though.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of Esports World Cup sponsors:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sony</li>



<li>Amazon</li>



<li>Honor</li>



<li>Moonton</li>



<li>Sportfive</li>



<li>The Esports Awards</li>



<li>Level Infinite</li>



<li>Bayes Esports</li>



<li>GRID</li>



<li>LG UltraGear</li>



<li>SecretLab</li>



<li>KitKat</li>



<li>TikTok</li>



<li>Adidas</li>



<li>DAZN</li>



<li>Pepsi</li>



<li>Axe Body Spray</li>



<li>Clear Men Shampoo</li>



<li>Audiotool</li>



<li>Warner Bros. Discovery</li>



<li>Star Sports Network</li>



<li>STC Group</li>



<li>ARAMCO</li>



<li>Barn’s Coffee</li>



<li>Jameel Motorsport</li>



<li>Qiddiya City</li>



<li>Logitech</li>
</ul>



<p>Almost every partnership or sponsorship comes with exclusive activations that support the growth of the Esports World Cup’s profile. What’s more remarkable is the fact that more sponsors are pouring in while the tournaments are ongoing.</p>



<p>Whether local to Riyadh or on an international scale, these brands are helping to ‘legitimise’ a tournament that some esports fans had their fair share of issues with – but are settling over time. </p>



<p>The Esports World Cup is a phenomenal event that’s setting a new bar for the industry. Even if you disagree with the setting, you can’t discredit the power of the showcase.</p>

<p>The Wimbledon Championships, which is traditionally known as simply ‘Wimbledon’, is live now and wrapping up this weekend. It’s one of the most iconic sporting competitions in the world, boasting a history that stretches back almost 150 years. Recently, it was revealed that the age-old event is taking a step into the digital age, with the team at Wimbledon promoting and hosting a full-fledged esports tournament focused on tennis.</p>



<p>One of the unique prizes up for grabs is a gold-plated, one-of-a-kind PlayStation 5 console, with the winner’s name being ‘etched onto it by Wimbledon’s official engraver.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-digital-age-emerges">The Digital Age Emerges</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2024-06-28/the_wimbledon_echamps.html">‘Wimbledon eChamps’</a> is a brand-new concept and a rarely-seen sight in the world of esports. It’s almost unheard of that a tennis game would feature as an exciting esports title, and typically, sports-focused games don’t do that well in general – but there’s plenty of hype around the Wimbledon eChamps.</p>



<p>It kicked off on July 6, with challengers being welcomed from Europe and North America. It all begins with the open qualifiers, after which a regional leaderboard will be established. then, the top sixteen players on each leaderboard compete for the final spots in the contest. It all comes down to the ‘Wimbledon eChamps Finals Event’, an in-person showdown at Wimbledon in London. This will play host to two players from each region – but only one can walk away with the grand prize.</p>



<p>It’s being played on TopSpin 2K25, the newest tennis game on the market and a sumptuous feast of visuals and authentic physics for fans of the sport to lap up. As it’s being backed by BLAST, one of the leading esports event organisers in the world, there’s no doubting the chops that this tournament has.</p>



<p>On September 12, the in-person finals will be held, and the champion will be crowned, walking away with a unique gold-plated PS5, amongst other things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-boys-season-4-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've been watching <em>The Boys</em>, Amazon's superhero satire that feels increasingly like it's lost the plot. While Season 4 isn't quite over yet, we'd yelled at each other enough about our thoughts on it that we decided to just get together and hash things out in the blog.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Hey Chris and Riley, we’ve all been watching the latest season of <em>The Boys</em>, a show I once ate up despite its flaws – and because of its simple though useful anticapitalism 101 approach to media and politics – but which now has let those flaws run rampant. Season four has been a corny, too-on-the-nose mess. It’s not really satirizing anything anymore so much as it’s ripping ideas from the headlines and changing some words around, and character beats are repeating ad nauseam. Feels like it should have wrapped up a season ago, but we’ve still got another one to go. I thought things might take a turn for the better after <em>Gen V</em>’s comparably solid showing, but nope.</p><p>What do y’all think? I gather from your posts online that you’re also pretty over this one.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The situation is dire. Really not good.</p><p>Corny is the thing I keep coming back to. I think people made a lot of hay of right wingers realizing they were the targets of satire, but unfortunately they're not entirely wrong here. The show is not as well written as it used to be, and it has this bizarre <em>SNL/Colbert</em> 3 years ago vibe on top of the usual generally vile stuff it does.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>So I should be clear that I struggled to get into this show at all-- I don't really like superhero stuff, and I hoped that what I thought&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' take on that genre was might change my mind. I really struggled to stay invested through its seasons--I'll admit that in previous seasons, I had a tendency to fast-forward through some of the parts containing the titular "boys"--but I've been watching every minute of the show since Season 3, a dedication that Season 4 is making me regret.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Boys – Season 4 Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzFXDvC-EwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris:</strong> A lot of the satire doesn't even make sense!</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You mean like Neuman referencing AOC when she IS that universe's AOC? That part threw me, lmao.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Forcing sex criminal Batman to donate to an Elizabeth Warren SuperPAC. C'mon man.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>God, that part made me roll my eyes SO HARD.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Season 4 does make you regret liking Season 3 which is impressive!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>To harken back to the comment above that right-wingers are mad because they just realized the show is making fun of them, like... OK, I'm not going to defend right-wingers, but the satire this season is just so one-note and over-the-top that I sort of don't blame them for being pissed? Like at least find the subject of your satire interesting enough to satirize it&nbsp;<em>well</em>? The prevailing note to me just seems to be "These people are stupid," which is maybe not untrue, but surely there's some more nuance there?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>If your show is good enough generally people get over it. I think maybe they were tired of people making right wing Homelander memes. Not an excuse to make the show actively worse though!</p><p>All the Fox News stuff feels like it's from a time capsule. A Santorum joke? In this day and age?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The on-the-nose-ness doesn't even feel like it's by design for the purpose of clarifying the show's politics, either. It just feels like the real world caught up to the show, and the writers didn't know what to do with that. So in the absence of any better ideas, they decided to go as big and dumb as possible to generate online discussion and discourse, which is a terrible way to write anything.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I really cannot stress enough how frustrated I feel by how dumb the show is. Besides the juvenile sex jokes, which I will happily rail about at length, I feel like the show just sees everyone in its world beyond its main characters as hopelessly stupid. I was telling Luke this, but I think it suffers from a somewhat similar problem as the movie <em>Don't Look Up</em>: in exploring the relationship between the subjects of media and the people watching that media, it falls into seeing the masses as stupid in order to highlight the uniqueness of its cast. But, like, I, the audience, am the masses! And the show thinks I am some rube who can be swayed by flashing lights on TV or appeals to Jesus (a la the whole Firecracker rally scene, which please let me complain about). It's so tired and depressing and makes me feel like the show hates me for watching it, which makes me hate it back.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Honestly go off man. Outside of her original motivations (being slighted by Starlight as a teen, bad but serviceable), everything about that entire segment was bad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> OK SO: Firecracker is giving her whole anti-Starlight/"save the children" rally, hitting all the right wing notes, and as part of that, it gets revealed that she had a relationship with someone under age. But instead of this being some reputation-ending thing, she pivots it on-stage into a "but I accepted Jesus, so it's cool" moment that totally wins the audience over. And that works well with what the scene intends to say about her and the situation the protagonists find themselves in, where Firecracker is so shameless that they can't get leverage on her. </p><p>But, while fully recognizing that all of this is clumsy satire, it felt like the... stupidest understanding of religion to me, someone who studies religion. Like, abuse is rampant in the evangelical churches I presume Firecracker is meant to come from, and a lot of it gets swept under the rug, but the reasons for that are complex and can't be boiled down to some surface-level appeal to Jesus. This abuse isn't allowed to fester just because religious people are stupid, right? I feel like as a piece of satire, this moment does a disservice to the realities of the thing it's criticizing, which I know I'm sensitive about. Abusive leaders or figures getting a pass in the church is way more complicated than that, and acting like it happens because people are just... faith-blind sheep made me really angry, even for a show that I know is just doing bad satire.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Also we have pretty concrete examples of that stuff ending right wing media careers!&nbsp;They're not loyal, they love turning on their own.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Right! Like... how are we supposed to see these people as formidable foes when the show presents them as so pathetic?</p><figure><blockquote><p>Besides the juvenile sex jokes, which I will happily rail about at length, I feel like the show just sees everyone in its world beyond its main characters as hopelessly stupid.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The incoherence coupled with the mediocre writing is really what gets me.&nbsp; Like tonally being that on the nose does not work. The Garth Ennis touch of the show always felt broadly tacky but in a kind of retro way you did not see any more, but mixed with really incoherent politics and plotting it just doesn't land for anyone.</p><p>You could see it coming a mile away, but everything involving Simon Pegg's character made me depressed. What a bad way to tell that story. </p><p>I think the Tek Knight episode really pushed a lot of people over the edge.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Season 3 at least had interesting personal stakes, even if the politics were already getting pretty wonky. Everything involving Soldier Boy was fun, especially once it was revealed that he was essentially Homelander's father. But Season 4 doesn't even have that. I do not care about what these characters are going through, because they've already been through it before. The stuff with Frenchie, especially, is so dumb. Boo-hoo, he killed some people, he’s gonna lock himself in jail. That’s something a person who’s been living Frenchie’s life for, like, a year or two would do. It just doesn’t ring true at this stage of his life.</p><p>The only emotionally compelling thing that’s happened all season was the death of Hughie’s father, and even that was played for shock before it wound up anywhere remotely resonant. Props to Simon Pegg for acting the hell out of those scenes, but still. And then, the very next episode – right after Hughie had scattered his father’s ashes – the show’s writers decided to sexually torture him for… laughs? At least they had Hughie acknowledge that what he went through was horrific, but what purpose did shoving his head in an even deeper vat of misery serve? </p><p>Hughie had already demonstrated growth in his decision to sacrifice his father, to let somebody go for once because after a certain point, trying to save everybody becomes more about your own fear of loss than helping those you’re stubbornly clinging to. The sex dungeon scene was the show’s worst instincts on display – excess and shock for excess and shock’s sake. And it wasn’t even funny! It was just uncomfortable. It felt like yet another waste of time in a season that’s been spinning its wheels from the word “go.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The premise of "What If Batman Was A Sex Freak Who Profits Off Of Misery?" is not itself a premise that is completely without merit, but his entire conversation with A-Train, the way they decide to sexually traumatize one of the main characters, and all in the service of torturing him by having him donate to Democrats. It's like they designed this in a lab to make me&nbsp; dislike them.&nbsp;</p><p>He's not even an interesting pervert! I know that's petty, but c'mon.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Honestly, it's a worthwhile point! In Season 3, they had a different pervert shrink down and crawl inside somebody's dick. That was at least entertaining! And then they try to top that with this vanilla shit?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>They already had a guy clone himself to eat his own ass this season. Which wasn't even good!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>The Tek Knight dungeon scene was the first time when watching this show that I thought, "If I wrote for this show, I would be embarrassed." I'm so frustrated by the show's incoherence around sex--<em>everything</em>&nbsp;is a sex joke, and&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;is a sex weirdo, and it's no longer clear to me what any of that is supposed to mean. I wrote about this in one of Aftermath's newsletters, actually, but I'll say here: like, it's revealed that one of the causes of conflict between Starlight and Firecracker is that Starlight called her a "slut" when they were young. But I felt like, held up against everything else the show does with sex, is that an honest motivation? Is that an insult in this world? A lot of the characters are motivated by trying to hide their freaky sex stuff from the world, but at this point, what does that even mean if&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;has a freaky sex thing?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I felt that with Sister Sage, a character I really like and think has a lot of potential but is written into a real corner here.&nbsp;</p><p>Like, it's not a bad premise! You are so smart you become a nihilist and desperately seek mental self abuse to escape being that person for a brief second. But they have just not handled her character well and I really hated the entire backstory info dump this episode.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I agree it could be so interesting, but half the time it--gasp--is played for dumb sex jokes?</p><p>I feel like I've yelled about both religion and sex and sound like a prude, lol.</p><figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That's the thing that really bums me out. A lot of the themes the show is trying to tackle this season COULD be interesting. It's clearly trying to be about death and mortality in a superpowered world. Every main character's arc ties back to this. Homelander is aging and realizing that even invincibility can't help him win the fight against Father Time. Hughie's father suffers from both a stroke and brain damage, and Hughie has to learn to cope with loss. Butcher is at death's door as the result of a brain tumor. Can he make up for a life of bitter regrets with one final, defining action? Frenchie has spent decades dealing death, and it's catching up to him. </p><p>On paper, a lot of this resonates with me, somebody whose grandmother died earlier this year after dementia caused her to decline precipitously. I feel like more skilled writers could pull this off, but they'd need to approach these subjects with care and compassion. A show this sloppy just doesn't have the tools.&nbsp;(edited)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;go to <em>The Boys</em> to learn about grief, I go to <em>The Boys</em> to see people explode very suddenly. I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;need the two at the same time.</p><p>Also, pulling a Tyler Durden with Butcher made me groan. C’mon man. What’re we doing here?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>EVERYBODY saw that coming. The least they could have done was make the reveal more interesting.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I thought there was gonna be more to it!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>With two episodes left in the season, I can't imagine they're going to turn things around. We know they have another season coming, so I wonder: is it going to be more of this, or will they see the light and reverse course somehow?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Based on the last episode I think&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;going to give everyone Super Covid.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Honestly, the high point of the entire season for me was how loudly that part made my partner groan. Just absolute, peak exasperation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Season 5:&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;all mask jokes.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>On the upside, this does mean there's a solid chance that many of the characters we know will die, and that's what needs to happen for this world to become interesting again. Like Riley said, there's still potential in it, but <em>The Boys</em>' main cast is completely tapped. Put them out of their -- and our -- misery.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I'm sort of fond of The Deep-- I think, more so than the other superheroes, we see him struggle with who to be and what kind of good or bad guy he is. But this season, he sucks, and not even in an interesting way, mostly in a--gasp--weird sex shit way again.</p><p>I just really, really cannot stand the sex shit this season. I feel bad about it a little bit! But it's making me feel like I'm losing my mind.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>They gotta stop going back to the cephalopod bit.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;rough.</p><p>And the breast milk thing! Get a new thing!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Owlcat Games, the developer of Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, has announced that they are moving the official release date of the first expansion, Void Shadows, to September 24, 2024. The expansion was originally due for release on August 8. Still, the developers have said they need more time to polish the game up as best as possible and "eradicate anything that might spoil the players' experience as they investigate the darkest corners of their voidship or romance a new companion."</p>
<p>For those who have been playing Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, you'll want to keep your eyes and ears out for all the info with the first expansion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pwCNWrK0co&amp;utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist%20PR%20List%20-%20Leading%20Gaming%20and%20Tech%20News%20(2023)&amp;utm_campaign=d9a26f20e4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_06_25_06_07_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-e5f83806f0-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Void Shadows</a>. It adds 15 hours of content to the game and is fully integrated with the main game's story, so you don't need to worry about spin-off confusion.</p>
<p>The new expansion features an exciting story where you get to play as the Lord Captain and get to peek into the lives of the citizens on the voidship while working to tackle a looming darkness that is threatening the existence of those on the ship. You are joined by a brand-new companion named Kibellah, an awesome, relentless Death Cult Assassin ready to pledge her life in service of the von Valancius dynasty, the same way her predecessors did.</p>
<p>While this news may be disheartening to some, it just means that the developers want to work as hard as possible to ensure that a quality product is released that will please all fans. Plus, there is plenty of content to get through in the main game, where you can replay it repeatedly to make different choices.</p>
<p>Whether you want to be the hero or you want to be the villain and be hated by those surrounding you, Rogue Trader has plenty of options and ways to play the game. There are at least 50 hours of gameplay to be had in the game, without doing every little thing present!</p>
<p>If you've exhausted all that, make sure to check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/">our review on Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader</a> as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-void-shadows-q-launch-had-way-too-many-bugs/">Q&amp;A with Owlcat Executive Producer Anatoly Shestov </a>where our burning questions regarding the new DLC have been answered in full clarity. Whether it's speaking about the bug fixes, they continue to bring out the game to be as enjoyable and bug-free as possible. On top of that, they work hard to adjust the UI and other important details so that Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader is as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat could be the next classic game franchise to get the remaster treatment. </p>



<p>In something that somehow flew under the radar, Eyeballistic CEO Joe Tresca took to Twitter in late June <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1804358945915510879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to tease something</a> that his studio is apparently working on. That tease came with a screenshot from an “updated” version of Mortal Kombat 2.</p>



<p>“I’m not sayin, but just sayin, we might be cooking up something special over at Eyeballistic,”  he said.</p>



<p>Immediately, the response from people in the replies was mixed. Some seemed excited about the possibility of a remaster while others criticized the shared image due to it appearing to have heavy AI elements. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Mortal Kombat Remaster</figcaption></figure>



<p>A claim that Tresca didn’t fully deny. </p>



<p>In a reply to a user calling the image terrible looking and stating that they “don’t want AI trash in their fighting games”, Tresca replied with, “I’ll take your opinion into consideration…”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games and NetherRealm Studios for comment on this tease from Tresca. Should a response be received, it will be added to the story.</p>

      </div>
<p>The game has three game modes to choose from: Career, Sandbox, and Franchise. In Career mode, players will have to solve a variety of different scenarios with varying difficulties. Franchise mode sees players building their own global park network, while Sandbox mode lets them create parks without the stress of money or management.</p><p>There are also online elements, such as being able to visit other players' parks as well as compete on leaderboards in Franchise mode. Players can even build theme parks together in Sandbox mode and share and download blueprints through the Frontier Workshop.</p><p>Planet Coast 2 is the follow-up to 2016's Planet Coaster, which was released for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/planet-coaster-review/1900-6416582/" data-ref-id="1900-6416582">Planet Coaster review</a>, we said, "It's a game that occupies your thoughts when you're not playing it, and it's thoroughly captivating when you are."</p>

            <p>
If you're hankering for some freebie action to see you into the weekend, you might want to point yourself toward the Epic Games Store, where you can procure a helping of arcade management and grid-based, turn-based deckbuilding for the sum of zero pee.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, from now until next Thursday, 18th July, the following titles are free to download and keep via the Epic Games Store:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Paradise</li>
<li>Floppy Knights</li>
</ul>
<p>
Starting with Nosebleed Interactive's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arcade-paradise">Arcade Paradise</a>, it's a sort of hands-on, first-person management game challenging players to turn their family's run-down laundrette into a thriving arcade, one shiny new cabinet at a time. Your time is split between keeping the laundrette running - manually collecting trash, washing and folding clothes, unclogging the toilet, and so on - in order to scrape together the cash needed to expand your arcade empire. Which is where you'll spend the rest of your time: messing around with the base game's 35 available cabinets, all of which are playable. Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcade-paradise-review-wash-clothes-and-play-games-in-this-feat-of-grime-caked-memory">liked Arcade Paradise a lot</a>!

<p>
As for Rose City Games' <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/floppy-knights-6a735a">Floppy Knights</a>, it casts players as Phoebe, a brilliant young inventor with a robotic arm for a best friend, who's trying to save up enough money to leave home. It's a goal that, for reasons, involves smashing through armies of monsters using Phoebe's titular tangible projections, all summoned from floppy disks. The result is a mix of tactical turn-based battling and deckbuilding that Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/floppy-knights-is-an-irresistible-mix-of-advance-wars-and-deckbuilding-1">said</a> "oozes fun, plain and simple",  back in 2022.

<p>
So if either of those take your fancy, you've got until next Thursday to add them to your Epic Games Store library. After that, a fresh set of freebies is due to take their place, with Welsh folklore-inspired first-person horror game Maid of Sker currently confirmed by Epic.

			<p>Concord, the hero shooter developed by Firewalk Studios, will soon launch its Early Access beta. At first, the beta was only available to those who pre-ordered the game on PlayStation 5 and PC. However, the developers have changed their minds, and the beta will now be available for all PS+ members.</p>
<p>If you've been sat on the fence about the game and were unsure whether you wanted to purchase it, getting stuck into the beta available for PlayStation 5 users is the perfect way to find out if this is a game for you.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/11/concord-beta-early-access-preload-and-server-times-pc-specs-and-more-detailed/">Concord developers</a> have announced the release times for the Early Access Beta. For those eager to get stuck in, you only have to wait one more day at the time of writing. The early access beta begins on July 12 through to July 14, with the full Open Beta taking place on July 18 through to July 21.</p>
<p>Players who have bought or pre-ordered any edition of Concord will immediately have access to the Early Access Beta and be given four extra codes to give to their friends should they have people they are eager to team up with in battle. The extra codes will be for the platform you have pre-ordered the game on, so make sure that whoever you're asking is planning on playing the game on the same platform.</p>
<p>The Early Access weekend has four maps, three game modes, and all 16 characters available for trial, so make sure to experiment as much as possible when you're playing Concord. When the Open Beta is released, a new mode and a new map for players to explore will be added.</p>
<p>For those who have access to the Early Access Beta, the following times are when you can expect to be able to get stuck into the Beta.</p>
<p>On July 12, the Concord Early Access Beta will be available from 10 AM PDT / 1 PM EDT / 2 PM BRT / 6 PM BST / 7 PM CEST. Additionally, for those on a later timezone, the game will be available on July 13 at 2 AM JST / 2 AM KST / 3 AM AEST. For players who will be playing this game on PlayStation 5, preloading for the Early Access Beta for Concord starts today at 10 AM PDT.</p>
<p>If you didn't pre-order Concord, the Open Beta will be available for everyone to get stuck into from July 18 through July 21, beginning at 10 AM PDT. For those on PlayStation 5, you can preload the Open Beta for Concord beginning on July 17 at 10 AM PDT.</p>
<p>If you participate in both Betas, your progress will continue from the first to the second. However, your progress during the betas will not continue until the full game is released on release day.</p>
<p>Firewalk Studios has also released the <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-sonys-upcoming-hero-shooter-gets-pc-specs/">PC specifications</a> that you will need to meet to run this game. Luckily, they are not as intensive as those of other modern games.</p>

<p>The marketing plans for Microsoft regarding its Xbox consoles could be changing in a major way. In the latest edition of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196361/microsoft-xbox-no-console-required-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren’s “The Notepad”</a> newsletter, the push to sell Xbox consoles in Europe and other regions could be going the way of the dodo bird. </p>



<p>According to a “tip” Warren received, Microsoft will reportedly stop marketing the Xbox console itself in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Instead, the company will focus solely on Xbox Game Pass, cloud gaming, PC, and Xbox controllers.</p>



<p>“Microsoft has been struggling to sell Xbox Series S / X consoles in many countries across EMEA, and the tipster believes Microsoft will now allocate less console stock to Europe as a result,” he says.</p>



<p>Warren adds that he hasn’t been able to fully verify the information from the tipster, and is still looking for more information. </p>



<p>Overall, the sales of the Xbox Series consoles have been struggling since their release in November 2020. According to the latest sales data, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-continues-to-outpace-ps4-in-sales-while-xbox-series-behind-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series consoles are 13% behind</a> that of the Xbox One through the same time on the market. They are also being the Xbox 360 over the same time, though no specific gap was given. </p>

<p>Splash Damage is the next studio to be facing layoffs in the gaming industry. The news of potential layoffs came as social media posts on the matter began to appear. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It's my 7 year anniversary at <a href="https://twitter.com/splashdamage?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@splashdamage</a> today!</p><p>As a thank you, I've been told my role is at risk of redundancy and I'll be entering into a consultation period.</p></div>— Max Downton 🔜 Develop (@mubly) <a href="https://twitter.com/mubly/status/1811339212412624926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>As far as the number of people being let go, the studio told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/small-number-of-roles-face-potential-redundancies-at-splash-damage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that it is limited to “a small number of roles”. What it’s meant by a small number remains to be seen.</p>



<p>“Following a recent business review, we have reached a point where we must adapt our structure to better suit the needs of our current and future games,” the statement to GI Biz reads. “Despite every effort to avoid it, this unfortunately means that a small number of roles across the studio are potentially at risk of redundancy.</p>



<p>“These roles are predominantly on the operations side of the business, with our development teams remaining largely unaffected. All games—both announced and unannounced—remain in development.”</p>



<p>Splash Damage is currently working on Transformers: Reactivate. The studio worked on the multiplayer aspects of Gears of War 4 and Gears 5 as well as the PC version of Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</p>



<p>As of publishing, nearly <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11,000 people have lost their jobs</a> in the gaming industry that we know of.</p>

<p>Some of the best Arm processors come from companies like Apple and Qualcomm, which license Arm's processor instruction set but create their own custom or semi-custom CPU designs. But Arm continues to plug away on its own CPU and GPU architectures and related technologies, and the company has announced that it's <a href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/graphics-gaming-and-vr-blog/posts/introducing-arm-accuracy-super-resolution?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social-organic&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mk04_client_na">getting into the crowded field of graphics upscaling technology</a>.</p>
<p>Arm's Accuracy Super Resolution (ASR) is a temporal upscaler that is based on AMD's open source FidelityFX Super Resolution 2, which Arm says allows developers to "benefit from the familiar API and configuration options." (This <a href="https://gpuopen.com/gdc-presentations/2023/GDC-2023-Temporal-Upscaling.pdf">AMD presentation from GDC 2023</a> gets into some of the differences between different kinds of upscalers.)</p>
<p>AMD's FSR and Nvidia's DLSS on gaming PCs are mostly sold as a way to boost graphical fidelity—increasing frame rates beyond 60 fps or rendering "4K" images on graphics cards that are too slow to do those things natively, for example. But since Arm devices are still (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943">mostly</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/surface-pro-11-and-laptop-7-review-an-apple-silicon-moment-for-windows/">for now</a>) phones and tablets, Arm is leaning into the potential power savings that are possible with lower GPU use. A less-busy GPU also runs cooler, reducing the likelihood of thermal throttling; Arm mentions reduced throttling as a benefit of ASR, though it doesn't say how much of ASR's performance advantage over FSR is attributable to reduced throttling.</p>
<p>"Using [ASR] rendered high-quality results at a stable, low temperature," writes Arm Director for Ecosystem Strategy Peter Hodges. "Rendering at a native resolution inevitably led to undesirable thermal throttling, which in games can ruin the user experience and shorten engagement."</p>
<p>Why not just use FSR2 without modification? Arm claims that the ASR upscaling tech has been tuned to reduce GPU usage and to run well on devices without a ton of memory bandwidth—think low-power mobile GPUs with integrated graphics rather than desktop-class graphics cards. ASR's GPU use is as little as one-third of FSR2's&nbsp;at the same target resolutions and scaling factors. Arm also claims that ASR delivers roughly 20 to 40 percent better frame rates than FSR2 on Arm devices, depending on the settings you're using.</p>

<p>Arm says it used "a commercial mobile device that features an Arm Immortalis-G720 GPU" for its&nbsp;performance testing and that it worked with MediaTek to corroborate its power consumption numbers "using a Dimensity 9300 handset."</p>
<p>When the ASR spec is released, it will be up to OS makers and game developers to implement it. Apple will likely stick with its own MetalFX upscaling technology—also derived from AMD's FSR, for what that's worth. Microsoft is pushing "Automatic Super Resolution" on Arm devices while also attempting to develop a vendor-agnostic upscaling API in "DirectSR." Qualcomm announced <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/04/introducing-snapdragon-game-super-resolution">Snapdragon Game Super Resolution</a> a little over a year ago.</p>
<p>Arm's upscaler has the benefit of being hardware-agnostic and also open-source (Arm says it "want[s] to share [ASR] with the developer community under an MIT open-source license") so that other upscalers can benefit from its improvements. Qualcomm's upscaler is also a simpler spatial upscaler a la AMD's first-generation FSR algorithm, so Arm's upscaler could also end up producing superior image quality on the same GPUs.</p>
<p>We're undeniably getting into <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">that one xkcd comic about the proliferation of standards</a> territory here, but it's at least interesting to see different companies using graphics upscaling technology to solve problems other than "make games look nicer."</p>

			<p>I had never considered what it would be like if someone made a version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/03/10/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number-review/">Hotline Miami</a> where you play as a sneakerhead who only knows how to kick, but part of the beauty of indie games is that I didn’t have to cook that wild concept up at all. The fine freaks at Free Lives and Devolver Digital were more than happy to bring it to life, anyway. In a sea of recent frantic time trial FPS indie games like Ultrakill and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/22/neon-white-review/">Neon White</a>, Anger Foot doesn’t falter for a second under the pressure. It brings unparalleled and unabashed vibes to the table and leaves no room for doubt – this filth-person-shooter is classic Devolver Digital, and one of the finest games the publisher has ever shepherded to release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anger Foot | Kicking Down Doors July 11" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XbW4873OPZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When I compare Anger Foot to iconic indie gem Hotline Miami, it isn’t just because of the twitch-precision, one-hit-kill, room-clearing adrenaline-maxing gameplay. It’s also because this game is nasty. You play a voiceless, green-skinned sneaker fanatic living in Shit City – a run-down, barely-functioning metropolis where everyone’s in a gang and the only rule is to “Do Crime.” You aren’t part of a gang, though; you just like collecting dope sneakers and storing them in your sneaker-room at home. When the leader of the Violence Gang rips the wall off your apartment and steals the priceless pairs of sneakers displayed on it, you’ve gotta fight through every decrepit inch of the city to get back what’s yours. It’s a bit like the plot of John Wick, when you think about it.</p>


<p>Of course, the way you exact vengeance is with your foot. Your tool set in Anger Foot is simple: one button kicks, another button shoots if you’ve picked up an enemy’s gun, and a third button throws that gun away once it’s empty. With those functions, a handy jump button, and a timer on your screen, you’re thrust into a bunch of bite-sized levels where your only goal is to get to the exit alive. There’s practically no tutorial to speak of in the game, and at first I thought that lack of guidance was a little weird.</p>


<p>With the timer ticking away on each level and a few of them proposing bonus challenges for me to finish in a certain time, I went into each encounter like it was a time trial. Eventually, I realised racing the clock wasn’t always worth prioritising. Some levels didn’t reward me for finishing in a certain time at all, and variables started popping up that made it clear I had way more options at my disposal than just speed.</p>
<p>Every 5 stars earned from beating levels or challenges gets you a new pair of sneakers, and each one comes with a unique ability that can enable completely different ways of play. When I unlocked the Detonators and saw that they make every door I kick blow up, I thought my speed-focused runs were about to get even faster. After a dozen deaths caused by me running face-first into an exploding door, I realised that the Detonators rewarded a stop-start style of play I hadn’t even considered up to that point. With new shoes, new enemies, and new challenge-types constantly coming at you, I was always enticed to mix up my play-style and even approach the same level multiple times in different ways to clear each challenge.</p>

<p>What I also appreciate about Anger Foot is that it gives you so much time to live and breath in this weird, gross, crime-fueled world it’s created. You aren’t just running, kicking, shooting, and kicking some more through each of the four main gangs territories. Every few levels, you get a chance to wander around a lively back alley or an unfinished apartment building half-filled with sewage. In those moments you can talk to NPCs hanging around and just see what bizarre, crime-loving shenanigans they’re up to. It’s a weirdly wholesome vibe, where someone will proudly tell you how they got mugged last week in the very stairwell they’re standing in, and right next to them is the person who mugged them. Even in the run-and-gun levels themselves, each room tells a story. It helps breathe so much life into the dozens of encounters you kick your way through, and made them feel like much more than just time-trials.</p>
<p>There’s so much more to love about Anger Foot. The hard, grungy bass-heavy music blasting in your ears at all times kicks every encounter up to 11. I fought a three-phase boss and it’s final phase was just a busted 1997 Lucida car. There’s weird, wonderful charm in every inch of this game – and heart-pounding combat that kept me sweating on my keyboard until the credits rolled. Anger Foot is gross, loud, and weird, and I love it.</p>

            <p>In a talk at Brighton's Develop conference this week, former Larian writer Baudelaire Welch declared the bear romance scene in Baldur's Gate 3 "a watershed moment in game history".  They said it was an unprecedented example of a developer recognising and validating the fanfiction community surrounding a game by realising something they wanted in it.</p>
<p>Welch was responsible for overseeing the companion romances in the game, and wrote the Dark Urge storyline, but didn't join the team until partway through development. The game had already come out in early access at that point, in autumn 2020, which meant considerable work had already been done - companion romances included. But there was still a lot of work to do, and some characters weren't yet romanceable - Halsin in particular.</p>
<p>"I don't think there were specific plans for him to be a love interest," Welch told me in a follow-up interview after their talk. However, the fanfiction community surrounding the game was clear about what they wanted, and what they wanted was "daddy Halsin". Welch knew this because they themselves were a part of that community. They'd written Astarion fanfiction before applying to work at the studio, and were partially hired for their embedded knowledge about what that community wanted (they also have a game design background alongside this). </p>
<p>So Larian acknowledged the desire for Halsin to be a romance and started to pursue it. "This is a character that everyone likes and sees as a possible love interest," Welch said, summarising, "let's try it out and see how it works."</p>

<p>"The specifically turning into a bear thing," Welch continued: "It was originally meant to be a gag that took place off screen in another scene that I pitched, because I didn't think that it would ever go anywhere, but then Swen [Vincke] and John [Corcoran], who's writing Halsin - as they were writing more major love scenes - were like, 'Oh, let's bring this idea forward and let's escalate it and make it a main thing for this character.'</p>
<p>"I have to admire that something I thought was just a gag - there's this off-stage sex scene where he turns into a bear as part of it - was taken as, 'Oh, that's really cool or funny, let's run with that.' That was a great attitude that was always there at Larian. Sometimes I would think something was too ridiculous to be done or too much of a joke, especially because so many people have to work on something in a game with cinematics and motion capture and scripting, but something that feels like 'oh this is a ridiculous little idea' did have the space to grow."</p>
<p>The upshot of this was an idea surfaced by the fanfiction community after the game was released in early access was now in Baldur's Gate 3.</p>

<p>"Why did it make such an impact on people?" Welch went on to say in their talk. "This is what it meant to me when I was involved in Baldur's Gate 3. This scene feels like a watershed moment in game history where the fanfiction community feels like they're not a subculture but are the majority audience being catered to in a scene and in the game as a whole.</p>
<p>"In order to reach out to that part of the community, Larian gave them an incredibly silly sequence that takes an identity moniker from the gay community - literally the gay bear becomes the bear (if no one has actually made the connection before) - and that is giving players something that feels like it's from the tradition of fanfic, or just something from your Discord shit-posting hole, and presenting it as a mainstream feature. And that feels like all the time you spent joking with your friends is validated. And how many games of this kind of scale have made you feel that way before?"</p>
<p>Welch's Develop presentation talked a lot about the importance of fanfiction for games. "Romance is one of the longest-tail parts of a fandom you can create," Welch said. "People will write about a good romance in fanfiction for years to come." It's the sort of discussion that sustains a game's community for a very long time - far longer than the main storylines themselves. The fanfiction community also appeals to female and LGBTQIA+ players in particular, Welch said - the sort of community that's propelled the collective love-in around Baldur's Gate 3 since it launched nearly a year ago.</p>

			<p>The biggest news of the week in gaming so far has undoubtedly been the substantial rise in Game Pass pricing <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by Microsoft. Game Pass for console is being removed as an option for new users; Core's annual price has been increased from $59.99 to $74.99; PC Game Pass's monthly fee has risen from $9.99 to $11.99; and Ultimate is now going to cost $19.99, up from $16.99. Additionally, a new 'Standard' tier has been introduced at $14.99, featuring just online multiplayer and around 25 games from the back catalog.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been a bit ambiguous about Game Pass pricing changes. In court, while fighting the Federal Trade Commission on the Activision Blizzard merger, lawyers said last June that there wouldn't be any increase following the closing. In September, though, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-price-increase-is-inevitable-says-spencer-more-unannounced-japanese-games-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> a hike would be inevitable at some point in the future.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that most fans were expecting a price increase following the addition of Call of Duty, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be imminent. Is this the right move from Microsoft, though, and should we expect any more changes in the foreseeable future?</p>
<p>We asked MIDiA Research games analyst <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/bigger-is-not-always-better-premium-gamings-aa-opportunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhys Elliott</a> to share his opinion with Wccftech on the subject. Here's what he told us:</p>
<p><em>Xbox has largely maximized its subscriber base on console, so it's looking to maximize average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) and onboard new subscribers with the higher pricing precedent. Call of Duty is about to bring more subscribers, so the timing makes sense. Expect more price increases in the future. The PC price increase suggests growth is starting to saturate there, too. Peeling PC players away from Steam is nigh on impossible...</em></p>
<p><em>GP Console doesn't grant day-one online access to non-F2P games like CoD (Ultimate does), so the OG tier is basically a confusing legacy tier that doesn't fit the new direction. Xbox has been hiding GP Console on its store lately, so the writing has been on the wall for a while.</em></p>
<p><em>A replacement for Game Pass Console, Standard is basically Game Pass Core with a bigger games library (and no first-party day one). This tier is Xbox's half-step from core to Ultimate. Removing the day-one stuff also retrains some Ultimate holdouts to buy new premium games again, again increasing ARPPU. Cannibalized premium revenues have been a massive opportunity cost for Xbox (slightly offset by paid early access).</em></p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, these changes reflect Xbox's recent strategy: upselling fans to Ultimate and increasing ARPPU ahead of the company's huge off-platform mobile/cloud push. PC and console will remain important, but those markets are reaching saturation, and Xbox needs growth (it's a public company in the time of big-tech efficiency and cuts). Xbox's big platform-agnostic play continues.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Elliott is right to point to the mobile push. Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-to-launch-mobile-store-via-web-in-july-microsoft-sees-tremendous-growth-in-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it will launch its Xbox mobile store via the Web at some point this month, and that's where it'll try to vastly expand the total addressable market for its games.</p>
<p>On the upside, more games than just Call of Duty are <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly coming soon</a> from Activision Blizzard to Game Pass, including Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2. Is that worth the higher price, though? Tell us in the comments and throw your vote in the poll below.</p>
<div id="democracy-1349" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1349,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Are Activision Blizzard's games worth the Game Pass price increase?</strong></p></div>

Every few years a new creative team takes the reins and wants to shake things up in its own way. To do that, the story must first return to the status quo. Such is the case with the latest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ultimate-x-men-marvel-comics-peach-momoko-1851333139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ultimate-x-men-marvel-comics-peach-momoko-1851333139"><em>X-Men </em>comic</a></span> from writer Jed MacKay. It’s not exactly shocking to see the <em>X-Men</em> get a restart, but after the game-changing Krakoan era of the past five years, returning to the “status quo” feels more tiring than ever. Even with some loving nods to the <em>X-Men</em>’s long past, it’s hard to get excited about what is, for all intents and purposes, a good but overly familiar <em>X-Men</em> comic based on its first issue.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For the X-Men, the status quo is being hated by humans because of their identity as mutants, the superpowered next stage of evolution. That’s true in the new<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/115440/x-men_2024_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/115440/x-men_2024_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>X-Men #1</em></a></span>, which sees our merry mutants shacked up in an abandoned factory in Alaska after the mutant nation of Krakoa was dissolved, marking the end of an arc started by Jonathan Hickman back in 2019. The first issue begins with Beast guiding the local police chief through their new home in hopes of easing the worries of the nearby town. Meanwhile Cyclops, the team leader, is out on a mission to rescue Wolverine. The two threads of the debut issue work in tandem to establish the series’ status quo, deploying a familiar and reliable format for<em> X-Men</em> stories. The fluidity of penciler Ryan Stegman’s art is enhanced by Marte Gracia’s color, all of which helps punctuate both the humor and the more serious moments of MacKay’s writing. </p><p>Another important piece of the puzzle that the issue establishes is the new team. Any<em> X-Men</em> book relies heavily on having a good team and I have to say I’m pretty interested in the mutants MacKay has rounded up. While Cyclops, Beast, and Magneto feel like safe choices, the trio is supported by a more eclectic and loveable cast. Magik, Quentin Quire, Tempest, Psylocke, and Juggernaut fill out the team with their unique personalities that, so far, make for great action and comedy scenes. It’s always good to see a team roster combine old and new characters, while also making room for some of the less famous mutants. </p><figure id="" data-id="7b6bb78b8f531abc5f4bb8d0d9111dd7" data-recommend-id="image://7b6bb78b8f531abc5f4bb8d0d9111dd7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1221" data-height="686" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik and Juggernaut play rock paper scissors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magik and Juggernaut play rock paper scissors" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b6bb78b8f531abc5f4bb8d0d9111dd7" data-recommend-id="image://7b6bb78b8f531abc5f4bb8d0d9111dd7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1221" data-height="686" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik and Juggernaut play rock paper scissors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For longtime readers, one of the most interesting parts of any new <em>X-Men </em>comic is figuring out what the new creative team’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472">favorite<em> X-Men</em> comics</a></span> are, which typically comes across in the characters, setting, and stakes they establish. For MacKay, it’s pretty clear he has an affinity for Grant Morrison’s iconic and incredible <em>New X-Men</em> run, and it’s nice to see Morrison’s characters like Quire and Xorn show up and heavily reference events from that run.<br></p><p>The Morrison connections extend to the first issue’s main villain, a group called Fourth School. In the first issue, we get a lore dump that ties the new group directly to Morrison’s big bad, John Sublime and his U-Men. Beyond Morrison, the new series also has flavors of the 2010s Aaron and Bendis <em>X-Men</em> comics. The reveal that the<em> X-Men</em>’s new home is an abandoned sentinel factory feels like a homage to the time the team lived in the old Weapon X facility, while the entire opening tour from Beast feels ripped right out of Aaron’s first issue of <em>Wolverine and the X-Men</em>. However. One era of<em> X-Men</em> feels conspicuously absent as an influence on the new series: the one that directly preceded it.</p><p>Started in 2019 by Jonathan Hickman in the dual series event<em> Houses of X/ Powers of X</em>, the Krakoan era was a complete shattering of the decades-long<em> X-Men </em>status quo. The characters who have long been stand-ins for marginalized communities across the world, a group who have always had to play nice with their oppressors and murderers, finally decided to do something different. In the first year of the Krakoan era, Hickman established that mutants were now effectively immortal and had founded the mutant nation of Krakoa,) a place that would serve as a haven for mutants across the world and a place to create a unique mutant culture and society. </p><figure id="" data-id="797ff37109689597b35bbc81ef5d4bc1" data-recommend-id="image://797ff37109689597b35bbc81ef5d4bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto discusses the island nation of Krakoa with a government agent" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto discusses the island nation of Krakoa with a government agent" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="797ff37109689597b35bbc81ef5d4bc1" data-recommend-id="image://797ff37109689597b35bbc81ef5d4bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto discusses the island nation of Krakoa with a government agent" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Over the course of the era, mutants showed the world they would no longer be oppressed and that humanity only lived because mutants allowed it. At one point mutants even terraform and claim Mars as part of their domain. It was a wild ride that felt truly groundbreaking. It also meant a lot for the mutant metaphor, showing that persecuted communities could in fact escape from under the heel of oppressors. Then, because of real-world creative and business decisions, Krakoa came to an end this year. The years-long story was by no means perfect but it proved that the<em> X-Men </em>could be more than they have always been. The end of Krakoa raised the question, where do we go from here?<br></p><p>That question is answered in <em>X-Men #1</em> and it seems to be that we just go back to the old status quo and ignore Krakoa as much as possible. Yes, characters still reference events from the Krakoan era but none of the meteoric shifts that Hickman and his collaborators made have lasted. They can’t, not if the<em> X-Men</em> are to be what Marvel wants them to be for money-making purposes. Instead, the mutant population has dwindled tremendously and the X-Men have to keep on fighting the good fight against humans trying to kill them, while pretending that they have some moral high ground because they like to play nice with their oppressors. I know this has always been the way <em>X-Men</em> stories work but after Krakoa it just feels exceedingly bereft of meaning or purpose. It’s a shame because as far as status quo <em>X-Men </em>books go, MacKay’s is shaping up to be a good one based on the first issue. </p><p>It’s surprising how heavily <em>X-Men #1 </em>draws on Morrison’s work, considering all the similarities it has with the Krakoan era. Both were bold reinventions of the <em>X-Men</em> that broke the status quo but ultimately were ended unceremoniously and immediately had the majority of their impact on the larger canon retconned. Hell, Xorn in Morrison’s run was secretly Magneto! Now Xorn is just some guy because Marvel retconned it. Yet here we are, two decades removed from Morrison’s ugly exit from the series and the latest <em>X-Men</em> book is using his era as a major influence. At the same time, Krakoa is being ignored in all the ways that matter, but I can’t help but wonder about the <em>X-Men</em> writer two decades from now who brings it all back. It’s all a cycle comics readers know well, but because of Krakoa, I can’t help but be disappointed at how laid bare that cycle is.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sad stuff. — Zack</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-us/product/the-simpsons-game/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80245410809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-us/product/the-simpsons-game/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80245410809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delisted. </a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ddbaa29a9e9347392fc81d4c14e94d8" data-recommend-id="image://6ddbaa29a9e9347392fc81d4c14e94d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Optimus fights Megatron on Cybertron.

And the first one of these,<em> War for Cybertron</em>, is still trapped on Xbox 360 and PS3 and unlikely to ever get back compat support or remastered. That’s a shame because this sci-fi third-person shooter mixing on-foot action with vehicular mayhem is a wonderful bit of <em>Transformers</em> fun and 10x better than anything Michael Bay created. — Zack<br></p><p><strong>Status: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://delistedgames.com/transformers-war-for-cybertron/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://delistedgames.com/transformers-war-for-cybertron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delisted in 2017.</a></span> </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
