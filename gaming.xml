            <p>Indie Sims-like Paralives has landed itself an early access release date.</p>
<p>It will be making its debut on 8th December, developer Alex Massé and team revealed last night.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to share the game with you all and can't wait to collect all your feedback to keep on improving the game," the Paralives crew shared along with a new trailer (see below). Here, we see some of the game's building techniques, and its world activities.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with Paralives already, it's a very promising looking Sims-like. The developer has promised a single player game which does not require an internet connection to enjoy, complete with dogs, cats, horses, cars, bikes and boats. <a href="https://www.paralives.com/faq">That includes boat houses</a>.</p>
<p>"Even if there will be bugs and some important features missing," the Paralives team explained last year, in the game's announcement post. "We think Paralives' Early Access will be quite enjoyable. Players who like to create characters and build houses will have a lot of tools and content to get creative with and the live mode will have its core features established which will allow people to create great stories for their Parafolks."</p>

</figure>
<p>At this same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">the developer added that it will have no paid DLC</a>. "As a small team without any shareholders to please," it said, "we believe the money we make from selling the game alone will be enough to support us and the development of free updates in the long run."</p>
<p>Well, colour me interested!</p>
<p>Paralives follows another Sims-like release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which debuted at the end of March. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-access-life-sim-inzoi-breaks-krafton-sales-record">particular release broke records for publisher Krafton</a>. </p>
<p>Other games playing with this genre, however, have not fared as well. Last year, Paradox shut down ambitious Sims-like Life by You, before also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">closing the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Survival Kids (Switch 2) - Konami's NS2 Debut Is Cosy, Competent, Kid-Friendly Co-op]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-survival-kids-switch-2-konamis-ns2-debut-is-cosy-competent-kid-friendly-co-op.1213179/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>A treasure map: a voyage. The ocean sploshing happily at your makeshift raft. Then a ferocious storm! Shipwrecked, alone, starving, surely doomed.</p>
<p>Well, not exactly. The happy sploshing part, yes — and technically a shipwreck — but then you’re in for a calypso-tinged, cosy hangout with friends. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a> offers a gentle change of pace in the fervour of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> launch, and a jolly fun jaunt it is, too.</p>
<p>Developed by Unity — as in the game engine company, in its first foray into end-to-end game development — this is an update of a dormant Konami IP that goes right back to the Game Boy in 1999. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/survival_kids">That game</a>, made available recently on Nintendo’s Game Boy app on Switch, was an early example of survival mechanics, including stabbing animals to death in a you-or-them scrap, before cooking up the flesh to eke out another day without starving to death. Over the years, through half a dozen or so sequels and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/lost_in_blue">spin-offs</a> and a lengthy hiatus, the edges have softened, culminating in this gentle, cooperative exploration and puzzle game.</p>
<figure><a title="Survival Kids Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156661/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The setup is lighthearted. Yes, stranded in a shipwreck – but on the back of a giant turtle called a 'whurtle'. Your mission is to fix up your raft and set off back home. However, each new voyage leads to another wreck on another whurtle – another level with the same mission to repair and escape. If that sounds repetitive, well, <em>it really is</em> – it’s whurtles all the way down. But, although solo play is available, this is fundamentally a multiplayer game, and cooperating and collaborating to complete the simple errands on the to-do list keeps everything fresh.</p>
<p>As for getting multiplayer set up, you have a few options: splitscreen for two players, online up to four, and an early example of Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-guide-how-to-share-games-locally-and-online">GameShare</a> feature, where up to three players can play with a single copy of the game. For this last option, however, you are limited to a local configuration, where all the Switches are in the same room. Since the Switch 2 streams the game to the other consoles (including the original Switch if you’ve held on to one), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/konamis-switch-2-launch-title-will-have-3-player-local-co-op-via-gameshare">the frame rate drops to 30fps</a>, and some latency creeps in. Add to this the big black border around the play area on each device and it’s not an ideal way to play, but it’s passable.</p>
<p>In my testing, splitscreen on the telly was the way to go. Online with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-guide-how-does-it-work">GameChat</a> could probably be a good laugh, but I don’t have any friends (<em>with this game</em>, thank you) to test that. Even if you are set up for GameChat, I doubt it could compete with couch co-op, particularly because your ideal co-survivor is probably about 5-10 years old – more on that in a minute.</p>
<figure><a title="Survival Kids Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156666/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, however you recruit them, once your crew is ready to set sail with the game, the process of repairing your raft boils down to gathering scattered items and carrying them to the wreckage. Reaching those items requires a bit of light puzzling, such as casting a fishing line to grab a distant piece of machinery or blowing items into place with a leafy fan. Said fishing line and fan also need to be constructed by gathering items and bringing them to base camp. All in all, it’s a game about searching and fetching.</p>
<p>Experienced gamers may find the very basic actions a bit tedious after the first couple of islands. However, put Survival Kids in front of a newer gamer — in my testing, a six-year-old — and the novelty doesn’t wear off so promptly. In fact, it was a gleeful time through to the end of the game and beyond.</p>
<p>And the enduring fun wasn’t just because the ideas were new to my fellow strandee; more than that, he was able to enjoy them thanks to the very dependable and generous controls. Chopping trees, for example, sends wood flying about, and those little bits all need to be gathered and lugged around. Larger items need to be dragged, and everything bobbles about for some physics-based fun. It’s a recipe for disaster, really, since repetition plus fidgetiness equals agonising gameplay. But not to fear: a quick and reliable push of the 'A' button grabs whatever’s nearby with a delightful pop, and since you can only stack alike items in your hands, mashing 'A' will always gather the right resource from a pile as long as you start with the one you’re after.</p>
<figure><a title="Survival Kids Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156659/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The same holds for some simple platforming. The kids’ yelping bounds are a bit floaty and inelegant as jumps go, but the island parkour was clear and easy to execute, with a quick reset just in case, and no real punishment if you miss the target.</p>
<p>'No real punishment' could be the game’s motto, in fact. Working together completes tasks faster, but it’s not too slow on your own. You need to eat to increase your strength, but you won’t really suffer for running out. The simple fishing can be messed up, snapping your line, but there are always plenty more fish in the sea, so to speak.</p>
<p>Overall, there’s little resistance to completion, even if your partner doesn’t feel like doing anything constructive. Mine appointed himself the cook every time — whether food was needed or not — but we always got our raft sorted in the end.</p>
<figure><a title="Survival Kids Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156664/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our rather dilly-dallying approach to island life made the game last about 12 hours for us. I’m confident experienced gamers could finish it off in half that time. There are star rewards to go back for on each level — for time gates and hidden items — but replaying the same level only amplified the tedium for me. We reached the last level to find it gated behind a 25-star requirement. We called it a day, and I spent an hour grinding stars on my own after bedtime so we could finish the game in the morning. That was the least fun part of the experience by a nautical mile.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Survival Kids is a thoroughly competent, cosy game of cooperative gathering and crafting. It’s not much of a looker, and its ideas aren’t mind-blowing, but it’s all good stuff thanks to its robust controls and easy-to-grasp loop. I’m not sure I’d want to be stuck with it on a desert island, but it’s good company for several happy hours with a friend – especially a less experienced gamer. If you plan to get shipwrecked with a little one and giggle your way through it, go ahead and add a point to the score.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-ndk-core-ounce-first-look-highlights-differences-with-retail-unit.1213176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-look/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first look at the Nintendo Switch 2 devkit has arrived today, thanks to some images that also highlight the differences with the retail unit that finally launched last week.</p>
<p>The new images of the NDK Core Ounce devkit were shared on X earlier today by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendeal</a>, and provide a rather good look at the system. Contrary to the usual, the Nintendo Switch 2 devkit doesn't look that different from the retail, and the only notable differences are the double USB-C ports at the bottom, and the all-black color scheme, which some may prefer to the color schemes used for the launch retail units.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Switch 2 dev kits use some kind of custom cable to connect on the bottom (USB-C and something else? double USB-C?) <a href="https://t.co/LSxefZuwth">pic.twitter.com/LSxefZuwth</a></p>
<p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1931840515156349195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 finally launched worldwide last week, with a few exceptions, alongside a few titles, including Mario Kart World, the highly anticipated new entry in the series, and a selection of third-party ports, which include Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, and a few others. While the system is the first one from Nintendo to support features that have become standard since the launch of the original Switch, the implementation sometimes leaves something to be desired. HDR support, for example, is disappointing, especially in handheld mode due to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">below-average display.</a> It's not all doom and gloom from a technical perspective, however, as the system seems to<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-seems-to-have-native-keyboard-and-mouse-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;natively support mouse and keyboard controls</a>, which can be a game-changer for first-person games or strategy games like Civilization VII, another of the system's launch titles.</p>

			<p>inXile Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-clockwork-revolution-trailer-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-will-launch-on-pc-and-consoles-in-due-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> its next big project, the first-person steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution, with a new trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025. The developers were also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/clockwork-revolution-gameplay-interview-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the official Xbox Wire blog, revealing more details about the game. For instance, we learned that multi-person dialogues are very important in Clockwork Revolution, and the game will even include some 'truly evil' options during conversations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Brian Fargo (inXile founder and producer on the game):</strong> It was important for us to speak directly to core roleplaying fans and show what this game really is. We slow things down for a moment, let the conversation breathe, and show the systems at work. That scene with Alfie isn’t just dramatic, it sets the tone. This is a game that can be brutal. Not just in combat, but in the choices you make and how the world responds. It’s not just about cinematics, it’s about the kind of deep, reactive RPG we love to build, and that our players expect.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Chad Moore (game director on Clockwork Revolution and programmer on the steampunk RPG classic Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura):</strong> It also highlights our multi-person conversations. Some conversations will have multiple people involved, and who you choose to speak to can send you down different dialogue branches. This can wildly change where a conversation ends up going. In the case of the trailer, Morgan chose to speak to Errol instead of Alfie, despite obvious warnings, and that resulted in poor Errol’s death. So, if you choose to go down that path, Errol is then a character that won’t be in the rest of the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Brian Fargo:</strong> Conversations have meaningful consequences, and I think it’s worth mentioning we have truly evil conversation options. You see a few of those play out in the trailer. If you’re offering evil options, they need to actually pay off and have meaningful consequences in order for the good choices to feel good. Otherwise, you’re not truly playing the way you want to play.</em></p>
<p>Clockwork Revolution was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase in 2023. At the time, the studio said it was in 'early development'. Now, it's saying that the game will launch in 'due time'. Phil Spencer didn't mention it among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-first-party-lineup-includes-forza-fable-gears-and-possibly-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games that will be part of the 2026 Xbox lineup</a>, so there's a chance it might launch even later. So far, the game is only confirmed for PC and Xbox Series S|X, but with Microsoft's new multiplatform policy, it's only a matter of time before it eventually reaches other consoles, too.</p>

        <p>Team Cherry's sliced through any confusion</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The collective desperation for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has evolved. Rather than people getting all up a height about the prospect of getting any news about it, they've now been left up a height due to confusion around some news they have gotten about the game. Cue Team Cherry having to step in to offer a bit of clarification about Silksong's Xbox Showcase cameo yesterday.</p>
<p>In case you were washing your hair, Silksong popped up during the bit that saw Microsoft introduce its handheld, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">the ROG Xbox Ally</a>. There was the usual hardware spinning around and looking cool, plus Xbox's Sarah Bond saying when Silksong popped up on the handheld's screen that the game'll be "available at launch and in Game Pass when the Ally releases later this year".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter confusion from some fans as to whether Silksong's release was tied to the handheld's release in "holiday 2025". Don't worry, it isn't.</p>
<p>Team Cherry marketing and publishing manager Matthew 'Leth' Griffin has made as much very clear via the long-suffering fan hive that is the Silksong Discord server. "I confirmed BEFORE Holiday," he wrote of the game's release date, "we are not tied to a console release." He then added that Christmas was what he meant by holiday, just to make totally sure there was no room for misinterpretation.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To give you an idea of the confusion that had followed the Xbox showcase appearance, these posts came in response to a Discord user with the wonderful handle fleetwood_bigmac asking Griffin for confirmation that Silksong was still on track to release before 2026. The dev replied "wait...what?" to that, likely realising that even if it was trolling, making things clear to the hardcore skongers beyond all doubt was probably a good shout.</p>
<p>So, to reiterate, Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming before Christmas 2025, possibly before September given a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">certain confirmed cameo</a> down under, and its release isn't tied to Xbox's new game playing box.</p>
<p>To be fair, we learned the date that Silksong will be playable as part of an Australian museum exhibit before we got a full release date for it, so you can't really blame fans for not knowing whether they're coming or going at this point. They've spent part of the last few years doing stuff like trying to read into comments on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">cake recipes</a> and their brains are just begging for straight, indisputable answers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Black Ops 7 is set in 2035, more than 40 years after the events of Black Ops 6, at a time when the world is on the brink of chaos following the events of Black Ops 2 and last year’s Black Ops 6. Co-op campaign returns for Black Ops 7 after 6 skipped it (you can still play the campaign solo). Expect to use near-future weaponry in Multiplayer, with brand-new maps. Meanwhile, there’s the next chapter of Round-Based Zombies in the heart of the Dark Aether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Wielding cutting-edge technology, David Mason and his team must fight back against a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Variety, Black Ops 7 sees This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia play David Mason (the character is recast with a new face), Kiernan Shipka as a new character called Emma Kagen (CEO of The Guild), and Michael Rooker, who reprises his role as Mike Harper from Black Ops 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/09/gettyimages-2031351968-1749464589972.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Milo Ventimiglia plays David Mason in Black Ops 7.

As you’d expect, you can play day-one on Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. There was no mention of Nintendo Switch 2 in the announcement. It’s a co-development between Treyarch and Raven Software.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 marks the first time the Black Ops sub-series has seen back-to-back releases, and comes just a year after Black Ops 6’s launch. Some fans are already saying this makes Black Ops 7 feel like a stop-gap, as 2023’s Modern Warfare 3 was considered by some within the community given it followed 2022’s Modern Warfare 2 just a year later. Activision, however, has insisted Black Ops 7 “delivers the full Call of Duty package for our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expectation is Infinity Ward will return with a new Modern Warfare game in 2026, resetting the Call of Duty cycle once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced-so-far">everything announced at Xbox Games Showcase June 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>The launch of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> has finally brought GameCube games to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, but there's also a secret startup sound.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, the GameCube collection features three games so far: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Soul Calibur 2, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>. Open the collection and it works just like others for the N64, SNES and more.</p>
<p>But! If you hold the Switch 2's left stick in any direction as the collection loads, you'll be treated to the iconic GameCube startup screen with its plinky-plonky sound effects and rolling cube. Cute!</p>

<figcaption>Classic Nintendo GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch 2! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmMxMVyWgvg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dwKgKoSGHQ">Spawn Wave</a> shared a video of the screen over the weekend. I then had to try it myself for that hit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>I tested it with other buttons too - the face buttons and the shoulder buttons - but only the left stick works for this little Easter Egg.</p>
<p>If you're planning on playing F-Zero GX - and you should be, it's great - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">note the default controls mean the game is virtually unplayable</a>. You'll need to enter the suspend menu to remap the controls, specifically moving boost to a more easily accessible button.</p>
<p>So far <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">only three games are available in the collection</a>, though you can buy a GameCube controller too. Other games on the way include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-path-radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, Mario Smash Football, Chibi Robo, Luigi's Mansion, and Pokémon Colosseum.</p>
<p>What other GameCube games are you hoping to see added to the collection? Personally, after splashing around in Mario Kart World over the weekend, I am hopeful Nintendo will whip out Wave Race: Blue Storm from its vault.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don't worry, gang, they are on a fix!</p>
<p>In the statement to TE, Josh Fairhurst from Limited Run also dropped the fact that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/clock_tower">Clock Tower</a>, that old chestnut from back in ye Super Nintendo days of yore, and more recently seen on Switch in its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/clock_tower_rewind">Clock Tower: Rewind</a> form, will receive some "Switch 2 exclusive features" through a patch in the near future:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zstxhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...we are also preparing patches for a few of our older games, but this may take some time as we also plan to add some Switch 2 exclusive features in games like Clock Tower."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New features for Clock Tower...but what could they be? Of course, Clock Tower: Rewind on Switch 1 added a whole bunch of new stuff, such as a new opening movie, new songs, save states, interviews and comics — amongst other things — so it'll be interesting to see what could possibly be jammed this time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/clock-tower-rewind">We gave Clock Tower: Rewind a 7/10 in our review on Switch</a>, saying that "we feel comfortable recommending to survival horror enthusiasts who wish to experience absolutely everything the genre has to offer." However, our review does point out that the game looks fairly archaic at this stage, so maybe we are in for a nice lick of paint? Seems ambitious, but let us dream. We'll be sure to let you know of any further announcements.</p>
<p>And in other old-game news, Fairhurst also mentioned that a certain soon-to-be-re-released gecho should be performing perfectly on Nintendo's new console soon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a heads up, we have already submitted a patch to Nintendo that ensures our upcoming release of GEX Trilogy works flawlessly on the Switch 2."</p>

			<p><a href="https://press.necrosoftgames.com/demonschool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demonschool</a>, the Persona series-inspired role-playing game in development by Necrosoft Games, is launching this summer after having been delayed last year.</p>
<p>The game's new release window on PC and consoles was confirmed in a new trailer shown during yesterday's PC Gaming Show which also provided a quick look at one week in the life of a Demonschool student, which doesn't exclusively involve hunting demons. The available activities look varied enough, so it definitely looks like the experience will have no trouble staying fresh for its entire duration.</p>
<p><iframe title="A week in the life of a Demonschool student" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwwaGNyrMdA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year</a>, I had the chance to try out a Demonschool demo before its public release, and really enjoyed what I played, despite the available in-game week not being as varied as the one showcased in the latest trailer. The combat system is probably what I liked best about the demo, together with its aesthetics, and what sets the game apart the most from the latest entries in the series.</p>
<p><em>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</em></p>
<p>Demonschool launches this summer on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>Beast of Reincarnation, an action RPG set in post-apocalyptic Japan and developed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamefreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon series developer</a>, has been announced for a 2026 release.</p>
<p>The game was revealed with a new trailer shared during yesterday's Xbox Games Showcase, which provided a first look at the game's setting, main character Emma, an outcast cursed as a Blighted One, her canine companion Koo, and the many dangerous enemies they will have to face. While the trailer has also proved how Game Freak and performance drops go hand in hand, no matter the platform, Beast of Reincarnation looks quite interesting in its first showing.</p>

<p><em>In post-apocalyptic Japan, a land ruined by corruption and crawling with monstrous beasts, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma—an outcast cursed as a Blighted One—and Koo, her loyal canine companion.</em></p>
<p><em>Survive a journey across an ominous, ever-changing world where dangerous forests can erupt in the wasteland. As Emma and Koo push deeper into the unknown, their bond strengthens—and with it, strange powers bloom.</em></p>

<p>Mario Kart World is the latest iteration of Nintendo's racing series, debuting last week alongside the launch of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>. Many have now raced through World's variety of tracks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-track-list">from Acorn Heights to Whistlestop Summit</a>.</p>
<p>However, Miyamoto is not mentioned in the credits for Mario Kart World, despite being an instrumental part of the series' legacy. This means that Miyamoto's last Mario Kart credit was with the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>

<p>"It definitely feels weird, especially as the 'father' of Mario," one person mused on Bluesky while discussing Miyamoto's lack of credit in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>However another suggested that, perhaps, the creator asked not to be credited if he wasn't actually part of the development, so that "people would focus on the new" team. </p>
<p>"I would feel like that is a classy move," they reasoned.</p>
<p>Miyamoto has steadily moved away from game development itself in recent years, taking on more of an advisory role within Nintendo. As such, this isn't the first time Miyamoto has been absent from the credits of a Nintendo game. He also doesn't feature in mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>, nor does he <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/echoes-of-wisdom-is-the-first-zelda-game-without-miyamoto-in-the-credits/">pop up in credits for last year's Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, the two look pretty similar, with grips that take inspiration from the Xbox controller and face buttons that will look instantly familiar to those well-acquainted with Microsoft's console line. The main difference is that the Ally X comes in black and the standard Ally in white.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ROG Xbox Ally:</strong> powered by the AMD Ryzen™ Z2 A Processor - balancing performance and power consumption to maximize battery life without sacrificing gameplay quality - 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage.</p>
<p><strong>ROG Xbox Ally X:</strong> features the AMD Ryzen™ AI Z2 Extreme processor - allowing us to bring new experiences to life including greater frames-per-second, sharp visuals and increased intelligence - double the storage to have more native games at your fingertips, and 24GB of high-speed RAM and 1TB of SSD storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, though, as highlighted by our pals over at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/06/no-the-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-doesnt-play-native-console-games">Pure Xbox</a>, these devices are Windows PC handhelds first and foremost. They don't play console games, but rather native PC titles on Xbox. So essentially, with Xbox Play Anywhere (which boasts <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/03/microsoft-shares-updated-xbox-play-anywhere-games-list-as-it-unifies-console-and-pc">over 1000 compatible titles</a>), you get a PC version of a game for free when you buy it on an Xbox console.</p>
<p>What's not clear yet, however, is how much these things will cost. Xbox recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/xbox-is-raising-the-price-of-consoles-accessories-and-games-worldwide">raised its prices across the board</a>, and given the specs on these things, we can't imagine either of them will come in at anything less than £500.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the potential price, the rather niche appeal of the systems, <em>and</em> the fact that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-has-been-a-great-partner-phil-spencer-reiterates-switch-2-support">Microsoft is keen to support the Switch 2</a>, we can't imagine Nintendo is even remotely concerned about the new ROG Ally devices. Regardless, we'll be keeping a close eye on future developements and how other companies take inspiration from Xbox's new handhelds.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry has confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will be coming out before the holiday season this year, following the game's appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-showcase-2025-round-up-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the official Silksong Discord, Team Cherry's Matthew Griffon wrote: "I confirmed BEFORE holiday - we are not tied to a console release." This indicates that Silksong's release is not tied to that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">Xbox's new Xbox ROG Ally handheld</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for the confusion is due to the game's sudden appearance at the tail-end of the Xbox ROG Ally reveal at the Xbox Games Showcase. Xbox's Sarah Bond stated that people will be able to play Silksong on this new handheld, leading some to interpret the two sharing a release date.

<p>The gaggle of people who have been fiending for anything and everything Silksong related have been desperate for anything concrete about the game and its release. Prior to the event-heavy weekend, interest was piqued <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-update-ignites-perfectly-reasonable-shadow-drop-hopes">due to an update to the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, the game was confirmed as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-is-playable-in-a-museum-this-september-but-that-probably-doesnt-help-narrow-down-its-release-date">playable at an Australian museum this September</a>. Earlier still, Nintendo included the game in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">Nintendo Direct and locked in the game's presence on both the Switch 1 and Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>There was also the cake fiasco, in which the eagle-eyed Silksong lovers went all in on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">cake recipe as the core of a release date tease</a>, a theory Team Chery had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">come out and put to rest</a>. With last night's news, those down bad for the smallest crumb of Silksong info may be able to rest, at last.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the concrete confirmation last night has folks very excited. A peak at the Silksong Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/">provides a window into the joys of happy gamers far and wide</a>. However the scars of hopium still ache in the hearts of some battle-hardened Silksong-minded folks. One user, Breadbowl004 wrote in response to Griffon's post: "Notice how he didn't say Holiday 2025".</p>
<p>That being said, it's still unknown when <em>exactly</em> the game will be released. Also consider this, it would be incredibly funny if the game was pushed back to 2026. Something to think on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-freaks-upcoming-action-rpg-looks-awesome-but-dont-expect-it-on-switch-2-yet.1213077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/game-freaks-upcoming-action-rpg-looks-awesome-but-dont-expect-it-on-switch-2-yet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Game Freak has made games other than Pokémon before. It has also released games on non-Nintendo platforms before. Yet whenever it spices up a launch schedule with either of these curveballs, it never fails to catch us off guard.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Pokémon dev popped up at the Xbox Games Showcase to reveal <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/beast_of_reincarnation">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, the action RPG previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/pokemon-studio-game-freak-is-partnering-with-private-division-on-project-bloom">revealed back in 2023</a> under the codename 'Project Bloom'. It looks awesome, it's arriving at some point in 2026, and Switch / Switch 2... don't appear to be invited to the party right now.</p>
<p>Beast of Reincarnation has been confirmed for launch on Xbox Series X and S, PC and PS5, and, from the little we've seen so far, it certainly seems to be making the most of the beefier consoles' power.</p>
<p>Described as "an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat," Beast of Reincarnation will see you exploring a post-apocalyptic Japan, on a mission to take down a gruesome beastie that brought about mankind's demise. Soooo, <em>not</em> catching cute little bug creatures in the tall grass, then?</p>
<p>Here's a brief summary and a handful of screenshots from the game's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In post-apocalyptic Japan, a land ruined by corruption and crawling with monstrous beasts, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma—an outcast cursed as a Blighted One—and Koo, her loyal canine companion.<br>
Survive a journey across an ominous, ever-changing world where dangerous forests can erupt in the wasteland. As Emma and Koo push deeper into the unknown, their bond strengthens—and with it, strange powers bloom.<br>
Explore what it means to be human in Beast of Reincarnation, an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat.<br>
What awaits at journey’s end?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one was initially announced as a partnership between Game Freak and Private Division, but the latest reveal has a new studio, 'Fictions,' on publishing duties — presumed to be the team built by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/ex-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-pick-up-private-division-portfolio-under-new-studio">former Annapurna Interactive staff</a>.</p>
<p>It all looks very big and impressive, with a scale that we're sure would prove too much for Switch 1. Switch 2, on the other hand, might be able to handle things — it can handle <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>, for crying out loud — but it's still missing from the launch line-up for the time being. Keep those fingers crossed for another announcement soon then, eh?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, the long-in-development endless cat breeding game from devs Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, has just had its release pencilled in for February 10th, 2026, by a fresh trailer. Yes, it’s still looking very weird and nigh impossible to explain to a mate in less than two minutes.</p>
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-trailer-for-the-binding-of-isaac-devs-next-game-mewgenics-answers-none-of-the-many-questions-i-have"> trailer it got in April</a>, this latest one roped in the most fitting collab <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac">Binding of Isaac</a> developer McMillen and co could have landed, in the form of sinewy surrealism expert and YouTuber MeatCanyon. We’ve also gotten a nice overview of where the devs are at in assembling their weird feline with two heads.</p>

<p>As you can watch above, the release date trailer featured a cartoon bloke explaining a bit about his cat to a real bloke who I’m sure is a real vet. Among other things, the kitty’s got a gambling addiction, a conjoined twin, and has been probed by aliens in addition to having made a deal with the devil. So, just your average cat with average cat quirks.</p>
<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/686060/view/529848673510623712?l=english">Steam dev blog</a>, McMillen explained the decision to push back releasing the “turn based legacy roguelike draft sim” into the wild until next year, rather than chucking it out of the cat flap before the end of 2025.</p>
<p>“Dude, listen. Launching in Nov–Dec is hard,” he wrote, “We want this game to get the attention it deserves and don’t want to compete with holidays and holiday AAA releases. And honestly, adding a few more months to dev means launching with an even more heavily tested and polished experience!”</p>
<p>In addition to more general polishing and playtesting, the sorts of things the team says they’ll be focusing on in this extra time include the addition of custom events, more cutscenes, and making sure they can launch the game in a few different languages.</p>
<p>McMillen added that Mewgenics’ mysterious final boss - which I’ve got no doubt will be <strong>something</strong> - is on track to be finished by the end of this month. The game’s “big secret late-game system” is already ready to go, and it’ll start getting some “alt/shiny furniture” next week. Sit back down on your gleaming throne, I know you’re excited about that last part, but patience is key here.</p>
<p>Why does a turn-based RPG/roguelike thing about cats shagging needs sparkling sofas, you might wonder. Don't look at me, I've got no idea whatsoever, but Mewgenics has definitely captured my curiosity, even if it's just because it has cats in it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Remember the fact that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum">the game will apparently be playable in September at an Australian museum</a>, the country's national museum of screen culture in Melbourne, from September 18. Could the game still be set for launch as early as that?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong fans had hoped for more definitive news on a release date from yesterday's Xbox Games Showcase, especially as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-day-another-hollow-knight-silksong-steam-update-could-we-finally-get-a-release-date-this-week">multiple updates to the game's Steam store page over the last week appeared to point towards an imminent launch</a>, or perhaps even a shadow drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Xbox reserved its usual shadow drop release for the belated arrival of Final Fantasy 16 — and Silksong fans were left still wondering when the long-awaited Metroidvania would finally arrive. Still, Christmas is only six months away now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-xbox-ally-x-the-new-gaming-handheld-from-asus-and-microsoft">IGN has already gone hands-on with the ROG Ally X</a>, should you wish to play Silksong on it, whenever the handheld arrives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

State of Decay 3, for example, failed to turn up. The Perfect Dark reboot was conspicuous by its absence. But perhaps Starfield’s ongoing M.I.A. status hurts the most — at least for long-suffering fans of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> community had hoped Bethesda would announce something to do with the game at its Xbox Games Showcase, but while The Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 both getting their moment in the spotlight, Starfield skipped proceedings entirely. No DLC, no expansion, no PlayStation 5 release… nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the Starfield community is starting to lose hope and a good deal of faith in Bethesda, whose silence around the game has been deafening.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had so much hope for today's Xbox show, but no,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6itk0/i_had_so_much_hope_for_todays_xbox_show_but_no/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said acatato on the Starfield subreddit</a>. “After so much time of silence (let's not talk about small update) the game looks so dead now, it's sad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What a complete disappointment,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6izi4/what_a_complete_disappointment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added totallynormalpersonz</a>. “What a joke the only thing we ever hear from Bethesda about this game nowadays is stuff off the Creation Club. The Xbox showcase would have been the perfect time to show off something new for this game. Unfortunately Bethesda doesn't seem to care. Wouldn't surprise me if Bethesda has abandoned this game and are hoping the community will make content for them. This does not bode well for future Bethesda game studio projects.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bethesda makes it so hard to defend this game,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6mzoe/bethesda_makes_it_so_hard_to_defend_this_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said TheVossDoss</a>. “I love Starfield. 1,100 hours in. If it weren’t for mods, I’d given up long ago. Knowing that Bethesda will never read this, I’m nonetheless speaking directly to you — shame on you for keeping your loyal fans in the dark, and for throwing in the towel. If you decided to give up on this game and move on, fine, but let us know so we’re not holding on to hope. I cannot believe Starfield was a complete no-show today. Thank you to all the modders out there who have kept the game on life support. I fear, though, we’re getting dangerously close to the heart monitor flatlining.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, fans just want some sort of communication from Bethesda on the future of the game. If it’s left it behind, they’d like to know. If the promised second expansion <em>is</em> coming, they’d like to know. If Starfield is coming to other platforms, they’d like to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comments from Starfield fans are now spilling over into social media posts from Bethesda Game Studios about unrelated matters. Take, for example, <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1931788007071182958" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post about a Fallout 76 interview at Summer Game Fest</a>. The replies include questions about Starfield’s status, including “Why did you guys abandon starfield?”, “Have you guys abandoned Starfield?”, “I’m uninstalling Starfield…. I’m tired of waiting,” and “RIP Starfield.” You get the idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the growing disappointment are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1l6kyjw/a_reminder_to_everyone/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some within the community</a> who are pointing out that Bethesda may shadow-drop a Starfield expansion and a PS5 release. It enjoyed huge success with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which it shadow-dropped in April to the tune of over 4 million players. Perhaps this is the new way forward for Bethesda. And if that’s the case, then perhaps some sort of Starfield update could be around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, the Starfield community is left sifting through previous statements from Bethesda as they look for a glimmer of hope. Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wait to find out if all that still stands goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>The Persona-inspired horror game Demonschool has a new release window, following a delay last year.</p>
<p>As revealed at the PC Gaming Show, the RPG will be released this summer. It was originally intended to launch last September, but in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-and-italian-horror-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay">August was delayed to allow the studio to "manifest our bigger dreams into reality"</a>.</p>
<p>The new trailer, below, provides a gameplay summary of Demonschool and its parallel social activities and tactical battles, all with a cartoon horror aesthetic.</p>

<p>Demonschool will be released across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC (Steam, Epic), with Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>Set in a haunted university, Demonschool includes both Persona-esque social activities and romance, with tactical battles inspired by Into the Breach. There will be 15 playable characters, each with special combat skills.</p>
<p>"Our team took great pride in fleshing out the world of Demonschool as much as possible," said Brandon Sheffield, creative director of developer Necrosoft Games. "With plenty of class and demon assignments to complete, characters to hang out with, and minigames to play, students won't run out of things to do on Jabberwock Island."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-is-persona-meets-buffy-and-i-love-its-90s-vibes">demo of the game was released last year</a>, which I described as "Persona meets Buffy" with its 90s vibes. "Added to the bold artwork, a dark yet funky soundtrack, and an over-the-top cartoonish aesthetic (I love the bouncy run animation), and Demonschool is yet another brilliant example of silly adults bested by a plucky gang of pesky kids."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The appearance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bernband">Bernband</a> during last night's PC Gaming Show had a few of us at RPS clicking our fingers and pointing at our monitors yelling: "Bernband! Bernband!" This remake of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-being-pleasantly-lost-bernband">best sci-fi walking sim of 2014</a> has been in the works for a while. Creator Tom van den Boogaart has dipped in and out of working on the alien wanderer, often switching focus to other projects such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a>. But now it looks like we are once again getting a trickle of sweet extraterrestrial wanderlust. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>"Bernband is a sci-fi exploration sim set in a bustling alien metropolis," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789170/Bernband/">the Steam page</a>. "Wander the streets at your leisure. See the sights, from dodgy dive bars to sprawling mega-marts. Discover secret areas, or hang out with the locals! There are no missions or timers; your only goal is to take a stroll."</p>
<p>That lack of goals and objectives puts it once again firmly into walking simulator turf, but if it shares even a bit of the atmospheric richness of the original walkabout, that is absolutely grand. When Bernband <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-alien-city-bernband">first appeared</a>, it offered a crowded little world of alien barflies, night clubs, high walkways, creepy alleys, xeno churches, school classrooms, and plenty of elevators connecting it all together. </p>
<p>It was a wonderful city to get lost in, and a reminder that simply dandering around a strange place can be exciting without having to collect anything, or even speak to anyone. As Alice O put it at the time, it's "about the freedom of being alone in a crowd, the joy of noise washing over you and filling you, and the pleasure of wandering with no purpose beyond wanting to have time to yourself and see some interesting things."</p>
<p>The original game's maker, Van den Boogaart, has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bernband-gifs">periodically shared some of his ongoing work</a> on the remake. But it would often submerge again for some time as he worked on other things. After all, the creator is a member of the busiest gang of Dutch game tinkerers in the world, the Sokpop Collective (who are also credited as helping on this remake). Sokpop are a a kind of romantic ideal of the games industry - a crowd-funded independant gang of mates who have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sokpop-collective-are-releasing-their-100th-game-and-aiming-for-100-more">made over 100 games</a> after announcing their plan to release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sokpop-collective-are-popping-out-a-new-game-every-2-weeks">a new plaything every two weeks</a>.

The new edition of Neverwinter Nights 2 features enhanced graphics and textures with updated camera controls and gameplay mechanics. It has full controller support, and the PC version is Steam Deck compatible. Steam Workshop access is also enabled.</p><p>All three of the original DLC expansions--Mask of the Betrayer, Storm of Zehir, and Mysteries of Westgate--are included in the Enhanced Edition.

<p>Over the past few days, there have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombaClub/comments/1l5jikh/tomba_is_not_compatible_with_switch_2_right_now">a few notices posted online</a> regarding Limited Run games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_special_edition">Tomba! Special Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/clock_tower_rewind">Clock Tower: Rewind</a> which aren't currently running properly on Nintendo's slick new console (and both feature on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">Nintendo's lists of games with issues</a>). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/clocktower/comments/1l40f1i/any_idea_when_rewind_will_be_fixed_for_switch_2/">Clock Tower appears to have audio problems</a>, whilst Tomba is fairing a little worse.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a specific line of code has been causing the issues, according to Limited Run founder Josh Fairhurst. Our sister site, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>, reached out to Fairhurst, who has addressed the situation, saying that they had very little time with the console pre-release to deal with a troublesome bug:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zstxhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>820k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The backwards compatibility issue derives from a line of code that is used for video playback on the original Switch. We have reported the line of code to Nintendo and are hoping to see it addressed as an update to the Switch 2's backwards compatibility in the future, as I believe this line of code is also causing compatibility issues with games from other publishers.</p>
<p>We were accepted as Switch 2 publishers and developers in mid-May and received our development hardware two weeks ago. We started digging into the issue the minute we got our kits and found the line of code causing the problem after a few days of investigation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LRG published a statement <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1931576962679521441">on social media</a> over the weekend mentioning that the firm was hopeful of this being addressed in future updates from Nintendo. Of course, it is still very early days for Switch 2, so these little bumps in the road are to be expected, and it's at least good news for potential players of Limited Run's Carbon Engine-emulated games that the problem has been identified.</p>
<p>The Carbon Engine, if you're unfamiliar, is Limited Run's multi-platform development tool that helps different emulators interface with modern consoles. It uses emulation as a base, then builds features like UI, rendering, audio, data management, controller inputs, and console-specific features like achievements.</p>
