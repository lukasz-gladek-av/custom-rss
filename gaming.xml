<p>It has been reported that Troy Baker, one of the industry’s most sought-after talents, will return to work under Neil Druckmann on whatever comes next at Naughty Dog. Baker has been in bed with ND since 2013’s The Last of Us, and the developer is unwilling to part ways with the superstar VA just yet.</p>



<p>In an interview with GQ, Troy Baker discussed his recent ventures. In one segment, he promised to return to work with Naughty Dog on Druckmann’s new project, whatever that may be.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-always">‘Always’</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with GQ</a>, it was reported that Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a heartbeat I would always work with Troy</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was quoted alongside a report that Baker <strong>will </strong>return to Naughty Dog to play a role in Druckmann’s next project, which for now remains under wraps.</p>



<p>It has been an uncharacteristically quiet year for Troy Baker, but he is playing the chief role in the upcoming Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, which will be released on December 6. He also had a spot in Arkham Shadow, playing Joker.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, I caught up with Troy Baker and talked about a project away from video games. He provided his vocal talents to James Cox for an audiobook, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-troy-baker-james-cox-grand-theft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering ‘Grand Theft AI’</a>, a cyberpunk novel of epic proportions.</p>



<p>It isn’t clear what Neil Druckmann’s next game looks like, but in 2025, Baker will surface in Ken Levine’s Judas, a spiritual successor to BioShock and a long-awaited first-person title.</p>



<p>What do you think Neil Druckmann’s next project looks like at Naughty Dog? Are we talking about another game set in The Last of Us’ universe, or could it be something else entirely? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While I primarily play on PC, like many other ARPG fans, the genre is growing on other systems, too. You can now play some of the best titles in the genre on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, including Path of Exile and Diablo IV. But what about the upcoming PoE2? What are the Path of Exile 2 platforms for Early Access? Here’s what you need to know to prepare for the monolithic ARPG!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-systems-is-path-of-exile-2-releasing-on">What Systems is Path of Exile 2 Releasing On?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access release day</a>, you can play Path of Exile 2 on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. On PC, you can buy a supporter pack ranging in price from $30 to nearly $500, depending on where you purchase. More options are available on the Grinding Gear Games’ official website, all offering game keys. But if you’re playing the ARPG on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, then you can scoop up one of the multiple supporter packs, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Supporter Pack – $30</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack – $60</strong></li>



<li><strong>King of the Faridun Supporter Pack – $100</strong></li>



<li><strong>Thamaturge of the Vaal Supporter Pack – $150</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warlord of the Karui Supporter Pack – $220</strong></li>



<li><strong>Liberator of Wraeclast Supporter Pack – $370</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Prices will vary depending on your platform, region, and associated taxes.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s">Will Path of Exile 2 Be Free to Play on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>While the full 1.0 launch of Path of Exile 2 will be a free-to-play experience available to anyone who wishes to download and enjoy the game, the current Early Access launch for PoE2 is a paid endeavor. If you want access, you must purchase one of the supporter packs mentioned earlier, all of which include a key to the early release of the ARPG. These packs, once again, range in price, with the cheapest being $30. </p>



<p>Now, if you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, eating up all of the grind you can, $30 isn’t a high asking price. Many people wind up playing PoE for hundreds or thousands of hours.</p>



<p>Where do you intend to play Path of Exile 2? Let us know in the comments below, or start a discussion about ARPGs and PoE2 on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Actress Jen Taylor has had the same longevity as Master Chief's AI companion, Cortana. However, according to Downes, he and Taylor were briefly replaced by other performers during the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-4-review/1900-6399288/" data-ref-id="1900-6399288">Halo 4</a>.</p><p>Downes recently shared the story of his recasting on his YouTube channel. As the actor recalls, neither he nor Taylor were aware that 343 Industries--which took over the Halo franchise from Bungie--had already cast new performers for Master Chief and Cortana. According to Downes, testers complained about not feeling connected to the new voices for those iconic characters.

However, Generalkidd points out that this may have been a temp track and unrelated to Downes' account about the actors who were chosen to replace them.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Generalkidd/status/1860878001769939137" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I guess this has become a hot topic again.

			<p>Hitman developer IO Interactive has made the decision to cut ties with the MMA fighter Conor McGregor after last week's Irish High Court ruling where he was found to be guilty of assaulting and raping a woman in December 2018. The decision to cut ties comes shortly after a collaboration between IO Interactive and McGregor was confirmed, where he would be a character in the Hitman series called <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-featuring-conor-mcgregor-attracts-large-player-base/">The Disruptor</a>. His voice and likeness were used for the character, where he was featured as one of the game's Elusive Targets. There was a mission available, as well as a DLC pack that would provide permanent access to an arcade contract featuring The Disruptor and new cosmetics. However, since the ruling, IO Interactive has made the decision to cut all ties and will be removing all content featuring McGregor from the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This statement</a> was made via social media this afternoon, where IO posted their announcement on X. The statement goes on to say: "In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately. e take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today."</p>
<p>The Disruptor most recently returned to the Hitman game earlier this month as a limited-time mission that players would be able to participate in, with the mission set to be playable until 8 December. However, all of this will now be removed from the game. For those who own The Disruptor DLC, it hasn't been stated what will happen to the content since it's already been purchased. However, in cases like these, where content is removed regardless of circumstance, those who already own it tend to be able to continue to access it.</p>
<p>With the Irish Jury deciding what they did, McGregor was ordered to pay at least 248k Euro in damages. Despite this, he's also said that he plans to appeal the verdict. As there's no date as to when this will happen, it's hard to say what IO Interactive would be able to do about the situation should McGregor be successful in his appeal of last week's court ruling. For now though, people will no longer be able to purchase any content relating to the athlete for the unforeseeable.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, like its predecessor, hasn't been released on Xbox consoles so far, but it definitely sounds like the door is still open to seeing the Remake trilogy on Microsoft consoles in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirths-director-is-an-xbox-fan-and-with-square-enix-testing-the-multiplatform-waters-he-says-he-wants-to-being-the-jrpg-to-as-many-players-out-there-as-possible/">GamesRadar+</a> shortly before taking the stage at this year's Golden Joystick Awards, game director Naoki Hamaguchi commented on the trilogy as a whole, saying that while nothing could be announced at the time, he certainly wants to bring the Final Fantasy VII remake series to as many players as possible. As such, they want to "create that situation, that environment, where more players can play the games in the future, and we want to look in that direction."</p>
<p>Square Enix changing its stance on platform exclusivity, which already produced some results with the release of select titles that missed Xbox consoles at launch, isn't an isolated happening but an industry-wide change, according to the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director. With so many platforms available, it is no longer possible to release a game on a single platform and get most of the players wanting to play such a game on that single platform. Giving his personal opinion on the matter, Hamaguchi-san, owning an Xbox console, praised it as a great hardware platform, so it definitely sounds like there wouldn't be any resistance on his part to get the game out on Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p>Despite having only released Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">earlier this year,</a> Naoki Hamaguchi and his team are already hard at work on the third and final part of the remake trilogy.<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"> The story and concept for the game are already completed</a>, so hopefully, it won't take much to see the first glimpse of the conclusion of Cloud's story.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will release in March 2025. That’s according to the latest rumors published by popular Nintendo news channel Nintendo Prime.</p>



<p>According to the latest rumors, which the channel found on Chinese forum <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5103984429499076#comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a> and the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-speculation-thread-st-this-is-furukawa-president-of-nintendo.7757/page-2146#post-1426497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards gaming forum</a>, Nintendo will officially reveal its next system in January 2025 followed by a March launch. </p>

<p>Nintendo has not responded to requests for comment as of publishing. As always, until something is made official or Insider Gaming can independently confirm the details, please take all rumors with a grain of salt. That said, this isn’t the first time a March 2025 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-reportedly-headed-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date has been rumored</a> for the follow-up console. Also, the last update from the company is that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console will be announced</a> before April.</p>



<p>As far as what to expect with the next Nintendo Switch console, Nintendo confirmed that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/">will have backwards compatibility</a> as well as feature the same Nintendo Switch Online service that players currently have. </p>



<p>Other rumors about the console include magnetic Joy-Con <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controllers with additional buttons</a> as well as support for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 4K resolution</a> when docked. It’s also been claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-aaa-games-at-launch-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new system will get AAA games</a> around its launch, something the current Nintendo Switch didn’t have. </p>



<p>None of those reports have been confirmed, either. </p>

<p>The year is nearly over, but we still have a handful of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/three-upcoming-free-to-play-games-may-dominate-the-end-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play titles</a> launching in December that promise hundreds of hours of gameplay between them. One of the biggest upcoming launches is Path of Exile 2, an ARPG that rivals Diablo IV in nearly every way. If you’re excited, join the club, but first, check out what’s inside each of the Path of Exile 2 supporter packs on Steam!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-early-access-supporter-pack">Path of Exile 2 – Early Access Supporter Pack</h2>



<p>If you want access to Path of Exile 2 during its Early Access period, supposedly, you’ll have to buy the Early Access Supporter Pack for <strong>$30</strong> to receive a key ahead of the game’s free-to-play launch.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Key</strong></li>

<li><strong>300 Points</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-lord-of-ogham-supporter-pack">Path of Exile 2 – Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack</h2>



<p>If you’re the type of player who knows they’ll wind up playing Path of Exile 2 for many tens of hours, then dropping the equivalent of a full price retail game on the ARPG with the Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack for <strong>$60</strong> doesn’t seem like a bad choice. You’ll receive the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Key</strong></li>



<li><strong>Extended Digital Soundtrack</strong></li>



<li><strong>600 Points</strong></li>

<h2>Path of Exile 2 – King of Faridun Supporter Pack ($100)</h2>



<p>On Steam, the most expensive Path of Exile 2 Supporter Pack is the King of Faridun bundle for $100. It includes everything the two previous editions offer, plus more. It’s for the supporter who knows they’ll continue playing PoE2 for years to come and wants to pump up developer Grinding Gear Games with funds for future development!</p>

                <p>Amazon is already slashing prices for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>, and right now you’ll find two popular retro gaming consoles discounted to their lowest prices of the year. Swing by the online retailer and you can pick up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CS3VD9TJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari 400 Mini</a> for $100 (was $120) and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG7LMFKY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari 2600+</a> for just $110 (was $130). The Atari 7800+ also arrives on Friday--so consider snagging a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-is-releasing-a-modernized-7800-console-that-plays-cartridges-this-holiday/1100-6525938/" data-ref-id="1100-6525938">preorder</a> to round out your retro console collection.</p><h2>Atari 400 Mini</h2><h3>$100 (was $120)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405129-71t1ur5x5l._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405129" data-ratio="0.564" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405129-71t1ur5x5l._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405129"></a><figcaption>Atari 400 Mini</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405129-71t1ur5x5l._sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>What’s great about the Atari 400 Mini is that it can emulate all Atari 8-bit systems, including the 400, 800XL, and 5200. The console has been fully modernized, featuring 720 HD output, HDMI support, and the option to play in a variety of aspect ratios. You can also enable a retro CRT filter to give your games a retro flair. It comes with 25 built-in games, though you can also play games via USB flash drive. This console includes a CXStick joystick, which is a recreation of the iconic Atari CX40.</p><h2>Atari 2600+</h2><h3>$110 (was $130)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405130-71hesrbyxdl._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405130" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405130-71hesrbyxdl._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405130"></a><figcaption>Atari 2600+</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405130-71hesrbyxdl._sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Atari 2600+ offers many of the same features as its smaller cousin, such as HDMI support, a joystick, and 10 games included with your purchase. Best of all, the Atari 2600+ offers full support for Atari 2600 and 7800 games thanks to a functional cartridge slot. That makes this a great way to check out your old Atari collection, though you’ll also find games for sale in case yours are no longer in working condition.</p><p>Shopping for a modern console?

                <p>Activision has released the latest operator bundle for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and it's none other than a shark. The "G'Day Bait Tracer Pack," as it's called, allows players to morph into a menacing-looking shark, but that's not all.</p><p>The bundle (<a href="https://www.oneesports.gg/call-of-duty/shark-skin-tracer-pack-price-items/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via One Esports</a>) includes two weapon blueprints and a number of exclusive cosmetics. The operator skin is called "Bloke Biter," and it transforms the operator Carver into a scary shark with huge muscles. The weapon blueprints included in the bundle are themed around the ocean and water. There are additional water-themed cosmetics to help make it look like you escaped from the depths.</p><p>This DLC bundle costs 24,000 COD Points, which is about $20 USD. You can get a closer look at the "G'Day Bait Tracer Pack" in the video below.</p><p>The in-game Call of Duty shop is regularly updated with new bundles, and the shark operator isn't the only new arrival. Peter Stormare's character, The Replacer, is now available in the store as well, and he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-the-replacers-leaked-finishing-moves-are-some-of-cods-most-ridiculous-yet/1100-6527926/" data-ref-id="1100-6527926">some of the most ridiculous finishing moves we've ever seen in Call of Duty.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 launched at the end of October and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5979">the month's best-selling game in the US</a>, and is already the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024 so far.</a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, it's been reported that Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">created a new committee to help shape the future of the mega-franchise.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-conor-mcgregor-collab-ended<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>studio IO Interactive has announced that it's ending its collaboration with MMA fighter Conor McGregor following a court ruling which found that McGregor assaulted a woman.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>, IO said that its Conor McGregor collaboration was ending "effective immediately". The studio followed up by saying it takes the matter of McGregor's victim's assault "very seriously" and that it "cannot ignore [the matter's] implications".</p>

<p>As such, all content involving McGregor will be removed from&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>"starting today". The developer hasn't explained what will happen if you already own&nbsp;<em>Hitman 3</em>'s Disruptor Pack, in which McGregor starred, but I'm assuming the content will be removed permanently from all storefronts.</p>

<p>McGregor has been ordered to pay his victim Nikita Hand over&nbsp;€248,000 in damages, a result that Ms. Hand described as "a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be to speak up, you have a voice".</p>

<p>For his part, McGregor says he plans to appeal the verdict and that he's "focused on [his] future" for the time being.</p>

<p>The jury in McGregor's case heard a paramedic who examined Ms. Hand following the assault that they hadn't seen "someone so bruised" in a long time, while Ms. Hand herself said that she had spent over&nbsp;€4,000 on psychotherapy, pharmaceutical aid, and doctor's visits.</p>

<p>Technically, the character in the game is never named as Conor McGregor, although he does clearly sport McGregor's face, as well as bearing a tattoo on his stomach that reads "McGregor".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305474/sonic-3-trailer-chao-garden-detective-pikachu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are a handful of details <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves">Parmount’s third <em>Sonic</em></a><em> </em>feature needs to get right in order for it to feel like a proper adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2,</em> and the movie’s latest trailer makes it look like it has the Chao Garden (arguably the best part of the game) on lock.</p><p>Though it features a few more shots of the Robotniks (Jim Carey) and Shadow the Hedgehog (Keanu Reeves) plotting to obliterate the earth, the highlight of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s new trailer are its new shots of the Chao Garden. While <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>’s Chao Garden was basically a daycare to raise magical little creatures, the movie reimagines it as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042393/the-world-definitely-does-not-need-a-chuck-e-cheese-game-show">Chuck E. Cheese</a>-like restaurant where Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and his crew like to hang out as Chao mascots dance around on stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Given all the Chao merch on display, you’d almost think the tiny blob creatures were the <em>Pokémon </em>of the live-action <em>Sonic</em>’s world in terms of being part of a beloved video game franchise. But these kids and Knuckles (Idris Elba) all seem to have seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a>, implying that the film was a successful movie adaptation in their world as well. Though Sonic’s Google Maps joke falls a little flat, the shots of Shadow using a weird orb to terrorize everyone gives him a bit of a <a href="https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Mewtwo_Ball">Mewtwo vibe</a> that feels fitting, given his being something of a misunderstood villain.</p><p>And while there’s no sign whether Rouge the Bat will make an appearance, the trailer’s a good reminder that the movie’s December 20th premiere is going to be an explosive one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You’ll find all manner of weapons throughout the Zone, and while many of them come to you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-do-with-broken-weapons-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken and worn</a>, they’re still viable if you don’t mind spending a little money on repairs. But sometimes, it’s not worthwhile. It’s better to stick with what you know, what you’ve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-upgrade-weapons-in-stalker-2-full-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent time upgrading and using frequently</a>. Yes, the game does have “meta” weapons that excel, whereas others falter. Here is an overview of the best weapons in Stalker 2 for every situation!</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-best-weapons-for-every-encounter">Stalker 2’s Best Weapons for Every Encounter</h2>



<p>It’s life or death in the Zone, and a competent weapon that’s well-maintained, upgraded, and customized with a few worthwhile attachments that you’re comfortable using makes a difference. Of course, not any old weapon will suffice. You want the meta. You want the rifle that’ll keep you alive in mid-range encounters, the sniper rifle for long-range precision, and the up-close-and-personal shotgun to clear abandoned labs. These are the best weapons in Stalker 2 that I recommend for every player:</p>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Best All-Around Weapon</strong>: The AKM-74S is an easy to acquire assault rifle with one of the most common ammo types available in the Zone. With a relatively low overall weight, manageable recoil, and relatively stable accuracy across mid and long-range engagements, you’ll find the starting AKM a stalwart companion through most of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Best CQB Weapon</strong>: The Ram-2 is not only a gorgeous bullpup-style shotgun with multiple barrelts but also a powerful one capable of clearing a hallway with ease. It’s a large weapon, taking up a 5×2 slot in your inventory, but that space isn’t going to waste. With high damage and rate of fire, the Ram-2 offers the discerning Stalker a chance at toppling enemies who dare to enter your personal bubble.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Best Pistol</strong>: Skif’s Pistol, yes, is a starting weapon and a PM. It’s not the most powerful handgun in the game, a title most will agree goes to the revolver, but your first handgun is special. It’s lightweight, highly customizable and upgradeable, versatile, and its ammunition—9x18mm PST—is readily available from the jump.</li>



<li><strong>Best Customizable Rifle</strong>: The AR416 feels like it should be a rare assault rifle, but it’s not. You can find it on Ward Soldiers at the Laboratory in Garbage, you’ll also occasionally receive one as a quest reward, such as during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-the-poppy-field-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Fields</a>. </li>



<li><strong>Best Sniper Rifle</strong>: The M701 Super shines as one of the most attractive and powerful sniper rifles in the Zone. It’s a bolt-action precision rifle that’s powerful, heavy, and expensive. Oh, and you can only upgrade it at Harpy in Yaniv Station, making it a bit of a unicorn. But for all of its downfalls, which aren’t really that bad, the M701 will serve you well in clearing enemy forces from afar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Windows 11 version 24H2 update is currently causing issues when playing certain Ubisoft games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> on Microsoft’s website, the Windows 24H2 update causes several issues while playing specific Ubisoft games, which included unresponsiveness while launching, loading or playing the games. Some users have also reported facing black screens while playing these titles. Check out all the affected games below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed Origins</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>



<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>
</ul>



<p>Ubisoft has “released a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">temporary mitigation</a> for Star Wars Outlaws to prevent the game from failing and stop responding” in the latest Windows 11 update. However, players might still encounter performance issues even after this hotfix. A permanent fix is currently being worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Windows 11 24H2 update is a phased rollout that will arrive for all eligible devices within the coming weeks. If the update becomes available for your device, it will be downloaded and installed automatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ubisoft has clarified the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-clarifies-assassins-creed-animus-hub-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Animus hub rumours</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project U is back on the drawing board</a> after 5 years of development. What are your thoughts on the latest Windows 11 update stopping Ubisoft games from working?&nbsp;</p>

Fans know next to nothing about this project, but according to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, Troy Baker has signed on to appear in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In a heartbeat I would always work with Troy,” Druckmann is quoted as saying in the article. Baker famously played Joel in The Last of Us Parts 1 and 2 for Naughty Dog and has worked closely with Druckmann for years.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/25/gettyimages-1455443700-1732545103522.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Troy Baker.

At the time, the studio said it would have needed to put all its resources into post-launch content for years to come, and that approach would have severely impacted its ability to develop future single-player games. Naughty Dog then went on to confirm that it had more than one ambitious brand new single-player game in the works, without revealing anything about them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-as-it-works-on-multiple-single-player-projects-neil-druckmann-says">Druckmann said Naughty Dog was looking to break away from being predominantly associated with The Last of Us</a>. "I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever," Druckmann insisted, speaking of Naughty Dog's beloved post-apocalyptic franchise that debuted in 2013 and received its Part 2 sequel in 2020. The studio is otherwise best known for creating the Uncharted franchise, though this was put to bed with 2016's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review"><u>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</u></a> and smaller follow-up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review"><u>The Lost Legacy</u></a> a year later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Baker is set to star as Indiana Jones for MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and The Great Circle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sniper-elite-resistance-doubles-down-on-the-saboteur-sandbox-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Developer Rebellion gives the series' secondary hero a shot at the big time in this new operation set in Nazi-occupied France.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Sniper Elite series has dived further into its World War II setting, it's embraced more of a Hitman-esque sandbox approach to stealth-action gameplay, getting players in the shoes of a saboteur aiming to cripple the Nazi empire from the inside. But what the series still excels at is capturing the suspense and rush of carefully sneaking behind enemy lines to land that one critical shot against an unsuspecting Nazi scumbag – and showing you the bloody results with the classic X-ray kill cam. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Sniper Elite: Resistance, developer Rebellion continues Sniper Elite 5's open-ended approach to sneaking into enemy territory and smashing Nazis in gory, schlocky fashion, and this time it gives the series' secondary protagonist their time in the spotlight. Just ahead of its January launch, we played over an hour of a mission focusing on destroying a German super train and sneaking through a hotel in search of valuable intel – all of which showcased what Sniper Elite does best.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sniper Elite: Resistance - November 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In parallel to the events of Sniper Elite 5, Resistance focuses on the exploits of British commando Harry Hawker. Returning players will recognize Harry as one of the second playable characters in the series' co-op campaigns alongside Karl Fairburne, so think of Resistance as an opportunity to see what he was up to while Karl was flying solo in the fifth game. The main story of Resistance focuses on Harry weakening the empire's influence and helping the French resistance gain the upper hand – all while channeling some strong Jason Statham energy as he does it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sniper Elite 5 saw a steady release of DLC missions that saw Karl Fairburne invade secret weapons facilities hidden in France, but the developers saw an opportunity to create a new campaign within the occupied country that told a different story, which led to the decision to create an entirely new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We felt that there was much more to explore in the French theater for the war, and we ended up making basically a full fledged campaign from what we wanted to do," said Shaw. "It was just better for players if we could release one big game rather than lots of little updates like for Sniper Elite 5."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Sniper Elite 5, Resistance is a stealth-action game where you carefully maneuver through dense levels packed with Nazi guards, outposts, and other encampments filled with supplies and valuable intel. Along with your reliable long-range sniper rifle, which includes different ammo types to mask sound and amplify damage, you also have a pair of binoculars to scout ahead and mark targets. Harry also possesses secondary weapons and gear to distract enemies and sabotage structures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resistance continues with that Hitman-style approach to taking out key targets and objectives with direct action or some off-the-wall problem-solving. There's that familiar thrill being able to quietly whittle down enemy presence with stealth kills and distracting guards with bottles to sneak through well-guarded areas. While the quiet approach is often the best way to make it through, Harry can still hold his own when all hell breaks loose – yet you're better off keeping a low profile, as Harry can be quickly taken out if peppered with enough bullets. Generally, the enemy AI is competent and kept me on my toes. However, there were some odd moments where I felt their behavior was a bit off when ignoring obvious signs of sabotage or having some weird instances of the enemies not being able to maneuver through areas as well as you'd think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was an area that fans responded to well with Sniper Elite 5, and the developers wanted to lean further into that open ended experience. According to Shaw, the levels of Sniper Elite: Resistance was designed to allow for multiple playstyles from players.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Resistance continues with that Hitman-style approach to taking out key targets and objectives with direct action or some off-the-wall problem-solving.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"What Sniper Elite does well is give players a lot of different tools and avenues to tackle any situation as they please," said Shaw. "As we see it internally, we allow players to observe first, examining their points of interests and enemies in the area, and try to figure out ways in which they might want to move through the level and complete the  objective. We want to make sure players can get high up to get those sniping shots in there, but also allow for players to stick to the stealth side of things completely – we try to cater as many play styles as we can."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What impressed me the most about this particular mission was how dense and multilayered the level design was. This level featured an impressive amount of verticality and different pathways to reach my goal of getting to the city's main hotel-turned-Nazi-command-base. In one ill-fated attempt, I tried a stealthy direct approach across a fortified bridge, but that quickly went south after getting spotted. In another go, I went to the opposite side and found my way to a train yard where one of the side objectives was to destroy a train. Along the way, I was whittling down targets and taking out high-profile marks to score extra experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The standout moment in the mission was reaching the hotel, which had multiple points of entry and hidden pathways into locked rooms by climbing on the side of the building. This was my favorite section of the mission, and it was satisfying to escape from the zipline above and down into the streets below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From what I played, Sniper Elite: Resistance largely sticks to the same formula as Sniper Elite 5, featuring the familiar loop and objectives that fans are accustomed to. It's not quite aiming to be a massive leap forward, but rather doubles down on Sniper Elite 5's open-ended stealth-action gameplay. One new feature that I didn't get to dive into was the new propaganda missions, which the developers state are hidden within each stage and unlock micro-missions where you take control of other members of the resistance, showcasing their stories and particular objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sniper Elite: Resistance Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a campaign aiming for a similar length to the Sniper Elite 5, Resistance works as a worthy companion to the previous game, but also seems like a compelling entry point for newcomers to the series. So far, Sniper Elite: Resistance maintains that familiar yet still satisfying action of being an assassin in an open world where you smash fascists and liberate towns from the Nazi scourge – and yes, it'll never get old seeing those kill cams in action.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Hitman developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has cut ties with MMA fighter Conor McGregor, following last week's Irish High Court ruling that found he had assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921">statement</a> released via social media this afternoon, IO said it was no longer associated with McGregor and would "begin removing content" featuring the UFC star from storefronts "starting today". 
</p>
<p>"In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately," the developer wrote. 
</p>
<p>"We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today."</p>
<p>
McGregor's voice and likeness is used in Hitman for a character named The Disruptor, which previously featured as one of the game's Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
The Disruptor mission returned to the game earlier this month for a limited time, and had been set to be playable until Sunday 8th December. 
</p>
<p>
An additional Disruptor DLC pack meanwhile offers players permanent access to The Ostentatious, an arcade contract featuring The Disruptor, as well as a new outfit, items, and a set of cosmetics for the freelancer house. 
</p>
<p>
Last week, an Irish jury decided McGregor had sexually assaulted a woman in a Dublin hotel six years ago, and was subsequently ordered to pay at least €248k (£206k) in damages.
</p>
<p>
McGregor has said he will appeal the verdict.

            <p>A new trailer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film has been released, showing off its version of the Chao Garden.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not exactly as you remember from the games: it's some sort of mascot café featuring dancing Chao characters and a group of children who ask Tails if he's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detective-pikachu">Detective Pikachu</a>.</p>
<p>Then things turn bad and soon we see Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog in the middle of Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The trailer offers the best look yet at Shadow (with a gun!), as well as Jim Carrey's two Eggman villains, and Maria Robotnik from Shadow's past.</p>
<p>Despite its real world setting, then, it seems the film will include plenty of elements familiar to fans of the games.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is due out in cinemas on 20th December, just before Christmas. It's fitting the trailer ends with a Christmas scene, in something of a callback to Carrey's performance as The Grinch.</p>

<p>The film will conclude Sega's Year of Shadow, which also included the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p>
<p>Sega also shared with Eurogamer some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-showcases-shadow-the-hedgehog-design-in-never-before-seen-sketches">exclusive design sketches of Shadow the Hedgehog</a> from Sonic Team's Kazuyuki Hoshino.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, the Chao Garden allowed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2 players to level up cute Chao critters and then race and battle them against one another. It's a much-requested feature in a potential Sonic Adventure 3 game, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-plans-for-sonic-adventure-3-says-sonic-team-boss-but-wed-love-to-make-it">Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka has "no plans" for such a project</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>If you’ve played the last couple of Sniper Elite games, you know pretty much exactly what to expect from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>. In fact, but for featuring Harry Hawker as its protagonist instead of series mainstay Karl Fairburne, this could easily have been branded as Sniper Elite 6. But then that might have put the pressure on to try and seriously advance the series, where Resistance feels like more of a classic standalone expansion pack –&nbsp;not that this is necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance Spotlight -  Out of the Shadows" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ai9hsXpo2ww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We’ve gone hands-on with a second mission from Sniper Elite: Resistance, following up from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">our first go back at Gamescom 2024</a>, and what I said then holds true now. This is sniper stealth-action comfort food, not to mention the WW2 setting and almost pantomime villainy of the Nazis, who just so happen to have another wunderwaffe in development.</p>


<p>Deep in occupied France with Harry linking up with the local French Resistance, this mission dropped us into a heavily guarded city of Lyon at night, looking to follow up on Resistance intel about mysterious cargo passing through the city’s train station. Along the way, you’ll also have to break into the Gestapo HQ at the Hotel Terminus, and try to inspect a cargo haul within its basement. After the castle town infiltration of my first hands-on, this is another urban setting that will equally provide you with a ton of hiding places and an awful lot of potential dangers from guards in high places.</p>
<p>Starting off on a hill overlooking the city, your eye is immediately drawn to the many spotlights and sniper spots –&nbsp;there’s a wild and excessive amount of sniper scope glare that will help you find snipers in the dark. Pulling out a handy set of binoculars, you can spot and mark enemies from all the way across the map, highlighting their positions for whenever you’re able to pull out the sniper rifle and make your tentative progress safer. Those binoculars also have a very capable parabolic microphone built-in, letting you listen in on conversations from a good long distance, potentially revealing clues from the loose lips of patrolling guards, soldiers and Gestapo.</p>


<p>Check the mission map, and there’s a bunch of main and side objectives to take on across the sandbox level. Each level has a high-ranking officer to take out from the Kill List, there’s a side mission to try and check in on a Resistance safe house (which has been found by the Gestapo, the surviving members fleeing to a backup hidey hole elsewhere in the city), and then the main mission objectives. There’s also new propaganda posters that will drop you into a quick side mission, though we didn’t find this, and the returning Axis Invasion mode that you can engage with or completely ignore.</p>
<p>Harry comes with a familiar set of tools –&nbsp;a trusty Welrod, an SMG for moments where you just need to spray and run away, and of course one of the game’s many sniper rifles. Alongside that, there’s a variety of explosives, traps and grenades that you can use in certain situations, such as booby trapping a noise maker or (in what was at least incredibly immoral at the time, and now illegal) a dead body that might draw an enemy near.</p>
<p>You’ll want to scrounge from the map to broaden your selection of gear, and that Resistance safehouse was an absolute treasure trove of different mines, ammunition types (subsonic bullets won’t be as noticeable to enemies), and limited use special weapon like a silenced sniper, though these do still emit enough sound that you need to be aware of nearby enemies being alerted. Then again, it’s not too difficult to get some noise cover for your sniping by sabotaging a diesel generator and timing when you start blasting.</p>

<p>It did take me a few goes to really get into the swing of things with this level, thanks in part to some wayward Welrod shots getting me discovered. It’s easy to get spotted more generally, thanks to plenty of overlooking spots from snipers, including two bridges across the city’s river, and once the alert has been raised, soldiers come rushing to your last known location –&nbsp;thankfully a zipline makes for a very handy escape route. I also noticed some guards walking around with flashlights in addition to the sweeps of searchlights from guard towers.</p>
<p>It all kicked off when getting to the opulent Hotel Terminus, the number of enemies in this area meaning I was spotted almost immediately and the time pressure of our hands-on time coming to a close forcing me to sprint through the building, up the stairs, set a satchel charge on the Gestapo office and then quickly grabbing what I could find in there before figuring out how to get the Hell out of there. Luckily a zipwire got me out into the gardens… but with the area on high alert, I was quickly spotted again and gunned down just as our session came to a close.</p>

<p>I do wonder what the future holds for Sniper Elite after the release of Resistance. We’re at a point where Rebellion’s take on stealth action and sandbox levels has maybe come to its evolutionary conclusion, so that Sniper Elite 6 might have to be a more fundamental reworking of the underlying game engine and gameplay core, pushing the production values higher. Resistance has some dated quirks, like certain waist-height scenery being oddly impossible to vault over, or the way characters slide into position for a melee takedown.</p>
<p>For now, though, Sniper Elite: Resistance will give another batch of good ol’ Sniper Elite action. It’s solid and dependable, and it’s always gruesomely amusing to see the series’ staple X-ray kill cam trigger as you explode someone’s testicles from the other side of the map.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/penny-blood-director-dangen-entertainment-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Penny Blood&nbsp;</em>director and Studio Wildrose CEO Matsuzo Machida has announced that he's filed a lawsuit against production company Dangen Entertainment and its former CEO Ben Judd over "unpaid production costs".</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.studiowildrose.jp/post/%E8%A8%B4%E8%A8%9F%E6%8F%90%E8%B5%B7%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8A%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%89%E3%81%9B" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement</a> spotted by news platform <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/director-of-penny-blood-shadow-heartss-spiritual-successor-files-lawsuit-over-unpaid-funding-from-kickstarter-campaign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, Machida simply says that he's suing Judd and Dangen, naming Judd as a "producer" on&nbsp;<em>Penny Blood</em>'s Kickstarter and Dangen as part of the "campaign team".</p>

<p>Presumably, Dangen and Judd were supposed to help Studio Wildrose and Machida out with production costs on&nbsp;<em>Penny Blood</em>, but Machida seems to be alleging that this didn't happen. No further details about the lawsuit are provided in the announcement.</p>

<p>The campaign, which was launched by&nbsp;<em>Wild Arms&nbsp;</em>creator Akifumi Kaneko and&nbsp;<em>Shadow Hearts&nbsp;</em>lead Matsuzo Machida, aimed to get both games funded simultaneously, since the developers believed that it would be more difficult to fund them separately.</p>

<p><em>Penny Blood&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Armed Fantasia</em>'s dual Kickstarter asked for around $700,000 to bring both games to PC, and that goal was met within hours, with the campaign going on to <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/armed-fantasia-penny-blood-campaigns-close-successfully/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">make over $2.6 million</a> in total.</p>

<p>Despite this success, we still don't have release dates or specific release windows for either project. Notably, Kaneko and&nbsp;<em>Armed Fantasia&nbsp;</em>don't seem to have anything to do with the lawsuit brought against Dangen and Judd by Machida.</p>

<p>Those allegations led to Judd being dismissed from his position with publishing firm Digital Development Management, as well as leading to his resignation from Japanese gaming festival BitSummit's board of directors.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that Machida's lawsuit isn't the first time Judd and Dangen have been accused of foul play when it comes to indie developers. We'll have to wait and see what, if anything, the lawsuit yields.</p>

Gerald was always an interesting inclusion for an adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, as the Dreamcast platformer’s story was set entirely after his death. But Carrey seems to be playing him a bit, uh, sillier than he’s seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560">in most <em>Sonic </em>media</a></span>, which I’m not thrilled by out of context. So maybe this is all in the interest of bringing some levity to the otherwise dark events of Shadow’s backstory. </p><p>Otherwise, the trailer shows that a lot of elements from <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> will show up in the movie, including what looks like the Space Colony Ark space station Shadow was born on, and his use of the Eclipse Cannon to destroy part of the moon. It also gives him a gun as a callback to his self-titled game, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>. I never thought I’d see the day an officially-licensed <em>Sonic </em>thing would give Shadow firearms again. But here we are. It’s the Year of Shadow, baby.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below:</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>will apparently include a big tease about what comes next for the franchise, and even though the series uses up one of its biggest possible reveals in Shadow, there’s still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899">a lot of territory the movies haven’t covered yet</a></span>.

I’m still holding out hope that Rouge might secretly be in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> and this is a <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home </em>situation in which marketing and trailers are purposefully omitting her, to preserve the surprise for moviegoers.

Game tracking website <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2127" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long to Beat</a> pegs Cyberpunk 2077's entire main story at around 25 hours and 30 minutes in total, meaning the player spent more time in the opening area than it would take to actually complete the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 opens with a handful of smaller missions before the crux of the story kicks off with The Heist. Per open-world game standards, it also limits players to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/Watson">the opening area of Watson</a> during this time, meaning just a fraction of the game's total activities (that award experience points) are available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">uO__Ou overcame this somewhat by using an exploit that allowed them to leave Watson.

"Repeat it over and over and over. Took me 40 hrs but, to be honest, if I did this more efficiently, it can take less than 35 hours. Just don't forget to sleep every hour for an experience boost and to use different weapons for your sanity and for skill progression."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 uses a similar progression system to the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review">The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</a>, where players can engage in different activities to level up specific skills which contribute to the overall level.
