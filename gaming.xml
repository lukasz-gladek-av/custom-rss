                <p>Switch 2 owners who purchased Dbrand's Killswitch have been reporting that their Joy-Con 2s detach from the console relatively easily once their controllers have been wrapped in the protective cover. Several users have claimed that the magnetic connection is weakened by the Killswitch case, but Dbrand is preparing to address this as it says anyone suffering from the "manufacturing tolerance issue" can reach out to the company and get a free set of replacement Joy-Con 2 Grips.</p><p>Dbrand originally acknowledged this issue <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/" rel="nofollow ">in a Reddit post that wasn't too well-received</a>, as it acknowledged an air gap that's crucial in creating resistance between console and controller was filled when the Killswitch was added. Because the lip on the Killswitch eliminated the buffer that was designed to absorb movement between the console and controller--which is needed to create a fulcrum point when you remove the Joy-Con 2s--several users had begun reporting that their console detached from the controllers far too easily.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"When holding the Switch 2 in a specific way, detachment between the Joy-Con 2s and [the] remainder of the console can occur," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/" rel="nofollow ">Dbrand explained</a>. "Some experience this issue. Some do not. This discrepancy is due to a manufacturing tolerance issue on the retaining lip that keeps the Joy-Con Grip attached to the Joy-Con. Anyone who suffers from the manufacturing tolerance issue can reach out and we'll get them better Joy-Con Grips in July. One nuanced point that got a bit lost in the prior update was that there <em>is</em> an alternative to the retaining lip. It's been tested and is already in-market on a few Switch 2 cases. It's adhesive. The problem with adhesive is that, given enough time or the wrong kind of stress, it will ultimately fail."</p><p>In our own testing, we did manage to replicate the issue with the Killswitch that several Switch 2 owners have experienced. The catch here is that this did require us to have our Switch 2 held at very specific angles to properly replicate, and we needed to apply some considerable force to the console as well.</p><p>While this appears to be an issue that some people are experiencing, the updated version will still be worth grabbing, as the Killswitch does offer some of the best ergonomic support, thanks to its design when compared to competitors like Satisfye and JSAUX. The Killswitch offers ridges for your fingers to rest in, resulting in a comfortable and natural grip.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dbrands-nintendo-switch-2-killswitch-grip-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6532032/" data-ref-id="1100-6532032">Check out our previous story on the Killswitch</a> for more details about the grip, including the unique dock adapter, optional travel cover, and bundle options.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">New platforms like the Nintendo Switch 2 are a siren call for many developers—and being selected by Nintendo to create a launch-exclusive title can be a huge boon for a game studio. So developers may have been surprised to see one of the few platform-exclusive titles at launch was a game called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/survival-kids-switch-2/">Survival Kids</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's published by Konami, but was developed entirely in-house by engine and in-app advertising company Unity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given Unity's prior aversion to developing games with its own engine (a practice sometimes called "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/business/dogfooding.html">dogfooding</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">"), it was surprising to see the company land in such a prominent position. But as producer Andy Dennison explained to Game Developer, this doesn't mean Unity is all-in on internal game development. The team cooked up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to achieve two major goals: first, to make a game fully "end-to-end" with Unity to help Dennison's team with its main task: parachuting in to help Unity developers solve engine-specific technical problems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And second: to prepare Unity—and everyone who uses it—for the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="From ">From <span>Gigaya</span> to <span>Survival Kids</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity nearly began making games with its own software in 2022 with the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/blog/games/introducing-unitys-latest-sample-game-gigaya">Gigaya</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was meant to be a "sample" game and a commercial product. But just two months after the game was announced, it reportedly laid off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-reportedly-laying-off-hundreds-of-employees">the bulk of the development team</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and canceled the project.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2 shows Nintendo's strategy for an online social future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the same year, Unity was quietly ramping up a division called "Unity Studio Productions" in the United Kingdom. Its first employee was Dennison, who leads the studio, primarily helping developers "behind the scenes" optimizing Unity. "You don't often hear about the work we do," he admitted in a recent chat with Game Developer, saying that the team's projects can range from short-term engagements like high-level performance profiling to larger long-term projects like porting or moving codebases from one engine over into Unity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dennison said that these smaller projects taught Unity plenty of lessons that could be used to improve the engine. "But they're always relatively narrow windows into [game] development," he explained. "You might only be looking at a specific problem or platform." That drove Unity to resurrect the idea of making a game entirely in-engine from end-to-end.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was in late 2022 that Dennison and his colleagues connected with Konami at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, striking it up with Konami Europe exec Richard Jones. There the two teams hit it off, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> entered development in March 2023.</span></p><p>Image via Unity/Konami.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a slew of Leamington Spa-area developers on the team (many veterans of Codemasters, Playground Games, and Rare), Dennison said the company was able to ship </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a relatively quick two-year period. With neither Konami or Unity relying on the game's success to prop up their financials, Dennison said the Studio Productions team could focus on "replicating what many of our customers go through."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They're building games with [schedules], with scope they have to think very carefully about, and a team they have to manage and look after," he observed. "I think that replication of our customers' day-to-day, and how they operate their businesses, was important as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's why he's glad the studio made what he called a "larger" game—not a platformer or mobile game Unity is more broadly used for. It also made Unity Studio Productions one of the first teams to get a look at two key Switch 2 features: GameShare and GameChat.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Survival Kids"><span>Survival Kids</span> is optimized for GameShare and GameChat</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Nintendo Switch 2 isn't a console with major new gameplay features like the Wii, Wii U, or the Switch. Its primary advancements come in the form of modest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games">internal hardware upgrades and AI upscaling</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/design-opportunities-for-devs-from-our-time-trying-out-the-nintendo-switch-2">a Joy-Con mouse mode</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future">a slew of social features</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> marking Nintendo's first major foray into the world of online multiplayer games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dennison said Unity learned about the social features after work started on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but "the stars aligned" and the game became a strong testbed for two key features: GameShare and GameChat. Dennison was particularly proud of the work on GameShare, which allows one player to invite other Switch and Switch 2 users to their game session without installing additional software. "It's essentially an extension of split-screen technology," he explained. When players use GameShare with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, their device renders a separate in-game camera for each player and streams it out to other Switch devices. Unity had already been developing two-player split screen for local play, but found it could push and optimize the engine to support up to three players over GameShare.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We worked really closely with the platform team, who didn't have another test case for that at this stage because it's so new."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This also made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a test for how game designers can think about games players might want to play together over GameChat—the video/audio chatroom system built into the Switch 2. It's not as straightforward as just making a good multiplayer game. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/extended-reality/owlchemy-labs-dimensional-double-shift-shows-what-s-next-for-vr-development">Developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we've chatted with in 2025 have spoken about how "presence" and spaces where players can relax and form their own kind of play are part of an emerging trend particularly popular with younger audiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Dennison, once Nintendo explained how the Switch 2 would handle the chat components of the game, his team doubled down on the "emote system" as a tool for in-game socialization and cooperation. Players can tap an "emote" button to auto-play a "smart emote" that aligns to what they're mostly likely trying to communicate, or use a wheel-like interface to pick specific emotes like planting a flag. This emote makes a flag emoji pop up on the other players' screens, pointing them in the direction of their teammate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Focusing on emotes puts Unity in the same camp as Riot Games, which is counting on them to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/how-riot-games-is-preparing-for-the-next-generation-of-players">boost the socialization</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> aspect of its upcoming tag-team fighting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dennison previously worked at Rare on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sea of Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so he's familiar with this kind of play. He still thinks the industry is only "scratching the surface" of this genre. "It's really encouraging communal play. I think there's another 20 years of innovation in that space, for sure."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just don't expect Unity Studio Productions to be the one doing that innovating. Dennison made clear that his team's first priority is "doing everything we can internally to make sure what we build is production-verified." It's the company's policy to make sure the engine is ready day zero for the launch of new platforms like the Switch 2, and in this case, making an original game was a great method for hitting that goal. It's not the team's primary focus now that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Survival Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is out the door.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it could be again—under the right circumstances. "We would love to find the right opportunity to partner with someone again and the right "story" internally about the technology we're going to push on that next product," Dennison said.

<p>On top of all this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>-themed enemies and weapons have been added to properly combine the two games.</p>

<p>You can expect new building types too, allowing you to better improve your base. There's also an overhauled enemy base system, allowing foes you find out in the wilds to construct their own fortifications much like you do.

<p>Palworld took the world by storm last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-passes-5m-copies-sold-in-three-days">selling five million copies in three days</a>. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">later came to PlayStation</a>, but not before its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">developer was sued by Nintendo for copyright infringement</a>.

<p>Atari has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fatal_run_2089">Fatal Run 2089</a>, the upcoming racing revival for the Switch, will launch in Fall 2025.</p>
<p>The accompanying gameplay trailer gives us a fresh look at the new post-apocalyptic racer from developer MNSTR Studio, and we have to say, it's looking pretty decent so far. There's definitely a pretty heavy <strong>Mad Max</strong> vibe to the whole thing, and the brief snippets of dialogue sequences give us a good taste of the story.</p>
<p>We have to admit though, looking at the key features below, 20 levels doesn't really sound like a lot on paper. We might have to get a bit more context as to how long each one lasts and whether it's somewhat comparable to a proper race course you might see in a Mario Kart game, for example.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Hopefully we'll get a couple more good glimpses at the game ahead of its launch later this year, but we're certainly intrigued, at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 20 levels across four landscapes with branching paths, hidden shortcuts, and explosive set pieces</p>
<p>- Four larger-than-life boss fights that will each provide a unique challenge to players</p>
<p>- Classic arcade progression challenges you to beat the clock, or ARC decay, or it’s back to the start</p>
<p>- 63 different enhancements that can be dropped or appear in shops and 27 randomized add variety and unpredictability to each run</p>
<p>- 4 co-pilots with different skills and personalities add extra character to your adventure and ways to shape your playstyle</p>
<p>- Tailor your approach to one of seven vehicles with distinct performance characteristics: weave in and out of danger with a light ride or barrel through enemies with a heavy one. But you can only choose one car per run, no mid-trip switching.</p>

			<p>Sloclap's new football game, Rematch, has surpassed 3 million unique players and 1 million copies sold, the studio has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lseohvckdc2a">announced</a>.</p>
<p>It's a big milestone for the studio and a strong follow-up from its previous martial arts hit, Sifu, and seemingly a clear sign that being available on Xbox Game Pass at launch was a major boon for the multiplayer game.</p>
<p>Rematch officially launched for everyone on June 19, and just in its first 24 hours, was able to hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">1 million unique players</a> jumping onto the pitch, whether they bought the game or played it through Game Pass.</p>
<p>Now, less than a week from its official launch, and a week from its early access release for those who paid for the deluxe edition, it's tripled that number of players and still managed to hit a strong sales milestone.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe/app.bsky.feed.post/3lseohvckdc2a" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidvoyjxlkjdfbfv5exlp4pcg27aif6ns45mek4bz3f73gamodfqpu">
<p>Rematch has officially reached 3M unique players!For those keeping score, that's- 11.8M matches played- 55.6M goals scored- 33.5M assists- 69.1M savesThis is just the beginning.Thank you for being with us, in and out of the pitch!#rematch</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe?ref_src=embed">Rematch (@playrematch.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ivx73oyahbwxlsm3yspl5jxe/post/3lseohvckdc2a?ref_src=embed">2025-06-24T18:00:48.389Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">I reviewed Rematch for Wccftech</a>, and was happy to be able to report that none of the issues I have with the game come from the core gameplay. It's a very tightly-made game, which makes it all the more unfortunate that there are so many issues around the core gameplay in how it's all structured that bring the experience down. Issues like poor menu design, slow-progression, and the misclassification of actions while in games, like how a goalie punching the ball away from a shot on net instead of catching it is counted as an interception, instead of a save.</p>
<p>Still, none of these issues are worth stopping you checking it out, as many of them can thankfully be patched out, along with all the bugs that myself and 3 million other players have had to endure. And, not to beat a dead horse with regarding the launch discourse around the game, but if you're playing Rematch, for the love of all that is good in football, please learn to pass.</p>

            <p>Yesterday’s launch of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 laptop GPU was quiet, yet nonetheless featured a surprise: there’s also a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/rtx-5050-desktop-gpu-and-laptops/">desktop version of the RTX 5050</a>, set to release (exclusively in third-party garb – there’s no Founders Edition) in "the second half" of July. Quite the turnaround for the non-laptop XX50 lineage, which was widely assumed extinguished following 2022’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-review">RTX 3050</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The RTX 5050 will replace the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-review">RTX 5060</a> as the cheapest of Nvidia's current-gen desktop GPUs, starting at $249. Budget buyers will need to make do with 8GB of last-gen GDDR6 VRAM, however, as well as a lighter smattering of CUDA cores: 2,560 to the RTX 5060’s 3,840. There’s obviously no desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-year-on-the-rtx-4050s-appeal-has-grown-but-better-laptop-gpus-loom">RTX 4050</a> to compare these specs to, though next to the RTX 3050, it does offer more memory bandwidth even if the total gigabyte count remains the same. Presumably there are also performance advantages, especially where ray tracing is concerned, that the RTX 5050 can glean from its updated Blackwell architecture.</p>
<p>'Course, while the RTX 5050 might make for a decent upgrade for current 3050 owners – especially those interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a> and frame generation – its $249 price tag does keep it nervily close to the $300 RTX 5060. Which, even with its driver issues, really isn’t a bad 1080p card itself, so we’ll have to see what the 5050 can do to coexist with its more core-rich, wider-bandwidth big brother.</p>
<p>I’ll admit, there’s a not-small part of me that hopes it can. We can raise eyebrows at the specifications and make "Fnar fnar new GTX 1030" jokes until our typing fingers are worn down to stumps, but there genuinely are vast numbers of PC players who are happy with below-max quality 1080p yet can’t reliably stretch to mid-rangers like the XX60 series. People, in other words, who haven’t been adequately served by the GPU market in years. Arguably since even before the RTX 3050, what with that GPU launching during the dark times of COVID-compounded shortages and price gouging.</p>
<p>Will the RTX 5050 fill that gap? I won’t know until I’ve tested one out. But I’d rather it ends up as a failed attempt, than a repeat of the RTX 40 series' failing to try at all.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-desktop-grade-nvidia-rtx-5050-after-all-and-its-out-next-month]]></content:encoded>

Each glimpse we get of him using his powers appears to be from one of two scenes in the movie. This final trailer shows him just a little more, but I still want to see that stretchy king smack someone around with long, flailing limbs.

Galactus is coming and the Silver Surfer is here to foreshadow his arrival. We still don’t see more than the planet-eating invader’s foot in this trailer, and at this point, I guess we won’t get a really good look at him until the film premieres on July 25. These trailers have shown a lot of the same stuff each time—this latest trailer perhaps showing even less than previously—and the most charitable read I can give is to assume that Marvel is keeping this movie’s secrets close to its chest. The Fantastic Four’s debut is a big deal for the MCU, and maybe you don’t want to spoil every surprise and cool sequence, but in doing so it’s kept me from finding anything to latch onto.

Their interactions create a battle environment where deeper strategies can emerge.</p><ul><li>Attribute: Vaccine, Virus, Data, Free, Variable, and others (seven total)</li><li>Element: Fire, Water, Plant, and others (11 total)</li></ul><p>Virus-type Digimon are weak to Vaccine-type, which are weak to Data-type. The other Attributes have their own strengths and weaknesses. Separately, each Digimon has resistances and weaknesses to the Elements.</p><p>For example, if your opponent is a Virus-type, attacking with a Vaccine-type Digimon will grant a +100% damage bonus. Additionally, using Water-type skills against them if they’re weak to water will further increase the damage multiplier! The reverse is also true—if both attribute and element matchups are unfavorable, the damage dealt will be significantly reduced.</p><p>Gain the battle advantage by obtaining a variety of Digimon through both converting Digimon and by Digivolving them. As digital beings, Digivolution is not linear—meeting certain conditions will unlock multiple evolution paths, and Digimon can even be De-digivolved to a younger form, allowing for flexible training strategies.</p><p><strong>Digimon <a title="Series > Persona [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lities: Daring or Adoring?</strong></p><p>One of the new systems introduced in Time Stranger is Personalities. Each Digimon has one of 16 personality types, which influence stat growth, skill acquisition, and even digivolution conditions.</p><p>For example, a Digimon with a Daring personality will see higher growth in Attack and Defense, making it more suited for physical offense.</p><p><video id="video-976054-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/1iA99n8.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1iA99n8.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/1iA99n8.mp4</a></video></p><p>They can also learn personality-linked skills that enhance combat capabilities. While a Digimon’s personality is initially determined when it is converted, it can be changed later through communication and training using special items in the Digifarm.</p><p>That means you can have two of the same Digimon that may perform differently based on their Personalities.</p><p><strong>Agent Skills: Lend a Helping Hand</strong></p><p>Another new system is Agent Skills, which represents the player’s own abilities as an ADAMAS agent. By completing missions, players earn points that can be used to unlock various effects—such as enhancing Digimon with specific personalities, increasing experience gain, or easing digivolution requirements. These skills allow for even more depth in how you prepare for battles.</p><p><video id="video-976054-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/ScVgZkG.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ScVgZkG.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/ScVgZkG.mp4</a></video></p><p>Agents also have unique abilities known as Cross Arts—powerful techniques that fuse the player’s Digivice with a Digimon’s power during battles. Cross Arts can significantly influence combat with support effects like stat boosts or follow-up attacks.</p><p>As your Digimon train and evolve, you will also experience your own growth, indicated by Agent Rank. This directly affects your Digimon’s strength.</p><p><video id="video-976054-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/MwzN5Uf.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/MwzN5Uf.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/MwzN5Uf.mp4</a></video></p><p>We encourage players to take on missions proactively, raise their rank, and experience the sense of unity that comes from fighting alongside their Digimon teammates.</p><p><video id="video-976054-5" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/Us7gsQr.mp4?_=5"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Us7gsQr.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/Us7gsQr.mp4</a></video></p><p>As you can see, Attributes, Elements, and Digivolving—along with the new Digimon Personalities and Agent Skills—all work together to add strategic depth to this unique battle system. Every fight is an opportunity to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Digimon and an opportunity to build a roster of Digimon ready for any scenario.</p></div><p>Watch a short video summary of the new information below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/digimon-story-time-stranger-introduces-new-digimon-enhancement-systems]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Have you ever wanted to have a relationship with your toilet? No? Me neither. It sounds far too much like a euphemism to describe the morning after eating a particularly heinous kebab. Still, it’s definitely a question developer Sassy Chaps have asked themselves, and in response, they’ve created the sandbox dating simulator Date Everything, a narrative text-based adventure in which you can date, well, everything.</p>
<p><iframe title="Date Everything | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlxxzmOXRf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As we all know, AI is coming for our jobs. But for the protagonist of Date Everything, AI has already arrived. In a humorous – yet scarily believable – opening, our hapless lead has just got a new working at home job for a massive tech firm, only to instantly lose it again when they are promptly fired. It’s not all bad though, as they soon receive a mysterious parcel from another ex-employee.</p>


<p>This gift turns out to be a pair of near-magical glasses, named Date-viators – that turn every object in the house – well, around a hundred of them anyway – into sentient and eminently dateable entities. What follows is a very loose and delightfully daft conspiratorial narrative, which is nothing more than an excuse for the hilarity of trying to woo your boiler.</p>
<p>Characterisation here is over the top and completely charming, with gorgeous comic-book-like artwork bringing humanised curtains, shelves, and gym equipment to life. Each day you mooch around your house, using the handful of charges your glasses possess to chat to your furniture, before you head to bed – which you can also date – to allow your mystical specs to recharge.</p>


<p>Exploration takes place from a 3D first-person view, and it’s here that Date Everything is at it’s weakest. The frame rate on Switch during these first-person sections frankly sucks, with obnoxious controls that make even navigating around a kitchenette a ridiculous chore. It’s almost as if First-Person games were never a thing, with controls that haven’t been refined over decades of gameplay. However, put up with these clunky moments and you’ll find a lot to enjoy in Date Everything.</p>
<p>The script is razor sharp; sardonic, silly, often laugh-out-load hilarious and occasionally rather touching. As you chat to your household objects each day, you’ll learn more about them and their relationships with their fellow tables, TVs and tennis racquets. Often, you’ll have feuds to resolve by playing peacemaker, with the ultimate aim to bring harmony to your home, rather than to get intimate with your lamp – though both are possible. Voice acting is top-notch, with a who’s who of vocal talent from across the videogame industry.</p>

<p>My personal highlights include the Thor-like Gym-equipment called Kristof, the insecure office supplies named Penelope who just wants to be noticed and used again, and Rebel the… erm… bad ass rubber duck who hangs out in the bathroom. Sassy Chaps clearly take great pleasure in skewering modern culture, but they’re definitely equal opportunity mockers, with Microtransactions being lampooned with the money-obsessed and brilliantly named Michael Transaction. You can even date their own Deluxe Edition of the game, Lucinda, to hilarious effect.</p>
<p>It’s just enormous fun talking to these wonderfully conceived characters and undertaking their simple quests, and in doing so unlocking further characters to talk too. There’s no prescriptive order to chat to your objects either, you’re free to talk to, or not talk to, whoever you want. Whilst extended sessions with the game can reveal the limitations of the gameplay – which amounts to little more than reading and selecting the occasional response, let’s face it – in short bursts Date Everything is a sumptuous treat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It's no exaggeration to say that we fairly enjoy a bit of the old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania">Castlevania</a> here at Nintendo Life, having dished out very positive reviews to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_advance_collection">Castlevania Advance Collection</a> and, the equally fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a> in more recent times.</p>
<p>Of course, grabbing physical editions of these beauties on Nintendo Switch has been a little tricky, especially since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/limited_run_reveals_four_castlevania_anniversary_collection_physical_editions">Limited Run Games' snazzy versions</a> have long since sold out. However, for those amongst us who weren't so quick off the block for LRG's offerings, Play-Asia has some exciting news.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Yes, pre-orders are now live <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/search/castlevania+advance#fc=prc:1.3003249458,o:6?affiliate_id=956097" rel="sponsored noopener">over on Play-Asia</a> for a bunch of Castlevania sets, with Anniversary, Advance and Dominion getting standard and deluxe versions. Fair warning, some of these are <em>very</em> nice. *clutches wallet tightly*</p>
<p>So, what have we actually got here? Well, the Castlevania Anniversary Collection comes in a standard version and a very slick collector's edition. Both of these versions will release on the 26th June, so not long to go!</p>
<p>Oh, and the deluxe version contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Castlevania</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania II Simon's Quest</em></li>
<li><em>Castlevania III Dracula's Curse</em></li>
<li><em>Super Castlevania IV</em></li>

<li><em>Encyclopedia: Detailed information on enemies, the 'DSS' system, the 'Tactical Soul' system and the 'Spell Fusion' system will help you truly master each game's unique combat system!</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, the Dominus Collection arrives on the 18th of September...so plenty of time to get saving, vampire slayers. Here's some more PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Three incredible action adventure games from the Castlevania series have finally returned, for the first time!

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has a sizeable game update that promises to finally get the game's A-Life system working as intended. For those just joining us - perhaps because you only popped into existence the second you entered my field of view - A-Life is developer GSC Game World's noughties-era buzzword for the pervasive simulation of NPCs throughout the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a>, leading to unpredictable interactions and conflicts and the general sense that things are happening without your input. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Heart Of Chornobyl <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken">struggled to implement this at launch</a>, with supposed "roaming" bands of ragamuffins spawning right under the noses of players who promptly took to the Steam reviews to administer some wasteland justice. Our own James Archer had a few warm words in his otherwise positive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">Stalker 2 review</a>, calling the game "a captivating survival shooter, even with bits falling off".</p>
<p>Now GSC Game World say they've fixed it. They've also added "Water Electric Tornado" anomalies, together with official mod support via Steam Workshop, Mod.io and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/uk/p/stalker-2-zone-kit">Epic Games Store</a>, a couple of new guns, various quality-of-life tweaks, and the ability to loot mutant parts. Catch some of that in this showcase video.

<p>
The A-Life overhaul is the star attraction, here. Please find below some bullet points, meticulously scrounged from the pockets of the dead.
</p>
<blockquote><p>

- Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view.
</p>
<p>
- Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.
</p>
<p>
- The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.
</p>
<p>
- Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world's immersion.
</p>
<p>
- Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants' lair, for example, those mutants won't simply reappear moments later.
</p>
<p>
- A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone's population.
</p>
<p>
- Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the "pop-in" effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Nice balance of tiny tweaks and gargantuan reworkings, there. On the one hand, allowing you to see further to avoid the impression of "pop-in" seems like a matter of moving some decimal places around. Allowing characters "to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end", on the other hand, sounds like it would require the attention of an actual genie. Can my third wish be "add a top-down view and turn the game into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>"?
</p>
<p>
The new guns are the Three-Line Rifle and the Kora handgun. The patch notes don't go into much detail about the new anomaly, but "Water Electric Tornado" seems fairly self-explanatory. As for the quality-of-life rejiggles, you'll now be able to see available artifact slots for armour in the upgrade tab, and there's an unlockable Fix all button in the technician's upgrade menu, to repair all equipped gear. The player stash window is now larger, and there's a reload renewal feature for all of the weapons. 
</p>
<p>
Read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399?l=english">the full patch notes</a> for more, including many a balancing change and bugfix.

PlayStation CEO Hideaki Nishino recently remarked that players kept signing up for more expensive tiers even after the last round of increases. “The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483">told investors earlier this month</a></span>. </p><p>Ever wonder what the most popular games on the service are?

They are mostly single-player games, including four first-party Sony blockbusters: <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em>, and <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>. Others include <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and<em> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, alongside no-brainers like<em> Grand Theft Auto V</em>. Less obvious top-performers are <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and <em>UFC 5</em>. </p><p>PlayStation’s global services VP Nick Maguire told <em>Game File </em>the company remains committed to bringing its big first-party games to PS Plus no earlier than 18 to 24 months after they comes out. Instead, it’s been wooing subscribers to upgrade to the priciest tier with PS1 and PS2 classics, while streaming for PS3 games has been rarer. “Through streaming, we’ll still continue to look at those ones,” he said. “We haven’t ruled them out. The opportunities are there. But there are a lot of PS3 games already streaming.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-2025-diablo-4-kof-15-price-monster-hunter-wilds-1851785063]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation Plus is about to celebrate 15 years this coming June 29, after the service was first launched on June 29, 2010. We've already heard about some of the celebratory actions the company is taking to commemorate the milestone that went along with the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">July 2025 monthly PS Plus Essential games</a>.</p>
<p>Also part of the commemoration, Nick Maguire, vice president of global services at Sony Interactive Entertainment, spoke with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playstation-plus-15th-anniversary-interview-ghost-of-tsushima">Game File</a> about the previous 15 years and where the service currently is.</p>
<p>After SIE president and chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino revealed that more players are choosing the PS Plus Extra and Premium tiers, Maguire backed up Nishino's comments, and added that "<em>Engagement in Plus has never been higher than it is right now,</em>" which is due in part to the restructuring of the service PlayStation announced in 2022.</p>
<p>The switch from the old PS Plus model to the current tiered model "<em>surpassed our expectations</em>," Maguire said. "<em>It's really given us a new way to reach the audiences with these games, and it's given new value to partners to find new people to play their titles. And just the engagement we see from it is really positive, in terms of the number of people choosing that Catalog and coming back month after month</em>."</p>
<p>Magurie did not talk about how the prices have gone up, only saying "<em>I think we just want to invest in Plus. We want to invest in the proposition, bring more value to users. And we're seeing high growth in Extra, Premium</em>."</p>
<p>When Nishino was asked about the price increases just a couple of weeks ago, he said the increases were part of Sony "<em>increasing value we bring to the players</em>," and it's clear from how many players continue to choose the Extra and Premium tiers that the increases aren't exactly hurting subscriber numbers.</p>
<p>On a separate matter, Maguire did make it clear that Sony has no intention of adding its first-party, PlayStation Studios-developed titles to the PlayStation Plus service on day one. Instead, PlayStation will continue to add third-party titles on day one where it sees a good fit, like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-and-battlefield-2042-headline-june-2025s-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-game-catalog-additions/">FBC: Firebreak</a> recently launched into the service.</p>
<p>"<em>We've sort of stayed true to our strategy across the board, where we're not looking to put games in day and date. Our strategy of finding four or five independent day-and-date titles - and using that to complement our strategy of bringing games in when they're 12, 18 months old or older - that balance for us is working really well across the platform</em>."</p>
<p>And, if the opportunities are there, Sony wouldn't stop at just four or five independent games. "<em>If there were six or seven great opportunities, then we would go for them as well</em>," Maguire added.</p>
<p>Maguire also declined to comment on whether he thought that adding first-party multiplayer games like Concord to the service would be a benefit, and if Concord might've had a better chance were it launched directly into the PS Plus service.</p>
<p>"<em>I think Plus has proven itself to be a great way to introduce new players to franchises. So I think there's always going to be a moment for any game where there's the right time for it to go into Plus, when it's ready to reach a wider audience or...to find new fans or new parts of our platform that it hasn't already reached</em>," said Maguire.</p>
<p>Beyond the price increases, and the lack of first-party games added to the service day one, Game File also had Maguire address, as much as he was willing, the other big topic of conversation players have around the service, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">games being removed from the catalog</a>.</p>
<p>He doesn't directly address the removal of older first-party titles, like how the Resistance games were recently taken off the PS Plus Game Catalog list, but said "<em>We've got 80 collections of games across the catalog, so we want to keep it fresh and bring in new games. Sometimes that means taking a few games out at the same time to keep the proposition interesting and help people find new games as well</em>."</p>
<p>The modern day subscription service is shaking up its offerings all the time. Whether its PlayStation Plus, Xbox Game Pass, Netflix, etc., things are added and taken away from them on a regular basis. But it remains mind-boggling that PlayStation would remove its first-party titles, especially when they're games that are difficult to play any other way if you don't have original hardware.</p>
<p>At the very least, Maguire says that he does read the comments players leave on PS Plus-specific posts, and that he thinks "<em>It can be helpful to understand where people are at, and, if we can, take that into our learnings in the future</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>I think we'll continue to listen and learn about what gamers want and try to bring more value in for them. We're very proud of what we've delivered in the last few years. And excited to sort of see the response and the engagement we get from players coming in</em>."</p>

			<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced will launch on PC and consoles on August 12, Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> today.</p>
<p>The enhanced edition of the second entry in the series, released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">last year</a> on PC and Xbox Series X|S, will launch as a free upgrade for owners of the original release. On PlayStation 5, users will be able to purchase either the Standard Edition for $49.99, which includes the base game with some additional features, or the Deluxe Edition for $69.99, which includes the base game as well as a PS5-optimized version of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Owners of the PlayStation 4 version of the first entry in the series will receive a free upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced has some new features over last year's release, making it the definitive edition of the game, no matter the platform. One of the biggest additions is Performance Mode on Xbox Series X, offering 60 FPS gameplay for the first time on consoles. On PC, the Enhanced edition will introduce a Very High preset to push visual fidelity further. The Enhanced edition will also make the game a Steam Deck Verified title, with optimizations aimed at delivering a smooth experience on the handheld system. Also coming with the new edition of the game is a new optional play mode that sees the return of the Dark Rot, an enhanced photo mode, and developer commentary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Ninja and Xbox have announced the PS5 release date for&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, as well as the new enhancements current owners on Xbox and PC can expect.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Xbox Wire, the followup to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5" rel="nofollow">arrive on PS5</a> on August 12th. This won't be the first time the franchise has appeared on PlayStation, of course;&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>got itself a PS4 release, after all.</p>

<p>Still, the game's release on PS5 marks an increasingly friendly approach to PlayStation on Xbox's part. Many of the studio's games are making their way to PlayStation now, including upcoming titles like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those include a new Performance Mode, which will allow you to play at 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X (but not S, unfortunately). The PC version will also include a new Very High graphics preset, allowing you to push more powerful rigs to their limit.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox and Team Ninja say that when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga&nbsp;</em>launches, it'll be Steam Deck Verified, so you'll be able to enjoy it on your handheld PC as well.</p>

<p>A new Dark Rot mode, which makes its return from the first game, will also be added to the sequel. Every time you fail, the Dark Rot will advance, and when it reaches Senua's head, you'll fail your run and all of your progress will be lost.</p>




<p>If you pick up the Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II</em>&nbsp;on PS5, you'll also get a version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>enhanced for the PS5, so if you haven't played that game yet, now's your chance.</p>

<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>. It once again follows Senua, who's on a quest to rescue her countrymen from the Northmen.</p>

<p>You can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> on August 12th.</p>

Now, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S owners are getting their chance to play I Am Your Beast.</p><p>On June 25, I Am Your Beast will officially go live on PSN and Xbox Live. In the game’s story, Harding has left his life of espionage and action behind him, even when his former employers at the Covert Operations Initiative try to entice him back for one final mission. When Harding turns down COI, it responds by sending countless agents to put him in an early grave. As you might expect, Harding takes that personally, and he's the wrong guy to mess with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mWOwtXZW8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/58mWOwtXZW8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The newly released ports include I Am Your Beast's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-years-best-games-just-added-nine-more-levels-for-free/1100-6527982/" data-ref-id="1100-6527982">free expansion</a>, which was released last November. Nine new levels were added to the game, as well as an epilogue that gave players even more ridiculously over-the-top action. The epilogue is taken from the accounts of the few COI agents who managed to survive Harding's wrath, and in their retelling he has superhuman abilities that break the laws of reason and physics.</p><p>I Am Your Beast was ported to iOS earlier this year without the added features that were included in the expansion. However, the mobile version of the game is also receiving a major update that will make it "feature-complete" with all of the material included with its PC and console ports. But on any platform, it's one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">the best shooters to play in 2025</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft releases its own first-party Xbox games on Game Pass at launch, but Sony does not do this--and it's not planning to change that strategy going forward.</p><p>PlayStation services executive Nick Maguire told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playstation-plus-15th-anniversary-interview-ghost-of-tsushima" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> that Sony has "stayed true to our strategy across the board," and that means no day-one new releases on PS Plus. "We're not looking to put games in day and date," Maguire said.</p><p>Back in 2022, PlayStation boss Jim Ryan--who has since left the company--said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">"virtuous cycle"</a> of Sony's business plans for gaming would be "broken" if Sony launched its new games into PS Plus.</p><p>"The level of investment that we need to make in our studios would not be possible, and we think the knock-on effect on the quality of the games that we make would not be something that gamers want."</p><p>The cycle, as Ryan described it is that, "the investment delivers success, which enables yet more investment, which delivers yet more success."</p><p>However, Ryan also acknowledged at the time that Sony wasn't married to this idea and would be open to changing its stance based on market conditions. In the three years since Ryan said this, however, Sony has not changed its stance, and the new comments from Maguire make it sound like it's not changing soon.</p><p>Also in the Game File interview, Maguire was asked if Sony's ill-fated live-service shooter Concord may have fared better had it been released on PS Plus at launch. Maguire declined to comment on that game specifically, but he said PS Plus has "proven itself to be a great way to introduce new players to franchises."</p><p>Maguire said the calculus comes down to finding the "right time" for a game to enter PS Plus to help it reach a wider audience after its initial debut. This could help a game "find new fans" or reach "new parts of our platform that it hasn't already reached," he said.</p><p>While Sony doesn't plan to launch its own games into PS Plus day-and-date, the company is partnering with third-party studios to debut new titles into the subscription service. FBC: Firebreak was a recent example of this. Going forward, Maguire said Sony aims to find four or five games each year to launch into PS Plus day-and-date, with Sony's own games coming to the service after a year, 18 months, or longer.</p><p>"That balance for us is working really well across the platform," Maguire said, adding that the four-to-five day-one third-party games each year is not a strict number but a ballpark estimate.</p>

<figure><a title="level 5 AI" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb882ca401494/level-5-ai.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been seeing the AI-related opinions a video game creator bandied about a bit already over the past few days, with Smash Bros' director Masahiro Sakurai being ever-so-slightly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/smash-bros-director-sakurai-laments-unsustainable-aaa-game-dev-discusses-ai-and-uncertainty">mistranslated in his thoughts</a> over the use of the new tech in artistic endeavours.</p>
<p>Now Level-5's CEO, Akihiro Hino, has been put in a bit of a similar situation, it seems. According to some reports that have popped up online in the past day or two, Hino had said that "Right now, around 80~90% of games are made by AI" when asked about the technology during an interview.</p><p><figure data-videoid="vhRubWa3khQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRubWa3khQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed598179xrtvlg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRubWa3khQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>However, and as explained thoroughly by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lsgcnhens22r">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> in a social media post, Hino's statement was taken right out of context for the sake of drama.</p>

<p>Indeed, reading through Nintendo Patents Watch's translation, it sounds like Hino isn't particularly keen on AI as a creative tool at all, whilst acknowledging its uses. As the translation of Hino's words put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...creativity cannot be completely handed over to AI, it is more of a tool for communication and efficiency improvement. For example, some planners who don't know how to draw can use AI to generate sketches to help express ideas and facilitate communication with artists."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key here is that AI is more of an assistant, something which helps rather than actually <em>does</em>. He backs this further in the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But the very content generated by AI will not be directly used in the game...AI can help us handle certain things more efficiently … but to complete the enormous game volume it requires the creatives to produce and direct the final content output."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hino also addresses fans who complained about game delays, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>, despite the studio reportedly using AI. However, that's "not the case". And given the size of that game, well, it's not surprising it took so long to come out. And it's fantastic.</p>
<p>So, that actually sounds fairly reasonable, or as reasonable as one can be when seeking to hold AI up in a positive light, we guess. Much as was the case with Sakurai, this is just another situation where cherry-picked quotes have been taken out of context.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>’s next Enhanced boss is Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow, developers From Software have confirmed. You’ll be able to get your teeth into him from June 26th at 4pm Central European Summer Time, 7am Pacific Daylight Time, or 11pm Japan Standard Time.</p>
<p>These timezone distinctions are meaningless, of course, because there is only one timezone in which Fulghor operates, and that timezone is Butt Kicking Time. He’s one of the co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s harder scraps, and he’ll be all the worse for being Enhanced.</p><!--more-->
<p>From and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-enhanced-boss-has-arrived-kicking-off-weekly-big-baddie-visits">released the first Enhanced Nightreign boss</a> - aka, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereigns">Everdark Sovereign</a> – earlier this month. They got the ball rolling with a hulked-up version of Gaping Jaw, who is an absolute pushover next to Fulghor - third easiest in the game, according to our recommended <a elden-ring-nightreign-main-boss-order"="" href"https:="" www.rockpapershotgun.com="">Elden Ring Nightreign boss play order</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll need to defeat the base edition of each boss before you can take a pop at the Everdark variety. Beat an Everdark Sovereign before they're taken out of rotation, and you’ll earn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sigil">Sigil</a> tokens to spend on special relics. Whether this is worth the terrible tingling sensation of repeated defeat is a question only you, a Gamer, can answer. </p>
<p>Fulghor, then. According to our intrepid guides wrangler John Schutt, you’re best off duelling him with a lightning weapon and some kind of status effect capacity. You’ll want to keep a dispersed formation because Fulghor’s swings cover a lot of ground. But you’ll also want to be close enough to stagger him when he threatens to do his spear-slamming routine. Read more in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-beat-fulghor">Elden Ring: Nightreign - how to beat Fulghor guide</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how the New &amp; Improved Fulghor differs, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-new-enhanced-boss-fights-have-leaked-early-thanks-to-nosy-modders">past reporting</a> has pointed to a third combat phase. “Third time’s the charm,” I hoot and holler to myself, as I am impaled from below by golden spears. Who's next for Everdarkening? Sentient Pest, apparently. Ah, that's not so bad.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-latest-elden-ring-nightreign-enhanced-boss-is-plenty-tough-enough-without-the-everdark-treatment]]></content:encoded>
