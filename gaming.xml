<p>ARC Raiders isn’t safe from cheaters or hackers, and most games aren’t. There’s a chance you could have some of your inventory stolen or taken through nefarious or illegal means at any point. If this happens, Embark Studios has your back with lost items in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Finding and losing items is part of the extraction shooter formula. You win some, you lose some—that’s how it goes. But there’s an ick when you lose hard-earned goods to cheaters. It can happen, and people are more than happy to extort your efforts for their own gain. </p>



<p>However, if it does happen in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, you should automatically get your stuff back.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The chicken, well, Embark, has spoken. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Radar</a> (via u/Jfourmes), if you’re targeted by a hacker, your items will be returned.</p>



<p>“Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you! They’re now available for you to claim and take with you on your next journey Topside. We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages. Thank you for being part of this mission! Together, we’re building ARC Raiders into a fair and fun experience for everyone,” says the official in-game message.</p>



<p>We did some digging into the original <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> post, and it seems the original user didn’t report the cheater or submit a report; it was an automatic message from the devs informing them of what had happened.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear what constitutes “unfair play.” Still, we imagine anything pertaining to cheating, hacking, or items being stolen that shouldn’t ordinarily be allowed to be taken falls under this umbrella.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you encountered any hackers or cheaters in ARC Raiders so far? Let us know if you’ve experienced this message pop-up, and what happened for more details. You can let everyone know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekicks-customization-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sidekicks are finally coming to Fortnite after months of speculation, giving players pets to accompany them across all game modes, but there are some specific customization choices that are permanent.</p>



<p>The first Sidekick is coming in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Battle Pass</a>, with additional Sidekicks being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to the Item Shop from November 7</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekick-leak-shows-prices-will-be-the-same-as-collab-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked prices indicate they will cost around the same as a Collab Skin</a>.</p>



<p>With a high price and restrictions to some customizations, Sidekicks have caused a stir in the community, and we have all the details on the customization rules.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-permanent">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Permanent?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Each Fortnite Sidekick has a one-time customization changes to their appearance that are applied before you can equip the item.</strong></p>



<p>These are the major customization choices with each Sidekick, impacting the base colours, any color accents, or major features, like the style of ears, body size, and similar. The final permanent choice is the name for a Sidekick.</p>



<p>Once locked in, these choices are permanent and cannot be adjusted. However, you can purchase the same Sidekick again and make a fresh style, though this, of course, incurs the cost of splashing out on the same item.</p>



<p>This is a big difference to The Mandalorian Warrior outfit, for example, which allows for constant cosmetic changes and the ability to save different appearances in your loadout. </p>



<p>Understandably, there has been some backlash to the permanence of some of the big customization choices for Sidekicks, and it remains to be seen whether Epic Games change their approach, or add a purchaseable item that allows you to edit a Sidekick again. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-repeatable">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Repeatable?</h2>



<p><strong>Not all customization choices for your Sidekick in Fortnite are permanent, with additional accessories and some cosmetics being freely available to change.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer for Fortnite Sidekicks</a>, a screen showing editable Styles offers a tease of what will be freely interchangeable with Sidekicks, with the example being clothing for a dog. In the video, two styles are shown, each with a different color and look.</p>



<p>Based on this, it’s expected that style choices for accessories like clothing, collars, and similar attire will all be able to be changed as many times as you want. What isn’t clear, however, is how you will gain access to these items, and whether there will be a deep supply of them.</p>



<p>As the amount of Sidekicks in Fortnite grows though, expect more customization options for attire to be added.</p>

		<p>It’s pinch, punch, first of the month time, and since it’s November, I hope you managed to survive last night with only treats and no tricks. Thankfully my supply of sweets was just enough to survive the glut of kids of all ages knocking on our door, so I didn’t have to break into my <em>actual</em> stash of sweets to appease the last kids in the final crowd that knocked.</p>
<p>But now that we’re free from this terror, what’s on the agenda for this weekend? Perhaps some ARC Raiders? Maybe avoiding the Battlefield battle royale? Perhaps some Football Managering?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite fanatics with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership had the blow of price increases to the service softened with the announcement Fortnite Crew was being added as a perk, and we’ve got all the details of when that comes into effect.</p>



<p>Price rises for Xbox Game Pass subscriptions caused a stir last month, rising <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as much as 50% in some cases</a>, though it was also announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Crew would be included</a> in some memberships.</p>



<p>The wait for that perk to come into effect continues, however, and if you’re wondering exactly when Fortnite Crew is added to a subscription, particularly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons-themed Battle Pass</a> landing, we can tell you the exact release date for the bonus perk.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-fortnite-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">When Is Fortnite Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New bonus. Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew will be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate memberships from November 18, 2025, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Announced as part of the pricing structure changes to the Game Pass service in October, Fortnite Crew is being added as an additional perk for subscribers to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>



<p>The inclusion was not immediate, however, and players are still waiting for this bonus to be unlocked—but it’s on the horizon, with the perk adding to memberships from November 18, as stated by an <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/billing-and-payment-c-202300000001723/fortnite-crew-availability-with-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-a202300000020476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games blog post</a>.</p>



<p>No additional cost will be added to the monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription price, though the previously announced price rises are in effect, but the bonus will soften the blow for Fortnite players.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-fortnite-crew">What’s Included in Fortnite Crew?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew membership includes full access to all the Battle Passes added in Fortnite across all modes, with a total of four passes in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The main Battle Pass, OG Battle Pass, Festival Pass, and LEGO Pass are all included in the membership, along with the Rocket Pass Premium in Rocket League.</p>



<p>Additional bonuses include 1,000 V-Bucks every month, available to spend on cosmetics in the Item Shop, and an exclusive monthly Crew Pack that provides a new Outfit alongside a matching accessory—a Glider, Pickaxe, or Emote.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 in Fortnite is rapidly approaching a conclusion but, before the big jump into Chapter 7, a mini-season themed around The Simpsons is taking center stage, with a new Battle Pass to enjoy.</p>



<p>Kicking off with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event on November 1</a>, The Simpsons takeover of Fortnite will see a smaller map brought onto the scene, representing Springfield, with lobby sizes in battle royale reduced from 100 to 80 as a result.</p>



<p>There’s also the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduction of Sidekicks</a>, Fortnite’s new pets feature, and the Battle Pass is stacked full of Simpsons goodies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass">How Much is The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to enjoy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite costs 1,000 V-Bucks to unlock, though it’s also available as part of a Fortnite Crew subscription.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a cheaper price than usual Battle Passes in Fortnite, due to the shorter duration of the season and fewer rewards, but there’s still plenty to sink your teeth into. 1,000 V-Bucks are purchasable for a base price of $8.99, though you may be able to find cheaper codes and better value for money if you purchase a larger amount.</p>



<p>Remember, Fortnite Crew will also be included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription starting from November 18, so don’t splash out twice if you have a membership!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass">All Rewards in The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass</h2>



<p><strong>There are seven pages of rewards in The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite, not including the bonus rewards that become available once the basic pass is completed.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, all of the bonus rewards are yet to be revealed, but we do know there will be an Evil Homer skin style available, alongside a Springfield Peely.</p>



<p>The full list of rewards in The Simpsons Battle Pass is shown in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass-worth-it">Is The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>For fans of The Simpsons, the Fortnite Battle Pass is certainly one of the best in a long while and highlights just how great Epic Games’ creativity is.</strong></p>



<p>With appearances of fan-favorite characters Ned Flanders, Marge Simpson, and Homer Simpson, alongside an abundance of fun easter eggs and references with Emotes, Pickaxes, and Back Blings, The Simpsons Battle Pass is worth every dollar.</p>



<p>On top of that, the Battle Pass includes a return of 900 V-Bucks, plus potentially more when the bonus rewards are revealed later this month, so you’ll pretty much get your money back in V-Bucks that can be spent on other Simpsons items in the shop.</p>

<p>A Rare Fortnite skin has returned to the Item Shop for the first time in half a decade, making its first appearance since 2020.</p>



<p>Fortnite has an abundance of skins players can use across all modes, and, with hundreds to choose from, some of those introduced take a long while to be brought back into the Item Shop.</p>



<p>These skins with limited appearances have been dubbed ‘rare’ by the community, with those owning them being able to flex on rival players—but the door has opened for players to finally get their hands on one of the rarest skins.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-returns-to-fortnite">Dante Returns To Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Returning. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1984395460040126887">ShiinaBR</a>, Dante returned to the Item Shop for the first time in five years on November, marking the first appearance of the skin since the same date five years ago.</p>



<p>Initially released on November 2, 2018, the Dante skin had featured just eight times in the Item Shop prior to its return today, with yearly reappearances in the Item Shop around Halloween.</p>



<p>That trend came to an end in 2020, however, with Dante not appearing for five consecutive years until the streak was broken with today’s appearance.</p>



<p>Priced at 1,500 V-Bucks, the Dante skin is available to pick up until November 4, and has the added bonus of being reactive and glowing in the dark.</p>



<p>Though the wait for Dante has been a lengthy one, it pales in comparison to some of the other rarest skins in Fortnite, with the likes of Reflex and Summit Striker not appearing in the shop for over 2,400 days.</p>

Well, either way, it's the weekend, so let's do a quick recap of the week before we dive into what we're playing, shall we?</p>
<p>Naturally, the biggest news of the week was the announcement from Nintendo that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> would be making a comeback, with both a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/everything-included-in-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-free-3-0-update">free update planned for all owners alongside a paid Switch 2 Edition</a> in the new year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> is also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-today-with-a-spooky-classic">now available on the Switch</a> via an NSO + Expansion Pack subscription, so hopefully a few of you have been playing this one for Halloween.</p>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">a bunch of announcements</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> revealed that a special Pro Controller will be launching alongside the game, with a Grace Ashcroft amiibo following in Summer 2026.

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer<br></h2>
<p>I recently picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, and it really is delightful. The performance issues on Switch 2 are definitely apparent, but it's really got its hooks in me. I find myself constantly tweaking little bits of my museum, taking "just one more" expedition to nab another fossil or skeleton for my collection, and simply sitting back to admire my handy work. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>I'd like to play some more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, but I'm tempted to put it aside for a little bit until the online issues are resolved.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have friends staying over this weekend, so I expect a fair amount of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and probably a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> — what can I say? I’m a sucker for a few holes of Golf!</p>
<p>All this does mean that the final Mission or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> will probably have to take a back seat for a couple of days. I’ll finish it soon, I promise!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'll be splitting my time between doing some review stuff and insulating my loft this weekend. Honestly, I wish I was joking. So, not much time for gaming, really, but I definitely will still be chilling with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> at some point, as I've got to get back to that before I forget the story.</p>
<p>Other than this, it'll be quick blasts of BALL x PIT (unbelievably addictive, be warned) and I'm afraid I've gone and bough the Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, so hopefully the online issues Ollie <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">pointed out in his review</a> will get sorted down the line. I'm still more than happy to have it portable, to be honest, as online isn't my preferred way to play the old fighting games. Too much stress, mate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The stands are filled with cheering, jeering fans. The bits of bone and blood have been cleared away from the pitch. The sun is high in the sky, and your team of rambunctious rabble rousers are ready to take the field. This is&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>, Games Workshop's tongue-in-cheek take on American Football. GW sent us the latest big box release for the game, which coincides with a new third season edition of the rules - so join us at the 50 yard line as we check out the new&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition</em>&nbsp;box set.</p>

<h2>What Is&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>?</h2>

<p><em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition</em>&nbsp;is the newest edition of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl,&nbsp;</em>a miniature game based loosely around the rules of American Football. In the game, you take on the role of the coach of a team, guiding them toward victory. Each coach brings a team of at least 11 players to the game, and you'll attempt to move a ball down the field and score against your opponent.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-midfield-action.jpg?itok=u6Q3fPhh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-midfield-action.jpg?itok=RR2Ezk13 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Teams can generally be divided into several different archetypes with different specialities. There's your bruiser-heavy team who wants to smash and grab your opponents, barreling their way down the field and sending as many of your opponent's players into the injury box (or the grave!) as possible. Then there are your more agility-focused teams, who want to move swiftly down the field, passing and catching and playing a proper game of American Football.</p>

<p>Finally, there are stunty teams, who use trickery and funny little hacks to get their way to victory. It's teams like this that usually let you chuck your teammate (with ball in hand) down the field - just like in American Football!</p>

<p>The game takes place over two halves, with each team getting eight turns per half. But here's the fun catch - if your active player drops the ball, goes out of bounds, or falls over - you end your turn with a turnover and have to hand the action over to your opponent. So even though sixteen turns per player&nbsp;<em>seems</em>&nbsp;like a lot, games usually move pretty swiftly once the action gets going.</p>

<h2>What's Different In&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition</em>?</h2>

<p>Fans of this classic tabletop sports game will be pleased to know that there haven't been many changes between the Second Season edition of the game and&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season</em>&nbsp;<em>Edition</em>. The core stats of players haven't changed, and the field remains its standard size.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-dice.jpg?itok=qeHCCo-4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-dice.jpg?itok=SO_DXInS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The biggest changes are all in the service of clarity. The rules have been rewritten to make it clear who's doing what, and who's being referred to in the text. Also new template markers have been created to make it clear who's been knocked down, and who's been stunned (normally, you'd have to lay your figure either face down for being Prone, or face up for being Stunned). It's an obvious and easy upgrade, and it makes a huge difference in the game.</p>

<p>This box is the first place to get the new rules, but they'll come out alongside two new Spike journals later on in the year. If you want to get into the action with the clearest rules possible, this is the way to go.</p>

<h2>How Does&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition&nbsp;</em>Play?</h2>

<p>The box set comes with two teams: the Brionne Barons, a wholly new army hailing from Bretonnia, and the Nehekhara Nightmares, a classic team who are reproduced in this box (with great plastic sprues) with very little in the way of updates or changes. Even with this combination of a brand new team and a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;old team, the game is wonderfully approachable for newcomers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-team-lineup.jpg?itok=OuedLeVK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-team-lineup.jpg?itok=KdIuDGuk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the box, each team has a quick-start cheat sheet, which really helps in tracking down their abilities and stats. In our test games, we found the match-ups incredibly balanced. The Brionne Barons are a very agile, fast team with great passing and catching abilities, but they're pretty easy to lay flat on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Nehekhara Nightmares are a sturdy team, who are slower (they are ancient undead shambling mummies, after all), but can really whollop your enemies. This balance between the two teams - with one being more proficient in the&nbsp;<em>game</em>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;while another team is better at the fight-y aspects of the game - perfectly represents the wonderful push and pull of the game.</p>

<p>The miniatures also look amazing, with very evocative poses for each team. That's what I love most of all about&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>. Unlike other Games Workshop properties,&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;has a truly outrageous, over-the-top sense of humor. There's a playfulness on display here that we don't always see in a GW game, and it perfectly fits the theme of an epic sporting brawl.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-table.jpg?itok=j37jDSHX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-third-season-edition-table.jpg?itok=-UuIAIau 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition&nbsp;</em>- Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While any&nbsp;Games Workshop release has its own barriers to entry -- you have to build the models, you have to learn from a fairly thick rulebook --&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl: Third Season Edition</em>&nbsp;is just about as approachable as you can hope for a wargaming product. It's high-flying fun, and this box set has everything you need to get into the action.</p>

<p>My only real quibble with the box set is the fact that the cheat sheets, while incredibly helpful, still have you flipping through the rulebook to find the exact description of all of your players' special abilities. This led to our first games featuring lots of forgotten special abilities, meaning we weren't getting the true full potential out of our teams. But after multiple play-throughs, we quickly picked up on everything our teams could do.</p>

<p>So if you're looking for a new tabletop wargame to get into, this is a great, fun, lighthearted entry into the genre. And if you're a returning player, the box set has the newest rules, all the tools and dice you could ever dream of, and two great new teams ready to rock.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) developer Rockstar Games has been mostly exempt from the rounds of layoffs that have rocked the industry throughout the last three years or so. This week, they have fired between 30 and 40 employees across offices in the United Kingdom and Canada, but not due to financial problems (which they do not have). <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB)</a>, this has been an act of 'union busting', as all the developers fired were attempting to unionize.</p>



<p>Alex Marshall, president of the IWGB, said in a statement: </p>



<p><em>Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</em></p>



<p><em>Despite this calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions, the Rockstar Union remains undeterred. They will keep organising for respect and better conditions whilst continuing to pour their blood, sweat and creativity into games that are loved by millions. The IWGB will pursue every legal claim possible to ensure our members are reinstated and receive interim relief.</em></p>



<p>Spring Mcparlin-Jones, Chair of the IWGB Game Workers Union, added: </p>



<p><em>Next year, GTA VI is expected to make upwards of $10 billion. That’s enough to end world hunger for a year. Such a flagrant attack on workers’ rights from such a valuable studio sends a very clear and shocking message to the world, that money matters more than people.</em></p>



<p>Alan Lewis, Head of Global Corporate Communications at Take-Two Interactive (the parent company of Rockstar Games), <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Bloomberg</a> that the employees were fired for 'gross misconduct', adding that Take-Two supports the GTA studio's approach in the matter.</p>



<p>Unionization has been increasingly common over the last three years in the industry, with studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-testers-from-blizzard-albany-win-the-right-to-unionize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Albany</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-says-raven-software-qa-union-will-be-recognized-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a>, Blizzard Irvine (the World of Warcraft team), <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Orange County</a> (the Overwatch 2 team), <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax</a> (as ZeniMax Workers United), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-zero-parades-studio-zaum-workers-alliance-union-uk-branch-iwgb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZA/UM</a> (which unionized recently and is represented by the IWGB) opting to unionize. </p>



<p>As a reminder, GTA VI is scheduled to be released on May 26, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X after slipping the original Fall 2025 launch window. Additional delays could still happen, though, as history tells us that Rockstar's previous game, Red Dead Redemption 2, was delayed from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2018 and then again to October 26, 2018, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it launched to unanimous critical acclaim</a>.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Major Munich will follow the well-established format typical for these types of tournaments.

<p>Here’s how the tournament schedule works:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Opening Stage: </strong>November 8 – 13 (no public access)</li>



<li><strong>Playoffs: </strong>November 14 – 16 (live audience)</li>



<li><strong>Grand Final: </strong>November 16</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re taking part in a little esports betting or want to watch the BLAST R6 Major Munich with some knowledge in your back pocket, here are the latest predictions for the tournament.</p>



<p><strong>FaZe Clan </strong>comes into the running in Munich with the tightest momentum and best esports betting odds. They’re the reigning Six Invitational champs with a clean roster that has had a decent year already.

<p>It was Team Secret that secured the trophy at the Esports World Cup, closely followed in second place by <strong>G2 Esports</strong>, the next top pick for winning it all in Munich. It would be a phenomenal thing for G2 Esports to win the Munich Major on home turf.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Review—The Most Refreshing Extraction Shooter Ever Made]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-review%E2%80%94the-most-refreshing-extraction-shooter-ever-made.1341034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has finally hit the market after years of development at Embark Studios. It comes from the creative minds that brought us The Finals and, once upon a time, games like Battlefield. It’s a retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic, extraction shooter epic that has been turning heads for months, and now it’s finally here, it’s <strong>screaming up the charts</strong>.</p>



<p>Being a fan of the extraction genre, I was all too eager to leap head over heels into ARC Raiders. I’d waited until the full release of the game to experience it, as I wanted the most polished version possible, and what I’ve been treated to is nothing short of sumptuous.</p>



<p>This is the most refreshing, entertaining extraction shooter I think we’ve ever had. Read on for my full ARC Raiders review.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-accessible-but-remains-challenging">ARC Raiders is Accessible but Remains Challenging</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a> is perhaps the most accessible game to land in the genre, which is typically tougher and less welcoming than almost every other genre out there (except perhaps Soulslike). It takes the extraction shooter concept and makes it more ‘arcadey’ and inviting, while retaining a solid sense of challenge that keeps the more talented players engaged.</p>



<p>That balance is flawless, in my eyes. I generally hate games that are challenging for the sake of it, but ARC Raiders manages to keep you entertained even <strong>while you’re losing</strong>, and there are mechanics built into the game to make sure you can keep playing even when you’re on your last buck.</p>



<p>Given that ARC Raiders is available on PlayStation, Xbox, <strong>and </strong>PC, it already has a step up on the competition, which is almost exclusively refined to PC platforms. For instance, Escape from Tarkov, arguably the spearhead of the extraction genre, has spent almost a decade confined to a proprietary launcher on PC, and is only just coming to Steam later this month.</p>



<p>If you choose to invest the $30 or so to secure a copy of ARC Raiders, you’ll be getting what might be one of the best introductions to the extraction shooter genre imaginable.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Team up, betray, or just gun down? The choice is yours in ARC Raiders</figcaption></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders takes players and throws them into a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by an invasion of robotic enemies called ARC. The human race has been driven underground into a settlement called Speranza, and ‘going topside’ is a risky and ambitious concept reserved only for foolhardy Raiders, scavengers who want to claim the riches still left above ground.</p>



<p>It’s a third-person action-based shooter with some light RPG and survival mechanics, large-ish environments to explore, and intense combat systems that make fighting both human enemies and AI-driven robots a satisfying romp.</p>



<p>I’ve said it’s effectively Fortnite crossed with Fallout, and fused with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>You’ve got the third-person perspective, rapid movement model, and elements like skin packs and emotes, combined with the post-apocalyptic, war-torn setting, and extraction-based gameplay loop.</p>



<p>What’s different about ARC Raiders is that it holds your hand quite nicely without being too forgiving. You can get free loadouts at any point if you’re down on your luck, you have a companion named Scrappy (he’s a chicken) who collects crafting items for you to use, and the early-game missions are tutorials that help you understand the core facets of the title.</p>



<p>I think the earliest quests had me fully understand every angle of the game, including trading, crafting, extraction, healing, and more, within an hour flat. You don’t get that in a game like Escape from Tarkov!</p>



<p>But with that being said, ARC Raiders can quickly ramp up the difficulty, depending on your circumstances. The ARC enemies are notoriously tough, and fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-boss-kill-58-times/">something like a <strong>Queen</strong></a><strong> </strong>is absolutely impossible without a dedicated effort by a well-armed team with a key strategy to follow.</p>



<p>As you could imagine, resources are scarce, the post-apocalyptic arsenal is reminiscent of Fallout’s ‘pipe weapon’ range, and there are no armor items to find and upgrade, just energy shields and the warm flesh of your Raider.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Don’t even hope to tackle an ARC Queen</figcaption></figure>







<p>Bungie stressed that Marathon, an upcoming extraction shooter that was plagued by bad press earlier this year, would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/">the first ‘social’ extraction shooter</a>. It was said it would hit the market with elements of accessibility and would promote teamwork and collaboration over mindless slaughter.</p>



<p>That’s what ARC Raiders is doing. In the raids that I’ve played, I’ve had more positive interactions than in any other extraction shooter or battle royale title. I’ve teamed up with other players, helped them into the extraction sites (elevators that take you back to Speranza), and even earned apologies from players before they brutally knocked me out and sent me to the abyss.</p>



<p>Even when I do get into a fight, I feel like it’s pretty balanced, even if the RPG-style skill-based pathways lend themselves to the whole ‘unemployed gamers are more powerful’ vibe. As you rank up your character, you unlock multiple benefits that might make a brand-new player feel a bit hard done by, but that’s the nature of the game, and you just need to deal with it.</p>



<p>If you grind, you’ll get there yourself at some point. There are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-arc-raiders-have-a-wipe/">no wipes in ARC Raiders</a>, except for the optional ‘Expedition Projects’ that crop up after you’ve hit level 20, so you can chug along at your own pace, have fun meeting people and enjoying the world around you, and not worry about losing all your progress once every six months.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-i-wanted">Everything I Wanted</h2>



<figure><figcaption>ARC Raiders’ maps encourage multiple playstyles, which is superb</figcaption></figure>







<p>I was holding fire on ARC Raiders for the longest time, but I need to admit that it’s everything I’m looking for in an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>There are plenty of places to loot and explore, the resource pool is diverse, and the core concept of the game is intriguing and engaging. I’m a huge fan of the combat, which invites you to try out a range of fighting styles and approaches, and I love how accessible the game is, catering perfectly for casual players just as much as die-hard veterans of the genre.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has done a phenomenal job with ARC Raiders. It looks brilliant on-screen, runs quite nicely, and has a diverse collection of maps, enemies to fight, and quests to complete. There are 63 quests to contend with right now, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/">ARC Raiders roadmap</a> for the path ahead has been revealed, and plenty more content is coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release</a> on November 15 and the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> on November 14 might disrupt ARC Raider somewhat, but I’m confident that this shooter has plenty of meat on the bones and fuel in the tank, more than enough to retain a core community that will keep the game up on their shoulders.</p>



<p>If there is <strong>one thing </strong>I would ask for, it’s a PvE mode that takes out the extra challenge of PvP battles. I’d be perfectly happy playing only with friends or running solo in a world populated by ARC, but I imagine that’s already set for development…</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – Great</h2>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-actor-gta-6-100-price-tag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-actor-thinks-grand-theft-auto-6-%E2%80%98warrants%E2%80%99-a-100-price-tag.1341028/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is mere months away from hitting the market (we hope), and fans are still busy theorizing over how much the game will cost. The price is yet to be set, and many feel that it could be the first standard game to hit the market with a $100 price tag.</p>



<p>The nature of that price tag has been widely debated by many, including the folks here at Insider Gaming. It’s believed that if any game can carry that price tag, it’s Grand Theft Auto 6. That’s a sentiment that was shared by a Grand Theft Auto actor during a recent interview with The Escapist.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-grand-theft-auto-6-cost-100">Should Grand Theft Auto 6 Cost $100?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Escapist</a>, Jay Klaitz, the actor behind the notorious Lester Crest in Grand Theft Auto 5, sat down to talk about all things GTA. He touched on his experiences acting the character and performing alongside the trio of leads in the game that debuted a whopping 12 years ago.</p>



<p>Talk naturally turned to Grand Theft Auto 6 and Klaitz’s expectations of the game, including the long-rumored price point.</p>



<p>He’s in the camp suggesting that, owing to the investment poured into creating a Grand Theft Auto game, it’s more than worth a $100 label.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah dude. I mean, GTA V was so heavy on the mocap. I assume that GTA VI will be the same way, and these games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It’s not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter.</p>



<p>This shit takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You’re almost buying multiple games when you buy the one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That’s cool too. Maybe there’s like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Klaitz was talking about the post-launch window of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set to drop in May 2026. He addressed hopes that Rockstar Games would ‘bring back old Lester’ in some kind of expansion that revisits the character.</p>



<p>It would work, given how we see heist footage in the newest GTA 6 trailers, and that fits nicely into Lester Crest’s wheelhouse.</p>



<p>Do you think Klaitz is right and that Grand Theft Auto 6 should cost $100? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-1-874/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-874-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-november-1.1341019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s November! That came around <strong>very fast</strong> this year, didn’t it? Halloween is now over and done with, and we can start looking to the festive season, and after that… 2026! Today, though, we’re looking a little smaller on the scale of time and considering today’s NYT Connections hints and answers.</p>



<p>I’ve got the best solutions you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle and get on with your day. Read on to get all the hints you need to smash today’s challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #874:</p>



<ul>
<li>RAVEN</li>



<li>PINKY</li>



<li>CHIP</li>



<li>JET</li>



<li>INKY</li>



<li>ROCKY</li>



<li>FILE</li>



<li>CLYDE</li>



<li>HARDY</li>



<li>SUE</li>



<li>TELLER</li>



<li>CHARGE</li>



<li>INDICT</li>



<li>ITCHY</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>CHER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all legal actions that initiate or escalate a case.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words is commonly used to describe a deep, rich black color — poetic and evocative.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>A fun twist — these are the “second” names in iconic duos.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>All animated rodents who take top billing in their respective pairs.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 1.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-1-874">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 1 (#874)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHARGE, FILE, INDICT, SUE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – INKY, JET, PITCH, RAVEN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHER, CLYDE, HARDY, TELLER</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CHIP, ITCHY, PINKY, ROCKY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

This is without question the most hooked I’ve found myself on an extraction shooter (and I’ve played a lot of them), with clean and tense gunplay, a progression system that’s been incredibly satisfying so far, and a loot game that has me sweating over what to put in my backpack and what to leave behind. I’ve still got loads more to do and see before I can draw any final conclusions, but what I <em>have </em>played has made an incredibly good first impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders follows the usual extraction shooter formula of dropping you into a zone to take down NPC enemies and scramble for loot, all while looking over your shoulder for rival crews who would love nothing more than to crack you open like a meat pinata and take everything you’ve collected. From what I’ve seen so far, ARC Raiders hasn’t done much to iterate on those fundamentals, but it does absolutely nail them, and that’s harder to do than it might sound – for example, a big budget attempt like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review">Battlefield 2042</a>’s Hazard Zone mostly fell flat, and the alpha for Bungie's Marathon landed with such a thud <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall">it was delayed indefinitely</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the main ways it succeeds is in its stressful gunplay, where weapons only have a few rounds in each magazine, take a good deal of time to reload, and the robotic NPCs are either much faster than you or can rain down missiles to take you out in a single blast. This means I’m usually feeling like a rodent sneaking around to scavenge food and supplies from the world before slinking back to base – but when combat does break out, it’s charged with delightful anxiety thanks to the high-risk, high-reward situation of knowing you’re either about to lose everything you’ve fought for or grab some awesome gear off the corpses of those you’ve bested. This includes both AI-controlled and human players, as both can be found and fought out in the world, though it’s best to avoid either of them unless you know you’ve brought the gear and skills required for a fight. That’s because firing a shot has a good chance of drawing all robot enemies and loot-hungry players to your position, taking advantage of your vulnerability to do as much damage as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All four of the maps I’ve seen so far have very cool and distinct vibes to them, from the ruined husk of a waterlogged dam to a city buried in red sand. It’s a good thing that they’re so great to look at, too, because you’ll spend a whole lot of time trekking back and forth across them in search of loot. I still feel like I haven’t seen most of the nooks and crannies of these areas, despite having played on them for dozens of matches already, but they are starting to feel a little familiar to me. Here’s hoping they’ve still got secrets to uncover that expand the amount of time I’m willing to spend on each.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Extraction Shooters</h3><p>For those who like risking it all on loot that's well worth it, these are your best bets.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As I work toward exploring every last zone, one thing I’m still looking for is an enemy combatant I haven’t faced yet (aside from the massive tanks, which I’m just steering clear of at this early stage). Most of my NPC combat encounters have been against the small roly poly bots and flying drones that are fairly easy to destroy, with my fellow players being the only proper challenge so far. I’m looking forward to the point where I’m powerful enough to actually engage with some of the chonkier enemies more seriously, but it still would have been nice to have a wider variety of low level AI combatants to shake up the early game a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, even as maps and enemies have begun to feel familiar, that hasn’t dampened my desire to play just because of how good the loot and progressions systems are. Every run, win or lose, has me excited to return to the cozy sanctuary of Speranza, where I can chat with vendors, turn in and accept new quests, upgrade my facilities that allow me to craft items and gain access to new upgrades, customize my character’s appearance, and spend skill points that make me slightly better at things like keeping quiet while rifling through loot during matches. There’s so much to do and unlock that I truly feel I’ve only scratched the surface in this regard, and that’s kept me glued to my controller and eager to dive into new matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, there’s still lots to do and robots to slay, so I’ll be headed back out to the wastes for more just as soon as I’m finished typing. You can expect a full, scored review early next week!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review]]></content:encoded>

              <p>And just like that, it’s already time to start shopping around for the holiday season. Finding the right gifts for all your friends, family, and loved ones can be quite stress inducing. Sure, we like to get unique gifts catered to the recipient, but also a good gift that works across the board for everyone can be equally appreciated and save you a lot of time and effort. Just about everyone under the sun could find a good use for a portable power station. Amazon happens to hat this one from Anker on sale for a solid $70 off. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">Anker power bank is typically sold for $150, but for a limited time, Amazon has it down by nearly 50%</a>: The price has dropped to just $79.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Emergency or Entertainment</h2>
<p>The Anker power bank is able to hold a massive capacity of 60,000mAh (or 192Wh). This much power will allow you to charge multiple devices from zero to 10%, multiple times over. It’s a great gadget to bring along for extended trips outdoors, whether its a day trip excursion or full weekend of camping. Likewise, it’s an excellent tool to have on had in an emergency situation like during a blackout or if your car has broken down on the side of the road. It’s good to be able to keep a charge phone in such events.</p>
<p>Built durably to last, the Anker portable power station has a lifespan 10 times as long as comparative models. Even after a full year of not being used, it will still have retained at least 85% of it’s charge. This way, if you are keeping it on hand in your car or in your closet in the event of an emergency, it will work for you as expected when it comes time that it’s needed.</p>



<p>The power bank includes a smart display on the front which can communicate helpful information while powering or charging your devices. It can be set to show the power station’s battery life, input and output power, remaining charge time, charge modes, among other data.</p>
<p>Atop the power station is an LED light which can be set to two different brightness modes. The convenient strap allows it to be easy to pick up and transport.</p>
<p>Choose between either green or gray for the Anker power bank. Both color options are on sale right now for 47% off. That brings them down from $150 to just $80, saving you $70 for a limited time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98gta-6-workers%E2%80%99-fired-to-prevent-union-forming-it%E2%80%99s-alleged.1340902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new report, it has been claimed that ‘dozens of’ Rockstar Games employees have been fired for misconduct in a wave that might have been a twisted form of union busting. </p>



<p>The report originally published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier claims that between 30 and 40 Rockstar Games employees in the UK and Canada were terminated, and they were allegedly <strong>all </strong>part of a ‘private trade union chat’ on Discord.</p>



<h2 id="h-blatant-and-ruthless-layoffs-at-rockstar-games">‘Blatant and Ruthless’ Layoffs at Rockstar Games</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games is preparing to launch Grand Theft Auto 6 in just a few months, all being well. The studio has been piecing together the open-world crime epic for years, and fans are eagerly awaiting the delivery of what will arguably be the largest game launch in history.</p>



<p>But the most recent bit of news involving Rockstar Games isn’t all that positive.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> recently reported that Rockstar Games laid off 30 to 40 employees, labelling their dismissal terms as ‘misconduct’. However, a spokesperson of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claimed that it’s an attempt at preventing unionization amongst the team members:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Take-Two refuted the claims, suggesting that all the firings took place because of ‘gross misconduct,’ but all the employees were dismissed at the same time, per reports, and all of them were found to be in a private chat on Discord related to unionization.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games has mostly avoided the waves of layoffs that have hit the industry over the last couple of years. Take-Two, the company’s parent firm, hasn’t fared as well. In April 2024, the gaming titan laid off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/">around 5% of all employees</a> in a bid to streamline the business.</p>



<p>Do you think these alleged dismissals sound unlawful? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a></p>

According to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), all of the employees fired were part of a private trade union Discord chat and were either already union members or attempting to organize a union at Rockstar.</p><p>“Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in a statement provided to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Alan Lewis, head of global corporate communications at Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive, responded, telling <em>The Verge</em> the firings were “for gross misconduct, and for no other reason,” without elaborating further.</p><p>The firings were spread out across Rockstar offices in the UK and Canada. They come just seven months ahead of the release of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI. </em>The game’s launch was originally scheduled for this fall, but a few months ago, Rockstar <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">delayed its release</a> until May 26th, 2026, saying, “We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”</p><p>Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) president Alex Marshall:</p><div><blockquote><p>“Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</p><p>Despite this calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions, the Rockstar Union remains undeterred. They will keep organising for respect and better conditions whilst continuing to pour their blood, sweat and creativity into games that are loved by millions.</p><p>The IWGB will pursue every legal claim possible to ensure our members are reinstated and receive interim relief.”</p></blockquote></div><p>Alan Lewis, head of global corporate communications at Take-Two Interactive:</p><div><blockquote><p>“We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities.

The studio fired between 30 and 40 staff members from offices in the United Kingdom and Canada earlier this week. The terminated employees were reportedly attempting to unionize when they were let go.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> broke the story, and added that all of the fired employees were part of a private trade union chat group on Discord. According to a spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain, the group was a mix of members who had already joined the union and others who were trying to organize a union at Rockstar.</p><p>"Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry," said IWGB president Alex Marshall in a statement. "This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry."</p><p>A spokesperson from Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said that it supported Rockstar's decision and alleged that the employees were terminated "for gross misconduct, and for no other reason."</p><p>This seems like the kind of dispute that may ultimately be settled inside of a courtroom, depending on what the British and Canadian courts have to say about it. This may take a long time for this to play out.</p><p>Rockstar Games recently shared a job listing which predicted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-to-have-largest-game-launch-in-history-rockstar-says/1100-6534732/" data-ref-id="1100-6534732">GTA 6 will have the biggest launch</a> in video game history. That seems very likely considering that Grand Theft Auto 5 passed 215 million in sales earlier this year, and GTA Online continues to be a cash cow for the company.</p><p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/" data-ref-id="1100-6533875">he isn't worried about AI competing with GTA</a>, and he's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-says-ai-is-great-but-people-are-overstating-what-it-can-do/1100-6535679/" data-ref-id="1100-6535679">pretty consistent in his assessment of the technology</a>. </p><p>GTA 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-20tb-hdd-priced-like-peanuts-amazon-bottoms-out-at-0-01-per-gb-2000639129</link>

              <p>Between 4K videos, raw photo files, game libraries, and endless work documents, running out of storage space feels like a monthly crisis. The Seagate expansion 20TB external hard drive solves this problem in one massive swoop, and right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">has slashed the price from $499 down to just $229 for both Prime and non-Prime members</a>. This early Black Friday deal <strong>beats even Seagate’s own website pricing</strong>, and here’s the kicker: you’re paying the same price you’d normally fork over for a 10TB drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Meets Desktop Convenience</h2>
<p>This is not a portable drive you will slip into your pocket: The <strong>Seagate 20TB device is a desktop unit that requires its own power supply</strong>&nbsp;which gives it the muscle to deliver consistent performance for your bulkiest files. Inside the black enclosure lives a 7200 RPM Seagate <em>BarraCuda</em> drive with a 512MB cache, pushing <strong>read speeds around 246-257 MB/s and write speeds of 239-256 MB/s</strong> according to real-world testing. These numbers mean you can transfer a 50GB game in about three to four minutes, or back up your entire photo library from the past decade without aging five years in the process.</p>
<p>The <strong>drive connects via USB 3.0 using a micro-USB port</strong> and it comes pre-formatted in exFAT so both Windows and Mac machines recognize it immediately. Just plug in the included 18-inch USB cable and 18W power adapter, and you’re ready to drag and drop files without installing a single piece of software. Mac users who want to use Time Machine will need to reformat the drive, but that’s a quick one-time setup.</p>



<p>It also includes Seagate’s <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em>&nbsp;which means if the worst happens, <strong>you’ll have access to pro data recovery</strong>. The service covers everything from accidental deletion to physical damage; you’d need to check the fine print for limitations. You also get international power adapter plugs, which are a nice touch if you travel or switch countries. There’s a <strong>one-year limited warranty on the hardware</strong> while most external drives tend to run hot during operation, this one reportedly stays at around 55°C, which is warm but not concerning.</p>
<p>The real story here is value: While the prices of external drives have dropped, this deal presses the cost per terabyte down into territory usually reserved for smaller capacity drives. It’s large-capacity drives make sense for media professionals, gamers with massive libraries, or anyone needing to archive years of files without having cloud subscription fees eat into their budget month after month</p>
<p>This drive won’t supplant a speedy NVMe SSD for active work, but for long-term storage, or consolidating scattered files across multiple older drives, it delivers exactly what most people need.&nbsp; You’re getting a 20TB drives in one unit for $229, which means you’re paying $0.01 per GB. And this is a record low.</p>

                <p>Today is Halloween, and what better way to celebrate than with a handful of spooky games. Humble Bundle is offering 13 games for $13 ($114 value) with their <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+13+PC+Games+For+%2413+With+the+Indie+Fears+Humble+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+10%3A54%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+15%3A33%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6535858&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Findie-fears-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-13-pc-games-for-13-with-the-indie-fears-humble-bundle%2F1100-6535858%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Indie Fears Bundle</a>. $13 gets you all the games on offer, but as always with Humble Bundle you can choose to pay more. If you do, portions of the proceeds get donated to charity. The Indie Fears Bundle benefits SpecialEffect, a UK-based charity whose goal is bringing video games to all disabled gamers around the world. This bundle is available until November 21, so you have plenty of time to pick it up.</p><p>One of the most notable inclusions here is Mouthwashing, which took the indie horror game community by storm when it came out last year. It sports a retro PS1-era graphical style and sees you play as a crew member of the space freighter <em>Tulpar,</em> delving into its mysterious crash landing by exploring the ship, chatting with your crewmates, and solving puzzles. It's more of a narrative-focused walking sim than a survival horror game with combat, but it's still a tense, scary game perfect for the season.</p><p>Then there's Arctic Eggs, which also features a purposefully downgraded graphical style (countless indie horror games do this, and I love it). In it, as the name implies, your goal is to fry eggs and cook breakfast for folks in a near-future dystopian Antarctica. The frying mechanics aren't the easiest to master, and you'll often have to fry weird items like bullets and cigarettes for the denizens. It's a relatively short game, but the story and setting and just weird and interesting enough to stay engaged.</p><p>Also available is Terror at Oakheart, a love-letter to 80's and 90's slasher films complete with a rip-off of the nursery rhyme from A Nightmare On Elm Street in the trailer. This is a 2D sidescrolling game with a visual style that would feel right at home on the Game Boy Advance. It's an action-adventure game with a nonlinear story that sees you taking control of both the killer and the victims, a unique take on the genre.</p><h2>Indie Fears Game Bundle</h2><ul><li>Adios</li><li>Arctic Eggs</li><li>The Boba Tea Shop</li><li>Buckshot Roulette</li><li>Daemonologie</li><li>Kiosk</li><li>Massacre at the Mirage</li><li>Mouthwashing</li><li>NO-SKIN</li><li>Order 13</li><li>Terror at Oakheart</li><li>THRESHOLD</li><li>Who's Lila?</li></ul><hr><p>Several other <span data-embed-type="buylink" data-size="buylink__embed" data-collection="%7B%22text%22:%22bundle%20deals%20are%20available%20at%20Humble%22,%22monetizedUrl%22:%22%22,%22rawUrl%22:%22https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/1804712/2059850/25796?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.humblebundle.com/bundles%22%7D">           <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+13+PC+Games+For+%2413+With+the+Indie+Fears+Humble+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+10%3A54%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+15%3A33%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6535858&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbundles&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-13-pc-games-for-13-with-the-indie-fears-humble-bundle%2F1100-6535858%2F&amp;event_type=click" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+13+PC+Games+For+%2413+With+the+Indie+Fears+Humble+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+10%3A54%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+15%3A33%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6535858&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbundles&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-13-pc-games-for-13-with-the-indie-fears-humble-bundle%2F1100-6535858%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;buylink|embedded-link&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;buylink|embedded-link&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+13+PC+Games+For+%2413+With+the+Indie+Fears+Humble+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+10%3A54%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+15%3A33%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6535858&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbundles&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-13-pc-games-for-13-with-the-indie-fears-humble-bundle%2F1100-6535858%2F&amp;event_type=click">bundle deals are available at Humble</a> </span> right now, including a few more with horror, mystery, and dystopian games.
