		<p>With a little less than a month to go to its previously announced date, Techland has announced that they are delaying the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> to 19th September 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/dying-light-the-beast-will-be-unleashed-with-an-august-release-date/">Previously expected for 22nd August</a>, the extra month will allow for extra polish.</p>


<p>In<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/516342322187731208"> the statement</a>, Techland writes:</p>
<p><em>It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve been carefully listening to what you’ve been saying – whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve based on player feedback include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.</em></p>

<p><em>We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand. Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we’ve learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is.</em></p>
<p>The team promises regular updates through the now 8 weeks before launch, and a playable demo of the game will be available at Gamescom in Hall 6, so you can check out Kyle Crane’s return if you’re heading to the show.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a standalone game that grew out of the second planned DLC for Dying Light 2. Because of that, it will be available separately, of course, but is also still being released at no extra cost&nbsp;for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition. Techland have a great reputation for long support and consumer-friendly moves, and this is just another example of that.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">previewed The Beast back at Gamescom</a> last year, Dom saying “Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.”</p>

			<p>Borderlands 4 has officially gone gold, and will launch next month as previously announced.</p>



<p>Today, Gearbox and publisher 2K confirmed the fourth entry in the series has gone gold, securing its September 12 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Although we have seen games getting delayed even after going gold, like in Cyberpunk 2077's case <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/">five years ago</a>, these are very rare cases, so there's little doubt at this point fans will be able to get their hands on the game in a little over a month.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Borderlands 4 is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2, but owners of the new generation system by Nintendo will have to wait until October 3 to play the game, as confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">earlier this week</a>. Considering the differences with the other current generation systems, it will be very interesting to see how the Nintendo Switch 2 will handle the game and if it will take advantage of any of its features like NVIDIA DLSS support and mouse controls, which would work extremely well for a game like this.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12. It will also hit Nintendo Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to launch on August 22, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-smashes-through-the-zombie-horde-in-august/1100-6532167/" data-ref-id="1100-6532167">Dying Light: The Beast is a new standalone adventure</a> that sees the return of Kyle Crane, the protagonist from the first game in the series. Hellbent on revenge after a decade of captivity and horrific genetic experimentation performed on him by a sinister figure known as the Baron, Crane eventually manages to break free from his prison.</p><p>Tracking the Baron to the once-bustling tourist destination of Castor Woods, Crane finds hordes of infected standing in his way. Fortunately, he has more than just parkour skills at his disposal, as the Baron's experiments have given him new rage-fueled powers that allow him to smash his way through zombies. When that's not enough, Crane can also rely on good ol' guns and melee weapons to even the odds.</p><p>"Dying Light: The Beast benefits from years of updates to Dying Light 2, while also pulling in elements from the first that Techland wanted to revisit." Mark Delaney wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-gave-me-a-car-and-a-gun-but-i-just-couldnt-stop-dropkicking-zombies/1100-6532282/" data-ref-id="1100-6532282">preview of the game</a>. "This mix of old and new feels like it's going to make the 20-hour game--40 to 60 for completionists--well worth it if you're already invested in the series.</p>

            <p>Troy Baker has had many video game roles over the years. He is Indiana Jones in The Great Circle, he is Sam Drake in the Uncharted series, he is Booker Dewitt in Bioshock, he is Higgs in Death Stranding… The list goes on (and on and on and on).</p>
<p>One of his most famous roles, though, is Joel in The Last of Us. Baker portrayed the cynical smuggler turned surrogate father in 2013's original release, before reprising his role in 2020's sequel. But, while Joel may have elevated Baker's career, the actor has admitted he was "woefully unprepared" for the part.</p>

<figcaption>A look at some of Troy Baker's roles over the years. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJd_fTSJ-EE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe0xVuIcxMw">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon New Orleans 2025</a>, Baker was asked if playing Joel had affected him personally, to which Baker jokingly quipped "you're trying to make me cry". He then elaborated on his role further, saying it had affected him "deeply" in many different ways.</p>
<p>"There's nothing worse, and I hope that no one ever feels this… [but] do you ever show up to something and go 'I am so woefully unprepared for this'? And, it's not imposter syndrome, it's a fact. You are not equipped to do the thing that you are about to do," Baker said. "You could be like, 'let's go bungie jumping!', and then you get on the platform and you go, 'I can't do this'. That was The Last of Us for me. You get the gig, and then you go, 'oh no, I have to deliver this'."</p>
<p>Baker recalled going through the script and pitch in the early days of The Last of Us with the development team and his co-star Ashley Johnson, who plays Ellie in the games. During a break, Baker turned to Johnson and said: "'Do you realise that if this thing sucks, it's our fault?'"</p>
<p>He noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> already had had great success with its Uncharted games, and the studio now knew the story it wanted to tell next. "We knew that what they were going to make was going to be good," Baker recalled, so now the pressure was on him and Johnson to deliver a worthy performance.</p>
<p>The Last of Us "taught me how to be a better actor", Baker continued. "It taught me how to stop trying to convince people that I could act, and just realise that Joel has no idea that he's in a game, and he's just in a moment in his life. And, I took that lesson, and I apply it all the way across."</p>

<p>Baker more recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, where he reprised his role of Higgs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-cars-3">Project Cars 3</a> will be delisted in August and the servers shutdown in early 2026. This brings an end to the Project Cars franchise, with the first two titles in the series having been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/24/project-cars-games-are-being-delisted-from-sale/">delisted in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement on the game’s Steam page, it was announced:</p>


<p><em>Update on PROJECT CARS 3. All product sales will end on: August 24th, 2025 23:59 UTC. Please note that times may vary by region. If you bought the game digitally it will remain in your library and can be redownloaded in the future. Any DLCs purchased before August 24th, 2025 23:59 UTC will still be available to use after this date. The game’s online modes will also remain active until February 24th, 2026.</em></p>
<p>While a reason for this was not given, the most likely situation is the one that affects almost all racing games, as licenses for cars, tracks and soundtracks expire. With reduced income from games several years after release, it rarely makes financial sense for companies to review the game-specific licensing deals that are cut with manufacturers and tracks.</p>
<p>The sad part of this is that it’s an end to what was a real bolt from the blue for the sim racing genre. Launching in 2015, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/05/11/project-cars-review/">Project Cars was an imperfect, but refreshingly different take</a> on the sim and simcade racer, and gained a healthy fanbase on the PS4 and Xbox One generation, two years before Gran Turismo Sport arrived, and at a time when Forza Motorsport was still a lighter style of racer. It was quickly followed up by a sequel in 2017, but then things went a little bit off the rails.</p>

<p>SMS was acquired in 2019 by Codemasters ahead of the 2020 release of Project Cars 3. That game took a turn towards more arcade racing that didn’t meet the same audience as the previous titles, and with Codemasters subsequently acquired by EA, their sim racing endeavours were eventually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/08/the-project-cars-franchise-has-been-cancelled-by-ea/">cancelled in 2022</a> and the team broken up or laid off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, SMS founder Ian Bell had left and gone on to found Straight4 Studios (previously branded as Mildly Annoyed Studios). They’re currently working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/project-motor-racing-races-to-a-november-launch-with-an-intriguing-single-player-career/">Project Motor Racing</a>, putting even more focus on motorsports and with a November release date.</p>
<p>In our review for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/24/project-cars-3-review/?cmpscreen">Project Cars 3</a>, Thomas wrote, “Project CARS 3 suffers from a case of mistaken identity. Once you adjust to the new direction, you can get into a fun flow of ticking off objectives, drifting around hairpins and purchasing upgrades. However, while the series’ existing platform means you get a great variety of circuits, cars and weather conditions, it also shackles this game from being a great arcade racing experience.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay-to-september-19.1253085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has just announced a four-week delay for its upcoming first-person open world action/adventure game Dying Light: The Beast. The game was scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on August 22</a> and will now be released on September 19. As you might expect, the reason is that it needs more polish (no pun intended).</p>



<p>The team shared a message with the Dying Light community:</p>



<p><em>It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</em></p>



<p><em>We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Dying Light 2: Stay Human wasn't as well received as the first game. Granted, Techland kept working on it and improving it for years, but the early reception certainly left a mark on the Polish studio. They would not want a repeat of that.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was recently featured in a fresh round of previews, including a hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on Wccftech</a> and written by Kai Tatsumoto. If you're attending Gamescom, the game will be playable in Hall 6. Even if you're not going to Cologne, Techland will continue to share more information about the game. Next week, they'll publish a new development diary about how they handled gore in this new title, narrated by the fan-favorite 'Bober the Beaver'.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slots-and-daggers">Slots &amp; Daggers</a> is by Friedemann, whose previous game was the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-teeny-tiny-townbuilder-is-the-pint-sized-townscaper-ive-been-waiting-for">Katharine-approved</a> tiny townbuilder. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/summerhouse">Summerhouse</a>. "After my last game, I wanted to make something radically different," says Friedemann. "Something faster, with numbers, fights and goblins!". Angry caffeinated math goblins, you say? Here are some other features <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3631290/Slots__Daggers">from Steam</a>.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fun slot machine</li>
<li>Weird fantasy world</li>
<li>Crude drawings of strange little guys</li>
<li>Retro visuals</li>
<li>Crunchy hip hop drum machines</li>
<li>Addictive arcade gameplay that goes “pling” a lot</li>
<li>Numbers! Fights! Goblins!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>"To make this game I combined a lot of things I deeply love – weird fantasy worlds, crude drawings of strange little guys, old school crunchy hiphop drum machines and addictive arcade games that go “PLING PLING PLING” as they spit out little coins – with classic roguelike mechanics," says Friedemann. They also warn that this is a solo project, and as such "doesn’t offer 80+ hours of content like games developed by bigger teams."</p>
<p>As delighted by both the crunchy drum machines and chucklesome weirdos as I am, I do despair a bit that anyone feels the need to avert potential gamer rage by clarifying that their project doesn't last as long as a CRPG. This isn't a slight on the developer, of course. Going by a sample of one (me), literally everyone who has ever played a videogame before is a massive idiot, and you can't be too careful. Can't wait for the enraged Steam review at exactly 79 hours of playtime.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gamings-only-three-genres-have-inevitably-converged-into-grimdark-balatro-with-a-whimsical-egg-idiot]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> has passed 5m copies sold, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has soared past 10m downloads, FromSoftware has announced.
</p>
<p>This duo of big milestones was announced on the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175">Elden Ring X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, alongside a lovely piece of custom art featuring the two games. The post reads: "The flame of thy passion burns ever bright in these shadowed lands. To all who wander the Lands Between, we offer our deepest thanks."</p>
<p>It was only in early June that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware celebrated Nightreign passing 3.5 million players</a> for its Soulslike PvE twist on the battle royale genre. Since its release, Nightreign has seen a consistant stream of updates and fixes. This includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">the addition of Everdark Sovereigns</a>, even harder variations of the game's end-of-run bosses.

<p>Smaller patches have made notable improvements to the game's rough edges too. A tweak to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-maintenance-makes-matchmaking-less-of-a-headache">how remembrances work removed the barriers they presented</a> with matchmaking online. In addition, soon after Nightreign's release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">solo runs were made easier in response to player feedback</a>.</p>
<p>The stage is now set for FromSoftware's future projects. Namely, the developer revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exclusive: The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-duskbloods">Duskbloods</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">Revealed during the April Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, it's a multiplayer PvPvE game that's another drastic shift away from the company's usual formula. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods">another unnanounced project we don't know too much about, but is reportedly deep in development</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond may finally be on its way to gamers. The <span>South Korean rating board, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank">GRAC</a>&nbsp;(Game Rating and Administration Committee), has just rated the game</span>, hinting at a relatively close release date.</p>



<p>The GRAC has often 'leaked' release date announcements. For example, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its rating on February 6, and the game's launch date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> around one month later, on March 9. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was then released on June 26.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4's launch date could therefore be announced in the coming weeks, whether at a Nintendo Direct, Gamescom, or even the Tokyo Game Show, for a late 2025 launch. Of course, an early 2026 date is also entirely possible.</p>



<p>Either way, this listing seemingly contradicts a rumor pushed a few hours ago by Reece 'KiwiTalks' Reilly, who <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1947809648700002346#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> there was no official release date because the game still wasn't finished. That seems highly unlikely given that the GRAC already put out its rating.</p>



<p>By the way, the game was rated '12 years old and up' by the South Korean rating board:</p>



<p><em>A first-person adventure game set on the planet Buros, where Samus Aran was transferred after an unexpected situation arose following her encounter with Silux at a Galactic Federation research facility.</em></p>



<p><em>Mild violence (using weapons attached to the suit to attack alien lifeforms).</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's development was very troublesome. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the original Nintendo Switch in June 2017. Back then, it had been assigned to an external studio, Bandai Namco, but their work did not satisfy Nintendo. The Japanese company decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot the project</a> and hand it back to the historic Metroid Prime caretaker: Retro Studios.</p>



<p>Now, at long last, the finishing line appears to be in sight. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to play the game</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event and came away rather positive about it:</p>



<p><em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also be available for the original Switch, by the way, as per the original announcement.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will get a New Game+ mode on 29th July, Ubisoft have announced in a video about their summer plans for the feudal Japanese <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a> stab-me-do. They're also working on a free Assassin's Creed Shadows update that lets you fast-forward the time of day, an ability that would certainly serve me well right now, as I contemplate the seven grim hours of video game journalism that separate me from the weekend.</p><!--more-->
<p>The New Game+ mode will reset story progression, discovered locations and objective progress, but will carry over your character level, gear, knowledge rank, and hideout progression. It'll let you start from the very beginning of the game, or skip the prologue to when you first inherit the hideout.</p>

<p>Ubisoft will also raise the level cap from 60 to 80, and are introducing new knowledge and mastery skill ranks together with new upgrades for hideout buildings, in particular the forge. Fans of live-served busywork can look forward to a third shadow project encompassing new resources, datafiles and animus-themed rewards.</p>
<p>It'll all be followed by one of those much-trumpeted "quality of life" updates at the beginning of September. This will let you speed the sun across the sky at whim, unfog the map by completing every single viewpoint in a region, and uncap the cutscene frame-rate (on PC only). </p>
<p>Ubisoft, if you want to improve the quality of my life specifically, please can you dispatch some of your best shinobi to menace my landlord? The hallway light has been flicking on and off for 18 months straight. Alternatively, please dispatch some of your best shinobi to fix the hallway light.</p>
<p>Finally, Ubisoft have slapped a release date on their Claws of Awaji expansion - September 16th. Access to the DLC is included with preorders, so if you're of the preordering persuasion, please resist the urge to buy it twice over.</p>
<p>Chaser: the video above harbours one of those Animus glitches with which Ubisoft are wont to tease future product announcements. I've screencapped it below. Please enjoy your continuing immersion in a simulation that has commodified the possibility of escape.</p>

<p>Excuse me?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We reported on Bandai Namco's naughty pup simulator, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doronko_wanko">Doronko Wanko</a>, back in December of last year, and not just because we were worried about what exactly this particular canine might be up to.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this very bold, but very cute, little doggy — who's name actually derives from <strong>わんこ</strong> <strong>Wan ko</strong>, which is an informal or cute way of saying dog or puppy in Japanese — is into wrecking the place, messing up his owner's stuff and causing havoc. Suddenly we are very, very interested.</p>
<p>The game, which is free-to-play on Steam (where it's currently sat on an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512840/DORONKO_WANKO/">"Overwhelmingly Positive" user-rating</a>) does cost $4.99 for Switch consoles. Boo! It's also launching alongside a bunch of new DLC that adds new breeds and kennels to muck about with. Hooray!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're into roleplaying a canine character who likes to destroy nice rooms with juice and ketchup, and just generally be a very bad dog, we're sure the price barrier to entry is unlikely to stop you in your messy, bold pup tracks. It's just one of those very specific things.</p>
<figure><a title="Doronko Wanko" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f91ce434669ac/doronko-wanko.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can check out the trailer for the game up top, and here's some more details for those dawgs over at Bandai Namco:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who’s a good boy? Whoseagoodboyyy? You are! Yes you are! So fluffy, so obedient, so swee—WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE HOUSE!?” Terrorize master’s domain with five new adorable-yet-troublemaking breeds as Corgis, Shibas, Jack Russell Terriers, Bulldogs, and Toy Poodles join the mess-making mix.</p>
<p>Fling muck onto every surface: spill wine bottles on the floor, splash paint on the walls, and shake grime from the pupper's filthy fur onto nearby furniture. It’s not all about destruction — haul scattered toys back to their rightful rooms (good dog!) to unlock new items, areas, and mess-making capabilities (bad dog!).</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Double the disarray with the assistance of rogue robo-vacuums and spinning fans that can spread dirt farther than those tiny paws could ever reach. Can these playful pups get any cuter? Yestheycanohmygoodness! Put on precious pirate hats or angelic halos — because they’re innocent!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DORONKO WANKO is now available for <a href="https://stridepr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/25YVWJhkzFCDWhgLPbt6YofXHpuPutNLujZn-5bPf-pngGeM8mAH4t14off9XzvI0aWlZaB18J1GBS5wLmTq_k4kUvs1-swhIBLEwuOwDwEJq3nNWMAMlLKHI-NOqkZDTH_Ra9mFNRLtfMd3YpTXJAfeRQnFRuZPfGfJ7CrQ6-ruTur61PZm7B9lQy2K_tv79NtLu8x989QFf4TyxfByseazx8fTJNHGLde6JDc1G0mVer8kNdqnOwpl7s9tnxqsxUDqskb6HxvAUpJQj-EwtMWsKzL2HE03M8TIEHA">Nintendo Switch</a> for $4.99</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix%E2%80%99s-final-fantasy-office-for-a-%E2%80%98creatively-rich-exchange-of-ideas%E2%80%99.1253046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Some of the key developers behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 have visited Square Enix's offices to meet with the Final Fantasy team. The confirmation <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1948389582665547854?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came</a> from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, who posted a picture of the two groups posing with a Cloud Strife standee.</p>



<p>According to Hamaguchi-san, the two groups engaged in a 'creatively rich exchange of visions and ideas' during the meeting. This will no doubt fuel Final Fantasy fans' hopes that Square Enix might reconsider its stance on turn-based combat.</p>



<p>The most recent games in the franchise have effectively shunned the traditional combat system in favor of action-based combat, as seen in Final Fantasy XVI, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> back in 2022 that the ever-improving realistic graphics was making it increasingly harder for some gamers to accept the inherently not-so-realistic nature of turn-based combat.</p>



<p>However, the success story of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proves that wrong</a>. Granted, Square Enix would have much higher sales targets for mainline Final Fantasy titles, and Sandfall Interactive's game doesn't use a traditional turn-based system anyway (dodges and parries are performed in real-time). Even so, it's obvious there is a market for this, as shown even by Baldur's Gate 3. Even though that was a Western cRPG, it still used turn-based combat mixed with fairly realistic graphics (perspective notwithstanding) to enormous acclaim.</p>



<p>Did Square Enix ask Sandfall Interactive for tips on how they made it work? Or, better yet, did they discuss a potential partnership on a new project? Co-development is all the rage nowadays throughout the gaming industry, so we wouldn't be surprised at all.</p>



<p>Of course, even if that were the case, it would be a long way from releasing. Nevertheless, it'll be interesting to see whether Square Enix eventually relents to fans to provide a new game with at least the option to play with turn-based fights.</p>

                <p>While last month's Unseen Update was meant to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades 2</a>'s final patch before the 1.0 launch, it turns out Supergiant had one more up its sleeve. The latest patch is full of balance tweaks, improvements, and fixes--including a handful that have come from players' feedback. Here's what's changing.</p><p>For the most part, players are getting a boost in power with the new patch, with many of the game's weapons, boons, and other abilities seeing buffs to damage, range, or other properties. Some abilities are being made easier to use, while a number of enemies are also becoming less punishing.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>The PwC report suggests that the games industry, which saw total revenues of $224 billion in 2024, could grow to nearly $300 billion by 2029. While other forms of digital entertainment are suffering, streaming media especially seeing reduced consumer spending amidst an overcrowded market, video games have proved more resistant to economic pressures.</p><p>PwC isn't the only analyst firm anticipating big things for the future of video games. Another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-next-console-will-drive-major-industry-growth-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6528534/" data-ref-id="1100-6528534">recent report suggested</a> 4 billion people, around half the world's population, would be counted as gamers by 2028. Many industry analysts stress the importance of major releases like the Switch 2 and GTA 6, with the latter's delay into 2026 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">causing some concern</a> about the industry's short-term figures.</p>

Multiple sources told us how the cuts have resulted in the loss of institutional knowledge that will make life harder for those left behind. They also criticized Xbox leadership for completely missing the mark when communicating with employees on the day the cuts were announced internally. One source described Microsoft's approach as "inhumane" and said workers were left in a state of "fight or flight" after the company failed to effectively clarify who would be impacted. "Some people were here for 15 years and cut out. Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting, they added. The full story is a tough but vital read.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-lowers-down-the-outer-worlds-2-price-from-80-to-70" target="_self" data-discover="true">Xbox lowers the price of The Outer Worlds 2 from $80 to $70</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo employee data indicates the company excels at retaining workers"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-employee-data-indicates-the-company-excels-at-retaining-workers">Nintendo employee data indicates the company excels at retaining workers</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">New data published by Nintendo shows the company is incredibly adept at retaining talent. The company's revised Employee Data Sheet shows that staff in Japan have an average tenure of 14.4 years, which is more than the national average of 12.5 years. Notably, the company's employee turnover rate in the country is a meager 1.9 percent. Nintendo also posted similarly impressive figures in other regions such as the United States and Europe. Why is this notable? Well, retaining knowledge and keeping teams together is vital in the game industry. It helps ensure production runs smoothly, benefitting both workers and consumers in a world of spiraling development costs and lofty sales expectations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mobile-dev-sandsoft-is-laying-off-around-65-employees-and-closing-two-studios" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Mobile developer Sandsoft is laying off 21 internal developers to 'double down' on publishing</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Obsidian just cut the controversial price of The Outer Worlds 2"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/615369/outer-worlds-2-price-cut-obsidian-xbox">Obsidian just cut the controversial price of The Outer Worlds 2</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Polygon // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Xbox has reconsidered its decision to start flogging games for $80.

The first-party studio shared the news via a tongue-in-cheek social media post, and said it had "worked with [REDACTED]" to revise the price of the sci-fi sequel. An Xbox spokesperson subsequently confirmed the company will be selling its full-priced holiday releases at $69.99 "in line with current market conditions."

Ubisoft expects the shooter to bounce back, which seems like good news given how reliant the company seems on the 10-year-old title.

In a lengthy statement posted on social media, 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx said the studio ultimately rushed the sequel to market and must now rethink its approach to build the game players deserve. It's the second round of layoffs the company has made this year—but it made headlines for other unsavory reasons too, after Proulx took to the stage at Summer Game Fest wearing a 'Make FPS Great Again' hat to announce </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be getting a battle royale mode. After the move drew criticism given the moniker's links to U.S. President Donald Trump and his right wing cohort of MAGA supporters, Proulx bravely decided to die on his MAGA-memeing hill and refused to apologize. He then apologized three days later. In an interview with Polygon announcing the layoffs, he said he has made "many, many mistakes." We suspect most would agree with him there.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Supermassive Games is laying off 36 people and delaying Directive 8020"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/supermassive-games-is-laying-off-36-people-and-delaying-directive-8020">Supermassive Games is laying off 36 people and delaying Directive 8020</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Dark Pictures Anthology developer Supermassive Games confirmed it would be making 36 people redundant this week to survive in a "challenging" business environment. The studio's upcoming horror title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Directive 8020</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has also been delayed to the first half of 2026—but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Nightmares III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> won't be impacted by the cuts. The news comes during period of upheaval for the UK studio, which lost its long-serving leadership team in February 2024. It then laid off a reported 90 people shortly after. That means the company has seemingly made 126 people redundant in around 18 months. How very bleak.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Just how much do consumers care about Nintendo Switch 2 peripherals?&nbsp;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">Just how much do consumers care about Nintendo Switch 2 peripherals?&nbsp;</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game File (subscription required) // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">New data published by Circana, spotlighted in Game File, indicates Nintendo sold around 512,000 Switch 2 Pro Controllers in the United States during the Switch 2's launch month. It's a number that means the premium gamepad, which retails for $85, had an attach rate of 32 percent in the region—in other words, one in three consumers purchased one with their Switch 2. Circana video game analyst Mat Piscatella also shared another interesting tidbit with Game File. He said the Switch 2's official camera—available for $55 in the U.S.—had a "mid-single digit percentage" attach rate. It'll be interesting to see whether Nintendo eventually shares concrete sales numbers to provide an indication as to how people are responding to the Switch 2's new social features.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Data points to slowing layoffs, but doesn't capture true harm to game industry"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/industry-layoffs-are-seemingly-slowing-but-the-damage-has-already-been-done">Data points to slowing layoffs, but doesn't capture true harm to game industry</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Believe it or not, it appears that game industry layoffs might actually be slowing down. Of course, the caveat is that so many people have been forcibly removed from their jobs over the past few years that you have to wonder how companies are still finding people to hurl out of the door. In her latest piece for Game Developer, veteran reporter Nicole Carpenter looks at how the layoff numbers have stacked up in the wake of a short-lived pandemic boom, how companies are approaching hiring after those widespread cuts, and why an apparent slowdown doesn't mean the industry or its workforce is suddenly out of the woods. Hint: propagating a culture of fear isn't helpful if you want people to make good video games.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>"Microsoft is thriving," said CEO and chairman Satya Nadella in a new statement following a round of layoffs earlier this month that cost 9000 employees their jobs.</p>
<p>The statement, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">shared publicly and with Microsoft employees</a>, reiterates the company mission, with Nadella doubling down on the importance of AI.</p>
<p>First, he acknowledged the layoffs. "I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left," he said. "Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful."</p>
<p>He continued: "I also want to acknowledge the uncertainty and seeming incongruence of the times we're in. By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving - our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right. We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognised and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.</p>
<p>"This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value. Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before."</p>
<p>It's clear that AI is now at the heart of Microsoft, as Nadella stated its three business priorities are security, quality, and AI transformation. "We are doubling down on the fundamentals while continuing to define new frontiers in AI," he said.</p>
<p>"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving - from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve."</p>
<p>Discussing company culture, Nadella stated: "Growth mindset has served us well over the last decade - the everyday practice of being a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all. It has reshaped our culture and helped us lead with greater humility and empathy. We need to keep that."</p>
<p>He continued: "It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganising. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere. It reminds me of the early '90s, when PCs and productivity software became standard in every home and every desk! That’s exactly where we are now with AI.</p>
<p>"Years from now, when you look back at your time here, I hope you'll say: 'That's when I learned the most. That's when I made my biggest impact. That's when I was part of something transformational'.</p>
<p>"What we've learned over the past five decades is that success is not about longevity. It's about relevance. Our future won't be defined by what we've built before, but by what we empower others to build now."</p>
<p>Nadella's statement comes three weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees were laid off from the company</a>, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>
<p>While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions is unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMaz MMORPG</a> were cancelled.</p>
<p>Roughly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and have reportedly been replaced by the AI tools they helped to build. The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">Turn 10 Studios behind Forza Motorsport is also reportedly "no more"</a>.</p>
<p>The knock-on effect has also resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">funding being cut for Romero Games' next project</a>, though contrary to reports the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">studio has not closed</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Controversy has rocked a recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> art contest, following accusations that one of the winning entries was made using AI. Capcom has since disqualified the piece in question, pointing to a rule that explicitly bans AI contributions.
</p>
<p>The art piece in question was created by user Lilithascends on X (formerly known as Twitter), who has since deleted their social media accounts following public accusations for other users. In response to these events, Capcom released the following statement on social media and the art contest website:
</p>
<p>"We want to extend a big thanks to everyone who participated in the latest Street Fighter Art Contest New Challenger Edition. Unfortunately, we have determined that one of the winning entries violated contest rules, specifically Section 5 pertaining to: Entry Submission and Design Requirements.

<p>It's worth noting that the section mentioned above - Entry Submission and Design Requirements - outright prohibits the use of AI, and states: "The design must be the Entrant's original creative work which has not been previously published or entered into other competitions."
</p>
<p>The statement from Capcom continues: "After careful review and discussion, we have decided to disqualify the entry in question.
</p>
<p>"Please note that the entry in question will remain available for voting in the Battle Hub until the end of the voting period. We want to thank those who participated in voting for the entry in question. While the entry in question has been disqualified, we will provide a replacement illustration for the featured character at a later date."
</p>
<p>Their art piece was of Kimberly, depicted colourfully in a street-art style. This piece, as well as a number of other community submissions, were eligible for a community vote on which of the chosen pieces would make it into Street Fighter 6's third season. These art contests have been an ongoing community event that has taken place since the launch of Street Fighter 6.
</p>
<p>Social media users who took a look back at the accused artist's prior works, including <a href="https://x.com/chupabaraa/status/1947783583957192894">fellow artist chupabaraa</a>, found prior art pieces that raised red flags for those levying accusations at Lilithascends, including stark similarities to the work of other artists.
</p>
<p>Is there a silver lining to these shenanigans? Well, one lucky person will have their work taking up the now-empty spot in the community art contest, which is nice. We've also seen <a href="https://x.com/click_burgundy/status/1948324713090195850">beloved FGC artist Hungry Clicker</a> put out their own Kimberly portrait in response, which is stunning. Also, for the artists battling to win this and future Street Fighter 6 art contests, it's surely a warm feeling to know Capcom is willing to stand firm against AI use.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-art-contest-rocked-by-ai-controversy-disqualification-issued]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I am not a coder. In fact, I view the actual process of development and coding in much the same way as much of Hollywood with hackers being some kind of modern wizard with arcane knowledge. With that in mind, when I was offered the chance to play a game that puts you in the shoes of a hacker trying to access a sinister organisation’s network, my first worry was that I wouldn’t be able to understand what I was doing. The premise intrigued me enough that I gave it a try and I’m glad that I did, as s.p.l.i.t is up there with the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/26/threshold-review/">Threshold</a> in terms of short experimental horror games.</p>
<p><em><strong>Content Warning:</strong> s.p.l.i.t contains dark elements, with thematic and immersive references to self harm and suicide. I won’t discuss details in the review but these are central enough to warrant caution.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="'s.p.l.i.t' - Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKO3UzOTBsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The aesthetics of s.p.l.i.t are perfectly in keeping with the game. While most of the time you’ll be staring at a simulated interface, you can turn to look around your room when necessary. This will mostly be required to switch between your hacking interface and your messaging screen through which you’ll interact with two mysterious colleagues. All mechanics are carried out through the keyboard, which really nails the immersion. Messaging is performed through mashing the keys to simulate actual typing, but all of the hacking has to be done for ‘real’.</p>
<p>The backstory of s.p.l.i.t is deliberately incredibly vague. You and two accomplices are trying to hack into a system in what appears to be an authoritarian dystopia. You have access to an illegal field kit device that can be used to create an authorisation key but will only have a limited time to finish the job once you have access. This scenario, especially when combined with the sheer immersion of the interface, leads to some of the most harrowing and thrilling gameplay you’ll find in indie horror. The fact that this all revolves around using a DOS-like interface to find and access files and programs within the system makes this a game that you have to play to feel.</p>


<p>There are few guidelines in the game but the signposting is so expertly done that I never found myself lost even though I didn’t have any coding knowledge going in. As mentioned above, the main interface is much closer to a pre-Windows experience as you must navigate file structures, find information and use the hints from your colleagues to proceed. Each major breakthrough is marked by a save point and brings you closer to the game’s conclusion.</p>
<p>In terms of dark themes, s.p.l.i.t is not a game with light and shade. This is a grubby and lo-fi experience that never lets up either in intensity or mood. The constant feeling of threat and surveillance makes the hour or so it takes to play through feel like an ordeal in the best possible way and both of the alternative endings offer no real optimism but both feel entirely appropriate for the game’s themes and setting.</p>


<!-- CONTENT END 1 -->

			
		</div>

		
				
	<div id="gp-summary">
		<p>Summary</p><p>
		s.p.l.i.t is a tough game to write about, as at heart it is just a simulation of a textual file interface wrapped up in a dark and oppressive environment, but it is also so much more than that. The perfect fusion of themes and mechanics makes for an experience that is almost suffocatingly immersive and the darker aspects (although absolutely not for everyone) elevate s.p.l.i.t to be one of the most harrowing games you’ll find. Aside from the essential content warning, I’d recommend going in as blind as possible and just playing out your The Matrix and Sneakers fantasies.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent infringement lawsuit in Japan against Pocketpair’s open-world survival game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is ongoing. In the latest development, Nintendo has reworded one of the patents in the case, but what led up to this bizarre move?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld is an open-world survival game that skyrocketed in popularity upon its Steam and Xbox early access launch back on January 19, 2024. It sold 8 million copies in just six days and racked up over 25 million players in one month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game world is inhabited by creatures called Pals, which you can capture and use (read: exploit) to carry out various tasks. The visual appearance of the Pals and the method of capturing them by throwing a ball (Pal Sphere), quickly drew comparisons to Pokémon, with the game even getting nicknamed “Pokémon with guns” for its darker, black humor-infused take on the creature collecting genre. With Palworld’s meteoric rise in popularity, it wasn’t long before Nintendo rival Sony got together with Pocketpair to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>form Palworld Entertainment</u></a> in June 2024, a new business venture aimed at expanding the IP.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company showed signs of keeping an eye on Palworld (for example, this <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official statement</u></a> from The Pokémon Company back in January 2024). But it wasn’t until September 2024 that they <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>officially announced</u></a> they were filing a lawsuit in Japan against Pocketpair for infringement of patent rights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office (JPO): two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that these changes by Pocketpair are not an admission of guilt. Rather, as Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/a9dd2fc3c0dc4e4d1282d012649b665462137560" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> on Yahoo Japan news last month, Pocketpair is following the standard three-pronged defense against patent lawsuits, which is to “deny infringement, argue that the patents are invalid, and avoid infringement through design changes.” He also noted that Nintendo does not have the upper hand, as there seems to be a fierce back-and-forth with Nintendo pushing for patent infringement and Pocketpair pushing for patent invalidity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7528390/15/ja" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ride mechanic patent</u></a> (which got a sudden rewrite recently) covers a system for mounting and maneuvering pre-selected “boardable characters” (<em>tōjō kyarakuta</em>). Commenting on X, Japanese lawyer Ryo Arashida <a href="https://x.com/IP_Arashida/status/1920369811932262824" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> that it could be argued that the way Palworld’s Glider Pals worked prior to the May update infringed part of the patent’s specifications, namely those about the player grabbing onto and hanging from the boardable character, and their subsequent control of that movement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the May Palworld update, you could use an actual Glider Pal to glide (by grabbing onto its feet). However, post-update, players have to use a piece of equipment — a Glider — to glide, rather than actually using the Pals themselves. Instead, Pals now act as passive buffs on your gliding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironically, as Arashida <a href="https://x.com/IP_Arashida/status/1920412095805571096" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noted</u></a>, Nintendo’s major argument to get the patent granted in the first place was that a “boardable character” was specifically a character and not a tool, like a parachute. “For this reason, claiming in the lawsuit that a ‘Glider’ (which is a tool) is a ‘boardable character’ would create a contradiction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month, Nintendo reworded the ride-switching mechanic patent. Rewording a patent mid-case is legal as long as it doesn’t introduce any new concepts or technical matter. However, as pointed out by IP consultant Florian Mueller at <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-resorts-to-weird-patent-claims-as-its-litigation-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair-is-struggling/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesFray</u></a>, this only tends to happen if the litigant (in this case, Nintendo) feels the patent is “at a fairly high risk of being deemed invalid in its original form.” Nintendo’s rewriting of the patent makes it more verbose. Mueller focused on the addition of “even when” <em>(-attemo</em> in Japanese) to the wording, noting that “even” is rarely used in patents because it's “too emphatic and subjective.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it's not clear exactly what Nintendo’s motivations are behind this sudden rewording, it’s possible that it is using this as a last-ditch tactic to make it harder for the patent claim to be dismissed as invalid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case continues. Meanwhile, Pocketpair continues to update Palworld with new features, such as the recently released Terraria crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/story-the-last-of-us-available-book-form/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-story-of-the-last-of-us-part-i-and-ii-will-be-available-in-book-form-later-this-year.1253001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you cannot stand video games and TV shows and would like to know what all the fuss regarding The Last of Us is about, the entire story so far will be available in book form later this year. Of course, it's also a perfectly valid option for those who already know the story through different mediums and would like to read it from the perspective of script writers Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross (the latter worked just on Part II).</p>



<p>The hardcover is already available for pre-order <a href="https://amzn.to/46WmXgE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Amazon</a>. It is estimated to be released on December 16, and the price of $69.99 is currently discounted to $66.63 (5% off). Dark Horse Books publishes the book, which is 616 pages long.</p>



<p>Here's the product overview:</p>



<p><em>Join Joel and Ellie from the very beginning of their unforgettable journey. Relive every climactic moment from The Last of Us Part I, from the duo’s time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie’s joy while petting giraffes, to Joel’s heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies’ hospital. And dive into The Last of Us Part II’s dual-perspective story, including Abby’s shocking introduction to the story, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby.</em></p>



<p><em>This volume contains the script from both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II, as well as the DLC, Left Behind, so you can experience every bottle thrown, every bad pun of Ellie’s, and every heart-pounding encounter with the Infected in a totally new way. Much like Savage Starlight was to Ellie, The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts is a must-have for any fan’s bookshelf (or survival kit).</em></p>



<p>The book also includes an art gallery featuring work by Naughty Dog principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, a buckram-textured cover, and block printing along the pages' edges that evokes the iconic Cordyceps fungus of The Last of Us.</p>



<p>The story as-is can be considered complete. As we previously reported, creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a third game would only be produced if Naughty Dog found a worthy story. Druckmann himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped back</a> from his additional role as co-showrunner of the HBO series, although HBO reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbo-not-concerned-neil-druckmann-departure-the-last-of-us-show-16-emmy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn't concerned</a> about his departure. Even so, the second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw a large decline </a>in viewership, and fans fear the third season will be even worse without the creator's handiwork.</p>

As highlighted by Serebii.net, it's a trench coat customisation and will be available "at certain locations" – including Amazon in Japan and from EB Games in Australia.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumours about a Nintendo Direct</a> already doing the rounds online, veteran video game journalist Christopher Dring has now added to this buzz, claiming "Xbox is expected to announce more game ports" for other platforms, including the Switch 2, in the "coming weeks" (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/xbox-will-apparently-announce-more-ps5-and-switch-2-ports-in-the-coming-weeks">thanks, Pure Xbox</a>).</p>

<p>While it's not known what exactly we might be seeing on the Switch 2 from Xbox, there's already been a lot of rumours about key series potentially being ported.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> team has recently responded to a question from <a href="https://youtu.be/o5tOD0sqfKM?t=1050">Gamertag Radio</a> about the game's sequel potentially getting a Switch 2 release at some point, and it sounds open to the idea of it – mentioning how it wants "as many people to be able to play" as possible (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51091-obsidian-says-we-ll-see-what-happens-in-regards-to-grounded-2-on-switch-2">via GoNintendo</a>).</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Xbox has been releasing more of its IP on other platforms, with <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a></strong> coming to the PlayStation 5 next month.</p>

Super Heroes both Earth-born and cosmic must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave.

Unlock stellar powerups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the Marvel universe. Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Joining the fight on Switch platforms later this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Marvel's been involved with some pretty exciting games in recent times, and hopefully, this trend continues with its upcoming arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on the Switch and Switch 2 later this year, Dotemu has today revealed another two playable characters joining the roster. This time we get a brief look at 'Beta Ray Bill' and 'Silver Surfer' who join the fight against the immortal super villain Annihilus.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about the latest character reveals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hammer time for Annihilus’ forces when Beta Ray Bill smashes into action! With his devastating and mighty hammer known as Stormbreaker, the son of Korbin marshals his cyborg strength to squash any bug battalion standing in his way!</p>
<p>And he won’t be joining the fight alone – from the depths of the cosmos, the Silver Surfer soars into the battle! Imbued with the Power Cosmic, the Surfer can stun any adversary. Easily gliding in the skies or close to the ground, insectoid invaders can’t escape Galactus’ former herald!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill will join a cast made up of various other characters like Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Venom and She-Hulk, as they brawl their way through the streets of Marvel's New York, all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone.</p>

<p>Fans voice their frustrations online</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03dfc2db8ed2c/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> has finally landed on the Switch 2 this week, and while the experience was expected to match other versions of the game, it seems this isn't <em>entirely</em> the case.</p>
<p>Although community creations are available in the Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-lacks-image-uploading-on-switch-2-and-fans-arent-happy">as highlighted by IGN</a>, this version "lacks image uploading" and it appears to have caught some wrestling enthusiasts by surprise.</p>
<p>The official game FAQ actually goes into a bit more detail about these restrictions, noting how Switch 2 players won't be able to upload or view custom images from "other platforms". The <a href="https://support.wwe2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/42408597808019-WWE-2K-Image-Uploader-Tool">same page on the game website</a> also includes the following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 players will not see Image Uploader based Community Creations from any platform or be able to upload their own"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see below, fans and content creators within this space have shared their frustrations online – with some already speculating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1m6lovh/no_community_creations_in_nintendo_switch_2/">about the reasons behind this decision</a>.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51086-wwe-2k25-on-switch-2-blocks-access-to-user-created-content">GoNintendo</a> have also labelled this a "major disappointment" and have reached out to multiple parties to "try and get an answer".</p>

<p>Apart from this, early impressions suggest <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64/status/1948093777320546314">the Switch 2 version of WWE 2K25 is a respectable port</a>. We'll be delivering our Nintendo Life review soon, and if we hear any significant developments tied to this story, we'll let you know.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Recently Canceled a Star Wars Outlaws Sequel – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-recently-canceled-a-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-%E2%80%93-rumor.1252920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This month, just days prior to the time of this writing, Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/"> Star Wars Outlaws missing its sales targets on the Star Wars IP itself</a>, saying that the Star Wars brand was "<em>in choppy waters</em>" at the time of Outlaws' launch. Now, a rumor has surfaced that Ubisoft has quietly canceled a Star Wars Outlaws sequel. </p>



<p>The rumor comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bFaIYn9H3g&amp;t=2800s">Tom Henderson and Insider-Gaming</a>, who said on the website's podcast that Ubisoft "<em>recently canceled Star Wars Outlaws 2</em>," adding that it was still in its early stages and that it "<em>hadn't entered [full] production</em>," and that it was "<em>very, very, early</em>." Mike Straw, senior editor at the site, joked that we were "<em>probably seven years away</em>" from seeing it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Is EA's Last Chance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFaIYn9H3g?start=2800&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Henderson has <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">previously correctly reported</a> internal information about Ubisoft, but this claim remains a rumor for now. It's also arguably not the most wild speculation. You could say that Outlaws was the biggest miss for Ubisoft in 2024, a year rife with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/09/skull-and-bones-looks-like-its-doing-worse-than-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">big misses</a> for the company. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">struggled to move units out of the gate</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">underwent significant changes from its original launch version</a> months after release due to a heavy wave of negative player feedback. The game's director even acknowledged <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">disappointment with the response from critics</a>.</p>



<p>Its poor launch sales were also used as an excuse to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows out of 2024 and to its eventual March 2025 launch date. You could make the case that Ubisoft has had anything but negative things to say about Outlaws since it launched. It's not the craziest idea that leadership ultimately decided not to go down the road of a sequel, even if they were exploring what one would look like.</p>

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h45Sr1kafGU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>resulting video</u></a> is quite funny, showing the new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) family as they fumble through a few matches as their in-game counterparts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet the family! ✨Marvel Studios The Fantastic Four: First Steps cast's genuine reactions as they try out Marvel Rivals! 😄 <a href="https://t.co/sq8lwMh7pp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sq8lwMh7pp</a></p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1948513591134679137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's goofy and occasionally hard to watch as Pascal flails his stretchy arms at enemies, but the highlight is no doubt the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to Invisible Woman’s infamous Marvel Rivals Malice skin. Fans of the game had already taken the time to see everything the shockingly revealing outfit had to offer when it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Season_1_Battle_Pass_and_New_Skins#Malice_Invisible_Woman_Skin">its debut with Season 1</a> in January. On the eve of the new Fantastic Four movie’s premiere, though, the cast is only just seeing it for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby is the first to joke about the skin: “Thank you. This is my favorite bit of her as well,” she says of the video game version of her Fantastic Four character. “This is my favorite bit. Guys, watch out, like I said, for the sequel. You better watch it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps, of course, has yet to receive the green light for a proper MCU sequel, though we do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-pedro-pascals-reed-richards-lead-the-avengers-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-director-clarifies-previous-comments-insists-its-for-the-russo-brothers-to-reveal"><u>at least some of its major characters</u></a> will make an appearance in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday. Invisible Woman’s evil black-and-red Malice skin probably won’t make it into the MCU, but the slack-jawed Pascal still shared some of his thoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here we go,” Pascal said. “Costume designer, take notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loserfruit’s video also includes the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to other Marvel Rivals cosmetics, including Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s The Life Fantastic wedding skins. Of course, it’s how all four actors reacted to the Malice skin that has started to achieve viral status.
