            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>About midway through <a href="https://www.animalwell.net/"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, I felt I had been lied to. I read all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">glowing</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch">reviews</a> of the game and heard the breathless praise heaped upon it on social media. But my expectations did not match my reality... until I beat the game. Now, I’m well on my way to 100 percent completion for a game I was seriously considering abandoning.</p><p><strong><em>Spoilers for</em> Animal Well<em> are below.</em></strong></p><p>Though I loved <em>Animal Well</em>’s novel take on traditional movement abilities — the tools it provides possess multiple clever uses — platforming itself often felt demoralizing. Initially, <em>Animal Well</em>’s platforming felt like it had difficulty spikes that were both too great and too frequent. I could often see where I had to go and how to get there (and I often looked up video guides to confirm I was doing it right with the right tools) but actually executing was more laborious than fun and engaging. </p><div><p>Though I loved <em>Animal Well</em>’s novel take on traditional movement abilities, platforming itself often felt demoralizing</p></div><p>I’ve always felt that the difficulty of a task in a platformer should be commensurate with its importance: the hardest moments should be reserved for secrets and optional goals, while everything involved in completing the game should be more attainable. That way, I am still in control of my experience and, critically, still <em>having</em> an experience. If reaching a secret is harder than I’d like, then I can opt out to continue on to beat the game one completion percentage point lower. But if simply getting from point A to point B is too dang hard, opting out means opting out of the game entirely. <em>Animal Well</em>’s platforming convinced me I’d run into an obstacle so frustratingly difficult that I’d quit and never come back.</p><div><figcaption><em>On a lark, I decided to see what would happen if I pressed a big red skull button in a room full of crows, and yup, they pecked me to death.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Big Mode / Shared Memory</cite></p></div><p>Thankfully, that didn’t happen. Somehow, I persisted long enough to collect all four animal flames to complete the game’s first “ending,” figuring I’d stop there. But then, right before the final encounter, I found a room littered with skulls containing an upgrade to the bubble wand item. Remember this, it’ll be important in a moment.</p><p>The bubble wand creates little bubble platforms you can jump on, but you can only blow one at a time. The upgraded bubble wand allows you to blow <em>multiple</em> bubbles that, with the right technique, let you bypass a lot of the game’s obstacles. </p><p>Remember the skulls? I figured out that all the skulls in that room, piled high enough for me to reach the wand, represented the number of times I died. With that realization came the shock that even though I wasn’t initially vibing with the game, it was always vibing with me. The bubble wand upgrade is unreachable unless you’ve accumulated enough skulls to build a platform up to it. The only way I got what finally made this game click for me was because of all the frustration it put me through in the first place.</p><p>When I figured that out, I started laughing maniacally, tears in my eyes, thinking, “Oh, you cheeky bastards!” I immediately went right back to the start of the game to go egg hunting, something I already decided I wasn’t going to do. But I was locked in now. I understood. I’m stuck in the (animal) well now, and I’m never coming out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="NGoiCX">Summer’s around the corner — or maybe it’s already here, depending on the weather wherever you’re at. Either way, May is almost over, and that means movies leaving streaming services at the end of the month.</p>
<p id="edsBx5">This month, we have two very different thrillers — one about corporate malfeasance, one about an evil box — an underrated video game adaptation, and a very silly comedy with a great cast. We’re also highlighting <em>The Crow</em>, with the new version starring Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs just a few months away.</p>
<p id="TQm1uj">Here are the best movies you should watch before they leave streaming this May.</p>

<p id="Kog0AX"><strong>Director: </strong>Michael Mann<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer<br><strong>Leaving Criterion Channel: </strong>May 31</p>
<p id="rgji44">In 1996, <em>60 Minutes </em>ran a searing episode exposing the tobacco industry for intentionally adding dangerous chemicals to cigarettes and lying to the public. The episode relied on the testimony of whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, the former vice president of research and development at a major tobacco company. And the story behind how that episode came to be (and how it nearly never aired) is fascinating, as documented in Michael Mann’s excellent thriller <em>The Insider</em>.</p>
<p id="2IpgEb">A powerful movie about the difficulties of working ethically inside a large corporation and what real heroism actually looks like, <em>The Insider </em>is one of Mann’s very best movies — and that’s an extremely high bar. Al Pacino and Russell Crowe star as CBS producer Lowell Bergman and the whistleblower Wigand, respectively, and the excellent supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (as legendary <em>60 Minutes </em>correspondent Mike Wallace), Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, and Rip Torn. It’s a gorgeous movie to take in as well, with crisp cinematography from Dante Spinotti earning him one of the movie’s seven Oscar nominations — including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and the first of three consecutive Best Actor nominations for Crowe. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="XH0qEW"><strong>Director: </strong>Christophe Gans<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden<br><strong>Leaving Netflix: </strong>May 31</p>
<p id="9VjPbc">This movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23411610/silent-hill-movie-new-game-announcement">doesn’t get the credit it deserves</a>. Not only is it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23196727/best-video-game-movies-adaptations-tv-watch-streaming">one of the best video game movies ever made</a>, it’s also a very creepy (and gory) horror movie that does a great job of capturing the games’ mounting existential dread. You already know the premise: A girl gets lost in Silent Hill and someone else has to go rescue her, only to find all manner of untold horrors within the abandoned town. While there are bits and pieces of CGI that don’t quite hold up, the rest of this movie includes some truly terrifying creatures and sequences, and an absolutely devastating ending that few horror movies can match. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="ZQaJ91">There’s a new adaptation of <em>The Crow </em>coming around the corner this summer, so why not watch the original this month? While best known for the tragic death of star Brandon Lee, who was fatally shot in an accident during production, <em>The Crow </em>is an enduring neo-(goth-)noir classic for good reason. With a foreboding atmosphere via director Alex Proyas (<em>Dark City</em>) and the (very) dark source material, <em>The Crow </em>inspired a whole generation of goths.</p>
<p id="4eltkw">And if you love Brandon Lee in this, check out some of the other movies in his all-too-short filmography. His previous two movies — <em>Showdown in Little Tokyo </em>and <em>Rapid Fire </em>— are both stellar. Like his father, he was one hell of a movie star whose life and career was cut all too short. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="MrYfe9">I have a vivid memory of <em>The Box </em>being marketed as a horror movie, but it really isn’t. After falling head over heels for his <em>Southland Tales </em>(and with <em>Donnie Darko </em>under my belt long before that), I wanted to complete my experience with the Richard Kelly filmography with his most recent feature, which was broadly rejected by critics and audiences alike but is nonetheless a fascinating movie. And I was rewarded for that decision, albeit with some qualms.</p>
<p id="oDtuhi">You know the basic premise. It’s been memed to death — a family receives a button that will give them a million dollars if they press it, but someone they don’t know will die. But that basic premise hides a much richer movie, a tense domestic drama that unwinds into a conspiracy thriller turned [redacted for spoilers]. Like Kelly’s other movies, <em>The Box </em>is filled with interesting images and is ripe for all sorts of metaphorical readings, even if it is less successful than his two previous features. I found myself quite frustrated with the ending, especially with regard to its relationship to disability, but it’s a fascinating and endlessly discussable thriller nonetheless. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="Lv0L5o"><strong>Director: </strong>Kay Cannon<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kathryn Newton, John Cena, Leslie Mann<br><strong>Leaving Hulu: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD%2frLJHOac&amp;offerid=1589248.1409&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">May 31</a></p>
<p id="6AXDM6">A hybrid sex comedy/generation-gap comedy from <em>30 Rock </em>alum Kay Cannon, <em>Blockers </em>follows three parents who are trying to stop their daughters from losing their virginity on prom night... and also the three daughters trying to lose their virginity on prom night. It’s not nearly as conservative about young women having sex as the premise might have you believe, as the parents’ ridiculous overprotectiveness is often the butt of the joke, but the real strength is the cast: rising stars Kathryn Newton, Geraldine Viswanathan, and Gideon Adlon excel as the three main girls, while Leslie Mann, John Cena, and Ike Barinholtz are all great as the overbearing parents.</p>
<p id="d2HAjy">Often juvenile and not always funny, <em>Blockers </em>isn’t some great breakthrough moment in American comedy, but it is a fun time with a very game cast. The split between the parents and the children and their various problems and hang-ups is almost like an American version of <em>Derry Girls</em>. While <em>Blockers </em>lacks the emotional resonance of that Netflix show, it’s still an underrated Hollywood comedy during an era where very few of those have been worth talking about. —<em>PV </em></p>

It truly was, and remains, one of the most brilliant things I’ve ever played.  - Moises Taveras <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb0180eae8a7717cd2c119a20ca0e371" data-recommend-id="image://bb0180eae8a7717cd2c119a20ca0e371" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Key art of Dungeons of Hinterberg showing Luisa, her supporting cast on the left side of the image, and the monsters she faces on the right side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Key art of Dungeons of Hinterberg showing Luisa, her supporting cast on the left side of the image, and the monsters she faces on the right side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microbird / Curve Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb0180eae8a7717cd2c119a20ca0e371" data-recommend-id="image://bb0180eae8a7717cd2c119a20ca0e371" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Key art of Dungeons of Hinterberg showing Luisa, her supporting cast on the left side of the image, and the monsters she faces on the right side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dungeons-of-hinterberg-xbox-id-indie-rpg-preview-bond-1850532289&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dungeons-of-hinterberg-xbox-id-indie-rpg-preview-bond-1850532289"><em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em></a></span><em> </em>begins in an awfully familiar place: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2024/05/cozy-games-cured-my-video-game-burnout-heres-why-you-should-try-it-too/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2024/05/cozy-games-cured-my-video-game-burnout-heres-why-you-should-try-it-too/">burnout</a></span>.

<p>These days, we don’t see many brand-new launches on last-gen systems. Most developers chose to forego the system in favor of new tech, like the current-gen Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. There are also rumors about the next generation of gaming consoles coming sometime in the next year or two. That said, not everyone feels the same. So, can you play Black Ops 6 on Xbox One?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-coming-to-xbox-one">Is Black Ops 6 Coming to Xbox One?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent reports online</a>, specifically surrounding product listings at GameStop, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is indeed coming to Xbox One. It will launch on last-gen and current-gen systems, along with PC, to reach the widest audience imaginable.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming heard rumors regarding Black Ops 6 on last-gen consoles in February last year, but we can only now confirm those rumors. We have confirmation from developers and retailers, which is fantastic news for anyone playing on Xbox One or PlayStation 4!</p>



<p>Furthermore, it’s important to note that you won’t find a direct listing for Black Ops 6 on Xbox One. Instead, it falls under the Xbox Series X|S version because it’s a cross-generation copy of the game, meaning it works on both systems!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-black-ops-6-have-crossplay">Does Black Ops 6 Have Crossplay?</h2>



<p>If past titles are anything to go by, then yes, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will feature crossplay. Honestly, it’s nearly a must-have feature for a first-person, lobby-based shooter launching on all available systems.</p>



<p>We don’t have exact numbers, but we know the Xbox One sold approximately 58 million units, while the Xbox Series X|S sold 21 million units, give or take. That’s a massive gap in the player base, meaning most didn’t upgrade. It would be foolish of Activision to split the communities so significantly on last-gen and current-gen systems!</p>



<hr>



<p>While we’re all casually waiting for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, did you hear about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>?

            <p>The families of those killed in the Uvalde school shooting in 2022 have filed lawsuits against Call of Duty publisher Activision, accusing the company of "grooming" the 18-year-old who shot and killed 19 children, two teachers, and injured 17 others.</p>
<p>As reported by The New York Times (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/us/uvalde-gun-instagram-activision-lawsuit.html">£</a>) (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/uvalde-activision-lawsuit/">PC Gamer</a>), the dual lawsuits – one filed in California, the other in Texas – claim that the killer bought a Daniel Defense M4 V7 on his 18th birthday after seeing the gun in Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>It's the lawsuits' position that by using real-life weapons, Activision is "the most prolific and effective marketer of assault weapons in the United States". </p>
<p>They also take issue with Meta's Instagram and the arms manufacturer, Daniel Defense, too, saying that were it not for technology and video games, the socially isolated teenager living in rural Texas would not have been able to contact the gun maker.</p>
<p>Activision says that whilst it shares its "deepest sympathies" to all those impacted by the mass shooting, "millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts".</p>
<p>The Entertainment Software Association – the video game trade body that representations video game companies in the US and established the ESRB ratings association in the early 1990s – calls the lawsuits "baseless".</p>
<p>"We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," the ESA said in a statement to press. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies. Many other countries have similar rates of video gameplay to the United States, yet do not see similar rates of gun violence."</p>
<p>We've reached out to Activision for further comment and will update you if/when we receive a formal response.</p>

		<p>A new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> game could be announced in the next two weeks, as rumours emerge for Sony’s expected summer showcase.</p>
<p>This comes from the very, very reliable games industry leaker Billbil-kun, writing on <a href="https://www-dealabs-com.translate.goog/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489">French deals site Dealabs</a>. They have a remarkable track record of predicting announcements, typically revealing the monthly PlayStation Plus games just a little before Sony make the formal announcement.</p>


<p>A new Astro Bot game has been mooted by industry insider Jeff Grubb earlier this year, and it absolutely follows that Team Asobi would make a new Astro Bot game after the success and popularity of Astro Bot: Rescue Mission on the original PSVR and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astros-playroom">Astro’s Playroom</a>, which is bundled in with every PlayStation 5 as a showcase of the console’s capabilities and love letter to all things PlayStation.</p>
<p>Team Asobi spawned out of Japan Studio, having been founded as an internal team at the studio back in 2012. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/25/report-playstations-japan-studio-is-being-wound-down-but-astros-playroom-developer-asobi-team-will-survive/">Sony’s decision to shut down Japan Studio in early 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/03/astro-bot-developer-team-asobi-is-now-a-standalone-studio-separate-from-japan-studio/">Team Asobi was splintered off as a standalone studio</a> within PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>So when, exactly, will Astro Bot’s next adventure be announced? Well, Sony has yet to confirm a State of Play or PlayStation Showcase, but they typically do hold an online showcase around this time of year. With Summer Game Fest now settled into the old E3 window of early June, Sony stole a march last year with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/17/playstation-showcase-announced-for-24th-may-2023/">a PlayStation Showcase on 24th May</a>. The latest rumours and speculation – coming from Jeff Grubb and Nick Baker – suggest an event could happen as soon as next week, 28th May. Except, Sony gave one week’s notice last time around and have been completely silent on the matter.</p>

<p>Astro’s Playroom was a simple bundle of joy for pretty much every PS5 owner. “Astro cements himself as the PlayStation 5’s mascot,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">I said in 2020</a>, “with a celebration of all things PlayStation that also showcases the full potential of the immersive new DualSense controller. Astro’s Playroom is the first thing you should play on PlayStation 5.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/24/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-reboots-both-underperform-for-embracer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two big game series revivals have underperformed, Embracer Group has said, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alone-in-the-dark">Alone in the Dark</a> reboot and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/outcast-a-new-beginning">Outcast: A New Beginning</a> sequel both selling worse than expected.</p>
<p>As part of Embracer’s latest earnings report for the year ending in March 2024, the company noted that the survival horror reboot failed to sell in line with expectations, and the sequel to 1999 cult classic Outcast faced similar struggles. Both games came under the THQ Nordic brand, but have impacted the wider finances of the troubled company.</p>


<p>Other games did, however, meet or exceed expectations. Despite server issues at launch, Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection sold well, and South Park: Snow Day also “delivered within expectations”. Even better, Embracer said that&nbsp;Tomb Raider I-III Remasted “was positively received and performed above management expectations.”</p>
<p>Alone in the Dark had some moderately high hopes pinned upon it, with Pieces Interactive taking the early 90s survival horror pioneer and promising a Resident Evil 2 Remake style makeover. It featured Jodie Comer and Dariv Harbour in leading roles, while reimagining the setting and story.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it just didn’t deliver. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">our Alone in the Dark review</a>, we said, “Alone in the Dark haphazardly follows modern genre trends where it once invented them. While it mostly succeeds at drawing players into a Lovecraftian mystery, it’s hard to ignore the underbaked action elements used to patch these story beats together.”</p>

<p>Embracer has gone from a growing force in gaming to a troubled company in just over a year. Having acquired a huge number of studios and publishing labels, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/14/embracer-will-shut-studios-and-cancel-games-after-2bn-deal-falls-apart/">company has enacted sweeping layoffs and redundancies</a>, cancelled games, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">sold</a> or shuttered studios. Most recently, it was announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/22/embracer-group-plans-to-split-into-three-separate-companies/">Embracer will split into three separate entities</a>. This latest news and underperforming games in general certainly won’t help…</p>

            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios has shared the "disappointing news" that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-xbox-physical-edition-gets-a-bit-of-a-delay-due-to-production-issues">physical PS5 North America deluxe editions have been delayed once again</a>, this time to July 2024.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, last night, the team said it was "so hoping not to have to update [...] with any further news of delay", but it had "run into more production issues", further delaying the shipping of physical copies of the North American PS5 version until later this year.</p>

<p>"Due to production changes outside of our control, we have had to follow certain processes specifically set by production companies when manufacturing the PS5 discs, and unfortunately, the approval for particular regions has taken much longer than expected," Larian explained in the statement.</p>
<p>"We expect all PS5 North America copies to be ready in around 14 days - followed by another 10 days to begin delivering these directly to players. We are also in talks with the manufacturer to understand whether it is possible to hire extra temporary staff to reduce assembly times.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We have disappointing news to share with you.</p><p>While we were so hoping to not have to update owners of the console physical Deluxe Edition with any further news of delay, we’ve now run into more production issues which means that players who pre-ordered their PS5 North America…</p></div>— Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1794059975746105362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Knowing that there are some of you still waiting to play Baldur’s Gate 3, despite the fact we are unable to substitute physical goods with digital versions, we can only deeply apologise that your preorders have again been delayed," the statement concluded. "By committing to creating physical editions, we were hoping to preserve the almost nostalgic feeling of unboxing your newest game, and this is a commitment we’re hoping to bring into the future with us, this time ensuring we continue to work closely with our partners to manage the planning and production process.</p>
<p>"We’re so sorry it’s taking so long to get your preorder to you, and thank you, for continuing to support us."</p>
<p>The team was able to confirm, however, that Xbox copies are now shipping, as are PS5 versions in the EU and Oceania.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed its next game will not be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, DLC, or anything else to do with Dungeons and Dragons, but did have other games in development.</p>
<p>Back in April, the studio said it was still "early days" for these projects, with CEO Swen Vincke stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">what's coming will be the team's "best work ever"</a>. An exciting claim given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">monumental success of Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>As for a potential Baldur's Gate 4? Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">recently confirmed</a> it's "talking to lots of partners" about a new game in the series.</p>

Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The free-to-play first-person shooter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-release-date-preseason-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDefiant</a> is reportedly doing big numbers already. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Tom Henderson</a>, the game has become the fastest ever made by Ubisoft to surpass one million unique players. In fact, it has already managed to break through the three million unique player milestone.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that XDefiant is currently outperforming even Ubisoft's rosiest expectations. However, the big question with a live service game like this is whether it can retain players' interest over time. While Call of Duty Modern Warfare III has certainly underwhelmed, the same might not be true for 2024's title, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just been confirmed to be Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft already shared the game's Year 1 roadmap, which will see the introduction of ranked mode and private matches, new arena and progression modes, a welcome list for beginners, practice zones, and ongoing anti-cheat improvements. There will also be four seasons, each coming with three new weapons, three new maps, 90 tiers of Battle Pass, and a new faction. The four factions being added in Year 1 are codenamed Ruby, Buzz, Orchard, and Horde.</p>
<p>For now, the game includes the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 maps inspired by other Ubisoft titles</li>
<li>Five Ubisoft franchise-inspired factions (one faction to be earned or purchased): Cleaners from The Division, Libertad from Far Cry, Echelon from Splinter Cell, Phantoms from Ghost Recon, and Dedsec from Watch Dogs</li>
<li>24 weapons</li>
<li>44 attachments</li>
<li>Five devices</li>
<li>Two game modes: Arena and Linear</li>
<li>Arena includes Domination, where teams fight to control three fixed zones; Occupy, in which teams fight to control one zone that periodically moves around the map; and HotShot, where players fight to get the most KOs.</li>
<li>Linear includes Zone Control, where the attacking team works to secure five zones in a progression across the map while defenders must fight to stop them, and Escort, where the attacking team must bring a package to its final destination across the map while the defenders attempt to stymie their progress, and even push the package back.</li>
</ul>
<p>XDefiant also encountered some of the usual launch title snags, such as server issues, although the developers appear to be on top of that.</p>
<p>Have you been playing this game yet? If so, what do you think of it?</p>

In addition to praising the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423">potential for generative AI</a></span> to transform how games are made, Druckmann appeared to make a grand pronouncement about Naughty Dog’s next, highly-anticipated PlayStation 5 game. “I’m eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of <em>The Last of Us</em>, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming,” the interview read. </p><p>In addition to getting picked up by several media outlets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including <em>IGN</em></a></span> which called it “big words,” the quote also went viral on social media, where it received widespread criticism. The reaction has now prompted Druckmann to correct the record.</p><p>“This is not quite what I said,” the veteran gaming creative tweeted late on May 24. “In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost. Well, here’s the full long rambling answer for the final question about our future game.”</p><p>Druckmann then proceeded to share an excerpt of the raw, unedited transcript from his conversation with the anonymous interviewer. In it, he talks about how gaming used to be very niche and siloed off from the rest of the culture when he was growing up, and how that has since changed, in part thanks to hit TV shows like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070">HBO’s adaptation of <em>The Last of Us</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon’s adaptation of <em>Fallout</em></a></span>. </p><p>“I’m not only excited for this game that we’re making—and it’s, it’s something really fresh for us—but I’m also excited to see how the world reacts to it,” the transcript reads. “Because of <em>The Last of Us</em>, and the success of the show, people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next. I’m very excited to see what the reaction for this thing will be.”</p><p>While interviews are often edited down for clarity and length, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the one published on Sony’s website</a></span> made a surprising number of cuts and, what’s worse, made up a bunch of things Druckmann didn’t actually say, including phrases with very different meanings from anything contained in the original. It raises the question of how many other parts of the interview aren’t accurate paraphrases of what the game designer said or are completely made-up, though presumably if there were more errors Druckmann would have corrected those as well. </p><p>One thing that Sony cut from his response was a moment of humility and graciousness. “I’ve been very lucky to have worked on my favorite games with incredible collaborators and I’m very thankful for them,” Druckmann said. It was a tacit reminder that Naughty Dog’s games are made by hundreds of people.</p><p>Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Other than the Lumina Sword, you will also have access to other weapons such as swift daggers and long-range guns. Find the perfect weapons to suit your fighting style.</p><p>This game features a skill tree system.

The game is chock-full of story and gameplay content alike, and Team Ladybug’s signature pixel art is being further refined. We’re terribly sorry for the delay, but we hope the improved <em>Blade Chimera</em> will be high-quality and be able to entertain a wide audience.</p><p>The newly released trailer showcases many new boss battles and gimmicks, all painstakingly designed by Team Ladybug. It offers a sneak peek into the world of the game… but in order to let more players get their hands on the actual game experience, <em>Blade Chimera</em> will be joining Steam Next Fest in June (next month!) with a public demo.

After 30 merciless years of war, the surviving humans have banded together under the Missa Association, a religious group formed by a leader who knows the secret to fighting the demons. Cities and civilizations continue to thrive despite the now regular sightings of bizarre monsters.</p><p>Three years ago, a man known as Shin was rescued from among the rubble in a cryopreserved state. With no recollection of his past, he quickly becomes one of the association’s best warriors and protectors.</p><p>However, when Shin comes across the brilliantly beautiful demon named Lux, she feels strangely familiar. This sensation of deja vu leads him to take her in, even if it means going against the creeds of the association.</p><p>From that very instant, the past begins to slowly unfold, revealing the events that caused the city to take on its current form…</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Watch beautifully animated conversations between the main characters. Join a young boy on his adventure and experience his story set in a hardcore sci-fi world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Boyhood’s End</em> is a juvenile science fiction horror adventure game, in which the world is ruled by a mechanical overlord “R. Karellen.” Every aspect of every person’s life is rated with a “human score,” and R. Karellen decides everything from academic and professional careers, romantic interests, to one’s daily meals.</p><p>The protagonist, Giovanni, has the lowest human score among the entire human race. Every day, he receives “special treatment” for everything including his meals and classes. On top of that, he gets bullied relentlessly by his classmates at the School, both in real life and online.</p><p>But one day, everything and everyone in the school starts attacking Giovanni, trying to “remake” him and raise his human score by making him “more human.” A senior student, the famously eccentric genius Campanella, reaches out to Giovanni, and they hop onto (and take over) a driverless train on the galactic railroad. And so, Giovanni gets swept up in a journey to find the “Crimson Southern Cross,” located at the farthest edge of the universe.</p><p>On their journey, the boys will meet great leaders of the past and pull reckless and destructive “pranks” on them all. Through their encounters with the history, twisted mysteries, and various horrors of the world, they will eventually have to confront the end of their own childhood.</p><p>Oh, did you hear that? The boys are (pointlessly) sounding the train whistle. Looks like it’s time for the galactic express to depart.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giovanni</strong><ul><li>“Shut up! I couldn’t care less about your twisted logic, but here’s the thing, I’m a human! And you’d better start treating me like one!”</li><li>Has a wanted <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal as a father and the lowest human score in the universe. Gets treated like trash by other people and even the system itself. Has a cynical personality and a sharp tongue, but has a soft spot for his family. Always has to earn money to pay his sister’s hospital fees. Although he lives in an age where humans haven’t had to write programs by themselves for generations, Giovanni knows the ancient craftsman technique of writing his own code from scratch. He frequently uses his coding skills to do shady side gigs on the dark web.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Campanella</strong><ul><li>“Come on, show me! Show me the true potential of humanity! Show me something unpredictable, something that could ruin the world as we know it—something a man-made thing could never do!”</li><li>Has the highest human score in the Gymnasium, and very talented in everything from academics to sports, but also has the highest total score deduction in the Gymnasium due to his frequent eccentric behavior. Talk about extreme. Campanella holds “humans” in high regard, and acts arrogantly around the inhuman and artificially intelligent R. However, many claim to have seen him chatting and playing around with R for no reason in particular.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Worldview Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="&quot;Boyhood's End&quot; world view trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJB2_n-9kPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="少年期の終り　世界観PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sa6wqqnJ5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Korean</strong></p><p><iframe title="Boyhood's End 세계관PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72rbzdc4YOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The year is 2036. Humanity has declined. Misha is a Public Safety Operator: a contractor for the Provisional Government tasked with hunting Youkai, and protecting the Quarantine City of Shin-Chiba. Within the haunted ruins of Tokyo, she unearths a mystery that could unmake what remains of civilization.</p><p><em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> is an action-horror shooter about hunting Youkai in the haunted ruins of Tokyo. Combat fuses the tense shooting gameplay of classic survival horror, with the skill-based mechanics and execution of fighting games and spectacle fighters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_884769"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clutch System</strong> – Misha’s Modular Gun allows her to rapidly switch between Weapon Modules using command inputs inspired by fighting games. Efficiently dispatching Youkai requires maintaining a cool head and skillful execution, even as the horrifying creatures close in.</li><li><strong>Legends Brought to Life</strong> – The Youkai that Misha encounters are drawn from urban legends, and Japanese folklore. However, they don’t appear exactly as depicted in the well-known stories. These are the monsters the stories are based on.</li><li><strong>Powerful Status Effects</strong> – Weapon Modules are imbued with various elemental damage types that allow Misha to inflict statuses such as “freeze,” “stun,” or “bleed” upon Youkai. Learning when your next shot is going to send a Youkai reeling or freeze them solid is key to <a title="Genres > Survival [276 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>.</li><li><strong>Build Your Own Combos</strong> – While exploring the ruins of Tokyo, Misha will discover and build up an impressive arsenal of Weapon Modules. Weapon Modules can be slotted into different “Command Slots” in Misha’s Modular Gun, allowing players to choose which command inputs to assign to what modules.</li><li><strong>Lo-Rez Tokyo</strong> – The locations Misha explores in <em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> are all based on the real-world districts and neighborhoods of Tokyo. Famous landmarks and beloved streets are realized in a beautiful low-poly aesthetic that is inspired by the early days of 3D video games.</li><li><strong>Kanpai!</strong> – Between missions, Misha and her team have nomikai at a local izakaya in the Quarantine City. These sections will allow players to explore archives from the broken world of <em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em>, interact with the inhabitants of the Quarantine City, and drool over low-poly izakaya fare.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> is in development for <a title="Platforms > PC [20,139 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957360/NIGHTMARE_OPERATOR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>).

        <p><strong>The Four Main Girls of Fuwa Fuwa</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shiro</strong> – <em>“Um, please be the new manager of the cafe!”</em> A maid who loves Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. A huge otaku for anime and video games, she talks really fast when she’s gushing about the things she loves, and often splurges on merch without thinking whenever she visits an anime shop. A little clumsy, but works hard every day to become the cute maid she’s always wanted to be.</li><li><strong>Miyu</strong> – <em>“Hey Mr. <a title="Series > Mana [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, thanks a bunch for hanging out with me today~☆”</em> A game otaku and gyaru with a big appetite.

Is actually Shiro’s friend on the online game Magic Angel, so they knew each other before actually meeting in real life.</li><li><strong>Favna</strong> – <em>“I am the Slayer of the False God, the Queen of the Kingdom of Darkness, the All-Seeing Oracle, the Guardian of the Dream of All Things—“</em> A mysterious girl dressed in gothic Lolita fashion. Speaks in riddles and demands the protagonist become her familiar.

That there sounds like a job for our shrine!”</em> A girl with a Kansaiben dialect who works as a shrine maiden at her family shrine.

On top of that, she’s also the only glasses girl at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe!</li></ul><p><strong>Support Your Maid Cafe Employees as the Manager</strong></p><p>As the cafe manager, it’s your job to allocate work to your maids. Make sure to give the right girl the right job! For example, Shiro is always enthusiastic to serve customers, and Miyu is great in the kitchen.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just sit there while they work. During opening hours, you’ll also have to make coffee and help out on the floor, so it’s not as easy as it sounds!<br><strong>The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi</strong></p><p>In order to recreate the atmosphere of the real Nipponbashi, the game features several real stores you can find there, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among many others. Don’t forget to pay them a visit when you’re shopping or taking one of your maids on a date!</p><p><strong>Collectable Capsule Toys</strong></p><p>If you’ve been to the real Nipponbashi, you’ll know that there are capsule toy machines all over the area. In this game, you can also try your hand at collecting your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you’re getting. As you collect more toys, you can even bring them up in conversations with the girls. Keep cranking those machines until you’ve collected them all!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>INDIE Live EXPO 2024 Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Maid Cafe on Electric Street - INDIE Live Expo Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HZfDxFYT9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『電気街の喫茶店』Indie Live Expo紹介映像" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKFLDEv_3Kw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-school-shooter-lawsuit/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On the second anniversary of the Uvalde school shooting, two lawsuits were revealed, filed on behalf of the families of the victims against a weapons manufacturer – and Activision Blizzard. The families are being represented by Josh Koskoff, who has gone on record as saying, ‘There is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.’</p>



<p>Meta was also named in one of the lawsuits, but the bulk of the litigation is being aimed at Activision Blizzard as the publisher of Call of Duty and Daniel Defense, a manufacturer of the weapon used in the school shooting that left 22 dead and a further 21 injured.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-knowingly-exposed">‘Knowingly Exposed’</h2>



<p>At the heart of these lawsuits, which were revealed on May 24, sits a claim that Activision and Meta have joined forces with the weapons manufacturing industry to ‘reach’ young, impressionable people. That’s the damning claim set forth by Koskoff in a statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that the gun industry and Daniel Defense didn’t act alone. They couldn’t have reached this kid but for Instagram. They couldn’t expose him to the dopamine loop of virtually killing a person. That’s what Call of Duty does.</p>



<p>(Meta and Activision Blizzard) knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him to use it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Call of Duty has been set forth as a root cause or a figure of blame for a tragic school shooting. In 2012, the Sandy Hook shooter – who also ran rampant in an elementary school – was accused of being obsessed with video games, particularly Call of Duty. It was a few years ago that <a href="https://www.koskoff.com/in-the-news/sandy-hook-families-achieve-historic-victory-holding-gunmaker-accountable-for-role-in-school-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Josh Koskoff successfully led a legal campaign</a> against Remington, the manufacturer of the weapon used in <strong>that </strong>shooting.</p>



<p>Activision Blizzard published an immediate response to the lawsuits, stressing that they were sympathetic to the ‘horrendous and heartbreaking’ events that took place in Uvalde in 2022, but ‘Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.’</p>



<p>That has long been the argument in favour of violent video games. When Donald Trump took to a podium in 2019 to ‘take a firm stance’ <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-suggests-video-games-blame-mass-shootings-n1039411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">against violent games</a> like Call of Duty, communities worldwide were quick to highlight that there are two billion gamers, many of which play violent games, and the research indicates that said games <strong>aren’t </strong>influencing them to go on vicious rampages armed with assault rifles.</p>



<p>If the lawsuit is successful against Activision Blizzard, the claims that these games are ‘knowingly promoting dangerous weapons to millions of vulnerable young people’ could have dramatic ramifications against the industry. From Fortnite to Grand Theft Auto, and from Rainbow Six to Battlefield, real-world weapons are replicated in thousands of video games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cod-black-ops-6-ps4-xo-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will reportedly also release on the last-gen consoles, including the PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Some days ago, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of rumors</a>, Activision officially announced a new entry in the Black Ops series - no subtitle, just Black Ops 6. Aside from releasing later this year on the current-gen consoles and PC, Tom Henderson from Insider Gaming now also reports that the shooter will be released on last-gen consoles, in a similar fashion as last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023-that-familiar-feeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, retailer GameStop <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1794089299589132780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had listings for the game, mentioning an SKU for PS4 as well</a>. Although there doesn't seem to be a separate Xbox One SKU, Henderson writes that the Xbox Series S|X version is a cross-gen version, which will also work on Xbox One. "Insider Gaming has been able to verify with multiple sources that the image is legitimate and that Black Ops 6 will be coming to past-generation consoles", Henderson writes in his article.</p>
<p>As for when Black Ops 6 will launch, outlet The Verge reports that the title is slated for a late October 2024 release. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by Insider Gaming, this likely means that the shooter is dropping on October 25 since the 18th of October would be considered mid-October.</p>
<p>More details about this year's Call of Duty entry will be shared during a special Black Ops 6 Direct broadcast, which will take place immediately after <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's Xbox Showcase on June 9</a>. "<em>Like our double-feature last year with Starfield Direct, immediately following the Showcase we’ll be airing a special deep-dive into the next installment of a beloved franchise", Microsoft wrote last month. "We can’t say much, so for now we’ll call it the Xbox Games Showcase followed by [REDACTED] Direct. This will also be our first Showcase featuring games from our portfolio of studios across Activision, Blizzard, Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios, in addition to titles from our third-party partners.”</em></p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as more information about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 comes in.</p>

Its nomer has now become a misnomer.</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">The new roomisode features the eponymous Dangeresque’s counterweight Dangeresque Too as he fights the fickle stubbornness of elevator doors using adventure game logic. That’s all I got, about the new episode, so here are the bullet points from the release:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"> <li>Um, more puzzles</li> <li>Uhh, more cutscenes</li> <li>More entertaining ways to die</li> <li>Single click interface!

 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">As legend has it, <em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode </em>came out in 2008 around the time of the blockbuster <em>Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People</em>.

 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">It’s really good! If I can talk real here, the fact that Videlectrix squished down the point-and-click formula to fit in one room (later three) is quite the design flex. Take that, doors. We don’t need you.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">The new Roomisode, <em>Roomisode X</em> was teased way, way back a few months ago when my life peaked and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-brothers-chaps-of-homestar-runner-fame-talk-about-videlectrix-and-the-future-of-good-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed the Brothers Chaps</a>. That was a fun time. Let’s all reflect on that for a while.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"><em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate </em>is available on PC and Linux. <em>Roomisode X</em> should have been glued on there by now.</p>

Both suits arrive on the two-year anniversary of the shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School. The documents claim that Activision, Meta, and Daniel Defense each took part in "grooming" the gunman to be a mass shooter.</p><p>Activision and Meta are being sued, essentially, for the roles the documents allege they played in promoting the gun used in the shooting to 18-year-old Salvador Ramos. The Uvalde families are being represented by lawyer Josh Koskoff, best known for reaching a $73 million settlement with the maker of another AR-15-style rifle that was used in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting.</p><p>“Daniel Defense is a predator but can’t get to the prey without the help of these other third parties,” Koskoff says.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/uvalde-1716591211262.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The families of Uvalde shooting victims are suing Activision, Meta, and Daniel Defense. (Image credit: Wu Xiaoling/Xinhua via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></output><p>Ramos allegedly bought the gun a week before the shooting, just 23 minutes after his 18th birthday, the suit alleges. Koskoff argues that this came months after he started playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which, according to the lawyer's account, began a spiral of the teenager becoming obsessed with guns. The gun that Ramos did end up purchasing, a DDM4 V7, was featured on Modern Warfare's opening title page, the lawsuit says.</p><p>“Within a week of downloading Modern Warfare on Nov. 5, 2021, the shooter’s phone indicates a growing obsession with weapons and accessories associated with the game," Koskoff says, according to the NYT. </p><p>The suit goes onto allege that, by December 2021, Ramos was looking into Daniel Defense, reasearching what models he might use, and making several Instagram posts about weapons. In the process, Koskoff claims, the teenager was "targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense."</p><p>"This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it," Koskoff says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Daniel Defense is a predator but can’t get to the prey without the help of these other third parties.</p></div><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uvalde-shooting-families-wrongful-death-lawsuit-meta-activision-daniel-defense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, Koskoff added that Instagram created a "connection" between the gunman and the gun manufacturer.</p><p>"And nobody exploited Instagram for this purpose more than Daniel Defense," he said. "If Instagram can prevent people from posting pictures of their private parts, they can prevent people from posting pictures of an AR-15. And of course, Instagram doesn't care. They don't care. All they care about is driving traffic and generating attention, drawing attention and getting their ad revenue."  </p><p>Meta and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to IGN's request for comment. When reached by IGN, Activision issued the following statement:</p><blockquote>The Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.</blockquote><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has also issued the following statement, more broadly addressing violence in video games:</p><blockquote>We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence. At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies. Many other countries have similar rates of video gameplay to the United States, yet do not see similar rates of gun violence.</blockquote><p>The new lawsuits come just days after the same 19 Uvalde families <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uvalde-school-shooting-settlement-texas-city-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached a $2 million settlement</a> with the Texas city, in which they were also represented by Koskoff. They also announced a number of new lawsuits against the Texas Department of Public Safety officers and Uvalde's school district, including one $500 million suit against nearly 100 state police officers. </p><p><em>Thumbnail credit: Wu Xiaoling/Xinhua via Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24164311/activision-meta-lawsuit-call-of-duty-uvalde-shooting<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The families of the victims killed in the Uvalde, Texas school shooting are suing Meta and <em>Call of Duty</em> developer Activision over allegations that they promoted the use of firearms to underage boys. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24688821-uvalde-families-vs-activision-and-meta?responsive=1&amp;title=1">The lawsuit claims</a> both companies “knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him to use it.” It’s the kind of claim we’ve seen unsuccessfully thrown at video game companies numerous times in the past.</p><p>The complaint was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday on behalf of around 45 family members. As noted in the lawsuit, the families accuse Activision and Meta of “grooming” young men and putting them on a path toward violent acts. On May 24th, 2022, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, killing 21.</p><p>The lawsuit says that the gunman played <em>Call of Duty </em>“obsessively, developed skill as a marksman, and obtained rewards that become available only after a substantial time investment.” It also claims that the game features the AR-15 used in the shooting. At the same time, the lawsuit alleges that “the shooter was being courted through explicit, aggressive marketing” on Instagram that showed “hundreds of images depicting and venerating the thrill of combat.”</p><div><p>“Activision should stop training and habituating kids to kill”</p></div><p>In addition to Activision and Meta, the families of the Uvalde victims are also suing Daniel Defense, the gun company that made the AR-15 used in the shooting. The lawsuit alleges Daniel Defense promotes its weapons to minors on Instagram through posts “glorifying” combat. Meta’s rules <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/09/facebook-gun-sellers-10-strikes/">theoretically</a> ban companies from selling guns on its platforms, though, and the gunman purchased the AR-15 from Daniel Defense’s website — not through Instagram. </p><p>Section 230 immunizes platforms from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262248/supreme-court-rejects-stuart-force-facebook-section-230-lawsuit-algorithms">civil lawsuits such as these</a> if they arise from posts made by their users, though things are a little more complicated in cases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23889747/facebook-biased-ad-algorithm-aclu-court">where a platform’s targeted advertising</a> is the primary issue. Meta didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p><p>“Companies like Instagram and Activision do more than just allow gun companies to reach consumers — they underwrite and mainstream violence to struggling adolescents,” wrote Josh Koskoff, the attorney for the Uvalde families. “Instagram should stop enabling the marketing of AR-15s to kids by gun companies; and Activision should stop training and habituating kids to kill. It’s that simple.”</p><div><p>Video game companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17082832/video-game-industry-esa-trump-meeting-violence-school-shooting-controversy">have long pushed back</a> on the idea that video games can cause real-world violence, something <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754793/trump-gun-control-video-games-violence-republicans-no-evidence-dayton-el-paso-texas-ohio">politicians have often claimed following mass shootings</a>. However, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/stanford-researchers-scoured-every-reputable-study-link-between-video-games-gun-violence-politics-mental-health-dupee-thvar-vasan/">research has shown</a> that video games don’t cause violent acts, and lawsuits targeting video game companies for the actions of other school shooters have failed.</p></div><p>In a statement provided to <em>The Verge</em>, Activision’s head of corporate communications Delaney Simmons writes: “Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.”</p><p>Koskoff previously won <a href="https://www.koskoff.com/in-the-news/sandy-hook-families-achieve-historic-victory-holding-gunmaker-accountable-for-role-in-school-massacre/">a $73 million settlement</a> for the families of Sandy Hook school shooting victims from gun manufacturer Remington.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The book takes fans on a frame-by-frame journey through the expansion's seven bosses and The King's Leap challenge arena. Delicious Last Course also introduced Ms. Chalice as a playable character and numerous new NPCs who will likely be featured in this art book.</p><p>If you've played Cuphead, you know the level of detail on display in each of the game's inventive boss battles. The DLC actually has as many frames of animation as the base game, despite it only comprising about 25% of the full Cuphead experience. The Art of Cuphead, which focuses on the base game, is a fascinating, must-have book for fans, so we'd expect The Art of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course to provide a similarly insightful look inside Studio MDHR's creative process.</p><p>Along with frame-by-frame animation of the bosses you can find in The Delicious Last Course, this book contains early concept art as well as unused ideas.</p><p>With Amazon's preorder price guarantee, you'll get The Art of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course for the lowest price offered between the time you order and release.
