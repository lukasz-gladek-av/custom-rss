			<p>ASTRO BOT is a game that took the world by storm when it was released, giving plenty of fun nods to the expansive history of PlayStation while you get to play as ASTRO BOT, who first made an appearance in The Playroom, with ASTRO BOT being a sequel to Astro's Playroom. It's now been confirmed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and Team ASOBI that a new free update will be released for ASTRO BOT on December 12 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET, which adds a little bit of content to the game. There will be a brand-new level for players to explore, as well as new special bots for you to rescue, much like you had to in the previous levels.</p>
<p>However, to be able to access this update, you need to have completed the game first. "Since we want it to remain a little surprise, we will not say too much, but you should expect a fun-filled level with shiny presents, a good dose of jingle bells, and brand-new special bots to add to your crew!" says Studio Director Nicolas Doucet.</p>
<p>While the update isn't as big as the previous one they added to the game, it's nice to see that they are still adding content to the game, especially due to how beloved it is. Across multiple award ceremonies, ASTRO BOT has been the receiver of awards and many nominations, with the game already winning five awards. The Game Awards will be taking place on Friday, where they are nominated for a whopping seven awards this year.</p>
<p>When it comes to the audience they had in mind for this update, it's been confirmed by Doucet that there is no sort of trickery and challenges involved, and it's just meant to be a good time had by all.</p>
<p>"This winter update was made with every user in mind, meaning it is a celebration enjoyable for children and adults alike. So, no hair-pulling challenge this time! We had a lot of fun making this special present for you all, and we hope you enjoy it very much, too."</p>
<p>For more details about the update, you can check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a> post, which is where they announced the new content coming to the game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/golf-with-your-friends-2-brings-more-golf-madness-next-year.1057887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/golf-with-your-friends-2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 has announced&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 multiplayer minigolf game&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends</em>, and it's due out sometime next year.</p>

<p>While the first game was developed by Australian studio Blacklight Interactive, development work on the sequel will be handled by UK-based developer Radical Forge. As you'd expect from a sequel,&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>will bring new courses, new gameplay mechanics, and more.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/GolfWYF/status/1866845983797022820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post on social media platform X</a>, Team17 and Radical Forge say the game will introduce cross-platform multiplayer, so you'll be able to play it with your friends no matter where they're playing, as well as a "cross-platform level editor" to help you share your crazy golf creations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/golf-with-your-friends-2-announced-course.jpg?itok=seuMr0kW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/golf-with-your-friends-2-announced-course.jpg?itok=_QwGfoK0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>will bring new courses and more next year.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these features,&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2</em>&nbsp;will also bring a new "hazardous weather system" that sounds like it'll throw a spanner in the works, as well as "improved physics" and more. It sounds like this'll be exactly the kind of sequel you've been expecting if you're a fan of the first game.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new customization options for your golf balls, as well as rewards you can accrue through the game's XP system. It doesn't sound like it'll be a live-service game, though, so it's unlikely you'll need to pay real money to unlock anything.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give much away, but it should get you hyped to play another installment in this franchise.</p>




<p>If you want to check out the original&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends&nbsp;</em>ahead of the sequel's release, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/431240/Golf_With_Your_Friends/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/235061" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/golf-with-your-friends/9N14G09PWG74" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/golf-with-your-friends-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

In <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Aardman-Team-Up-for-Exciting-Collaboration-Coming-2027">a press release</a> about the collaboration, TCP marketing and media VP Taito Okiura described it as “a dream partnership for Pokémon.” Aardman’s managing director Sean Clarke added that it was both a huge honor and privilege to be tasked with presenting the Pokémon world in a new way.</p><p>“Bringing together Pokémon, the world’s biggest entertainment brand, together with our love of craft, character and comedic storytelling feels incredibly exciting,” Clarke said. “Aardman and TPCi share an emphasis on heritage and attention to detail as well as putting our fans and audiences at the heart of what we do, which we know will steer us right as we together create charming, original and new stories for audiences around the world.”</p><p>Aside from the projected release year, there aren’t all that many details about what the collaboration is or how we’ll be able to consume it. Clearly, stop-motion claymation will be involved, but what’s less obvious is whether this will end up being a movie, a series, or perhaps a game — which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJuoDhPDfE">wouldn’t be a first for Aardman</a>. This sort of team-up makes a lot of sense for TCPi after the success of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a><em> </em>and surprise delights like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24017505/pokemon-concierge-review-netflix"><em>Pokémon Concierge</em></a><em>. </em>And the closer we get to 2027, it’s feels like there’s a very strong chance this will be something that has people buzzing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’re about to drop a Hellstorm missile on the enemy position!</p><p>Of course, you can only equip three of the best scorestreaks in <em>Black Ops 6,</em> and choosing which selection out of the game’s arsenal proves difficult at first glance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-team-of-the-year-promo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Another season, another TOTY. The EA community picks their favorite eleven players for the men’s and women’s professional games each season, culminating in the best promo each game. EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo beckons, and we have everything you need to know.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ea-sports-fc-25-tactics-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 25</a> has a ton of promos each game. Gone are the days when Team of the Week is the main course from which to pull cards. Now, EA’s soccer titles have a new promo almost every week. But it doesn’t matter how cool the designs get or how special the cards are, there’s one promotion to rule them all—Team of the Year. </p>



<p>We are fast closing in on 2025, and TOTY kickstarts the year off with a bang. It doesn’t matter if this is your first TOTY or your tenth, check out the latest details regarding the promo.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-ea-fc-25-toty-release-date">Do we Know the EA FC 25 TOTY Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>EA FC 24 was stacked. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>There is no official start date for EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo; however, if we look at FIFA 23 and FC 24’s TOTY start dates, the first round of cards go into packs on the <strong>third Friday of January</strong>—although there are five Fridays in January 2025. So, you can probably expect to start your TOTY card hunt on either <strong>Friday, Jan. 17, 2025, or Friday, Jan. 24, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The Goalkeeper and Defenders, Midfielders, or Attackers are released for a couple of days, then another position gets 48 hours to shine, and the final set of players goes last. After everyone gets their turn, it’s time for a week-long pack hunt as the entire Team of the Year is put into packs and crashes the market.</p>







<p>We expect the EA FC site to have a <strong>dedicated Team of the Year Promo Vote page</strong>—like every year—<strong>allowing you to vote for the eleven players you feel have earned their spot in the best XI</strong>.</p>



<p>A ton of nominees are decided before the official TOTY announcement. You have the difficult choice of choosing one player for every position, and this is done for the Men’s and Women’s TOTY. The winners are eventually announced, showing you who earned the much sought-after spots.</p>



<h2 id="h-potential-ea-fc-25-toty-nominees">Potential EA FC 25 TOTY Nominees</h2>



<p>It’s been another year of incredible football around Europe and the rest of the world. EA FC 25’s TOTY vote is expected to be fiercely contested, and this is only fair when you’re dealing with potential game-breaking cards rated 95, 96, 97, and maybe higher!</p>



<p>Here are our predictions for who we think is in contention for EA FC 25’s Team of the Year promo.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toem-2-promises-more-monochrome-photography-shenanigans.1057851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish studio Something We Made has announced&nbsp;<em>Toem 2</em>, a followup to its 2021 monochromatic photography puzzler, and it's currently in the very early stages of development.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the game right now, but Something We Made is promising a "brand new adventure" that's all about "documenting the world's little wonders", so it sounds very much like the sequel will be following in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/toem" rel="nofollow">the original game</a>'s footsteps.</p>

<p>It looks like <i>Toem 2</i>'s visual style will also be an upgrade over the original; while it'll sport the same monochromatic color scheme, the graphics seem to have been improved, and it seems as though the new game will adopt a more traditional 3D perspective as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=BFcetWiX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=-z3YFmQt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>looks like it's taking a slightly different visual direction to the original.</figcaption></figure><p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "uncovering little details" in the game's world, and you'll also be "helping friends along the way", so it sounds like you'll be taking on photography requests just like in&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't have a release date or even a release window for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>yet; Something We Made says the game is in very early development right now, so it could be a few years before we hear from this one again.</p>

<p>While you wait, you can check out the teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It shows off what the game's art style will be like, but (understandably given the game's stage of development) it doesn't give too much away beyond that.</p>




<p>If you didn't check out the original&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>, it was a low-key cozy photography game in which you took on a variety of tasks given to you by a range of quirky characters.</p>

<p>The original game is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM_A_Photo_Adventure/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/toem/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/toem/9n7zcllr01b3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/toem-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

But another thing it is, on PC at least, is buggy. I’ve had a bunch of freezes, which suck, but worst was the moment when companion Gina just refused to follow her script, and my game—which offers no way to manually save—was softlocked. But, it turns out, there’s a rather hidden feature that got me out of trouble!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Searching around on the worldwide information superhighway, I know I’m not alone in hitting an issue with Gina’s AI in the Collapsed Hall section within Gizeh. While I’ve seen posts from others reporting it occurring in slightly different sections of the level, the problem remains the same: she just refuses to budge, and therefore doesn’t trigger an obligatory sequence of dialogue that’s required to let you continue. And that sucks too. </p><p>It sucks even more that without a quicksave, nor even a manual save (why? <em>why?!</em>), the bug was locked in already at the point the game had last saved for me. Jumping into a pit caused Gina to wake from her stupor and wail at my demise, but then she was back, catatonic, staring at a wall when I miraculously revived. I felt completely stuck, no way to get out of this pickle. Until I saw mention of a “rollback” option.

The standard pause screen has an option to “Restart Checkpoint,” which is useless if you’re in a similar situation. However, if you instead choose the bizarrely titled “Quit Game,” which does in fact <em>not</em> quit the game but takes you back to the main menu, you’ll see an option called “Game Slots.”</p><p>Yes, I know, that’s the section for picking which of the three concurrent versions of the game you want to play in, and yet, yes, this is where the secret is hidden. It’s like finding an ancient artefact in a mysterious tomb! Because tucked away at the bottom-left of the screen is text that opaquely says, “Save Rollback.” </p><p>This odd terminology hides a little menu that contains the three previous checkpoint saves that occurred before the current one (there’s no clear explanation of this, but none of them is the most recent), letting you jump back in time to an earlier moment. The times they’re labeled with are not clock times, but rather indicate how long you’d been playing, so you’ll be able to see how many minutes of progress you’re about to lament repeating—in my particular case it was only about five minutes, although it involved solving a boring mirror puzzle for a second time, complete with unskippable cutscenes.</p><hr><p>I’m so relieved this feature is in the game, given otherwise I’d have lost 10 hours of progress and likely never bothered playing again. But it remains a mystery greater than any Indy ever investigated why you can’t just manually save for yourself.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked.1057842/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan, the souls-like game from Nexon, has had its release date leaked by the reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-et-de-nouvelles-informations-sur-le-jeu-the-first-berserker-khazan-59763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>.</p>



<p>According to the leaker, the game will be released on March 27, 2025. He also said that the official announcement will be made tomorrow at The Game Awards 2024. Pre-orders will start immediately after the event.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the game will be sold 10 dollars lower than usual, going for U$60. I had the opportunity to test a closed beta of the game and I had the impression that the title was ready for release.</p>



<p>During my playthrough, all I got was the feeling that it needs some slight balancing adjustments, given that some enemies can destroy the protagonist with two hits. The bosses, even the initial ones, were extremely challenging, and I’m a veteran of the genre. It’s a similar feeling to the first NiOh, with the first demo on the beach.</p>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is set in the DNF universe. As the subtitle suggests, the game stars Khazan, a legendary general who ended up being betrayed by the Empire. The narrative sets the general on a journey of revenge.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled for release on PS5, PC and Xbox Series. Unlike other Nexon games, this title will be single-player focused.</p>

<p>An Astro Bot Christmas DLC has been announced featuring some new obtainable bots, which will only be available for those who have already completed the game.</p>



<p>The surprise announcement came courtesy of a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog post</a>.</p>



<p>It reads, “Since releasing&nbsp;Astro Bot&nbsp;earlier this year on PlayStation 5, we have been submerged by lovely comments from you and the PlayStation community, and we are delighted with the critical response to the game all over the world. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much for showing your appreciation. It truly means a lot to us.</p>



<p>As our way of saying thank you, it is my pleasure to announce that a whole new piece of free additional content is coming to Astro Bot. Indeed, the little robotic elves of Team Asobi have been very busy preparing a whole new level called Winter Wonder, which will be coming live on Thursday, December 12 at 6:00 pm PT*”<a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54186391130_c9f9d33e07_h.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>

Crusade, in the year 1937. Players take on the iconic role of Indiana Jones as they try to stop evil forces from obtaining a power known as The Great Circle.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://indianajones.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_video_games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lots of Indiana Jones video games over the years</a>, and The Great Circle is the first title for console since Lego Indiana Jones 2 in 2011.</p><p>Also in the interview, Reilly shared more insight on how Lucasfilm interacts with game developers working on its properties. "We don't tell the teams how to run development. We don't tell them how to run their day-to-day of the business," he said.</p><p>For The Great Circle, Lucasfilm was involved in making sure the game "looks, feels, [and] sounds like Indiana Jones," and that included approving the casting of Troy Baker as Indiana Jones himself.</p><p>"Between the work MachineGames did in representing him physically and the absolutely stunning work Troy has done voicing the character, you forget it's not Harrison when you play it. He's that good," Reilly said.</p><p>Whether or not another Indiana Jones game from MachineGames or anyone else gets made likely has to do, in part, with the commercial success of The Great Circle. Microsoft doesn't typically announce sales numbers, and the fact that The Great Circle is also on Game Pass doesn't make it easy to understand how the game is performing. On Steam, The Great Circle is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listed as a top-seller </a>and has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2677660/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached 12,000 concurrent players there</a>. It is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/top-paid/games/xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not inside the top 500 games on Xbox's top paid games list</a>, but there are plenty of reasons for why this could be.</p><p>The Great Circle began development prior to Microsoft's acquisition of MachineGames via its buyout of parent company ZeniMax. Making The Great Circle exclusive to Xbox at launch is expected to amount to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-being-an-xbox-exclusive-means-millions-in-lost-sales-microsoft-believes/1100-6515976/" data-ref-id="1100-6515976">millions in lost sales</a>, Microsoft has said. The Great Circle is scheduled to come to PS5 in Spring 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-trailer-showcases-fun-features/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Donkey Kong Country Returns HD trailer has been released by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-series-developer-monolith-soft-is-now-fully-owned-by-nintendo/">Nintendo</a>, and it showcases some of the content that players can expect from this nostalgic journey. This game was originally released on both the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo 3DS, with the 3DS having extra levels. In this new visually-enhanced version of the game, those levels will be included, and as a result, there are 80 levels across nine different worlds for players to explore. For those interested in getting this game, it will be available on Nintendo Switch on January 16, 2025. For a glimpse into what's to come, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="A barrelful of details on Donkey Kong Country Returns HD! (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/skNFOPOiyYw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game has lots of fun details for those who are completionists, as there are secrets and collectibles to gather, as well as a Time Attack medal, which will require the player to be quick on their feet, especially when it comes to facing off against the boss battles at the end of each world.</p>
<p>Much like many other Donkey Kong games, players will also be able to play this game in local co-ops, allowing you to play with a friend or family member, where your teammate can play as Diddy Kong and give you a helping hand.&nbsp; By having Diddy Kong help you out, you will be able to utilize his jet pack, which can be used for some of the more challenging jumps in the game, as well as to fight off enemies using his peanut popgun.</p>
<p>When the game was first released for the Nintendo Wii, it was proven to be quite challenging. In this remastered version of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, you will have the option to choose between Classic Mode, which is the difficulty it was at originally, or playing using Modern Mode if you need a bit of a helping hand and want an easier experience.</p>
<p>Of course, it's completely up to you whether you play this game solo or with a friend, and you are still able to succeed just using Donkey Kong's Ground Pound and Barrel Roll.</p>
<p>For those interested, you<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOooFtowm_VZ2XeH0f79at3njXQb3iRlhA9zoLIZEmBbGY991JSvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> can currently pre-order the game</a> now for a price of $59.99, with the game set to release on January 16, 2025.</p>

Jim B helps V out on this treasure hunt by providing images that point players in the right direction, complete with card-based puns.

Quest designer Maria Mazu then created the Balatro quest for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-22-fully-revealed-and-its-out-now">Patch 2.2</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Some time ago, I asked the Quest Design team at CDPR: “You liked the Cyberpunk cards in Balatro?

                <p>The festive season is here, and as is tradition, people have dusted off their ugliest sweaters to help celebrate this jolly time of the year. Over at Microsoft, employees are getting into the swing of things with an ugly sweater that celebrates one of the <em>ugliest</em> moments of Xbox history: the infamous red ring of death that plagued the Xbox 360 early in its console lifecycle.</p><p>In addition to a power button that can display both the green and the crimson symbols, the sweater also has an interesting arrangement of green and yellow stripes. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318401/microsoft-has-created-an-xbox-360-red-ring-of-death-ugly-sweater" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, it's only currently available to Microsoft employees through the company's store, and stock has already sold out.</p><p>Anyone who owned an Xbox 360 early on likely experienced a red ring of death hardware failure, as this was a widespread issue that turned the console into a paperweight. This was a major problem for Microsoft at the time, and in the 2021 web series Power On, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-explains-how-the-red-ring-of-death-happened/1100-6499059/" data-ref-id="1100-6499059">the company explained how it happened</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2d6IMBS8oY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2d6IMBS8oY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Leo Del Castillo, a member of Xbox's hardware engineering group, the red ring of death was caused by connectors inside the console's components that broke as a result of rapid heating and cooling. This problem--combined with thermal and stress issues in the Xbox 360 related to its soldering balls--eventually resulted in bricked consoles.</p><p>Microsoft's solution at the time was to repair and return the affected Xbox 360 at no cost to the consumer--an expensive fix that became a "1.15 billion dollar problem" according to former head of Xbox Peter Moore. Future hardware revisions of the Xbox 360 mostly managed to prevent this issue from occurring, and successor consoles like the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S haven't faced any major hardware failures on this scale.</p>

			<p>The base PlayStation 5 is more than capable of emulating PlayStation 3 games at a hardware level, a new test confirms.</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LowestLogan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowest Logan</a> on YouTube showcases a test conducted using an AMD BC-250, a mining card that features the PlayStation 5 silicon, most likely created by repurposing chips that did not meet the full specifications required by the console, complete with 16 GB of GDDR6 RAM. The card, however, has some limitations over the actual PS5 hardware, as two CPU cores have been disabled, and only 24 compute units are available over the total number of 32 units.</p>
<p>To get the AMD BC-250 to run games like the PlayStation 5 hardware it is based on, Lowest Logan had to overcome plenty of challenges, as both Windows and Linux distros did not run properly. After some experimenting, however, the YouTuber managed to get everything up and running and has tested some PlayStation 3 games via the excellent RPCS3 emulator, proving the claims that PS3 emulation is too computationally heavy for the PS5 are false. Both Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Little Big Planet ran well at both native and higher resolution, keeping steady framerates even with some of the hardware limitations over the actual PS5, including memory limitations, as the GPU driver only saw a single memory clock state for the GPU, 450 Mhz, which put it on the same level of an RX 480 GPU, a much weaker card than the RX 6700 GPU the PS5 GPU is close to. So, even with a lot of performance left on the table, the current generation console is more than capable of running PlayStation 3 games.</p>

            <p>The team behind Italian Soulslike Enotria: The Last Song has finally found some resolution to the game's Xbox absence.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, back in March developer Jyamma Games said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-avoiding-elden-ring-dlc">would not be releasing its game on Xbox</a> in order to ensure "a superior experience for PC and PS5 players". At this time, it was suggested the studio would reassess an Xbox release once the game had launched elsewhere, and the Enortria team went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enotria-the-last-song-ceo-apologises-to-xbox-community-for-a-choice-that-was-forced-to-make">apologise to the Xbox community for this delay</a>.</p>

<p>However, if we fast forward to September, things get a little more involved. The developer announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-indefinitely-on-xbox-as-dev-says-its-being-ignored-by-microsoft">delaying Enotria: The Last Song's Xbox release indefinitely</a>, claiming Microsoft had "decided to ignore us" as it attempted to navigate certification.</p>
<p>When this comment was picked up further, Microsoft went on to apologise to the developer for this apparent oversight. An Xbox release of Enotria: The Last Song was back on the cards. But, when for?</p>
<p>Well, we now have an answer to that question. Enotria: The Last Song will be coming to Microsoft's platform very, very soon. In fact, it arrives tomorrow, 12th December.</p>
<p>"We bring great news for our Xbox players," the team wrote on <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1866521654765265387">social media</a>. "Enotria: The Last Song is finally ready to be released on [Xbox Series X/S]." Hurrah!</p>

<p>Enotria: The Last Song has been inspired by Italian folklore, and while its setting is dappled in Mediterranean sunlight, there looks to be plenty of darkness lurking within.</p>
<p>"The world has been gripped by the Canovaccio - a twisted eternal play that keeps everything in an unnatural stasis," the game's description reads. "You, Maskless One, are the only one without a given role and master of your destiny. Defeat the fearsome Authors that created it and free the world from stagnation, by harnessing the power of Ardore."</p>
<p>Will you be giving it a go on its Xbox debut?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-series-developer-monolith-soft-is-now-fully-owned-by-nintendo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xenoblade Chronicles series developer Monolith Soft is now fully owned by Nintendo, as the Japanese company has reportedly purchased the remaining shares of the company it did not previously own.\</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton</a>, the development studio's <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/company/#overview">official website</a> confirmed that now Nintendo is the only owner. The studio, which was founded in 1999 by Xenogears' creator Tetsuya Takahashi after he left SquareSoft, started a prolific partnership with Nintendo with the release of Xenoblade Chronicles on the original Wii, which led to Nintendo eventually purchasing 80% of Monolith shares from Namco in 2007, which were further increased to 96% in 2011. The remaining 4% shares were owned by founders Hirohide Sugiura, Tetsuya Takahashi, and Yasuyuki Honne.</p>
<p>Given that Nintendo already owned the Xenoblade Chronicles developer, today's news shouldn't really impact the developer in any major capacity. Besides working on their franchise, Monolith Soft also supported the development of other Nintendo games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, so the studio has been an integral part of the development process for many first-party Nintendo titles for some time.</p>
<p>Monolith Soft's next game will be&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, a new version of the open-world role-playing game originally released on Wii U in 2015. Launching on March 20th, 2025, the new version of the game will come with updated visuals as well as an alternate version of the post-credit scene featuring a mysterious hooded figure, which could finally tie the game with the rest of the series.</p>

        <p>A shadowy and sonorous 2D platformer - try the demo, eh</p>

            <p>
In "non-violent and poetic" 2D platformer Symphonia, you're an extremely fancy violinist exploring a realm of musical machines, where gas lanterns kindle fitfully as you approach, crotchets adorn vast cogwheels, and reams of what I really hope isn't actual catgut feed through titanic pegboxes overhead. Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits. <!--more-->
</p>
<p>
"Superbesque!" I breathed, watching myself casually tear off a violin solo to magic open a door. "Magnifissimos!" I sang, watching myself artfully bounce my violin bow off the floor and catch it to double-jump. "Bravanche!" I honked, watching myself evaporate against some spikes. While it's not a metroidvania, the cavernous, lamplit, whirring set-dressing puts me strongly in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and the eternally-forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Here's a trailer:

<p>
And here's some backstory: the aforementioned very fancy violinist is Philemon, who must gather the members of an orchestra and restore vitalising music to a world that has fallen into deathly silence. The levels and backdrops are a phantasmagoric, almost Cubist portrayal of instruments collapsed together into halls and shafts - I am keen to see more of them. Hollow Knight aside, it all reminds me just a little of Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> and Oddworld, which probably aren't the parallels developers Sunny Peak are going for. I mean, I assume there isn't an abbatoir level, but perhaps that's where they get all the catgut. </p>
<p>"Each area in Symphonia has its own distinct feel and characters, and each room is hand-crafted," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865960/Symphonia/">the Steam page adds</a>. "Meet prodigious musicians and try to convince them to join the orchestra."
</p>
<p>
And then there's the score, a bespoke piece of classical romance music, written by composer Olivier Esman and his partners Alexandre Bucas-Français and Lou Corroyer. As regards the demo, at least, it's gently synched to your progress, with certain actions triggering the next movement. You'll also perform full-arsed concerts at intervals that are dedicated to a particular section of the orchestra - Strings, Brass and Woodwinds. I deduce from this that the game has a three-act structure.
</p>
<p>
Symphonia is out... now! And feels like a good festive pick if your idea of festive is a soothing melange of velvet, mahogany and candlelight. And spike pits. Here's some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYN1d3f2dc">Disney's Fantasia</a> to wash it all down.

<p>Ubisoft has released new combat gameplay for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and has deep-dived into the combat mechanics.</p>



<p>Ubisoft uploaded the gameplay as part of a new Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog update</a>, but YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AssassinRaptor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JorRaptor</a> has compiled all of the clips into one quick YouTube video.</p>

<p>You can read the full blog update on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft website here</a>. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shaodws was delayed from its intended November 15 release to February to give its developers time to polish the game. An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal memo from Yves Guillemot</a> said that the delay was to “to offer an optimal experience from launch on all platforms and various PC configurations, and to remove the small frictions we typically used to address in post-launch title updates.”</p>



<p>Following the delay, Marc-Alexis Côté announced, </p>



<p>“Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a dream project for us; finally bringing the series to Feudal Japan with many features developed with our community in mind, such as parkour or the renewed stealth, brought by new technology, all set in a beautiful and immersive world.”</p>



<p>He continued, “As such, we’ve made the decision to postpone the release date to February 14, 2025. The game will be released on a broad range of platforms, including Steam at launch. Additionally, preorders will be refunded and all future preorders will be granted the first expansion for free.”</p>



<p>At the time of the delay, it’s understood that Assassin’s Creed Shadows pre-orders were strong, but behind that of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla which also release on past-generation consoles and thus, had a large market to release to.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches February 14, 2024 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>
