		<p>Enotria: The Last Song won’t be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a> at the same time as PS5 and PC, developer Jyamma Games has announced, as they struggle to get access to the game’s Microsoft Store page. The game will still launch as planned on 19th September for PS5 and PC, but the Xbox Series version is indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p>“We understand how disappointing this news is to the Xbox community,” the team writes. “Unfortunately, despite our best efforts and the hard work of our dedicated team, we’ve encountered challenges that have delayed our release on the Xbox platform. We want to emphasize that this is not a decision we’ve made lightly.</p>


<p>“We apologize for any disappointment this may cause and sincerely thank you for your understanding and patience. As a self-published indie studio, your support means everything to us, and we are dedicated to bringing Enotria to as many players as possible.”</p>
<p>In a follow up statement to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/enotria-xbox-release-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, Jyamma Games CEO Giacomo Greco revealed that it’s not a technical issue with the game on console, but rather not being able to access the game’s Microsoft Store page. The studio has been going back and forth with Xbox support staff, but is still unable to access the store backend and submit the game for release.</p>

<p>It’s truly a bizarre situation, and one that I’m sure Microsoft will work to resolve now that it’s getting headlines and public attention.</p>

<p>Enotria is the latest game to set foot into the arena of the Soulslike, carving out an intriguing setting with inspiration from Italian mythology and scenery as you venture forth and battle the Authors, trying to put an end to their eternal play, Canovaccio.</p>

		<p>Survival horror action RPG Graft has been announced by Harebrained, the studio behind the Shadowrun Trilogy and the mech-tastic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/04/24/battletech-review/">Battletech</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="GRAFT by Harebrained — Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhQZYJkfe8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blending survival horror with action RPG isn’t just a change of pace for a studio best known for turn-based action, but it’s an interesting change of pace for this style of game. One of the key mechanics is that you can tear pieces from enemies to add them to your own person and abilities – “Every Graft brings with it some piece of its previous owner’s identity, changing more than just your physical body,” reads the blurb, in an exploration of the Ship of Theseus tale from Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Set in a post-cyberpunk sci-fi setting, you must escape the Arc, a continent-sized station that is falling apart as its biomechanically enhanced citizens go a bit loopy, scrabbling around for resources. There are other survivors trying to escape as well, and you can forge certain alliances with them (or stab/be stabbed in the back by them), and as you explore, you’ll fight strange experiements that have been unleashed, and the agents of an AI gone insane that are stalking you.</p>

<p>Harebrained – formerly known as Harebrained Schemes – is best known for their Shadowrun trilogy of RPGs and the turn-based tactical mech action of Battletech, but a defining chapter in the studio’s history came with the disappointing release of The Lamplighters League last year. A 1930s pulpy spin on turn-based tactical action, it launched in a poor state, leading to &nbsp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/02/the-lamplighters-league-review/">low review scores</a> thanks in part to technical hitches, and sales were then so poor that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/12/paradox-interactive-writes-off-the-lamplighers-league-as-a-22-8-million-flop/">Paradox wrote down the game’s development and took the financial hit</a> – the studio also faced significant layoffs before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/17/harebrained-schemes-going-independent-from-paradox-interactive-after-lamplighters-league-flop/">Paradox and Harebrained came to an agreement</a> to let the studio go back to being independent at the start of this year.</p>

			<p>Following an earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/graft-is-harebraineds-new-game-slated-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tease</a>, Harebrained has now unveiled its next game, a 'post-cyberpunk' survival horror RPG titled GRAFT. In development for PC (it will be released on both Steam and the Epic Games Store), it is themed around the idea of morphing the player character's body and what it does to them.</p>
<p>In GRAFT, players navigate a crumbling, continent-sized space station known as the Arc, where the remains of a once-advanced civilization now lie in darkness and decay. As a survivor in a dying world, you must scavenge and graft parts from enemies to transform and enhance your abilities.<br>
Each graft not only alters the player character's physical form but also infuses them with fragments of its previous owner's consciousness, creating a mix of survival, transformation, and self-discovery - all while battling monstrous abominations.</p>
<p><iframe title="GRAFT by Harebrained — Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhQZYJkfe8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's an overview provided by Harebrained:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Arc is rich with forgotten technologies and unsettling wonders. Traverse massive chasms, labyrinthine techno-catacombs, and self-replicating corridors in search of a way out. Master these ancient mysteries and uncover the secrets that lie within.</li>
<li>Survival is not just about fighting the horrors that lurk in the shadows. It's also about navigating treacherous relationships with other survivors. Form alliances, build trust, and face the reality that anyone still alive can be both an ally and a threat. Your choices will shape your journey and determine the fate of those you encounter.</li>
<li>Engage in visceral survival horror combat against ancient experiments, monstrous abominations, and relentless agents of a demented AI. Manage your resources and choose your battles wisely to stay alive as you make your way through the dangers of the Arc.</li>
<li>Your evolving body is a powerful weapon. With each Graft you acquire - whether ripped from enemies or found hidden in the depths of the Arc - you gain new abilities and powers. But each Graft carries with it fragments of its former owner's identity, shaping your memories, your impulses, and even your very self. Every choice you make will have a profound effect on who you become.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is currently scheduled to launch in 2026, so it'll be a while before we see a long gameplay video. Meanwhile, stay tuned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-major-temtem-update-arrives-extensive-patch-notes-revealed.970893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-temtem-update-18<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The final&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>update (outside of smaller maintenance patches in future) has arrived, and it's bringing a ton of changes to the game's economy, as well as its fundamental gameplay mechanics and more.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-microtransactions-updates">revealed back in March</a>, this update, which is version 1.8, will be the final big update for the game. In essence, from now on,&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>will be in maintenance mode, meaning that while it will still get updates, they'll be focused mainly on fixing bugs and keeping things operational.</p>
<p>Since it's the last update for the game, though, the patch notes are basically a massive blowout of changes, mostly focused around making&nbsp;<em>Temtem</em>'s economy functional from a single-player, offline perspective.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temtem-update-1.8-walking.jpg?itok=zLhr-FXj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temtem-update-1.8-walking.jpg?itok=R61vsVUF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>has received its final update, which may also be its biggest.</figcaption></figure><p>Big changes include a Store that's no longer Premium or rotating; it's now a permanent collection of cosmetics, all of which you can buy with the in-game Feathers currency.</p>
<p>You can now select any Tamer Pass from any previous&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>Season,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-reactivation"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>-style</a>, and work towards any Pass you choose. You'll also be able to switch between all of them whenever you like.</p>
<p>It's now possible to skip animations during combat, a change that Crema says it hasn't "agreed with for a long time". Despite that, Crema says that since this update is aiming to make&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>a "kinder, more enjoyable" experience for players, animations are now skippable.</p>
<p>Other big changes include being able to see when Temtems will evolve, eggs hatching faster, and boosted loading times, plus lots more. You can check out the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://crema.gg/temtem/patch-1-8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/745920/Temtem/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/temtem/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/temtem/9MVXZMRQXHSF" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/temtem-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Crema's time with the game may be over, but its time in the&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>universe certainly isn't; the studio is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-swarm-announced-mashing-together-pokemon-like-creatures-and-survivors-style">currently working on</a>&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style game&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm</em>, which is due sometime later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

However, things are more perilous than they initially seem, and before long our plucky heroine finds herself investigating an apparent murder instead. Released on August 15, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Crimson Diamond</em></a></span><em> </em>is a brand-new adventure game from developer Julia Minamata, and it is exceptional. With its design, Minamata excavates a once-common element of early adventure games that has long fallen by the wayside, dismissed as if it were no longer of any value. However, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>brilliantly demonstrates that, when used effectively, this device can actually enhance our connection to a game. Let me explain.<br></p><p>When you think of adventure games, chances are you think of point-and-clicks, games in which all of your interactions with other characters and the environment are done by clicking. Whether you click on verbs in the lower part of the screen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as in early SCUMM games</a></span> or have more minimal interfaces like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/R0caHaL8l0w?si=VpnRAdYlkgWi0Y2h&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/R0caHaL8l0w?si=VpnRAdYlkgWi0Y2h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many adventure games since the mid-90s</a></span>, the game is designed so that every interaction can be navigated and every puzzle can be solved with nothing but a few clicks of the mouse. This style of play became so common that the term “point-and-click adventure games” practically became synonymous with adventure games as a whole. However, once upon a time there were many great adventure games that you interacted with through a text parser, typing in specifically what you wanted your character to do. <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>brings this back, and uses it to brilliant effect.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195301,196345" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h344171"><a id=""></a><strong>In defense of text parsers</strong></h2><p>Now, I think some see text parsers as outdated, a necessity of early adventure games that was largely abandoned when something “better” was devised. However, I’ve often thought that if a game is designed intentionally to make good use of a text parser, it can really open up the possibilities for ways in which you can think about interacting with the world and the situations the game presents you with. I’ll give you one example from my own memory. When I was young, I played the brilliant Sierra game <em>Space Quest 2</em>. A 1987 release, this game saw Sierra still very much in its text parser era, and at one point, I became completely flummoxed. I knew I had to dive into a deep pool of water and swim to safety, but every time I tried, I’d run out of air before I could get anywhere, and wound up dying one of those horrible, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/sierra-adventure-games-funniest-deaths/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/sierra-adventure-games-funniest-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notorious Sierra game deaths</a></span>. (Speaking of those, here’s a video I found featuring <em>Crimson Diamond </em>creator Julia Minamata talking about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/2lyaoydIKY0?si=yECem__6p01EY3GU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/2lyaoydIKY0?si=yECem__6p01EY3GU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some of her personal favorites</a></span>!)<br></p><p>Try as I might, I couldn’t figure out how to progress. I had to quit the game and go to school the next day, still stuck at that one spot, and all day long, it was all I could think about. Finally, in some class I no longer remember, I was hit by inspiration. “What if I take a deep breath first?” Once the idea struck, I absolutely couldn’t wait to get back in front of my computer to try it. An eternity of hours later, I typed it in, and it worked! (Watch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/APpxIyL8yhk?si=yVYXckCmXG7blpVY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/APpxIyL8yhk?si=yVYXckCmXG7blpVY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone else struggle with this same puzzle</a></span>, though not for nearly as long as I did.)<br></p><figure id="" data-id="369270fa35ca193989e738e91e2f2b70" data-recommend-id="image://369270fa35ca193989e738e91e2f2b70" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of The Crimson Diamond shows the redheaded protagonist in a rustic lodge room, while another woman sits at a nearby table.

You wouldn’t have to think about the situation, and arrive at the possibility on your own.<br></p><p>Now, don’t get me wrong, there are tons of great adventure games that use graphical interfaces. Many of my personal all-time favorites in the genre are pure point-and-clicks, and I don’t think one approach is inherently better or worse than the other. But playing through <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>gave me a new appreciation for how the very limited and specific options those interfaces provide can also limit how you think about the situations in which you find yourself.<br></p><p>When a game gives you a text parser, however, there are no baked-in limitations, no guardrails. If you can think it, you can at least try it. There’s a good chance the game won’t understand you or allow you to do it, but nevertheless, you’re thinking about the situations you’re in in a fundamentally different way than you do when a game limits you to clicks. Throughout my time with <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, I repeatedly found myself trying things that a standard point-and-click interface simply wouldn’t allow for. I was constantly asking characters <em>about </em>specific things, and interacting with the environment in more thoughtful, deliberate ways than I often do in an adventure game. And because I had to think clearly about what I was doing, I felt much more absorbed in its mystery.</p><h2 id="h344172"><a id=""></a><strong>Using classic elements to create something wonderfully new</strong></h2><p>However, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>is not simply a new game in the mold of classic text-parser adventures. Its closest cousin is perhaps 1989’s <em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em>, a Sierra game that, like <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, is an Agatha-Christie-style murder mystery featuring a colorful cast of characters, with a young woman as its unlikely heroine. But despite being presented in gorgeously vivid EGA graphics and sporting a text parser, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>also feels wonderfully modern. </p><p>For one thing, it gives you a notebook that always indicates what you need to do to advance the story, and so the plot generally hums along at a compelling pace, and you’re unlikely to ever get completely stuck for long periods of time the way players often do in adventure games. (There’s also an online hint book, which, wonderfully, lets you first unlock gentle nudges in the right direction before viewing the whole solution, just like the best real adventure game hint books of the past did.) Importantly, however, you never have to consult Nancy’s notebook if you don’t want to, and while you can complete the game by simply following the tasks it lays out for you, that will hardly get you the best result.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="aa81bdda7ac724f7eac09b0af690db61" data-recommend-id="image://aa81bdda7ac724f7eac09b0af690db61" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nancy stands in a wonderfully colorful boudoir, while another woman sits at a vanity.

In other words, only real detective work will reveal the true intricacies of the plot that some nefarious person or persons are hatching in Crimson. I admit, I wasn’t as successful in my first playthrough as I would have liked. Some secrets stayed buried, and things ended on a sour note between my Nancy and one of her friends at the lodge. However, at the end the game helpfully gives you nudges about areas in which you could have done better, so if I give it another go, I have some clue as to where I should focus some extra attention in untangling its mystery.<br></p><p>And that mystery is a banger, twisty and surprising, while also tackling some big, important themes, like who profits–and who suffers–when land is exploited for its natural resources. Crucially, the game is never hamfisted or preachy about these concerns. They’re woven organically into the plot, and all the drama is kept at a human level, as Nancy interacts with each of the game’s colorful cast members, all of whom have their own desires and motivations.<br></p><p>Finally, remember those notorious Sierra deaths I mentioned? Well, <em>The Crimson Diamond </em>definitely won’t kill you at every opportunity like those games, but it does have seven deaths to discover (and an achievement for each one!), giving you one more reason to poke at its limits and find every possibility you can. My jaw dropped in shocked glee the first time I stumbled upon a death, which came complete with a Sierra-style text box playfully quipping about my demise. I wound up finding five of them in my playthrough. Someday I’ll come back to <em>The Crimson Diamond</em>, both to more thoroughly solve its central mystery, and to find those other two deaths. More than an homage to early adventure games, this is a thrilling game in its own right, and an encouraging sign that the future of adventure games may be as bright as its heyday. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234777/microsoft-apple-cloud-gaming-app-store-changes-xbox-cma<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050430/apple-app-store-game-streaming">started opening up</a> its App Store to game streaming services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now, freeing them from being restricted to web apps on the iPhone and iPad. Despite multiple changes to Apple’s App Store guidelines this year, Microsoft and Nvidia have still not published native cloud gaming apps for iOS, and Microsoft is now detailing exactly why.</p><p>Microsoft already said earlier this year that Apple’s cloud changes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">don’t go “far enough” for Xbox</a>, but in submissions to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6d0d19084b18b95709f13/Microsoft_WP_6_Redacted_version_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED__1_.pdf">Microsoft now argues</a> that Apple’s changes in January, March, and April to its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines">App Store guidelines</a> (section 4.9 and 4.7) aren’t enough for it to operate a native Xbox Cloud Gaming app on iOS at all.</p><p>“Microsoft identified a number of other provisions in Apple’s Guidelines that continue to limit its ability to distribute and operate a Cloud Gaming iOS native app (namely Guidelines 2.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.6, 3.1.1, 3.1.2(a), 3.1.3(b), 3.2.2(i), 3.2.2(ii), 4.2.2., 4.2.7(e)),” said Microsoft in a filing to the CMA in late July. </p><p>Microsoft claims that Apple’s guidelines “still represent an obstacle to Cloud Gaming native apps” because it apparently can’t comply with them, both technically and economically, if it incorporates third-party games into its Xbox Cloud Gaming service on iOS. Microsoft specifically calls out <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#multiplatform-services">Apple’s requirement</a> for multiplatform services, like Xbox Cloud Gaming, to make all content, subscriptions, and features available within an iOS app as an in-app purchase (IAP):</p><div><blockquote><p>In fact, Apple’s IAP commission fee is set at a level that is neither economically sustainable nor justifiable. The 30 percent commission fee makes it impossible for Microsoft to effectively monetize its cloud gaming service offering, given that Guideline 3.1.3(b) prevents different content, subscriptions or features (including consumables in multiplatform games) being offered to iOS users (as compared to the content, subscriptions and features offered on other platforms).</p><p>As observed by the CMA in its Mobile Ecosystem market study, the 30 percent fee imposed by Apple on IAPs is the result of a lack of competition in the distribution of native iOS apps.</p></blockquote></div><p>Microsoft also claims third-party game developers would need to recode their games to comply with the IAP requirement. </p><p>Microsoft also takes issue with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business">Apple’s 3.1.1 guideline</a>, which prevents iOS app developers from linking outside to enable the purchase of subscriptions. Apple provides an exception for “Reader” apps, but cloud gaming apps don’t qualify for this exception. Apple argues in its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf">filing with the CMA</a> that it has “never approved a gaming app to take advantage of the Reader Rule,” so it says app developers shouldn’t be calling into question its approach to in-app purchases in the context of cloud gaming.</p><p>The CMA is currently carrying out a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming">market investigation</a> into mobile browsers, browser engines, and the distribution of cloud gaming services through app stores in the UK. It has identified a number of possible remedies to address competition concerns around cloud gaming apps on mobile devices, including potentially requiring Apple to enable cloud gaming native apps to operate on a “read-only” basis with no in-game purchases or subscriptions so that games don’t need to be re-coded. </p><p>The CMA is also considering requiring Apple and Google to allow cloud gaming service providers to incorporate their own in-app payment systems, and potential requirements for Apple to amend its guidelines to remove elements that may contain technical restrictions on cloud gaming apps.</p><p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf">Apple argues</a> that it supports cloud gaming via web apps, and even cites two <em>Verge </em>articles that cover <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979290/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-ios-ipad-performance-improvements">Microsoft’s improvements to Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> performance on iPhone and iPad and that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23423668/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-20-million-people-streamed">more than 20 million people</a> have used Xbox Cloud Gaming. “It is notable that while CMA cites Microsoft’s concerns in the Working Paper, Microsoft has chosen not to engage with Apple on cloud gaming apps since Apple’s changes to the Guideline,” says Apple. “This lack of engagement comes despite Apple’s affirmative outreach on new opportunities and tools for cloud gaming apps on iOS.”</p><p>Apple also argues that developers “...generally are not having difficulty with the IPA requirement” and then cites Antstream, a small app developer that launched the first iPhone game streaming service in the App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183027/antstream-emulator-apple-iphone-retro-games-ipad-streaming">earlier this year</a> with more than 1,300 retro titles from Atari, Amiga, and Nintendo consoles. Apple helped Antstream with subscription optimizations, editorial frameworks, and even public relations review and guidance for its launch announcement.</p><p>The CMA has set a deadline for all parties to respond to its market investigation for this month before it plans to publish a provisional decision report in November. There will then be plenty of time for Microsoft and Apple to continue arguing between November and December, ahead of a final report in either February or March next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You need:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>x2 Mucus-Slick Eggs (Dropped by Echo of Varshan)</li><li>x2 Shard of Agony (Dropped by Grigoire the Galvanic Saint)</li></ul><p>Alternatively, if you wish to increase your odds of receiving Godslayer Crown, spend the additional resources necessary to summon the Torment version of Duriel:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>x6 Mucus-Slick Eggs (Dropped by Echo of Varshan)</li><li>x6 Shard of Agony (Dropped by Grigoire the Galvanic Saint)</li><li>x1 Stygian Stone (Dropped by bosses in The Pit in World Tier 4)</li></ul><h2 id="h22730"><a id=""></a><strong>How to summon Echo of Andariel</strong></h2><p>For Andariel, the summoning process is similar to Duriel, albeit with unique materials and a different location. You must head to Hanged Man’s Hall in Kehjistan while playing in World Tier 4, where you’ll find a summoning altar. You require:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>x2 Sandscorched Shackles (Dropped by Lord Zir)</li><li>x2 Pincushioned Dolls (Dropped by The Beast in the Ice)</li></ul><p>Like Duriel, you may also summon a Tormented version of Echo of Andariel to increase your chances of a unique drop. You need:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>x6 Sandscorched Shackles (Dropped by Lord Zir)</li><li>x6 Pincushioned Dolls (Dropped by The Beast in the Ice)</li><li>x1 Stygian Stone (Dropped by bosses in The Pit in World Tier 4)</li></ul><h2 id="h22731"><a id=""></a><strong>Godslayer Crown affixes</strong></h2><p><strong>Affix 1</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>+28-42 All Stats</li></ul><p><strong>Affix 2</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>+638-873 Maximum Life</li></ul><p><strong>Affix 3</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>+50-67.3 Damage to Elites</li></ul><p><strong>Affix 4</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>8-8 percent Cooldown Reduction</li></ul><p>Welcome to the end game! Running through various Nightmare Dungeons, The Pit, and the countless bosses in search of rare resources—which will help you run additional bosses for Mythic Uniques—is the gameplay loop once you reach level 100. Once you acquire Godslayer Crown, you’ll find the process easier to manage!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft was apparently responsive at first before going radio silent on the developer.</p><p>  <em>Enotria </em>is one of a number of recent and upcoming Soulslikes that try to take the punishing, stamina-meter-based combat pioneered by FromSoft and push it in new creative directions.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t work the other way around for current Xbox owners, and increasingly it seems like they are missing out even on things that should be multiplatform at launch. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-heights-could-be-the-climbing-game-i%E2%80%99ve-always-wanted.970797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/new-heights-climbing-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Around Aftermath’s launch, I wrote about climbing game <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-jusant-gets-rock-climbing-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jusant</em></a> and lamented that, as much as I liked it, it wasn’t quite my ideal climbing game. In the comments, a few of you recommended an early access game called <em>New Heights</em>, which I will admit I completely forgot about until my buddy <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/12/rock-climbing-changed-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Serrels</a> reminded me of the game on Twitter recently. I played it a bunch over the holiday weekend, and while it has some flaws and is still in development, it feels a lot like the climbing game of my dreams.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179440/New_Heights_Realistic_Climbing_and_Bouldering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Heights: Realistic Climbing and Bouldering</em></a> is, let’s face it, not a terribly sexy title, and it’s not a terribly sexy-looking game, with only one character model and a less-than-eye-catching visual style. There’s no storyline or mountaineering narrative; instead, the game is mostly its complicated mechanics, where you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_solo_climbing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free solo</a> routes of various difficulties by using your left and right mouse buttons to control each hand, mouse+shift to control each foot, and WASD, Q, and E to control your weight placement and body positioning. You climb real world locations that include rock faces and boulders, but also what I found to be a slight over-abundance of ruins and old buildings, though you might be more keen on those location choices than I am.&nbsp;</p><p>I put all this sort of negative stuff up front to explain why it might be an easy game to make assumptions about and skip, especially in the crowd of early access. But you totally shouldn’t miss it, especially if you're a climber.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="New Heights: Climbing &amp; Bouldering - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_NuocVSVII?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Once you wrap your head around the controls, which you can practice in a tutorial area styled like a climbing gym, you’re set loose to do what honestly feels the most like actual climbing of any climbing game I’ve played. The quality of your holds and hand and foot placement is indicated by directional arrows that change color depending on your grip direction and body placement. Too much bad positioning, indicated by yellow or red arrows as opposed to green, will start to drain your stamina meter until you fall. To deal with all this, the techniques that worked for me are the ones that best work for me in real life: bringing my feet up high, shifting my weight around, keeping my body close to the wall. Unlike other climbing games where you just navigate between holds or perform dramatic mid-air moves<em>, New Heights</em> requires full awareness of your virtual body and a careful, systematic approach.</p><figure><figcaption>My left foot should probably lower in that crack, though (Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>It's fascinating to experiment with turning a bad hold into a good one (or vice versa) by moving my body around, and I found myself thinking and navigating much the way I would in real life–with the added bonus that the character is much stronger and seemingly taller than me, letting me climb things I can only dream of in real life. Long climbs feel like thoughtful, harrowing adventures the way my favorite roped routes do, with safer areas and sketchier areas, and the bouldering routes are surprisingly tough, the way bouldering often is. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__zh9KFt9aI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speed-based</a> leaderboards whose scores tempt me to think about how I can improve my climbs, and even a <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/connors-world-dynoing-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dyno</a> mechanic that’s thrilling to execute in the middle of a route. Routes of different levels feel meaningfully harder from each other, and there are player-created <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2179440/workshop/?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">areas</a> and <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-to-create-your-own-routes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routes</a> as well.&nbsp;</p><p>There are places where the simulation falls short, as perhaps it must for something that must be <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-we-created-our-climber-1-the-animated-approach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>so</em></a> <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/how-we-created-our-climber-2-using-active-ragdolls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complicated</a> to make work. The physics bugged out on occasion, twisting my character into horrifying shapes or letting my limbs clip through the wall. I couldn’t do some things that feel instinctive for real life climbing–in one route, I wanted to do something with my foot on an <a href="https://hardclimbs.info/what-is-an-arete-in-climbing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arete</a> that the game couldn’t simulate, and it doesn't quite seem to know what to do with <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/how-it-works-the-mantle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mantling</a> or moments where you end up on flat ground mid-route. Moves I would use in real life, like <a href="https://philarockgym.com/climbing-techniques-what-is-flagging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flagging</a> or <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/blog/connors-world-how-to-dropknee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drop knees</a>, felt more like screwing around to see if I could recreate them than vital techniques. One of the biggest challenges, as some Steam reviewers note, is that the <a href="https://newheightsgame.com/blog/nature-is-beautiful" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">textures</a> don’t always correspond to the quality of a hold: something will look like a ledge or grip only to not be, which means finding a good hold is sometimes less a matter of using your eyes and more wagging your mouse around until an arrow turns green.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fun fact: I can do this in real life (Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>But a lack of certain realism in a game that touts realism isn’t a dealbreaker for me. As I wrote about <em>Jusant</em>,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When I imagine what I think a “true” climbing game would be, I inevitably conjure up some kind of inelegant, <em>QWOP</em>-esque nightmare that would force you to navigate foot and hand placement, limb tension, stamina, pathfinding, and your own emotions in a way that couldn’t possibly be fun, much less technically possible.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Developer Wikkl Works seems to recognize the challenging boundaries between what’s realistic, what’s technically possible, and what’s fun. In real life, I would have hooked my foot around that arete, but in a game, controlling ankle movement and simulating using the top of the foot instead of the bottom would be a nightmare for both player and programmer. <em>New Heights</em> picks the right things to get technical about–your contact points with the wall and your whole body’s position in relation to them–to make a game that simulates so much of the strategy and feel of climbing while still simplifying things enough to be approachable and, crucially, enjoyable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a sadly lapsed climber who’s struggling to get back into shape, <em>New Heights</em> gave me so much of the pleasure I get from real climbing. It manages to be realistic without being overly fiddly or complicated, and what it lacks in visual or narrative flair it makes up with through a clear love of climbing and the places where you do it. I’m excited to see how it keeps developing through early access and so glad I took a chance on it. If you’re a climber, I think you’ll have a blast with it; if you’re not, it might give you something like a taste of one of my favorite sports.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Set between the first and second trilogies of the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ace-attorney-investigations-collection">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a> follows fan favourite Miles Edgeworth as he investigates a string of increasingly wild cases. Combining the original game with it’s never before released in the West sequel, the colllection has Edgeworth joined by series mainstay Detective Dick Gumshoe and newcomer (and Great Thief) Kay Faraday, the trio find themselves quickly involved with wider overarching plots involving smuggling and corruption.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ace Attorney Investigations Collection - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLFMaakr_xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout you’ll run into a host of characters from the main series, which is a mixed bag to say the least. On one hand, some excellent characters that deserved more time to shine or develop get exactly that. On the other, some of the most irritating characters from the Ace Attorney canon get to return to bother you, and Edgeworth is just as disappointed to see them return as I was.</p>


<p>We do get to enjoy more of the buddy comedy double act that is Edgeworth and Gumshoe working together though. The chemistry between the two and Kay is absolutely incredible as well, while the primary antagonist (but not villain) Agent Lang is a superb character as well. So, I guess I can’t explain too much when there’s this much great character work on display.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between this spin-off duo and the main series is the lack of courtroom shenanigans. Far from being a problem, the lack of these parts helps the narrative flow far better, with everything lining up far smoother. The result is that the stories of these games are arguably the most coherent of the series, displaying the clever ‘whodunnit?’ style writing well and giving the twists greater payoffs than ever.</p>

<p>This contributes to the gameplay feeling smoother too, as instead of the harsh transitions between investigation and courtroom, the cases are segmented into smaller narrative chunks that flow into the next towards a natural conclusion each time. Largely though, the main components of the gameplay are investigating crime scenes and listening to testimonies from other characters – business as usual for Ace Attorney fans.</p>

<p>The investigation segments allow Edgeworth to wander around areas to examine them rather than the visual novel style of the main series. Certain spots allow you then to examine in greater detail, and even choose spots that conflict with your evidence to Deduce why contradictions might exist there. As a great little quality of life feature, the game tells you when you have fully investigated a spot. This shouldn’t feel like a big deal, but it absolutely is, believe me!</p>
<p>The main purposes of these investigations are to find evidence and clues for the cases. The evidence, as well as the deductions in investigations, is used in Rebuttals. These function the same as Cross Examinations from the main series, with the player presenting evidence to expose contradictions in the testimony of the character, complete with pressing statements for more information and presenting evidence with the trademark “Objection!”</p>
<p>The clues, however, are more like vague nuggets of information or questions posed by Edgeworth or other characters during the investigations. These are used in the new mechanic, Logic. This is by far my favourite addition in these games and allows Edgeworth to reach new reasoning by combining gathered information, which can result in new items of evidence or new directions of enquiry into the case.</p>

<p>The strength of the Logic system is that it’s easy to understand, and even easier to piece together, with only rare occasions in the whole collection where the link between the clues is unclear. That simplicity is what I enjoy about it. It encourages you to think about the information you currently hold without overly blocking your progress and keeps you moving towards the solution of each chapter’s mystery.</p>
<p>Another new mechanic for the second game is Mind Chess. This is a little more vague than Logic, and sees you playing a game with a witness or other person of interest to gain information. It takes place as a conversation with the character where you need to decide when to go on the attack or remain silent based on the behaviour of the opponent.</p>
<p>If the character is aggressive, you can bide your time in silence until they calm down and let slip information you need to proceed. Oh, and as added fun, you’re timed in these sequences and mistakes take a chunk out of your remaining time. This is the closest these games get to the obtuse nonsense of the main series, and can be frustrating, but once you get into the swing of it, it’s a great little back and forth challenge.</p>
<p>Both of these new mechanics are enjoyable though and really work to diversify the gameplay beyond what would otherwise simply be point and click. I wouldn’t say that they’re as interesting mechanically as say the Magatama or Mood Matrix from the main series, but they definitely add flavour to the investigations, and – of course – they also make sense with Edgeworth’s character at this point in the overall series timeline.</p>

<p>This two game collection has remastered visuals, with the option to use the original pixel art character sprites if you would prefer that, if with the inconvenience that you can only do this from the main menu. For the most part, I would recommend going with the enhanced visuals, as the core cast look great in this updated style. It only starts to fall apart with some of the side characters who have the odd animation or facial expression that just doesn’t look right but that doesn’t overly detract from the visuals.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is absolutely incredible from beginning to end, as you would expect from the Ace Attorney series, with those classic Ace Attorney sound effects thrown in as well to add that little bit of familiarity around these new settings. The song in this game for when you have a witness on the ropes during a Rebuttal especially is exquisite, especially in the remixed version used in the final showdown.</p>
<p>One final feature to praise is the Story Mode, which removes the puzzles and let’s you just enjoy the story of the two game. Also, as is standard for these collections now, all of the music tracks in the game, plus a load of concept art and all that fun behind the scenes stuff, is all available in the Gallery. More things get added to this as you go, with in-game achievements also to be found during gameplay that you can view from the main menu, though I’d advise against viewing those until you’ve finished the games to avoid spoilers.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ace Attorney Investigations Collection finally completes the Ace Attorney series of remasters, and does so with possibly the best two games in the series! The move from the courtroom to the crime scene creates a far smoother and more cohesive narrative experience that really allows the twisting mysteries to shine like never before. Coupled with some excellent quality of life improvements, a bevy of bonus content, and some enjoyable new mechanics, it would be a crime to not indulge in this collection.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review-law-order.970779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review-law-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has done solid work in getting all the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-review-few-objections">Ace Attorney</a> games out on modern platforms. No longer confined to a single handheld, they’re accessible to more people than ever before.</p>
<p>The latest release is the last in the collections to be made available - the aptly named <em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</em>, which includes both <em>Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth </em>and its sequel <em>Ace Attorney Investigations: Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>. Both titles were originally out on the Nintendo DS, so it has been some time since their release. <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> is especially notable because it’s releasing outside of Japan for the first time ever.</p>
<p>To that end, Capcom has seen fit to give these games a proper remaster treatment - redrawing the pixel-based sprites in HD, as well as the backgrounds for a modernized look with the game available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Having missed out these games before, I was keen on how different they might play compared to the courtroom trials of the mainline series. It’s lucky then that the <em>Collection</em> lets you get right to it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot01.jpg?itok=QUoLCZh1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot01.jpg?itok=ZIpDGqAC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Upon booting the menu, you have the option of choosing to start <em>Miles Edgeworth</em> or<em> Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>. As the latter is a sequel, it makes sense to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Right away, the game lets you choose from the original pixel style sprites from the DS version, or the updated HD ones created by the original character designer. It’s a nice touch having that option for purists’ sake.</p>
<p><em>Miles Edgeworth</em> starts off with the titular main character involved indirectly in a murder scene that took place in his very office. While we know Miles didn’t do it, the scene is immediately put into investigation as series detective Gumshoe helps assist, and Miles himself digs deep into unmasking the culprit.</p>
<p>I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising, what with ‘Investigations’ in the title, but right away it’s one of the main things you’ll be tasked with despite Miles being a prosecutor. He’s found a new role for himself by solving crimes out in the field, and much of the story is focused on how he gets roped into these messes - often as a target, and even as a suspect in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting turnabout, with much more agency placed on the story, and the larger and murderous plots at play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot02.jpg?itok=AJJQPuV4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot02.jpg?itok=DfaZI8OK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As with the other Ace Attorney games, <em>Miles Edgeworth</em> is presented in a visual novel format with a lot of reading, some point and click interaction during the investigation sections, and selecting choices to advance the plot while interrogating suspects. There’s even some gimmicks like recreating the crime scene in a simulation, and is something that puts Miles in more of a direct role, along with other new characters.</p>
<p>My only complaint is there’s no voice acting despite the modern updates. It feels a bit outdated in that aspect, but it’s ultimately a trade off for getting these games at all.</p>
<p><em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>, being a direct sequel, is fairly similar in game design to its predecessor. The story continues once again with Miles Edgeworth of course, but this time he finds himself in the middle of a presidential assassination plot.<br>
Right away, Miles is tasked with understanding the aims of the shooter, their identity, and the evidence of the gunfire. As the investigation continues, Miles finds himself caught up in a setup that eventually leads to some unexpected arrests.</p>
<p>The story is arguably more complex than it was in <em>Miles Edgeworth</em>, with Miles himself put under risk of losing his own badge, and having to further work with rivals to uncover the truth. I largely appreciated his role here because it gave him a lot of depth and nuance. It made me want to see his success to the end.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot03.jpg?itok=iYRiZMBq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aaichronicles-screenshot03.jpg?itok=Q7xWpC1H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>, several new gameplay elements have been added to the series’ usual visual novel presentation. There’s the usual investigation segments, including talking to suspects and searching for clues, but the former adds a new mechanic called Mind Chess.</p>
<p>Mind Chess is a game that Miles sets up when a suspect doesn’t want to testify. He will question them as always, but these timed segments rely on making decisions that metaphorically destroy the suspect’s chess pieces. Listen to what they have to say, and select the best option to press the truth out of them.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting mechanic that adds a bit of tension, and more layers to help uncover contradictions in testimonies.</p>
<p>The <em>Investigations Collection</em> has been updated throughout with an eye pleasing style that cleans up everything in HD. I found the sprites were especially standout, with the dialogue portraits and investigation items having more of a hand drawn look to them compared to previous games.</p>

<p>It’s a solid transition from the DS graphics in any case. The music is still there, and again, you can use the old pixel sprites if you really want. Overall it’s a great remaster, and even better that it’s the vehicle we finally get to play <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> in. With it finally here, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-review-few-objections">Ace Attorney collection</a> for the modern age is finally complete.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
The Ace Attorney Investigations is another great release from Capcom that brings Miles Edgeworth back in a starring role. Despite the lack of voice acting, the remaster captures the feeling of the series quite well. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

The annual event, in the German city of Cologne (or Köln to the locals), is the largest, most visited gaming exhibition in the world, dwarfing its nearest rivals, and has outlasted many alternative public and industry events. It adapted rapidly to covid, and became a successful online event when others wilted. And it somehow seamlessly combines a massive-scale industry event with an even more enormous public convention. So why is Gamescom so successful, where others struggle?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://abc7.com/e3-expo-canceled-electronic-entertainment-video-game-conventions/14174924/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://abc7.com/e3-expo-canceled-electronic-entertainment-video-game-conventions/14174924/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">E3 is officially dead</a></span>. It’s easy to blame covid, the cause of the Los Angeles event’s cancellation in 2020, 2021 and perhaps 2022, with the resulting demise and lack of online replacement leading to major publishers pulling out of 2023’s event until it was cancelled too. But really, its time had been up long before. For the majority of its life from 1995 to 2016, it was an industry-only event, and regularly pulled in 50,000 to 70,000 visitors (apart from during the bizarre decision to host it in an aircraft hangar in 2007 and 2008). Come 2017, as numbers and interest had begun to dwindle, E3 offered 15,000 public tickets at the same time as the number of exhibitors plummeted by a third. It was already looking very peaky before covid was even a factor.</p><p>Yet Gamescom, which delivers an industry event very similar to E3 (taking place in a monstrously large convention center that takes 15 minutes to walk end-to-end, with building-sized booths for major publishers decorated to match their games, and labyrinthine halls of business booths and meeting rooms), does this at the same time as offering a public exhibition that’s three times the size of PAX West. And add to this an opening night event featuring a wealth of massive-name exclusive reveals and trailers, hosted by the prince of gaming himself, Geoff Keighley. Which makes it all rather a big deal. And no diss to Germany, but it’s not exactly the first country that comes to mind when thinking about the games industry. So what makes Gamescom so persistently successful?</p><figure id="" data-id="a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-recommend-id="image://a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-format="jpg" data-width="1403" data-height="789" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-recommend-id="image://a7b9020c0ece9b86ead19f4ce514c786" data-format="jpg" data-width="1403" data-height="789" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Saint Geoff stares in wonder at Indiana Jones' release date." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Gamescom is a hybrid show,” says Tim Endres, the director of Gamescom, “that’s the USP.” He’s not talking about the combination of industry and public, but rather the overlap of in-person and online. And interestingly, this wasn’t something that began because of covid. In fact, the event had the jump on the virus by a full year, via the presence of the first instance of Opening Night Live in 2019. The flashy stage show that matches Keighley’s other annual ventures like Summer Games Fest and The Game Awards draws in an impressive live crowd (this year doubled to 5,000 people in the room), but a gargantuan online audience.<br></p><p>“This is the sixth year that we’ve been doing Opening Night Live,” said Geoff Keighley in a Zoom call the night before the event. Explaining why it has proved so successful, he stated, “Through the pandemic we were able to do a virtual show, and then come back live here at Gamescom. It’s really a global celebration.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-2024-record-number-of-exhibitors-internationality-and-global-reach&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-2024-record-number-of-exhibitors-internationality-and-global-reach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This year saw 40 million people tune in</a></span>—numbers any TV network would sell its soul to see—and it establishes the online presence of Gamescom in a massive way.

The Voldemort-like nature of the deceased event was an odd shadow during our chat, but I attempted to be more general when trying to understand why Gamescom survived the last few years. His answer: “Because we took place.” Endres primarily credits the incredible fortune of having gotten the show’s online nature established ahead of the global shutdowns in 2020 as a part of the reason for the event’s survival—they weren’t scrambling to try to invent some sort of last-minute digital version of their show, but rather building on an infrastructure that had already begun development. “We never cancelled, we never lost the contact to the community or the industry, so we were able to have a good pace for the restart after the pandemic.”</p><p>Boasting 1,400 exhibitors (E3 would hit 500 at its early peak) from 64 different countries, Endres says this makes the event the most truly international. It’s hard to deny this—I think back to U.S. events I’ve been to, where North American companies dominate the show floor,  international exhibitors scattered around them. In Cologne, there was still a massive American presence—especially in the form of Microsoft and Xbox—but unsurprisingly the European numbers were far higher. Fifty percent of trade visitors came in from outside the country. “That means the world’s here at Gamescom,” said Endres. It’s also true of public visitors, with 10 percent coming from outside the country, meaning over 30,000 people travelling to Germany for the event.</p><p>Microsoft’s enormous amount of floor space was striking, and made me wonder whether Sony and Nintendo might be getting left behind. “Of course we’d love to see them too at Gamescom,” said Endres. “We’re in constant [contact] with them, and if they don’t come one year, it does not mean it’s a decision for the future.”</p><p>But Gamescom is also spreading outward. In 2021, Gamescom Asia was established, an annual event in Singapore, and 2023 saw the first Gamescom Latam, hosted in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Interestingly, despite the existence of those regional events, those countries are also present at Gamescom in Germany, which perhaps makes sense given the different nature of the shows. Gamescom Asia, for instance, is predominantly a show about mobile gaming—a platform that doesn’t have a large footprint at the European show (with the odd exception of <em>Dark and Darker</em>). It also sees the other big players getting involved, with Nintendo having sent games to Latam, and PlayStation showing up for Asia.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-recommend-id="image://e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Gamescom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-recommend-id="image://e8bcbb287b86c076e731e76f5d2a604e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pokemon had a presence for the first time this year." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which all sets up a rather big, obvious question, doesn’t it? Gamescom is massively successful, has gained international recognition as the biggest gaming event in the world, and has survived where that other big name in industry trade shows has failed. That would leave one rather obvious region that Gamescom isn’t reaching, one that has a large void where an event used to be, loosely replaced by a digital-only event that happens to be hosted by Geoff Keighley…</p><p>“You <em>must</em> be looking at the United States,” I say. On my audio of the interview there’s then a long silence, before laughter in the room from a couple of onlookers. I then say, “For my recording, there was a slight shrug.” Endres laughs, called out on his presumably accidental body language, and then stammers toward the company line. “What we see at Gamescom is this massive increase in internationality here in Cologne, and it’s going to be the core event in Cologne, and we have a worldwide reach starting from Cologne, and then with our satellites we have a different reach. And Sao Paulo is not far from the U.S… But right now we’re focusing on making Gamescom Cologne bigger, and Latam and Asia bigger, and then we’ll see what the future brings.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The latest big PlayStation game, the multiplayer shooter Concord from developer Firewalk Studios, was a misfire upon release earlier this month and might have sold only 25,000 copies. [<strong>Update: </strong>Just over a week since launch, Sony has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">Concord will go offline and refunds will be issued</a>.]</p><p>GameDiscover.co analyst Simon Carless told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Concord likely sold 10,000 units on Steam and 15,000 on PlayStation as of the end of August. Concord struggling to sell would not be a surprise, as the game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">peaked at 697 concurrent players on Steam</a> and is <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/d0446d4b-dc9a-4f1e-86ec-651f099c9b29/6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently outside the top 100 best-selling games on PlayStation.</a></p><p>Circana analyst Mat Piscatella told IGN that fewer than 0.2% of PS5 active players were logged into the game on Monday, August 26. Liam Deane, an analyst at Omdia, told the website, "The Steam numbers are so bad that even without the exact data on the PS5 side we can be pretty certain that the game is doing very badly."</p><p>The analysts that IGN spoke with said Concord failed to move units and drive engagement due to a variety of reasons, including a lackluster marketing campaign, a relatively high price point ($40 USD), and a lack of stand-out features in a market already filled with similar types of games.</p><p>Midia Research analyst Rhys Elliott said Concord should have launched as a free-to-play game, or as part of the PlayStation Plus subscription catalog like Quidditch Champions is doing for its own launch today, September 3. Elliott pointed out that it's not too late, as Sony could add Concord to PlayStation Plus, but admitted, "The damage might have already been done. First impressions matter."</p><p>Concord is Firewalk's first game. It was in development for more than eight years, <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to lead designer Joe Weisnewski</a>. "Concord has so much humanity and depth to it. I really hope people give it a shot. Insanely proud of the game and we’re strapped in and ready to push it for years to come," the developer said.</p><p>Sony was at one point planning to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surpass-17-million-10-live-service-games-coming-by-2026/1100-6500204/" data-ref-id="1100-6500204">10 live-service games by 2026</a> but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cut the figure in half as the company outlined a plan to focus on quality over quantity.</a> Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online, once described as the developer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-title-ever-druckmann-says/1100-6510559/" data-ref-id="1100-6510559">most ambitious game ever</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">was canceled</a>.</p><p>According to a report, one of the last major decisions that former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan made was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were said to be upset by this, and the blame apparently fell on industry veteran Connie Booth. A 30-year veteran, Booth left PlayStation in October 2023, and no reason for her departure was ever provided. Some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/" data-ref-id="1100-6518727">she was fired.</a> Booth is now an executive at Electronic Arts.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-concord-early-and-what-time-it-unlocks/1100-6525754/" data-ref-id="1100-6525754">Concord Season 1: The Tempest</a>, launches in October--it adds a new character, new map, new variants, and additional cosmetics and rewards. It also introduces a new season of weekly cinematic vignettes that will further flesh out the narrative. Season 2 is scheduled for January, with Season 3 expected in April.</p>

The freemium title surpassed 13 million downloads when it was still in open beta and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/677620/charts/">delivered an all-time peak of around 68,000 concurrent players on Steam</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> roughly three years ago.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As interest in the project surged, developer 1047 Games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/1047-games-nets-100-million-to-expand-and-support-sci-fi-shooter-i-splitgate-i-">secured over $100 million in funding</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> via an investment that valued the studio at $1.5 billion. The company openly admitted that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "achieved a level of success that we could not have anticipated and that few indie games are fortunate to reach."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That acknowledgement, however, was bundled into a statement that confirmed the studio would </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-splitgate-i-receives-its-final-update-as-developer-1047-games-moves-to-its-next-project">no longer be supporting the shooter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Why? It&nbsp; had simply become too successful, too quickly. "We are, in a way, bailing water while also trying to keep everyone who bought a ticket to board our ship happy, while also trying to turn our boat into a rocket ship," added the company, back in 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time, 1047 Games said it was saying "see you soon" to the title rather than "farewell." Now, the company has returned with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a full-blooded sequel that features a new faction system, four versus four gameplay, and (quite naturally) loads of bloody portals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about how 1047 Games will ensure the sequel can go the distance, studio founder, CEO, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">creative director Ian Proulx says the company is now fully aware that "content is king."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="1047 Games boss hopes ">1047 Games boss hopes <span>Splitgate 2</span> will still be thriving in a decade</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I want [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] to be a game that people are playing in 10 years from now, on a much larger scale of course," says Proulx. "I think we had 200,000 concurrent players in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at our peak. Success to me would be more than that—and more than that in years from now."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proulx feels there wasn't a lot the studio could have done to sustain the original title because it ran out of runway. "We didn't have the resources [to support </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">]. We didn't have the tech," he says. "Our thought was 'we're going to have a bump in players. We're going to have have slow and steady growth over time.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Even if we knew [that wasn't going to be the case], there wasn't a whole lot we could have done about it. We were a very tiny team [of under 20 people]. So we were just fighting to keep the lights on with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To avoid a repeat, Proulx has been "obsessing" over what goes into delivering a "world class" live ops experience. The key, he feels, is making sure 1047 Games is ahead of the curve when launch day arrives. "[We have to be] ready technically, in terms of the servers. But also we need to be ready from a content perspective and make sure we have plenty of stuff to come," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We ask Proulx about his admission that developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was akin to bailing water out of a sinking ship. Elaborating, he explains 1047 Games struggled to convince </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players to stick around for more than a month—piling more pressure on a team that was already gasping for breath. The interest was there, but players didn't have a reason to properly engage with the shooter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Content is king," says Proulx. "That's one thing I learned for sure: players always want more. I'll put it this way: in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we saw players come in and play for around three to four weeks—and they'd have an amazing time and leave a good review—but after [that period] most players would run out of things to do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It took us around seven months to deliver a new season that had content. The way I'm looking at it this time is, step one, I need to make sure that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has enough content. Instead of three to four weeks being a typical play pattern, I need to extend that. Hopefully, to six, eight, twelve, twenty, thirty weeks. Whatever it is—I need that to be longer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's to give the team more time [to develop new content]. Then, by the time that number hits—because inevitably, it doesn't matter if you have the best game on the planet—by the time that happens we need to have delivered a major content update."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proulx explains the development team is putting a lot of "care" into how it defines small updates, medium updates, and large updates. He says those varying additions will provide a sense of momentum and notes a small update might be a "featured game" while a medium update could be a "new map." He envisions larger updates as full-blown seasons, but reiterates the team is still figuring out the details.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oua2iTVFbJI?si=anIOMUAFTQgN9t6U" height="150px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a technical level, Proulx is adamant </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> must be infinitely more scalable than its forebear, and says 1047 Games now has the personnel to make that happen. "Once we did get the funding [for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">], it forced us to think 'wow, there's a lot we could do if we could do it all over again,'" he says, comparing the original to a "school project" that was pushed beyond its limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We thought] wouldn't it be nice to redo these things? Wouldn't it be nice to redo the code and make it more scalable. And when I say scalable—I mean scalable both in terms of handling more players but also in having more people work on it. Our code base in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was fine for 20 people to work on, but with 175 people it was very easy to step on each other's toes. So, we restructured a lot of the code so that if somebody's working on a gun, for example, they don't break a character.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We thought about the [prospect of a redo] very early on, but ultimately said 'that's not a good idea because we're still learning a ton. We've got a big playerbase. People love this thing. We've got to keep doing this.' I'm a big believer in 'you've got to be a student of the game,' but just over year [later] we made the decision that it was time to move on. At that point, we felt like we'd made everything we needed to learn to make the game of our dreams."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proulx expects to remain a student following the launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2025, but explains 1047 now has the ability and foresight to adapt more effectively. "We have a plan—and by the way, the plan is totally bogus and is absolutely going to change. But at least we have an approximate plan that is good on paper. We have the resources to build towards [that], but we've structured it in a way so there's not a lot of red tape," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We know the second we launch we're going to learn a bunch and that plan is going out the window. That's part of the [learning curve]. Another part is having content in your back pocket, so if there are fires of any kind we'll be ahead of schedule instead of always playing catch up. We also have redundancy on the team itself, so if somebody gets hit by a bus we've got a number two in place."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Outsourcing partners are part of the plan for ">Outsourcing partners are part of the plan for <span>Splitgate 2</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1047 Games has already enlisted the help of outsourcing partners, who aren't doing much yet but can provide assistance if (or perhaps when) things kick into overdrive. Proulx says those structures have been put in place because he's an out-and-out optimist that feels you need to plan for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[I ask] 'what will happen in the best case scenario?'" he says. "I'm very confident in the game. We're giving [our outsourcing partners] a little bit of everything [across art, animation, and audio] so that if and when this game takes off, we've already got the contract. We've got the relationship, and now we just crank it out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Proulx's sense of optimism extends to the wider game industry. When asked how developers can thrive in an environment that seems ready to crush all but the biggest success stories, he suggests adversity is an opportunity for growth. "I think we're a couple of years away from coming out of this [situation]," he says. "There's definitely a hole that has been dug and an overcorrection, [but] I'm still an optimist. I think you're going to see a lot of very cool games being announced.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think we're going to see more hits. The best companies are going to come out of the dark times, because they're the ones who face adversity and keep going, just like we have. Those are going to be the ones who learn the most—to find a way to win when it's difficult. If they get through this, when things bounce back they're going to do an amazing job."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/graft-new-cyberpunk-rpg-harebrained-schemes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadowrun Returns&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>BattleTech&nbsp;</em>developer Harebrained Schemes has announced its latest project, a grim cyberpunk RPG by the name of&nbsp;<em>Graft&nbsp;</em>that's currently in development for PC.</p>
<p>Harebrained was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-interactive-acquires-harebrained-schemes-after-battletech-team-up">purchased</a> by its former parent company Paradox Interactive back in 2018, but following weak sales of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lamplighters-league-announced-by-battletech-developer-paradox">2023 tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>The Lamplighters League</em></a>, Paradox and Harebrained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-harebrained-schemes-are-parting-ways-following-weak-sales-of-latest-game">parted ways</a> earlier this year, allowing Harebrained to pursue its own indie agenda.</p>
<p>Now, the studio is back with&nbsp;<em>Graft</em>, a game that "splices together tense survival horror with a dark RPG experience", according to the description on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Steam page</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/harebrained-schemes-graft-rpg.jpg?itok=ey_S19I7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/harebrained-schemes-graft-rpg.jpg?itok=YmrAKVy1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Graft&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>Shadowrun Returns&nbsp;</em>developer Harebrained Schemes' newest RPG.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Graft&nbsp;</em>will take place aboard the Arc, a "continent-sized station filled with biomechanically enhanced citizens". Since this is a cyberpunk RPG, you probably know how that's going to go.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the superstructure slowly begins to succumb to some kind of unknown decay, and so you must escape the Arc, navigating its winding pathways and labyrinthine corridors in order to scavenge resources and search for a way out.</p>
<p>According to Harebrained,&nbsp;<em>Graft&nbsp;</em>will offer "a visceral new twist on classic survival horror combat". From the brief gameplay teaser included on the Steam page, it doesn't look like the game will have turn-based battling.</p>
<p>It will, however, allow you to augment your body with the titular Grafts, which are essentially parts you can scavenge from your foes or find scattered across the Arc. Each Graft "carries with it some small piece of its previous owner", Harebrained says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/graft-harebrained-schemes-arc.jpg?itok=Ggu_6XEf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/graft-harebrained-schemes-arc.jpg?itok=MDIko4Jv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll explore a megastructure known as the Arc in&nbsp;<em>Graft</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Grafts will flood your system with "strange cravings and half-glimpsed memories", and you'll need to work out "what each of these fragments means to you". The Steam page rather heavily leans on the Ship of Theseus metaphor, wherein a ship's parts are gradually replaced until nothing of the original ship arguably remains.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Graft&nbsp;</em>yet, and we also don't know if it's coming to consoles or not. Stay tuned for more on this one as and when we get it.</p>

<p>So, what of those games? Well, our Matt was rather taken with Star Trucker when he gave the demo a whirl on Steam earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Star Trucker's demo is a treat, and there's suggestion of some real depth here - surprisingly so, when it could easily have positioned itself as a fun, throwaway gimmick and moved on," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-trucker-who-needs-a-mountain-vista-when-youve-got-the-whole-of-space">Star Trucker feature from February</a>. </p>
<p>
"It's promising stuff - slick, wonderfully atmospheric, and perfectly pitched somewhere between a sly wink and a straight face - and I can't wait to properly truck off when the full game shows up later this year. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> might have mountains, but who needs mountains when you've got the whole of space out your window?"</p>
<p>As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, we called it a "lumpy and loveable extreme sports playground" on its initial release. "There are bumps and bruises along the way, but the exuberance and energy on offer here make Riders Republic a worthwhile adventure," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riders-republic-review-lumpy-and-loveable-extreme-sports-playground">Eurogamer's Riders Republic review from 2021</a>.</p> <div>

<p>As is the case with every month, the arrival of these new games means that others will be leaving Game Pass. The following games will leave the service on 15th September:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ashes of Singularity: Escalation (PC)</li>
<li>FIFA 23 (Cloud, Console, and PC) EA Play</li>
<li>Payday 3 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Slime Rancher 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>SpiderHeck (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>You Suck At Parking (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
