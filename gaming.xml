            <p>Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild has reportedly been cancelled following layoffs at Xbox.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft began making layoffs across its gaming division today</a>, with staff at the likes of King and Zenimax reportedly affected. It now appears that Everwild is another casualty of these reductions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a> initially shared news of Everwild's alleged cancellation, and Eurogamer sources have since corroborated these reports. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyeysnjmk24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has additionally been told of the game's cancellation, citing those familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Everwild was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a>. At this time, Everwild was said to be the next "large" game from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>.</p>
<p>Everwild then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">surfaced again in 2020</a>, with a trailer showing groups of Eternals - beings with the gift "to sense and feel how magic flows through nature and connects every living thing" -  working together to heal a deer-like creature, and discovering a stag mural in some old ruins. </p>
<p>Since then, very little has been shared about Rare's game, although in February of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-rares-everwild-is-still-in-development-and-xbox-is-committed-to-giving-the-team-the-time-it-needs">Xbox head Phil Spencer assured the community the Everwild team was making progress</a>. "I was recently out at Rare. It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making," Spencer said at the time. "It has been [a while]. And we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Xbox for comment on Everwild's reported cancellation, and will update when we know more.</p></div>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/sony-has-a-drop-in-replacement-for-pssr-coming-to-ps5-pro-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-has-a-%E2%80%9Cdrop-in-replacement%E2%80%9D-for-pssr-coming-to-ps5-pro-in-2026.1234017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s Mark Cerny has revealed that “a drop-in replacement for the current PSSR” should be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in 2026.</p>
<p>This will be part of the ongoing Project Amethyst partnership between AMD and Sony that began in 2023 and has seen the companies collaborate to improve their various temporal upscaling hardware. On the PlayStation side, that’s with the dedicated hardware for PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) on PS5 Pro, and on AMD’s side, the latest Radeon 9000 series GPUs now have hardware for FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution), which is a significant jump over the more general purpose FSR generations and widely seen as being much more competitive with Nvidia’s leading DLSS 4.</p>


<p>PSSR had a generally positive impact at release, but there were some notable issues with games like Silent Hill 2 having graphical glitching with PSSR added, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/21/darktide-space-marine-2-on-ps5-pro-a-tale-of-two-pssrs/">added unwanted noise in Darktide</a>. So what’s great to hear is this reaffirmation that Sony is able and willing to deliver software updates that make use of the silicon dedicated to PSSR, but also the pace and extent of this partnership with AMD, which will deliver benefits to both PlayStation and PC (and let’s be honest, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/xbox-and-amd-sign-a-new-multi-year-partnership-for-next-gen-gaming/">to Xbox as well</a>).</p>
<p>“This is not for proprietary technology,” <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-mark-cerny-explains-why-your-ps5-pro-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-2026">Cerny told Tom’s Guide</a>. “This is really trying to move the industry forward. Obviously we want to use these technologies on our consoles, but these technologies are available to any of AMD’s customers freely.”</p>
<p>Two examples of the collaboration are that Sony helped AMD have more demanding graphical scenes within their research, to better mimic real games, while AMD had Sony set up a QA team for vetting algorithmic improvements.&nbsp;This built momentum such that the algorithm that is now core to FSR 4 was created within around 9 months.</p>

<p>And here’s the best news for PS5 Pro owners:</p>
<p>“The algorithm they came up with could be implemented on current-generation hardware,” said Cerny. “So the co-developed algorithm has already been released by AMD as part of FSR 4 on PC. And we’re in the process of implementing it on PS5 and it will release next year on PS5 Pro.”</p>
<p>He contineud, “It’s not a cut-down [version] of the algorithm. It’s the full-fat version of the co-developed super resolution that we’ll be releasing on PS5 Pro.”</p>
<p>The tricky thing will be figuring out how to put this in the hands of developers. Will Sony be able to simply replace PSSR as it currently exists in games? Will it be down to developers to patch it in? Or will users have the ability to override a game’s PSSR, similar to FSR 4 overrides on PC?</p>
<p>Another element of Project Amethyst is the feedback loop of development for AMD’s graphics in general. Sony and Microsoft have previously collaborated with AMD to create the custom silicon within PlayStation and Xbox consoles, drawing upon the upcoming roadmap of CPU and GPU advancements to meet their demands and budgets. However, Cerny says that “Big chunks of RDNA 5, or whatever AMD ends up calling it, are coming out of engineering I am doing on the project. And again, this is coming out of trying to move things forward. There are no restrictions on the way any of it can be used.”</p>
<p>AMD has just released RDNA 4 GPUs in the form of the Radeon RX 9070 and 9060 cards. Already looking to the future, their next generation GPU will be called UDNA (not RDNA 5), with promises of another significant overhaul and step forward in their efforts to catch up to Nvidia’s dominance of upscaling and ray tracing techniques – ray reconstruction is a big new feature that significantly improves core details of ray-traced reflections and effects.</p>
<p>It’s also widely expected that UDNA will provide the basis for any new consoles released in late 2026 or 2027, with rumours that Xbox might try to get the jump on Sony.</p>

<p>Luke, Kimberly, and Jamie have all received their own amiibo, and we've managed to get our hands on the cover star himself.</p>
<p>As you can see from the photos below, Luke towers above Ryu, Ken, and Terry and feels more weighty and substantial.</p>

<figure><a title="Gallery: Street Fighter's Luke amiibo Is A Big Boy, And No Mistake 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56dca29547cf1/gallery-street-fighters-luke-amiibo-is-a-big-boy-and-no-mistake-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>It's not just his size which is a step up from other amiibo, however; like his fellow <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-amiibo">Street Fighter 6 characters</a>, Luke unlocks special items in the game, such as unique music tracks, wallpapers and backgrounds (the latter being used with the in-game camera functionality).</p>
<p>Does this mean that Luke and company are worth the extra money? We'll let you decide on that score, but these larger figures do offer the potential for more detailed features.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<div><p>As new information regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's mass layoffs</a> continues to trickle out online, the first reported project casualty appears to be Rare's next major title, Everwild, which <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyeysnjmk24">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a>, and others are now reporting has been cancelled as part of the cuts. </p><p>Everwild was first publicly announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/">2019</a>, and has reportedly been in the works for the better part of a decade. Just months prior to this reported cancellation, Microsoft's chief executive officer of its gaming division, Phil Spencer, commented on Everwild, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-making-good-progress-confirms-phil-spencer/">saying that it was "<em>making good progress</em>."</a> Now, it seems, we'll never know what that progress looked like, or get to see what Everwild would have become.</p><p>Which is unfortunate, though, that being said, its cancellation comes as less of a shock considering the reports regarding its development journey. It had previously been <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/">described as a "<em>real mess</em>,"</a> due in part to the fact that when Everwild was revealed in 2019, Rare wasn't entirely sure what kind of game it was due to become. </p><p>The visuals featured in its reveal trailer and in media presented following the announcement always captivated players, but the question around what kind of game it was going to be was never entirely answered.</p></div>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<div><p>Regardless, Rare is one of the industry's most iconic and respected studios for good reason. Whatever Everwild was going to become, players would have expected an incredible game, because that's what Rare is known for making.</p><p>Which only compounds the news of the game's cancellation, because it also means that Rare will lose some of its talented employees. Details around how many are being laid off remain unclear, as Microsoft is seemingly drip-feeding the news of just how many people have been impacted. According to reports, a total of 9,000 people across Microsoft are being laid off today.</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-top-2m-copies-worldwide.1234008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Cygames has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another major milestone, around a year and a half after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/881020/view/506206686159045888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>has passed the two million sales mark, which means it's earned another million sales for itself since February last year.</p>

<p>That milestone was reached in around eleven days; it seems that sales have slowed pretty significantly since then, but two million is a very respectable number indeed for an action RPG based on what remains a relatively niche property.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=ZwZNWUZc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=uo-0beuh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>sales are doing very well for themselves, thank you very much.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em>, it's a third-person action RPG based on the mobile gacha game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>. Taking place in a land known as the Sky Realm, the game casts you as "the captain of a skyfaring crew", with whom you'll embark on adventures galore.</p>

<p>The game has had a long road to release; it was first revealed back in 2016 as a collaboration with PlatinumGames, but by 2019, the&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101&nbsp;</em>studio was no longer involved with the project.</p>

<p>Following that, it would spend a few more years in development before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-relink-gets-spectacular-new-trailer-release-in-2023-confirmed" rel="nofollow">slated for a 2023 release</a>, although it was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-opening-night-live-here-are-all-trailers-news-reveals" rel="nofollow">delayed to February 2024</a>. Thankfully, that's a date the action RPG did manage to make.</p>

<p><em>Relink&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>spinoff to grace PC and consoles, either. It's joined by the 2020 fighting game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>&nbsp;and its 2023 sequel&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, both of which pit characters from the world of&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>against one another in one-on-one bouts.</p>

            <p>Microsoft have cancelled Rare's wistful bucolic ramble <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs at the company this month</a>, according to a report. Microsoft themselves have yet to comment, but the news wouldn't be unexpected given that Everwild has been in development for around a decade, including its prototype phase, yet remains something of a mystery.</p><!--more-->
<p>The story comes from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a>, who cite "people with knowledge of the project". The same sources claim that team members are likely to lose their jobs in the process.</p>
<p>Everwild was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-new-game-is-everwild-some-sort-of-fantasy-nature-y-thing">revealed back in 2019</a> as a verdant fantasy experience that seeks "new ways to play in a natural and magical world". It cast you as an "eternal" being communing with plants and animals by means of staff-wielding rites, and seemed devoid of video game staples like combat and progression.</p>
<p>Over the years we've been treated to more trailers and concept art, but Rare have never quite explained what players do in the game, possibly because they hadn't worked it out themselves. The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rare-have-started-over-on-everwild-rumours-say">"restarted the project from scratch"</a> in 2021, according to rumours, following the departure of creative director Simon Woodroffe.</p>
<p>I myself liked the peacenik green-living stylings of Everwild's announcement trailer, and was intrigued rather than confused by Rare's elusiveness about tasks, goals and mechanics. Xbox boss wizard Phil Spencer was similarly positive when he <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-provides-rare-update-on-missing-in-action-xbox-exclusive-everwild/">talked about the game earlier this year</a>, commenting "we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have."</p>
<p>At the same time, Everwild has always felt like a hard sell within Microsoft, even given the relative success of the comparably playful and bloodshed-averse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>. Microsoft do not historically go in for this kind of hippy fairytale, to put it mildly. And when a game is in the works (in some form) for 10 years and still doesn't have a release date, a happy ending seems unlikely.</p>
<p>I'll mail Microsoft for comment. If you're employed at Rare, best of luck navigating all this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft is making another round of sweeping layoffs across its businesses of around 4% of its worldwide employees, with Phil Spencer sending an internal memo which has immediately leaked publicly.</p>
<p>The memo has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">reviewed and published by IGN</a>, who also had a source relay that Candy Crush developer King has been hit particularly hard, and that Bethesda’s London offices and marketing team are also affected.</p>


<p>In total, Microsoft is making layoffs of around 4%, per <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/">The Seattle Times</a>, or around 9,000 employees from the worldwide headcount of 228,000 as of June 2024. Individual teams and employees will be given specifics of what is happening over the coming days. This comes shortly after 6,000 employees were let go in May and June.</p>
<p>In Spencer’s memo, he said that “we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management”. He also acknowledges that this is at a time when Microsoft’s gaming business has a wider reach than ever before, he blows smoke up a future roadmap which has “never looked stronger”, but asserts that “The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously,” and that “a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities.”</p>
<p>This all sucks, and once again feels more callous than it really needs to be for a company that continues to be obscenely wealthy and profitable. We will have to wait and see the specifics of the job cuts, but our thoughts go to those affected.</p>

<p data-cy="paragraph">The silver lining is that Microsoft should be able to give supportive exit packages, including pay and healthcare coverage, while anyone being let go will have priority review for any open positions within Microsoft that they could apply for.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">The full message from Phil Spencer is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Phil</p></blockquote>

<figure><a title="Xbox Game Studios" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/afd3dfea7a4b5/xbox-game-studios.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft has begun informing staff of a huge second wave of job cuts this year, and the layoffs are expected to hit over 9,000 employees.</p>
<p>In a report published by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, studios affected include King — the team behind Candy Crush — where around 200 staff (roughly 10%) are being laid off, and ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. Staff have informed Schreier they weren't authorised to speak to the press.</p>
<p>Other US-based studios will be told of the cuts later today, and the cuts go beyond the gaming division. Many who are losing their jobs today only found out about the incoming cuts due to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division?srnd=undefined">a previous Bloomberg report</a>. These layoffs follow the 2,000 cuts made in January 2024, and the closure of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May 2024.</p>
<p>It's galling stuff, and it comes despite the fact that, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html">CNBC</a>, " $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter". As a result, it's reportedly one of the most profitable companies in the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKu_ZSYOos0cnYjMoZ4Emgzx0Wk4z-5LcUARMrLW2FCD-ZYxhyklcUDTygMIUSiLefK1-1OeNKSWM_l1u9MD9aYTQ_REJLnvOcWVKyoM2EgLGDenVhZTizdXJcASovGM9lfMplCFYMhblYNKLSoU7URjjmOlT3xcL_i9Ejt4b8TD">S&amp;P 500 index</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">IGN also reports</a> that Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer has been vague on the details, telling staff in a memo that organisational shifts and changes "will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days".</p>
<p>Below is Spencer's note in full, sent to staff and shared by IGN earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p>
<p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities.

</blockquote>
<p>Rare may also be part of the layoffs as the studio's upcoming action game <strong>Everwild</strong> — which was bound for Xbox and PC — has reportedly been cancelled as part of the cuts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">IGN</a> claim that MS have begun informing staff of the cuts today, June 2nd, with workers based in Europe seemingly the first to learn their fates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division">Bloomberg</a> claim that Candy Crush developers King, acquired by Microsoft as part of the Activision Blizzard deal in 2023, are laying off 10% of their staff, which is "about 200 jobs". They also report that the European arm of Zenimax, Bethesda's parent company, are cutting staff, but there aren't any numbers to share as of this writing.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/">The Seattle Times</a>, Microsoft have said that as much as 4% of the company’s total employees, roughly 9,100 workers across all of its departments, could be affected by these layoffs.</p>
<p>While Microsoft have yet to comment on all this publicly, IGN have circulated an email from Xbox chief Phil Spencer to all of the staff in Microsoft's gaming division about today's layoffs. You can read it in full below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.

<p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started testing headsets on my new Nintendo Switch 2, I dove in from a casual perspective seeking a pleasant experience with pals on GameChat while running some Knockout Tours in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. I’m not an audiophile, after all. I’m just a guy who enjoys an easy-to-use, comfy headset with generally good sound quality and solid battery life. I found a handful of such headsets that I’ve really enjoyed using on my Switch 2, and I’m here to tell you about them. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since the Switch 2 doesn’t allow mic input while using Bluetooth, every wireless headset on this list includes a USB dongle that allows for audio output <em>and</em> input. </p><h2 id="h33039"><a id="1"></a>Alienware Pro</h2><p>At $230, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset/apd/520-bbkn/gaming-gaming-accessories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset/apd/520-bbkn/gaming-gaming-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alienware Pro</a></span> is the most expensive headset I tested since the launch of the Switch 2, and I’d argue it’s (mostly) worth the asking price. Its exceptional ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) was miles above other headsets I tried. And it’s easily the most comfortable option in my current collection. Because of this, it’s been one of only two headsets I’ve used consistently since finishing my initial tests.</p><p>I found the Alienware Pro produces a somewhat muffled voice output, which is admittedly disappointing at this price point. But I’ve otherwise loved many of its other offerings, such as its sleek aesthetic, soft and cozy earpads, 70+ hour battery life, and detachable mic. The latter is especially nice, as it allows the Alienware Pro to function as attractive out-and-about headphones, too. </p><h2 id="h33040"><a id="2"></a>Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-blackshark-v2-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-blackshark-v2-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a></span> is a $200 option that should appeal to competitive gamers. This award-winning headset is well-liked in the eSports community due to its excellent spatial audio and killer wideband mic that provides some of the clearest voice delivery I’ve ever heard from a headset. With the touch of a button, you can even select useful EQ presets, including a few created by pro players for specific games.</p><p>One of my favorite things about the BlackShark V2 Pro is its helicopter pilot-esque visual style, which gives it an understated vintage vibe that looks unique in an era of “gamery” devices. The fact that it’s so comfortable that I often forgot I was wearing it is also nice. If it only had noise canceling capabilities so I could drown out the sound of my cat summoning demons in the background while I’m getting my ass kicked in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, it’d be basically perfect.</p><h2 id="h33041"><a id="3"></a>Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3)</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-700-gen-3-headset&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-700-gen-3-headset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3)</a></span> mostly delivers on its $200 price tag thanks to stellar 60mm dual drivers that offer crisp audio, a cool flip-to-mute mic, phenomenal battery life (up to 80 hours), and sturdy build quality. Admittedly, the high clamp force of the headset occasionally caused minor discomfort after extensive use (4+ hours), but it was never so bad that I felt compelled to take it off. You really shouldn’t wear a headset that long without a break anyway.</p><p>But while the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3) isn’t necessarily the most <em>comfortable</em> headset I’ve used, one feature has kept me coming back: <strong>This bad boy sports two USB dongles out of the box so that you can swap between consoles (or PC) with the touch of a button.</strong> As someone who frequently jumps between PS5 and Switch 2, this is a godsend that keeps me from having to switch out headsets when doing so. Efficiency is king for lazy asses like me.</p><h2 id="h33042"><a id="4"></a>Razer Barracuda X Chroma</h2><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x-chroma&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x-chroma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer Barracuda X Chroma</a></span> sits at a cool $130, which places it in that sweet mid-range spot. And that seems about right for this aesthetically pleasing headset that does pretty much everything well without feeling like it needs to be particularly exceptional at any one thing. It provides great sound and mic quality, an ergonomic fit, and 65-70 hours of battery life that ensures you stay in the game and off the charger. It’s just a good all-arounder for the average user, and that’s a win in my book.</p><p>There’s also a nice selection of RGB customization on the Razer Barracuda X Chroma, though you probably won’t really get to see any of them since the headset is on your head, of course. I appreciate this neat touch for those with a penchant for some fun visual flair, even if it’s not my cup of tea. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to download a companion app to get all of this stuff up and running.</p><h2 id="h33043"><a id="5"></a>OXS Storm G2</h2><p>Landing just above the budget crowd and just below the mid-range selections is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://oxsaudio.com/products/oxs-storm-g2?srsltid=AfmBOooo8I9qExR8hLfoYqN8ydpI2S-QfXDEPPUEy0GyGDlwJE37znbh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://oxsaudio.com/products/oxs-storm-g2?srsltid=AfmBOooo8I9qExR8hLfoYqN8ydpI2S-QfXDEPPUEy0GyGDlwJE37znbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OXS Storm G2</a></span>. And it’s a serviceable $80 headset that I found myself using quite a lot during the first week of owning my Switch 2. This is a good-looking set of cans with a solid sound profile, fairly decent mic quality, and a 40-hour battery life (20ish with RGB lighting turned on). And its lightweight design was so comfortable that I didn’t feel compelled to rip them off after my pals bounced out of GameChat for the night.</p><p>The cheap plastic build quality means you probably shouldn’t be tossing the headset around your game room or letting kids get too happy-go-lucky with it. But seeing as the OXS Storm G2 isn’t trying to fulfill the same promises as premium options, I’d say it’s still a catch at this price point. And I’ve frequently seen it drop down to $60 during sales, making it even more appealing.</p><h2 id="h33044"><a id="6"></a>Turtle Beach Recon 70</h2><p>Coming in at only $40, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recon-70-headset&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recon-70-headset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turtle Beach Recon 70</a></span> was one of the few wired headsets I tried on my Switch 2, and it was certainly my favorite budget option. I don’t like being tethered to my controller by a wire, so I probably won’t continue using this one, but it’s a satisfyingly low-cost option with sound quality that punches above its weight. Its mic quality is also significantly better than I’d expect from something twice its price.</p><p>Despite being made of plastic, the Turtle Beach Recon 70 is shockingly comfortable and sturdy, too, so I never felt like I had to be too careful with it. And since it plugs into a 3.5mm jack on your controller, there’s very little to fiddle with on the cups themselves. This lack of extra buttons and thingamajigs to keep up with makes this headset exceedingly easy to understand and use for casual players and youngsters alike.</p><p>Though the Switch 2 is still quite young, having only been out for about a month, there are already some great peripherals out there to upgrade your gaming experience.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-best-headsets-alienware-razer-turtle-beach-1851785500]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Layoffs have started (again) at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-laying-off-about-9000-employees-in-latest-round-of-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC </a>reporting that the company will lay off around 9000 people. Many of those cuts are expected to hit Xbox, as first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported this morning that <em>Candy Crush</em> maker King, based in Barcelona, is losing 10% of its staff, or around 200 people. Bloomberg also reported cuts to other European ZeniMax offices. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> reports that Bethesda, including its London office, will be affected. US cuts are expected; a memo to gaming staff from Phil Spencer published by IGN says that “the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by [Microsoft] team leaders in the coming days.”</p><p>Spencer writes in his memo, “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.”</p><p>Spencer goes on, in classic tone-deaf executive style, to praise Xbox for having “more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger.” He writes</p><blockquote><p>We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You’d be forgiven for being confused that Microsoft sees the need for <em>more</em> layoffs, given the company’s decision to lay off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 6000 people in May</a>. And you might wonder how the company could see the need for more gaming-specific layoffs, given the multiple rounds of layoffs Xbox has seen over the last few years. In <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2024</a>, Xbox cut around 2000 people primarily at <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision Blizzard</a>, following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2023</a>. In <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May</a> of that year, Microsoft closed four Bethesda studios in Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Games. The company laid off an additional 650 people in <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has seen an explosion of unions at the company in the wake of all this. <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA workers at Zenimax reached a contract agreement in May</a> after nearly two years of bargaining. Workers at Bethesda unionized in<a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> July 2024</a>, quickly followed by <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers at <em>World of Warcraft</em></a>, and&nbsp; <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenimax Online Studios</a> unionized in December of that year. These unions have been able to form due to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality agreement</a> Microsoft signed with the Communications Workers of America in 2022, though that hasn’t stopped the company from <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dragging its heels</a> at the bargaining table. Still, the unions are one way Microsoft employees are fighting back against the company’s frequent, brutal cuts.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a breaking story and will be updated.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-shower-handles"><h3>An In-Depth Examination Of Death Stranding 2’s Shower Handles</h3></a><p>Death Stranding 1 &amp; 2 both feature beautiful mechanical design.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update 02/07/2025: </strong>A memo from Microsoft gaming division head Phil Spencer to employees has been published online by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">The Verge</a> and others, as Microsoft is reportedly laying off as many as <strong>9,000 employees</strong> across the entire company. </p><p>In the statement, Spencer says these changes are being made "<em>To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas</em>." He also states that more specifics around these cuts will be dolled out across the next few days, which means we'll continue to see the damage these layoffs have done over the course of the week.</p><p>Spencer also admits that these cuts are coming at a time when the numbers from the Gaming division are actually on the rise, though considering that Tango Gameworks' reward for making an award-winning title in Hi-Fi Rush was being shut down, its practically part of Microsoft's playbook to enact these mass layoffs in good times and bad.</p><p>"<em>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger</em>," Spencer writes. "<em>The success we're seeing currently is based on tough choices we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities.</em>"</p><p>Further in the statement, Spencer acknowledges that Microsoft and Xbox would not be in its current position of strength without the work of the employees who are being impacted today. "<em>Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental - it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams</em>."</p><p>Part of the cuts reportedly include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancellation of Rare's next major title, Everwild</a>, which had reportedly been in development for the better part of a decade before its cancellation.</p><p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p><p>After reports from <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-is-reportedly-planning-another-major-xbox-layoff/">Bloomberg and The Verge</a> last week revealed that Microsoft was setting up for another round of mass layoffs to its gaming division, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA">Bloomberg now reports</a> that the layoffs have begun, with 200 employees already impacted at Stockholm-based King studio, the team behind popular mobile title Candy Crush.</p><p>Those are just the first round of reported cuts, with unknown numbers of employees being told to brace for layoffs at ZeniMax offices across Europe, while American employees are due to find out the details of how many people will be laid off later today, according to Bloomberg. </p><p>These layoffs are the fourth instance of mass layoffs at Microsoft and its Xbox gaming division in the last 18 months, dating back to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">1,900 people Microsoft laid off in January 2024</a>, months after it closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King.</p><p>Shortly after that Xbox shuttered <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/">four ZeniMax studios</a>, including Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, and months after that, another <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-lay-off-hundreds-of-california-workers/">400 developers were laid off from Activision</a> teams based in California.</p><p>If the rumors from last week regarding these cuts are correct, then we should expect the totality of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-layoffs-rumored-to-remove-up-to-2k-employees-studio-closures-a-possibility/">today's cuts to be closer to 2,000 people losing their jobs</a>, and the shuttering of more studios, though it's unclear which team will be cut at the time of this writing. A cut that big would be 10% of the total employee head count in Microsoft's gaming division, which reportedly has 20,000 employees. </p><p>The cuts to the King studio in Stockholm were approximately 10% of the studio, so it might be a sweeping 10% cut across the board. </p><p>We'll continue to update this story as more details around the cuts are revealed.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/]]></content:encoded>

			<div><p>Nexus Mods has announced that there will be significant changes coming to the website for users in the UK and EU, as its new ownership is working to comply with new EU and UK laws on child safety and the harboring of "<em>illegal content</em>" online.</p><p>Two weeks prior to this writing and the announcement of these changes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer/">Nexus Mods changed ownership</a>, with its founder selling the website after 24 years. This is the first major change and action the new owners are taking with the website, though these changes are less about the new owners deciding to shuffle things around, and more about complying with the<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/"> UK's Online Safety Act</a> and the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en">EU's Digital Services Act</a>.</p><p>The biggest change for UK and EU users is that Nexus Mods will implement some form of age verification in the near future, to try and prevent children from accessing mature and adult content. Adult content isn't being removed from the website, as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319">Nexus Mods says in its blog post announcing the changes</a>, "<em>Adult content is a core part of what makes Nexus Mods what it is; we don't consider removing it a viable option. We are aware that some users may find the changes irritating; however, we are obligated to do this to ensure we can continue to host adult content legally.</em>"</p><p>Some of these changes involve Nexus Mods updating its terms of service to include "<em>more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content under UK law and how we protect children from harm whilst on the site.</em>" Nexus Mods clarifies that the content it is discussing here, including content depicting child sexual abuse was already not allowed on the website. It is just making the language in its terms of service even more clear than it previously was. </p><p>Nexus Mods will also be adding automatic detection for any mods and content that include child sexual abuse. Creators found including that kind of content in their mods will have it removed from the website, be banned from Nexus Mods, and be reported to the UK's National Crime Agency.</p><p>The other major changes include an overhaul of how adult and mature content is categorized, with 10 new content tags being introduced that users in the UK and EU will be allowed to access after they have verified their age. Users will also be able to select which tags they see on the website and which they want to hide. These new tags also do not change users ability to vote on content tags for mods, nor does it change a mod author's ability to tag their own mods. The new tags are: </p></div>



<ul>
<li>Body stigma</li>



<li>Depression</li>



<li>Eating disorders</li>



<li>Extreme violence</li>



<li>Harmful substances</li>



<li>Pornographic</li>



<li>Self-harm</li>



<li>Sexualized</li>



<li>Suicide</li>



<li>Swearing or Profanity</li>
</ul>



<div><p>The response to these changes has been mixed, to say the least. While no one is arguing that children shouldn't be protected from adult and mature content online or that child sexual abuse material should be hosted on the website, the sticking point around it all is how the age verification will work. All Nexus Mods is saying for now is that "<em>the specifics of this [age verification] are being carefully considered as we want to get this right so that the option to view adult content remains available to adults, whilst fulfilling our legal obligation to ensure children are safe on our website</em>."</p><p>Nexus Mods could add age verification that's no deeper than clicking a box to verify a user is 18 years or older, which anyone who has been on the internet for more than five minutes will tell you that children on the website will just lie through. If the age verification is deeper than that, it could involve users being required to upload a form of ID. How that information will be protected and stored is what has users concerned. Either way, a new form of age verification is coming, one way or another, and its unfortunate for the new owners that this is their first major issue to deal with. </p><p>Founder and former owner of Nexus Mods, Dark0ne, piped into the comment section to make it clear that if he were still running the website, this would be his mess to deal with, and that he would've had to deal with it this year. He said that he's "<em>relieved" </em>it's not him at the helm of this, and adds that he would have made the changes the new owners are making now. </p><p>"<em>You can be worried or angry with the direction the internet is taking and the amount of control governments are enforcing on it around the world</em>," Dark0ne writes,  "<em>but the law is the law, and Nexus Mods will, and must, follow the law.</em>"</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new round of layoffs at Microsoft has apparently begun, and employees at studios like&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga&nbsp;</em>developer King and Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax are losing their jobs, with up to 9,000 company-wide employees reportedly in the firing line.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier, 200 staffers at King will lose their jobs, which represents around 10% of the company's total headcount. We don't yet know the number of layoffs at ZeniMax's European location.</p>

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-to-cut-9-000-workers-in-second-wave-of-major-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;these cuts are part of a wider layoff wave at Microsoft, in which "about 9,000 workers" will be caught up. A spokesperson told the publication that the layoffs will represent less than 4% of the company's workforce, but that the cuts are - say it with me - part of "best position[ing] the company...for success in a dynamic marketplace". Yuck.</p>

<p>This is the start of the layoff wave <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">predicted by Bloomberg last week</a>, and it's also not the first time Microsoft has laid off a large number of employees in the last eighteen months or so.</p>

<p>The company's most recent layoff round came in May, when Microsoft reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">let go of around 3% of its workforce</a>&nbsp;"across all levels, teams, and geographies" (according to news platform CNBC).</p>

<p>Prior to that, another wave of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">took place in January</a>, although a smaller number of employees were apparently affected by those layoffs than in subsequent job shearing efforts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-zenimax.jpg?itok=ag33jupa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-zenimax.jpg?itok=jzBOm8lz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax and King are almost certainly not the only studios affected by these layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>I could go on, but the point is that Microsoft has laid off a lot of employees in recent months, and the company is showing no signs of stopping on that front.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these layoffs stopped CEO Satya Nadella scoring himself an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly high payrise</a> back in October, and given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-payrise-andrew-wilson" rel="nofollow">recent CEO payrise trends</a>, I'd be extremely surprised if that doesn't happen again this year. Stay tuned for more on this as it develops.</p>

Employees in Microsoft’s Xbox division, known as Microsoft Gaming, are being hit hard by these layoffs, although exact numbers and divisions are not yet known.</p><p>Xbox leader Phil Spencer said in a message to the team that “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.”</p><p><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division">Bloomberg</a></em> reports that the now-Microsoft-owned King division that makes <em>Candy Crush</em> is cutting about 10 percent of employees, or 200 people, while other European units like Zenimax have also confirmed they are cutting jobs. A <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">report from<em> VGC</em></a> says that UK-based developer Rare has also been affected, and that the long-in-development title <em>Everwild,</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965203/rare-everwild-xbox-windows-10-new-game-watch-trailer">announced in 2019</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft-xbox/696628/everwild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled">has been canceled</a> as a result.</p><p>These major layoffs come less than two months after Microsoft announced it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce">cutting more than 6,000 employees</a>, followed by an additional 305 reductions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/678376/microsoft-is-laying-off-300-more-employees">in early June</a>. Microsoft employees have faced a series of layoffs over the past year, including a round of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604850/microsofts-performance-based-layoffs">performance-based cuts</a> that have seriously hit morale, according to multiple Microsoft employees I’ve spoken to.</p><div><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">laid off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees</a> in January 2024, followed by several game studios closures and job losses in May, and 1,000 job losses from its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170902/microsoft-hololens-2-mixed-reality-azure-layoffs">HoloLens and Azure cloud teams in June</a>. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242695/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-650-employees">laid off 650 more Xbox employees in September</a>, as part of a restructuring related to the company’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p></div><p>This is the memo that Xbox boss Phil Spencer sent to employees:</p><div><blockquote><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</p><p>Phil</p></blockquote></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unknown Worlds’ <em>Subnautica 2</em> is due to release into early access soon, which makes the news that its development team’s bosses have just been apparently ousted even more shocking.

However, it wasn’t really the “indie” project it sometimes appeared, given that by this point the development studio was majority owned by Chinese publisher Perfect World, based on a valuation of around $3.5 million. In 2019, a year after the release of <em>Subnautica</em>, Perfect World sold off most of its shares, and in 2021 the studio was bought outright by Korean developer Krafton (publishers of mega-hits <em>PUGB </em>and <em>InZoi</em>), which at the time said it would allow Unknown Worlds to continue to operate independently. Clearly, that has now changed.<br></p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> put out July 2, Krafton declared that long-time game producer Steve Papoutsis (<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>) has been brought in to be the new CEO of Unknown Worlds, with a goal to “prioritize development momentum and delivering best possible fan experience for [the] long-anticipated <em>Subnautica 2</em> launch.”</p><p>Krafton states that Papoutsis is replacing all three members of the original leadership team, “effective immediately.” The rather combative tone continues:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>While KRAFTON sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the <em>Subnautica</em> series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.</p></blockquote><p>Not so much reading between the lines as just reading the lines themselves, this gives the impression that Krafton had enough of how long the sequel to the 2018 game was taking, and so fired the company’s founders. We’ve reached out to find out if this is the case. The news has clearly come in fast, given at the time of writing, Ted Gill’s X account still states “CEO of @UnknownWorlds.”</p><p>This time pressure is stressed over and over, including in this statement from Krafton’s CEO, CH Kim. “There is nothing more important than the gamer experience,” he begins. “Given the anticipation around <em>Subnautica 2</em>, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible.” There’s <em>nothing more important</em>. The statement then goes on to seemingly just outright chastise the previous team, lecturing the reader:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> As part of its oversight, KRAFTON is committed to achieving regular milestones to assess progress across its creative studios. These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations.</p></blockquote><p>It really is quite something. And that’s fewer than half the times the same press release reiterates the importance of timely development. It’s astonishingly passive-aggressive.</p><p>My guess—and I stress I’m guessing—is that Cleveland et al would have been pushing for a delay before the early access release, and Krafton drew a line in the sand. Which, if true, would be all the more interesting given this isn’t a game that’s publicly slipped; it was initially announced as a 2025 release, and no one would have batted an eye if it was made known it was now sliding into 2026. It’d be fascinating to learn the internal situation that’s led to this apparent coup d’état.</p><p><em>Subnautica</em> was a sublime game (albeit with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-dev-fired-over-hateful-statements-1822746373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-dev-fired-over-hateful-statements-1822746373">its own controversial firings</a></span>), and will be a hard act to follow. Rumors that the sequel was going to be a multiplayer live-service thing caused a ferocious response, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/is-subnautica-2-live-service-krafton-release-date-1851240327&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/is-subnautica-2-live-service-krafton-release-date-1851240327">rapidly quashed by Unknown Worlds</a></span>. Hopefully we’ll still get a chance to play a not-quite-finished version of the game via early access some time this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479]]></content:encoded>
