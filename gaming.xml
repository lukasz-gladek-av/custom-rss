            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While the rest of the world was playing <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, </em>I was playing <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legendary-visual-novel-tsukihime-piece-of-blue-glass-moon-gets-first-english-trailer">Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-</a>. </em></p>
<p>Obviously, these games are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum. One is this highly involved, hard-as-nails action game. The other is a visual novel, more similar to reading a book than it is playing a video game. Yet, I haven't been this hooked on a game in years. <em>Tsukihime,</em> you convinced me: Visual novels are freakin' awesome.</p>
<p><em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>is a rather obscure title for those unfamiliar with visual novels, but it came to my attention after diving headfirst into the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fatesamurai-remnant-review-musou-holy-grail"><em>Fate</em></a> franchise. <em>Tsukihime</em> shares the same universe, so I already had a bit of familiarity with the subject matter, though if you want to go in blind, this is a perfectly fine experience on its own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-narative.jpg?itok=5n2pq32J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-narative.jpg?itok=w7nf8wwh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nasu's known for a certain writing style, and if "edgy" is what you'd call it, hey, count me in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Visual Novels Like <em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>Might Just Put You in a Trance</h2>
<p>This particular version of <em>Tsukihime</em> is a remake that originally released in Japan in 2021, but the West finally received an official English release in June 2024. I admit, I was very apprehensive. My previous foray into visual novels wasn't as enjoyable as I would have wanted, but like any piece of media, sometimes it takes a few tries before you find something that clicks.</p>
<p>And click, <em>Tsukihime </em>did. This visual novel is a treat to the eyes and ears, immersing the player in a narrative filled with magic, vampires, and plenty of emotional twists and turns. And that's the thing: I normally wouldn't attribute "immersive" to a very passive experience like a visual novel, but<em> Tsukihime</em> achieves just that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-narrative-2.jpg?itok=qHrlhiJT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-narrative-2.jpg?itok=q4usgo74 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shiki isn't your normal high schooler.</figcaption></figure><p>Exceptional voice acting with polished character art and backgrounds accompany words on the screen, and this combination creates a clear and cohesive image in my head as I read. Though there's little motion to these images, in my mind I can see this living and breathing world <em>Tsukihime</em> so clearly conveys.</p>
<p>Sound effects and music coalesce with the narrative as you read, putting me in a dream-like trance. These aspects of <em>Tsukihime</em> might sound like any other visual novel, but as someone who has little to no experience with the medium, the psychological aspects of reading took me by surprise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-vlov-2.jpg?itok=jiNxaKES 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-vlov-2.jpg?itok=zNENrI72 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Action-packed moments are still a thing, despite being a visual novel.</figcaption></figure><h2>Find Yourself a Story with a Hook</h2>
<p>Of course, <em>Tsukihime</em>'s story is what keeps me coming back. You play through the eyes of Shiki Tohno, an anemic high schooler with a very powerful supernatural ability: the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. Shiki can see red lines marked on every object and living thing in the world -- these are lines of death which, when severed, mark a permanent end for whatever it was on.</p>
<p>The player learns more about Mystic Eyes of Death Perception and the effect it has on Shiki and those around him. When Shiki gained these eyes after a horrific accident during his childhood, he was warned it may attract other "strange" things. After being outcast from his insanely rich family's mansion, he is summoned to the mansion a decade later to take up the role as eldest son once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-dialogue.jpg?itok=_Yg_8v_A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-dialogue.jpg?itok=7pbBOJlN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tsukihime</em> takes time to brief the player on the world, and worldbuilding is exactly my cup of tea.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tsukihime</em> takes a bit to ramp up, but the visual novel takes many unexpected turns. Vampires and some of the most bombastic fights in fiction are thrown in the player's face as the combination of voice acting, detailed visuals, and well-written dialogue constantly barrage the player in its latter half.</p>
<p>To dive into more detail on the characters and scenes in <em>Tsukihime</em>, well, we'd be here all day. And look, this is not a short experience -- with three different endings, it'll probably take up to 40 hours to finish everything.</p>
<p>So I'll keep it brief and say, I did not expect to get so emotionally involved in a game, much less a visual novel. In fact, few pieces of media hit me as hard as <em>Tsukihime</em> did. A key character, Arcueid, well, her story was so potent to me, I had to emotionally detach myself from the visual novel so it didn't make me a mess. And that is when I realized, if visual novels can do this to me, what else might there be in store?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-flowchart.jpg?itok=7gL0LYRW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-flowchart.jpg?itok=SBv2h1se 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the flowchart feature, allowing you to jump to previous scenes.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Tsukihime </em>Came Equipped With Handy Tools for Beginners</h2>
<p>Visual novels are already a bit light on gameplay features, but <em>Tsukihime</em> makes things a breeze if this is your first foray into a the genre. There's the bare minimum you'd expect (a reading log, quick save and quick loads), but also other inclusions that made this much more accessible. It was a misconception of mine to go in expecting visual novels to be clunky, but everything flows very well.</p>
<p>There's a flowchart that allows players to jump around the story with ease, collecting new scenes or, if you have a change of heart or even <em>die</em> in the story, allows for a way to fix your mistakes. Though, if you do die, it'll give you tips on how to change your fate, which is also very appreciated as a newcomer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-accessibility.jpg?itok=ahAlWMLr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-accessibility.jpg?itok=h49xs7la 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's some handy features to make your reading experience smoother.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than that, there are three endings which means three routes, but a decent amount of overlap in the beginning. There's a feature that can automatically skip dialogue you've seen, and you can also adjust the speed in which new dialogue is shown. You can finely tune the timing on these, so developer Type-Moon clearly tried to make this as welcoming an experience as possible.</p>
<p>It was my fault for discounting visual novels as "not for me." If you find yourself in the same shoes, you might just be surprised. Pick up a visual novel with a subject matter that appeals to you -- it doesn't have to be <em>Tsukihime </em>-- and devote yourself to it like it's a great novel. You might just be surprised by how powerful visual novels can be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/19/the-ftc-pushes-back-against-xbox-game-pass-price-increases<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, Xbox <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/10/price-increases-and-new-tiers-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">announced</a> it was introducing new Game Pass tiers and raising its subscription prices for existing members on September 12. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called <strong>Xbox Game Pass Standard</strong>, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. <strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong>, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. <strong>Xbox&nbsp;Game Pass Core</strong>, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged). <strong>PC Game Pass</strong> is increasing from $10 per month to $12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the $10.99 <strong>Game Pass for Console</strong> is no longer be available to new subscribers as of July 10. If existing subscribers fail to renew their membership, they will be permanently locked out of this tier and must subscribe to another, more expensive membership.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">filing</a>, the FTC blasts Microsoft’s discontinuation of Game Pass for Console, stating that users must pay a substantial price increase (81%) to switch to Game Pass Ultimate. Those unwilling to do so must settle for Game Pass Standard, which the FTC describes as a “degraded product” since it excludes day-one releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“[Game Pass Standard] costs 36% more than Console Game Pass, and withholds day-one releases. Product degradation—removing the most valuable games from Microsoft’s new service—combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged."</p>

<p>The FTC was the primary opposition against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and sees this move as proof of its concerns over the purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs[…]—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.”</p>

<p>The FTC goes on to call the price increases "inconsistent" with the case Microsoft made during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/07/11/microsoft-and-xbox-win-case-against-ftc-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">Xbox FTC trial last year</a>. It states, "Microsoft promised that 'the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [CoD] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition).' Microsoft’s post-merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminarily halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects, and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm’s economic incentives."</p>

<p>That last portion references&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-set-for-october" target="_blank">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s (the first new entry to release post-acquisition) October 25 launch on Game Pass Ultimate, roughly a month after the subscription tier's price increase.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-rated-by-esrb-for-pc-ps5-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The US Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> Hunt: Showdown 1986 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Here's the description of the game (which received a Mature 17+ rating):</p>
<p><em>This is a first-person monster hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era. Players use bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols to kill zombie-like creatures and human rivals. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, gunfire, and blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to cave in zombies' heads or to cut off their limbs. One type of zombie explodes into blood and viscera when killed; another type is depicted wearing human skin as a cape.</em></p>
<p>Notably, this is a separate listing from Hunt: Showdown. Before you dream of a sequel, though, Crytek General Manager David Fifield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-will-never-replace-hunt-showdown-with-hunt-2-the-way-overwatch-2-did-overwatch-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Rock, Paper, Shotgun in late 2023 that such a thing was not at all in the plans:</p>
<p><em>I would say we would even be less aggressive than Overwatch or, you know, Destiny 2. No, we have no plans for Hunt 2. We just plan to keep going forward. </em><em>You could say that chapter two of Fortnite was Fortnite 2 - they made a new island, they radically overhauled a whole, giant part of all its systems, but they just called it chapter two of a game called Fortnite. So that seems to be more the trend that we'll follow, when updating Hunt: Showdown.</em></p>
<p><em>If we talked about other products in the Hunt franchise, they wouldn't be replacements to Hunt: Showdown, they'd be brand extensions. Here's another game you could make in the Hunt universe, but that game wouldn't be meant to replace Hunt: Showdown, the thing people play.</em></p>
<p>So, maybe Hunt: Showdown 1896 is going to be a brand extension, as suggested a while ago by Fifield. Or, more likely, this is simply the rebrand of the game itself. The developers have hinted at such a thing, and we already know that next month, they will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-ps5-xbox-series-x-update-release-date-support-xbox-one-ps4-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add</a> proper PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X support while dropping old-generation consoles, which are indeed absent in the ESRB listing.</p>
<p>Either way, big changes are on the way for the game.</p>

<p>The EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) marketing director at Xbox says that the company “isn’t blessed” with a large budget in the region, leading to PlayStation outspending them on marketing in the region.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/xboxs-marketing-boss-fight-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketing Week</a>, Michael Flatt said that Xbox needs to “work really hard” against the competition. That work includes being “quite scrappy”.</p>



<p>“They’re [PlayStation] blessed with marketing funds that we’re just not able to enjoy,” Flatt said. “But that’s totally fine. We adopt what I would call a more fiscally responsible approach to media investments.”</p>

<p>He continued: “We’re not blessed with huge media budgets, so we have to be quite scrappy really, and quite tenacious to fight for funds that would probably go somewhere else.”</p>



<p>This interview comes after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-stop-pushing-xbox-consoles-in-europe-other-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims of Microsoft looking to stop</a> pushing console sales in the EMEA region. Instead, Xbox will reportedly put more of a focus on Game Pass, Cloud Gaming, PC, and Xbox controllers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/building-a-new-star-wars-moon-for-outlaws-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At the very heart of Star Wars Outlaws is the fantasy that all sci-fi fans dream of: the ability to adventure across the stars. Five different moons and planets await you, from Rise of Skywalker’s chilly Kijimi to the classic deserts of Tatooine. But while fans will recognise many of Outlaws’ locations, there’s one that they definitely won’t: Toshara. </p><p>A brand new moon crafted especially for Star Wars Outlaws by the development team at Massive Entertainment, Toshara is inspired by the East African savannah. But while it has uniquely beautiful landscapes, it is – aptly for a game called ‘Star Wars Outlaws’ – a criminal hive. </p><p>“It's run by a corrupt imperial governor,” says Navid Khavari, Outlaws’ narrative director. “And while the Empire is in charge, this is also a hub of scum and villainy, and you have all the sorts of major syndicates trying to vie for a stake of Toshara.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-newmoon-landscape-1720445484854.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Toshara is inspired by savannah regions such as Tanzania. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>To ensure Toshara is as immersive and authentic as possible, Massive approached the moon from all angles. “We had to work out the demographics of the planet,” Khavari explains. “We had to work out what the major hubs are. We had to work out fauna, flora, all of these sections that needed to come together and also be weaved by narratives.”  </p><p>But before all that, Massive had to pitch Toshara to the custodians of Star Wars: Lucasfilm. Because Toshara isn’t just a location for a video game; anything in Star Wars Outlaws is canon, and so whatever Massive made would need to be fully approved by the people behind the films, shows, and Star Wars universe at large. </p><p>“It's like they're giving us a box of toys, we take the toys out, play with them, but then we also create our new toys and put them back for somebody else to play,” says Benedikt Podlesnigg, art and world director on Star Wars Outlaws. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While the Empire is in charge, this is also a hub of scum and villainy.</p></div><p>A major player in such a process is Steve Blank, director of franchise content and strategy at Lucasfilm. “Massive came to us with the idea of a savannah planet,” he recalls. “Once we sort of knew the high level intention behind the story and where we wanted to go, we let them ruminate on what does that mean? What would you like to see? What do you feel like you haven't seen before?”</p><p>The result of those conversations was a collection of unusual and familiar ideas. Massive wanted Toshara to be a world where the Star Wars mythology’s pirate-inspired elements could live – think Jabba’s barge and Luke being forced to walk the plank over a sarlacc pit. This had to be a place of high risk, high reward treasure hunting. And so was born the so-called gem of the underworld; a moon ruled by a corrupt division of the Empire and largely controlled by the galaxy’s crime syndicates. But it wasn’t enough to develop lore. The team had to start with the look and feel of the very ground itself. </p><p>“We approached Toshara in terms of the general Star Wars design tenets, where it has to be familiar but with a twist,” explains Julian Gerighty, creative director of Outlaws. The familiar is the landscapes of Tanzania, which Podlesnigg says would be the shooting location for Tosharan scenes if Outlaws were a movie. Layered on top of this is the twist: “huge mountain outcrops that have been carved so that a city can take place within those rock walls,” describes Gerighty. And then, within that rock, is Toshara’s most distinct characteristic: amberine. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-newmoon-city-1720445391303.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The crime-ridden city of Mirogana is built inside the amberine outcrops of a mountain. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Amberine is an orange, crystal-like material that runs through the crust of Toshara and juts out through its surface. Inspired by an old Austrian fortune-telling tradition in which molten lead is poured into cold water to create shapes that reveal what’s to come, the Amberine forms into a variety of striking forms. It is Blank’s favourite part of Massive’s new world. </p><p>“You find [amberine structures] sort of wherever you're going,” he says. “They're inside caves, they form plateaus [...] and they also react beautifully to the sun over Toshara, so you get these gorgeous reflections in the lighting.” </p><p>Unusually for Star Wars, amberine isn’t a precious resource like spice or Beskar Steel, and so Toshara’s population has left it untouched and intact. That’s not to say the crystal is useless, though. The moon’s climate is incredibly windy, and those winds erode away rocks, cliff faces, even mountains – a process that gradually reveals the incredibly resilient amberine within. It made sense, then, that Toshara’s main metropolis, the city of Mirogana, would be built within an amberine structure to protect it from the winds. </p><p>Basking within the orange glow cast by sunlight filtering through that amberine shield is the Pyke Syndicate, the most dominant of Mirogana’s criminal organisations. But don’t let them put you off visiting; the city’s busy streets are full of opportunities for both a galactic scoundrel scouting for gigs, and a player looking to diversify their experience.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first thing that you should do as a scoundrel is go to the cantina.</p></div><p>“Every single location we had to choose had to be a den of scum and villainy, right? And in Mirogana you can do a lot of things,” says Gerighty. “There's the first thing that you should do as a scoundrel, as an outlaw, is go to the cantina. And in the cantina you'll find lots of shady characters that'll offer you jobs. Or you can just relax, eavesdrop, pick up some intel, play a couple of games of sabacc, bet on the Fathier races, play some arcade games…” </p><p>Beyond the cantina you’ll find a city split into several regions, each with their own flavour. The gambling district is constructed using different architecture and signage to the central market, while the Imperial checkpoint is built out of the Empire’s instantly recognisable flat panels and grid vents. No matter where you find an Imperial base on Toshara, it’ll stick out like a sore thumb. </p><p>“They come in, they don't care about their environment, they just stamp down their base wherever they need,” says Podlesnigg. He paints a picture of a time when the Tosharan landscape featured a colossal amberine archway, but when the Empire arrived they simply demolished the arch to make way for the base. In the game, you’ll be able to see that very base flanked by two amberine pillars – all that remains of that historic arch. “It creates a really interesting visual that's seen from far away that you can really use as a landmark.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-imperialcompoundconceptart-1720425543767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Tosharan Imperial Base, flanked by the remains of an amberine arch. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Beyond the city’s borders, the aforementioned winds have eroded away the moon’s rock surface to reveal even more unusual amberine formations. A resourceful outlaw with a speeder bike could use such formations to hit even greater speeds during hot pursuits. </p><p>“It's very orange glowing, so it stands out very naturally in the environment,” says Podlesnigg. “So we could make ramps where you can jump off [while riding the speeder bike]. We made the wind tunnels where you can see [how they have been] carved out by the winds. I think one of the references was surfing underneath waves.” </p><p>In the process of planning out Toshara’s geography, Massive went as far as establishing that the moon’s wind currents all run north to south. This dictated the map’s population density, road networks, audio design, and – importantly – the formation of the speed-boosting wind tunnels. And so while the amberine ramps and tunnels may be a gameplay-first element, it’s all created hand-in-hand with world-building. </p><p>“For every location, no matter how small, we want to think about what happened here, what is happening now, and what is the location in general? What [do] people do here?” explains Podlesnigg. “So we have a very clear idea of the history of the place and what the place is.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For every location, no matter how small, we want to think about what happened here, what is happening now?</p></div><p>A skilled outlaw can harness the moon’s winds for their benefit, but not everyone is prepared to tackle such a climate. Echoing the derelict Star Destroyer on Jakku in The Force Awakens, Toshara is littered with crashed starships. They’re the remnants of those who tried to fight the winds and lost. It’s a smart bit of environmental storytelling, but the tale doesn’t end there. Those shipwrecks have become part of Toshara’s history and economy; with nothing but rock and amberine available to the moon’s population, the crashed ships were harvested for metal which was then used to construct many of the buildings you’ll see and explore.  </p><p>With so much of Toshara’s environment being made up of harsh rock, crashed spaceships, and strange amberine structures, the finishing touch had to be something much more alive and endearing. While the crime syndicates may be the planet’s apex predators, there are plenty of other creatures in the wilds to discover and befriend. Podlesnigg describes a magpie-like flying creature that’s “attracted by everything that sparkles, and they steal everything.” It’s an amusing trait, but one that folds directly into gameplay: “When you see them circling somewhere, maybe you can go there and find something of value.”</p><p>A cuter friend can be found in Toshara's weasel-like creatures, small pettable animals that will follow you around in groups. We can only hope that we’ll be able to round up a dozen and cause chaos in a cantina… </p><p>Toshara has yet more secrets to be discovered, but we won’t know this new moon’s best treasures until we explore it ourselves when Star Wars Outlaws arrives on August 30.

This gives you a new option to focus one of these weapons outside of Nightfalls, although you will need to have unlocked its pattern already before you can do so, and you'll need several Nightfall Ciphers to do so.

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

                <p>Prime Video's The Boys TV series wrapped up its fourth season this week, and the season went out with a bang. Now, the show's creator and showrunner has provided a peek behind the curtain of how the most climatic part of the finale was created, and it's getting people talking about the possibility of a video game based on The Boys. <strong>Major s</strong><strong>poilers follow below.</strong></p><p>Eric Kripke revealed that the team works with Cncpt Studio to create detailed CG pre-visualizations for major scenes prior to filming, and this was the case for the season finale. Creating a pre-vis sequence like this can help the team decide on camera positions, lens, and coverage, Kripke said, all without having actors rehearse in person. Peter Jackson famously used pre-vis animatics to plan out some of its biggest and most complicated scenes as well. Many Hollywood productions do this.</p><p>For the season finale of The Boys, Kripke enlisted Cncpt's help for the pivotal sequence where Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) launches tentacles out of his chest and uses them to rip the would-be president Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) in half. Cncpt's pre-vis of this sequence is pretty impressive in its own right, featuring all the main characters and their movements from the scene in pretty solid detail.</p><p>"Our team is amazing," Kripke said of the work. Take a look at the video for yourself below.</p><p>The impressive-looking character models have people calling on Prime Video to make a video game based on The Boys. It remains to be seen if that would ever happen, and the rights might be a little complicated given that The Boys is produced by Sony Pictures Television for Prime Video. Both Sony and Amazon have their own dedicated gaming divisions, too.</p><p>Characters from The Boys have already come to video games, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-brings-back-the-boys-dlc-soon-along-with-these-unexpected-bundles/1100-6523618/" data-ref-id="1100-6523618">Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir were added to Call of Duty as playable characters</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-teaser-shows-first-look-at-homelander-in-action/1100-6523183/" data-ref-id="1100-6523183">Homelander alone came to Mortal Kombat. </a></p><p>The Boys will return for one final season to come, but it won't be here anytime soon. In the meantime, fans can look forward to Gen V Season 2 at some point sooner.

			<p>Honkai: Star Rail is one of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/honkai-star-rail-five-tips-on-getting-started/"> more popular games</a> created by miHoYo. Released in 2023, it has received consistent updates that add new content and banners for players to try and roll for. The latest update for Honkai: Star Rail, <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article_pre/15787?utm_campaign=link&amp;utm_id=6&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=sns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 2.4</a>, is set to be released on July 31. The full title for this update is "Finest Duel Under The Pristine Blue."</p>
<p>This update shows the crew of the Astral Express heading back into familiar territory as they return to Xianzhou Luofu. On this journey, they will meet old and new friends as they attend the Wardance ceremony. Along with the event of the Wardance ceremony, two new characters will be joining the roster.&nbsp; The Ambrosial Arbor crisis has now been resolved, and people can celebrate with the Wardance ceremony. This ceremony commemorates the Reighbow Arbiter and the Cloud Knight's defeat of the Abominations of Abundance.</p>
<p>At the festival, players will get to reunite with fan favorites such as Yanqing and be introduced to significant figures in the story, such as General Feixiao of Xianzhou Yaoqing and General Huaiyan of Xianzhou Yaoqing, known as Merlin's Claw and Flaming Heart, respectively.</p>
<p>This update sees the introduction of Yunli and Jiaoqiu. Alongside the introduction of these two characters in Honkai: Star Rail 2.4, a brand new map will appear with tons of buried secrets for players to explore—the map that is being introduced in the Honkai: Star Rail update 2.4 is titled "The Shackling Prison," where players will get to learn more about the atrocities that go on beneath the surface in the prison that holds the most formidable criminals. To be able to access this area, you'll have to go beneath the waters of Scalegorge Waterscape. This area is full of mystery and intrigue, and has many secrets for players to uncover.</p>
<p>Yunli is one of the brand-new characters to be added to Honkai: Star Rail and she is the treasured granddaughter of Flaming Heart General Huaiyan. Yunli has a lot of exciting new abilities that players will get to experiment with, such as her Parry state and her unique Counter ability.</p>
<p>In addition to Yunli being added to the game, Jiaoqiu will also make their arrival representing the Xiaozhou Yaoqing delegates. Jiaoqiu experiments with alchemy and fire, and has their unique debuff that they can inflict on enemies called "Ashen Roast." This huge update to Honkai: Star Rail will be released on July 31, with a Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works] collaboration also teased by miHoYo. However, this collaboration is not due to arrive until Q3 2025.</p>
<p>In other news, the developer has recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/zenless-zone-zero-the-perfect-gacha-game-for-those-who-dont-like-gachas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, which is yet another <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-reaches-50-million-global-downloads-hoyoverses-latest-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global hit</a> from the studio.</p>

From worst to best, the levels are: Hated, Disliked, Neutral, Liked, and Respectable. </p><p>The level is determined by a 100-point scale, with each level having a specific range. For example, Neutral is between 40 and 60. Whenever Geralt enters a new region the reputation will start at Neutral, so you don’t have to worry about being public enemy number one from the start. Doing Witcher contracts as well as winning horse/boat races or fist fights will boost your reputation. Some main quests will also have an impact on reputation depending on your choices, and if you steal or swing your weapon in front of guards, you’ll lose reputation points. The system looks to punish (or reward) you by focusing consequences on the place that matters, your wallet. Better reputation levels will give you a discount at shops while letting you sell items for a higher price. The opposite is true if Geralt isn’t popular with the locals. </p><hr><p>The mod claims it restores this system after CDPR cut it from the game at some point in development. <em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to CD Projekt Red for confirmation or comment.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Our former editor Katharine "Thorsbane" Castle has long since quit these turgid shores for the sunny uplands of Eurogamer, where the consoles multiply like rabbits, but her legacy endures. For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roots-of-yggdrasil">Roots of Yggdrasil</a>, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.</p>
<p>Katharine called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roots-of-yggdrasils-gorgeous-roguelike-citybuilding-is-a-real-grower">"a real grower"</a> before the early access release in January, likening it to both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-banished-vault">The Banished Vault</a> - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We had planned another patch before releasing 1.0, but as we worked on it, we realized bundling all the changes together made way more sense," developers ManaVoid Entertainment comment in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2071430/view/4190113770900051871?l=english">a Steam post</a>. "That means the next patch is going to be BIG." Here's what you can expect: new events, including new characters to bandy words with from biome to biome, and new Runic Stones, which can be used to add keywords to your cards. For example, if you stick "Retain" on a card, it'll stay in your hand at the end of your turn.</p><p>There will be new building cards, too, such as raiding camp and cart maker, and a fourth playable scion to unlock, with their own story and quest. Existing characters will get endings for their story quests. Quality of life improvements include cleaned-up scion blurbs when preparing for each run, and a clearer presentation of whether your scion or housing will level up if you succeed at a trial.</p>
<p>They've also rebalanced the Holt environment that forms the persistent and evolving staging area for this particular roguelike. "Overall, we felt the progression was a bit too slow and also too restrictive," the devs explain. "Expect less requirements on Holt buildings in the future and more ways to obtain amenity tags. We also don't plan to wipe anything, so if a building you placed gets rebalanced, you'll be able to simply remove it and replace it elsewhere if you prefer!"</p>
<p>All this comes with the caution that the game's price will increase "slightly" when it leaves early access. But there will be a launch discount, too, so you hopefully won't suffer if you hold off till September. Anybody here played this recently? How has the early access build come along since Katharine's day?</p>

            <p>
Following a bit of a tease at least year's BlizzCon, Blizzard has given Overwatch 2's 41st hero the full reveal treatment. And that's not all! Juno, as the shooter's new Martian space ranger is known, is available to play today for a limited-time.
</p>
<p>
When Blizzard first teased Juno last year, she was known only by the codename Space Ranger. It was, however, confirmed, she'd be Overwatch's first Martian character, as well as a "highly mobile support hero". Eight months later and we now have a much clearer idea of who Juno is, as well as what she can do, thanks to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspacNMHSbM">brand-new gameplay trailer</a> showcasing her abilities.
</p>
<p>
Sporting a kind of retrofuturistic look, complete with jet-infused roller-boots and a slinky ray gun, Juno leans heavily on speedy traversal. Her passive Martian Overboots ability can be triggered while airborne, enabling her to hover for a limited time, and it can be paired with her Glide Boost, allowing her glide horizontally with increased movement speed.
</p>

<p>
As for that ray gun, it's officially known as a Mediblaster, and its primary mode of fire is capable of healing allies and damaging enemies. Juno's secondary fire, meanwhile, takes the form of Pulsar Torpedoes - homing misses that can lock on to enemies and allies alike, harming or healing them respectively over time.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the gateway-like Hyper Ring, granting teammates a temporary speed boost as they pass on through, and her ultimate is the Orbital Ray. This massive beam from outer space travels forward, healing allies and increasing their damage as it goes.
</p>
<p>
Juno officially joins Overwatch 2 in Season 12, which begins on 20th August - but players can put her through her paces from today, 19th July, until 21st July on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC. She'll be available in all game modes except Competitive for the duration of her trial, as well as the No Limits mode in the Overwatch arcade.

As a result, yesterday representatives of publisher NetEase and its subsidiary, Starry Studio, posted on the massively popular 500,000-person <em>Once Human</em> Discord, begging fans to go to the game’s Steam review section to boost the rating to “positive” or higher.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240718/40780_1167927.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240718/40780_1167927.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But the game’s July 18 patch</a></span>, which was full of bug fixes, caused some unexpected problems. It has been essentially eating some players’ items when they tried to deposit them, and ruining some bases people had spent decent chunks of time building. This all came after extended server maintenance to complete the update in the first place. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6tjjc/after_patch_update_i_lost_my_home/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6tjjc/after_patch_update_i_lost_my_home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players have since shared</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6ex5f/base_disappeared/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6ex5f/base_disappeared/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images of busted homes</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6jtfz/my_friends_base_after_the_patch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e6jtfz/my_friends_base_after_the_patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the <em>Once Human </em>subreddit</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/2139460/discussions/0/4515505180235671253/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2139460/discussions/0/4515505180235671253/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and Steam Page</a></span>,  asking one another for help getting them restored.  “Been walking around tonight thinking why do people build half bases without walls,” joked one player. “Now I know why.”</p><p>“We apologize for the inconvenience,” representatives for the game posted on the Discord today under the title,<strong> </strong>“Fixes for ‘Deposit Function Causing Item Loss’ and ‘Territory Module Loss’ Issues.” The developers added, “Both problems have been identified and are currently being resolved as quickly as possible.” <em>Once Human</em>’s developers said players who lost items will get them replaced through the in-game mail and all players impacted negatively by the patch will get “extra compensation.” </p><p>Amid this latest mess, the original post asking players for positive reviews was deleted (I only saw it initially because of the auto-ping notification from the Discord server). It’s unclear if there will be a new call-to-action  once the mini-crisis has fully-passed, or if NetEase has thought better of asking players to juice the Steam rating—a not altogether unreasonable ask given how many players do like the game, and the fact that it’s still being held down by unsubstantiated criticisms of<em> Once Human</em>’s data collection policies. </p><p>“Bad reviews like that can do so much harm to the game and might be the reason that it may die which I hope from the bottom of my heart that this will not happen,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e1b6r2/i_wish_the_reviews_would_get_positive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceHumanOfficial/comments/1e1b6r2/i_wish_the_reviews_would_get_positive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one fan on the subreddit last week. And the tide does seem to be turning. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?gad_source=1#app_reviews_hash&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?gad_source=1#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Despite plenty of complaints</a></span> about the latest patch issues, most of the negative Steam reviews have begun tapering off. We’ll see how that holds up after <em>Once Human</em> reaches its first map and character reset at the end of August. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It didn’t work.</p><p>I purchased a copy of it when it launched in 2022, and sunk around 10 hours into it to mixed results. I definitely clicked with it here and there, but when it got tougher…I wasn’t here for it. Or, rather, other things in life grabbed my attention instead. Sure, I could see the appeal of mastering a tough challenge, but I already have my fair share of challenges in other hobbies and, well, <em>life </em>itself. So it drifted. I’d try it every now and then, including a few months ago, and just couldn’t get into it in a sustainable way.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559"><em>Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>And then I played, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559">reviewed, <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em></a></span>. Like many soulslikes, it’s got its work cut out for it trying to make it in a genre with fans that have very discriminating, and often developer-specific, tastes. <em>Flintlock</em> is a much easier take on the <em>Souls</em> format though, and that really helped me cut to the chase a bit more, find the joy of more intentional combat and the dopamine drip that results from steadily moving through a world, one tough battle at a time. It was a nice set of training wheels for me and provided some joy on its own merits as well. And around halfway through that game, I felt a confident and excited urge to jump into one of FromSoftware’s masterpieces with the intention of finishing it. </p><p>That game turned out to be <em>Elden Ring</em>. I considered others, but the open, wandering spaces of <em>Elden Ring</em> feel a bit more inviting. I spun up a new character and have since sunk six hours into this fresh, new attempt. Having just gotten through a fight that literally took me around an hour and a half to complete, accompanied by a dear friend who’s willing to help me unpack the game’s cryptic systems and provide me with some encouragement, I think I’ve cracked it. I’ve got some good momentum. I understand this genre and this game better now. </p><p>Also, this playthrough of <em>Elden Ring</em> is coming at a time where I’m facing some steep personal challenges, unexpected failures, pains, and regrets. Yet, there’s opportunity and an uncertain future full of trials and struggles where I can easily see myself coming out intact and stronger. In getting sent to “You Died” screens constantly, with the courage to get up and do it again, I’m wondering if <em>Elden Ring</em>’s gonna have more to offer than just a fun, if not challenging, way to pass the time. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-recommend-id="image://209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hello Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-recommend-id="image://209678f4949d13482011eb680facaf59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A space explorer stares out at islands floating in the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Touch some alien grass and maybe some water too</p><p>I won’t claim to be an OG, but I’ve been on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/no-man-s-sky&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/no-man-s-sky"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span>’s side since the very beginning. I believed in it so much I picked up a steelbook on PS4, which I almost never do. Since then, <em>No Man’s Sky </em>and I have had a very on-and-off relationship, though we’re largely off.

I’ve cheered it on through numerous of its updates, and even flirted with the possibility of coming back numerous times. The “Atlas Rises” update in particular, which added a whole new story to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, was very enticing, but I stayed away for a bit longer. It wasn’t till the “Next” update that I booted the game back up, since it finally introduced proper multiplayer and overhauled the game to be <em>much </em>closer to the vision of it I’d always had.

Sure, I’ve been running through <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> for the past month-and-a-half at this point, slowly catching up to the recently released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-steam-reviews-1851570344&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-steam-reviews-1851570344"><em>Dawntrail</em></a></span>, but it’s time for something different. <em>FF11 </em>first released in 2002, and has been steadily getting updates ever since. At the start of this year, egged on by a great deal in the Steam winter sale, I purchased <em>FF11 </em>and dove in. My first foray into the dated MMO was spent struggling through the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-xi-log-in-process-sucks-man&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-xi-log-in-process-sucks-man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frustrating set-up</a></span>, but I did eventually figure it out and start exploring the world with a friend. I declared that 2024 would be the year of <em>FF11</em>, at least for me. </p><p><br>In the months since I created my character, the constant itch to play <em>FF11 </em>has remained. That has only been enhanced by my time with <em>FF14</em>, which is a sleeker and more approachable MMO, but one that lacks the particular old-school charm of its online predecessor. <em>Final Fantasy 11</em>’s world of Vana’diel has a unique friction to it, something rooted in a more adversarial relationship with the player. Die too much and you can lose levels; enemies often drop loot in password protected chests you need to solve or watch disappear; and NPC party members must be recruited one-by-one through special missions. It makes every step of progress feel hard-earned in a way that I find extremely satisfying. The experience has been made easier in the two decades since the game’s original release (like the addition of the NPC party members), and there are plenty of helpful beginner’s guides out there. It would be perfect timing for any <em>FF14 </em>players, since<em> Dawntrail</em>’s Alliance Raids will be an homage to Vana’diel. — Willa Rowe  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-recommend-id="image://5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-recommend-id="image://5dd9100c576b70ef1df4625c3679b7c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a speed run mode shows different game level selections from Nintendo's history." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Prove I’m the best around, and nothing’s gonna ever keep me down</p><p>In my NES-playing youth, it was common for me to make up my own challenges to tackle after I’d mastered a game the “normal” way. Can I beat <em>Mega Man 2 </em>mostly just using the Buster? Can I beat <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>without relying on mushrooms or other power-ups? Things like that. And I know I’m not the only one. In talking to others over the years, I’ve learned it was quite common for kids to devise challenges that gave us new goals to shoot for and lent new replay value to NES games we’d otherwise mastered. Now, Nintendo has put out its own collection of time-based challenges for its own first-party NES games (sorry, <em>Mega Man 2</em>), and I’ll be spending a fair chunk of this weekend seeing if I’ve still got the stuff. </p><p>Weirdly, despite being called <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition </em>(emphasis on “World Championships”), apparently there aren’t leaderboards for its many challenges, so you can’t actually compete directly with your friends or the wider world. (There is one weekly challenge everyone can participate in which <em>is </em>ranked, but, for now at least, that’s it.) This is an absolutely puzzling decision to me, albeit one that seems par for the course for Nintendo, which historically seems to struggle with implementing online features in a smart, player-friendly way. All week, as I’ve been anticipating this game, I’ve been thinking back on how the Xbox 360 era of Xbox Live was a golden age for leaderboard competition and online activity. It was a time when I gleefully invested hours in playing <em>Pac-Man CE </em>or <em>Geometry Wars </em>in an effort to surpass my friends on the high score charts, and I’d hoped this game might rekindle some of that competitive enthusiasm in me, but for NES games. It seems that’s not to be. </p><p>Still, I’m keeping an open mind. I love many of the games featured here—<em>Metroid</em>, <em>Zelda II</em>, <em>Donkey Kong</em>—and even those I don’t love (like <em>Ice Climber</em>) I think could be the stuff of entertaining one-off challenges, so I’m eager to jump in and see just what sorts of tests of skill Nintendo has devised. Perhaps my friends and I will just have to resort to sharing our best times in a group chat or something, which won’t be nearly as cool or seamless as doing so via an in-game leaderboard, but I’ll take what I can get. And I’m already thinking about how that <em>NES Edition </em>in the name implies that this may be the first of many. Nintendo, please, for the sake of all that is good and holy in this world, add proper leaderboards by the time you get around to making the <em>SNES </em>edition. Please! — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-recommend-id="image://0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-recommend-id="image://0ccf586bb0d136eb6999b7bc34b8122a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Monsters pour forth from a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck OK)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Get the Platinum trophy </p><p>If this were the PS2-era,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-tower-defense-hands-on-1851532868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-tower-defense-hands-on-1851532868"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></a></span><em> </em>would be one of those games that would have come out, been mostly ignored, and then disappeared only to live on in the memories of people who raved about it to anyone who would listen. Hell, it might never have gotten localized at all. But it’s 2024, and everyone will get a chance to give <em>Path of the Goddess</em> a try, and they should. Capcom’s mashup of tower defense and old-school arcade action games is dressed up in Japanese folklore with a vibrant art style and incredible soundtrack. It’s fun, meaty, and doesn’t try to do more than it can. It’s a refreshing departure from games that put big-budget presentation over compelling gameplay and pile on needless systems to pad out play time. </p><p>You play as a warrior named Soh, tasked with escorting a maiden down a mountain so she can purge the evil spirits that have infested it. You train villagers to take on specific roles, and then order them around the battlefield to fight off hordes of demons until the sun comes up. Between missions, you rebuild the villages you encounter to unlock new abilities, classes, and equipment. It’s a solid formula that sings thanks to crisp combat and attention to every little detail from the development team. You can feel the love, care, and creativity in even the smallest elements, especially the UI which is masterfully incorporated into the overall presentation. There are flaws and tedious parts to be sure, but for a $50 game (it’s also on Game Pass), <em>Path of the Goddess</em> nails everything it <em>needs</em> to do and more. — Ethan Gach </p><hr><p>And that wraps our picks for the weekend.

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 is officially available for everyone, but the success of the game has been going on for days. EA Sports has announced that 2.2 million unique players played College Football 25 during the three-day early access period. </p>



<p>On top of that 2.2 million players, another 600,000 players played via the EA Play 10-hour trial that was available.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming previously reported</a>, the original internal expectations for the game were to hit the mid-$100 million for revenue in order to be a “success”. That number, based on the player count who purchased the $99.99 Deluxe Edition, has already been surpassed. Just simple math puts the game at around $220 million in Deluxe Edition sales already.</p>



<p>“There was a feeling that we had something special based on the trailer views and interactions online, but the way it’s transitioned to actual sales and players has me lost for words,” one source said earlier this week.</p>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1813973638275850649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mat Piscatella of Circana</a> said that the game was third in US daily active users on Xbox behind just Call of Duty and Fortnite. On PlayStation 5, it was fourth behind Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Grand Theft Auto 5. </p>



<p>College Football 25 is available now for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

              <section>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the biggest points against any sort of augmented reality, mixed reality, or virtual reality is that the headsets are just too big and bulky. "Once they're just like wearing a pair of glasses," people will often say, "then I'll be more interested." Well, the latest iteration of Viture's virtual display glasses, the Viture Pro XR, are about the closest I've seen a device get to that point.</p><p dir="ltr">True to its name, the Viture Pro XR is an XR or "mixed reality" headset that works as a virtual display. While it's not an all-in-one device like the Apple Vision Pro, you can hook up the Viture Pro XR to a wide range of devices and use it as a monitor for office work, a personal home theater for watching movies or YouTube, or a giant screen for gaming. The screen reaches up to 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Best of all, they look like a chunky pair of sunglasses. While you won't be mistaking these for a pair of Ray-Bans, they nonetheless sport a design that looks unmistakably like sunglasses--ones that just project a giant screen in both lenses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328837-vitureproxr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328837-vitureproxr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328837"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro XR glasses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328837-vitureproxr.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We tested the Viture Pro XR over the last few weeks, specifically to determine its viability for gaming. After several sessions across multiple games and consoles, it's fair to say the Viture Pro XR lives up to its promise as an affordable virtual display--once everything is set up and the glasses are finally on your head, the experience is largely great. But, as you'll see, it can take some trial and error get to that point.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Setup</h2><p dir="ltr">Depending on which devices you use the Viture Pro XR glasses with, the setup is either super simple, or annoyingly cumbersome.</p><p dir="ltr">The core components are simple enough to get together--the glasses attach to whatever external devices you're watching via a USB-C cable that secures magnetically to the end of the right arm of the glasses, attaching just above the ear. If you're using the glasses with a device that supports DisplayPort over USB-C--such as a Steam Deck, iPhone 15, and select laptops--this is all you need to connect the two. However, desktop PCs and consoles like the PS5 or Xbox will require an additional HDMI adapter, and the Switch needs and entire separate battery pack before you can use the glasses with it--and these extra dongles and attachments require separate purchases on top of the Viture Pro XR's normal $450 price tag.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of which devices you're connected to, you will need to be seated relatively close to it since the Viture Pro XR uses a hardwired USB-C connection, and the included cable is only four feet long. This is less of an issue when using it with a portable device like a Steam Deck, Switch, smartphone, or laptop since those devices are going to be kept nearby anyway. Using it with a console or desktop PC, however, is more cumbersome. For example, you won't be able to sit back on your couch and play PS5 from across the room. You'll need to be seated right next to it for the cable to reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, the spacing considerations are less of an issue if you're using a nearby portable device or seated at a desk next to your PC, but it's the first or several small limitations that hamper the Viture Pro XR's viability for many users.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the Viture Pro XR glasses are connected to your PC, smartphone, or console, you'll next need to adjust the fit and focus to match your head and eyes. While the glasses themselves are somewhat bulky--no one is going to mistake these for a real pair of sunglasses--they are light enough to stay comfortable for longer play sessions. The trick is making sure you find the right fit for the nose rest. The glasses come with multiple nose rest shapes and sizes, and it's very quick and easy to swap them out. Unfortunately, in my case, I never quite found the "perfect" option for my face since different bits rest at different points on your nose, which affects the viewing angle of the screens inside the lenses. The issue was compounded by my ears being drastically uneven on the sides of my head, so glasses were always slightly askew or uncomfortable--which is a problem I encounter with all glasses. Others will likely find them much more comfortable to wear--one my colleagues with evenly aligned ears found them to be quite comfy--and I appreciate that users get multiple nose rest options out of the box. I do wish there were more customization options like extendable/retractable arm lengths and pivot points for folks like me with uneven ears.</p><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, dialing in the focus on the screens themselves was a cinch. There is a keystone dial on top of each lens that you turn to adjust the focus. I don't wear glasses in my daily life, so there wasn't much adjustment needed, but there seems to be a decent range to help folks match their eyesight.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Viewing experience</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328839-viture2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328839" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328839-viture2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328839"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro XR glasses, battery pack, and Xbox wireless controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328839-viture2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you can see, depending on which devices you use them with, it can take a bit to get the Viture Pro XR set up and ready. But once you finally have them on and are playing a game, the experience is excellent--mostly.</p><p dir="ltr">The screens themselves are bright and clear, delivering 1080p picture quality at just the right display size to keep the picture crisp. One thing to note is that there's a noticeable yellow tint to the picture, which is by design to help reduce eye strain. This does affect the colors, but it isn't detrimental. For my part, I tested them on Steam Deck and PS5, and I found the picture quality to be excellent. Another GameSpot editor tested them on Xbox Series X and experienced comparable performance to the PS5<strong>.</strong> My biggest concern was the possibility of input lag, but I was able to play multiple hours of Final Fantasy XVI, Elden Ring, and Returnal without any issues. However, the Steam Deck offered the best experience. The setup is <em>mostly </em>plug-and-play--no additional dongles needed-- through you'll need to download and install the official Viture XR Steam Deck plugin first. Best of all, you can play directly with the Steam Deck's handheld controls. Moreso than any device we tested the glasses with, the Viture Pro XR feels best as an accompaniment for Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for a way to play PS5, PC, Xbox Series X|S, or Steam Deck games while someone else is using the TV and you don't want to be stuck with a tiny screen, the Viture Pro XR is a great solution. The same cannot be said for the Nintendo Switch, unfortunately.</p><p dir="ltr">While the experience on Switch ultimately became just as smooth as the other platforms, it didn't start out that way. On my initial tests, almost every Switch game experienced performance dips when connected to the Viture Pro XR--that is, until I updated my Switch's firmware a few days later and the performance was suddenly improved. Nowhere in the setup manual or other documentation does Viture mention the Switch firmware needs to be updated for them to work properly, and there's nothing within the latest patch notes to indicate issues specific to the glasses were part of the update, so it's possible such issues could crop up again later. Nevertheless, even though the glasses eventually worked as intended on the Switch, I still found them less enjoyable to use with Nintendo's handheld due to the cumbersome extra setup required. You'll need to connect the undocked Switch to a separate battery pack via USB-C. Both devices are then secured with a plastic case (that's also surprisingly difficult to get the Switch out of). Finally, the glasses are then plugged into the battery case, which charges both the glasses and the Switch while in use. You can only play with detached Joy-Con controllers, but that's actually not much of an issue since the Switch and portable battery combo is heavy. Still, the lack of a true handheld mode like Steam Deck was a letdown.</p><p dir="ltr">While I have reservations about the Viture Pro XR's user experience on Switch, the other platforms were much more enjoyable, especially Steam Deck. Nevertheless, there are some smaller quibbles worth mentioning. Most notable is the field of view.</p><p dir="ltr">The Viture Pro XR's virtual screens are surprisingly big, and while that is great for immersion, the experience is hampered somewhat because--just like with a regular pair of sunglasses--your peripheral surroundings are always visible while wearing the glasses. Even worse, at some viewing angles, the projected screens inside the glasses can also appear bigger than what's visible in the lenses. Expect to try out multiple nose rests to find the proper viewing angle, but if parts of the screen aren't visible even after finding the right nose piece, you can also adjust the screen display area in your console or PC's settings to make them fit.</p><p dir="ltr">I also ran into a strange issue with the glasses' transparency toggle. The left arm of the glasses includes brightness controls and a button to toggle the glasses' transparency, letting you see through the glasses or block out whatever is directly in front of you with a single press. However, when two pairs of glasses were connected to a device at once--which Viture lists as a standard feature of the Pro XR--the screens would freeze and glitch out with static and image artifacts for a few seconds whenever one of the glasses' transparency buttons were toggled. While it's a very specific issue that wouldn't necessarily affect the watching experience unless one of the two people were constantly changing the transparency setting, it's still a notable glitch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328841-viture1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328841" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328841-viture1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328841"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro XR Glasses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4328841-viture1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While those issues did impact the viewing experience, the Viture Pro XR's baseline visual quality is excellent and worked as intended most of the time. The same is also true of the Viture Pro XR's audio quality. In fact, I would say the audio is what I was most impressed with overall. I never ran into any issues, and while I wouldn't say the built-in open-back speakers can stack up to a good pair of headphones or a high-end gaming headset, they were clear and loud enough to do justice to Elden Ring boss fights. Even better, despite being external speakers, they have surprisingly minimal noise bleed; while I was hearing Bayle the Dread's bombastic boss theme, my wife, sitting just a few feet away, said she could barely tell any sound was playing at all.</p><p dir="ltr">And I think that example perfectly describes the Viture Pro XR: When they work, they're great, but the handful of quirks can quickly add up and can limit their usability. That's true of all AR, VR, or XR devices these days, and this is no exception.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Viture Pro XR vs. Viture One XR</h2><p dir="ltr">The Viture Pro XR are just the latest version of the company's XR sunglasses. The previously released Viture One XR and One Lite models are also available, and while the Pro XR eclipses both in terms of specs, they are still similar enough that some users may be wondering whether the Pro XR's higher cost are worth it. The biggest difference is the screens. The XR's screen is larger and brighter, with a wider field of view and higher refresh rate. However, since it's larger, the pixel density is slightly lower on the Pro than the One. While that likely won't be a dealbreaker for most people, it's still worth noting. Another major difference is the that the One and One Lite lack the electromagnetic film on the lenses, which means you need to use physical lens covers to block external light. The Lite also uses a standard USB connection behind the right ear, rather than the proprietary magnetic connectors on the Pro and One.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond physical design and specs, the other difference is device compatibility. The Pro XR and One support the same list of devices--including gaming consoles--while the One Lite only works with PCs, laptops, smartphones, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Lenovo Go.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2><p dir="ltr">The Viture Pro XR achieves what it sets out to do, the technology is sound, and it works great if it fits into your setup and lifestyle--the problem is that the Viture Pro XR's use case feels extremely niche right now, especially given the setup hurdles and uneven device support. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a pair of XR glasses for virtual computing or privacy reasons--and you can work around its quirks--the Viture Pro XR glasses are great once you have them on and are easily one of the most affordable XR displays out there.</p><hr><p><em>Viture provided a product sample for the purpose of this review.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/taliesin-jaffe-talks-asha-of-critical-role-downfall-monk-builds-and-what-ashton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role Campaign 3 has begun airing its three-episode prequel special titled <em>Critical Role Downfall</em>. Set in the far past this adventure is the memories of the city of Aeor before it's fall. We had a chance to talk with Taliesin Jaffe earlier this week to learn about his character Asha, her role in Downfall, and how the events of this prequel could affect Ashton of Bells Hells.</p>
<p><em>Critical Role Downfall</em> covers episodes 99-101 of Campaign 3. The game is being DM'd by <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b853d22b-df8b-43ab-afaf-0e3829194c09" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/brennan-lee-mulligan-discusses-sean-finnerty-importance-of-laughing-at-fear-and">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>&nbsp;(<em>Dimension 20, Game Changer</em>) who previously worked with Critical Role for Calamity. Joining Jaffe at the table are fellow co-creators of Critical Role Laura Bailey (<em>Critical Role, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us: Part II</a></em>) and Ashley Johnson (<em>Critical Role, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us: Part II</a></em>), as well as Noshir Dalal (<em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a1550c58-472a-4d2d-93f5-1d2835ab0eaa" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mortal-kombat-1-preview">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em>), Nick Marina (<em>Cobra Kai, Chicago Med</em>), and Abubakar Salim (<em>House of the Dragon, Tales of Kenzera</em>).</p>
<p>As someone who absolutely loved but was scarred by the events of Critical Role Calamity I first wanted to know how Jaffe had felt knowing that he was entering a similar kind of situation with Brennan Lee Mulligan helming the story. "Boy, I was really excited"</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//bsS-aGTq-_4"></iframe></p>
<p>"I'm full enough of myself that I'm very rarely intimidated by other human beings [...] so I knew he was going to bring something very challenging and I was really glad that I was picked for this," Jaffe continued to explain "This kind of thing is my jam"</p>
<p>Later on in our discussion Jaffe hoped that viewers of episode 2 will realise that "Brennan is so cruel and mean, but in a good way. He's very good at finding the specific aspects of our characters that matter to us and really hurting us with that, on a fundamental level"</p>
<h2>Asha, Mortal Aspect Of The Wild Mother</h2>
<p>In talking about Asha Jaffe revealed that playing as a mortal aspect of the Wild Mother wasn't his first choice. "At one point I asked if I could be a Betrayer God because I've got a great idea"</p>
<p>After pitching some of those ideas to Matthew Mercer, the creator of the world of Critical Role, Mercer explained that there were a lot of 'lore things' that were unknown to Jaffe.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asha-cr-downfall_0.jpg?itok=yBcy4wde 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asha-cr-downfall_0.jpg?itok=upLIOqTF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"I had a Moonweaver idea and just seeing the way the cast was coming together, and Brennen was very much like 'can you find a different opinion going into it?', especially with Noshir coming in with [The Emissary] it was great because it was essentially the same opinion from two very different vantage points. My take on the Wild Mother has always been a little weird"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was glad to come in and take the essential philosophy I had been putting forward with Caduceus and make a version of what I call 'Perhaps I didn't make myself clear'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing the animalistic take on the Wild Mother I noted that the performance Jaffe was giving was accentuating the 'Wild' whereas previous times we've been given a glimpse of the power of the Wild Mother - Especially for Campaign 2 characters Fjord (Travis Willingham) and Caduceus (Jaffe) - she has seemed more mothering.</p>
<p>The quick and simple response I received was that she is nurturing "when things are better"</p>
<p>Talking about what Asha and the Wild Mother were doing prior to the events of Downfall Jaffe revealed "Things are not great, she doens't have a lot of followers and even the natural world [...] is kind of gone or dead"</p>

<p>"Backstory that doesn't really get hit up [Asha] found herself a little patch of forest, hidden away. It is the 100 Acre Woods or the 'Mad Max Thunderdome' little chunk of forest and that's where the food that they're bringing in is from. She's basically started up a cult and that's where those people are. People who wander in are like Tthis is what I want' and she's like 'Great, you live by my rules and if you fuck up I kill you."</p>
<p>Taking on the form of the Wolf was also a deliberate result of the kind of world that the Gods are facing pre-Downfall. As a Wolf Asha is able to take action and it serves to remove that level of compassion and empathy for the human world.</p>
<h2>What Is Asha's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Build?</h2>
<p>Wanting to know a bit more about how Asha was built mechanically I wanted to hear from Jaffe what type of elf she was, being a wolf normally but Wild Shaping into an Elf. Asking whether she was a Lythari Elf Jaffe clarified "No, her actual incarnated for is basically a wolf or direwolf. I essentially dropped one of the feat options of my level 20 build and took what was a Wild Shape but could only do one thing which was to Wild Shape into an Elven form at will as a matter of convenience."</p>
<p>Jaffe began to describe the different situations where Asha would be aware that being humanoid would be easier to get by in comparison to a Wolf. He also revealed that when Asha does "talk it is slow and broken. It's not a muscle that works very well. I don't know if that reads as often as I like but it's almost entirely telepathic.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I essentially dropped one of the feat options of my level 20 build and took what was a Wild Shape"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As regular listener of Critical Role I had remembered Jaffe in the past stating that they had a Monk cooked up for the next EXU. I only got part way into my question before Jaffe cut in to let me know that while Asha is a Monk, Asha isn't the Monk he'd been thinking about.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asha-introduction.jpg?itok=TKc-D_pP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asha-introduction.jpg?itok=C75SokKQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taliesin introduces Asha to the table and the viewers, the binary on her passport reads NATURE</figcaption></figure><p>"That was one of my pitches, that Monk, but I was given a lot of reasons not to do that. I'm going to save them for a future game. That Monk is still going to come along but this was definitely 'I wanted to, but no'"</p>
<p>Wanting to dive more into the mechanics of Asha's build Jaffe played his explanation very close to the chest. He decided that he didn't want to reveal which subclass she was a part of, and not remembering whether her very specific weapon was revealed in Episode 2 or 3 he didn't touch on that either.</p>
<p>"Other than a weapon, that I kind of homebrewed, and not even a very complex one the whole notion [of Asha] was somebody who is very grounded."</p>
<p>Where other gods in the party would be able to show off divine powers for Asha he wanted to make a character that was "cool, not necessarily in a God-level way, but more in a Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow way. It's really being more grounded that anyone else in the group."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's nothing anyone on the outside would see and say 'What is that?' It's like 'oh, this is a very dangerous woman'"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Short Story With A Definitive End</h2>
<p>Stepping away from a character that he's been playing since October 2021 Jaffe and I discussed the differences in making a character for such a short adventure. Discussing this we talked about how there isn't room for events to occur and for them to grow with your character Jaffe also added that "Gods don't change really. They are what they are."</p>
<p>"Giant archetype characters, I really love, just because they're immutable. It's hard to change a fundamental notion of the universe but figuring out how to make sure I wasn't always going to be on the same path and could be swayed one way or the other was hard"</p>
<p>There was a definite appeal for Jaffe in just the experience of playing a character at Level 20, something very rare in most Dungeons &amp; Dragons games.</p>
<h2>What Of Taliesin Can Fans Find In Asha</h2>
<p>Jaffe is known to put aspects that are true to him into his characters. For Ashton, it is his character's chronic pain and how that's shaped him, for Asha I wanted to know what part of him was most true within.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-and-caduceus.jpg?itok=TDjsOE03 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-and-caduceus.jpg?itok=hIshH8Lh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Caduceus was a Firbolg Cleric of the Wild Mother from Campaign 2 of Critical Role</figcaption></figure><p>"It's a chunk of what Caduceus was, and perhaps it's a bit of a teenage reaction to being raised by hippies" Jaffe explained "That soft Earth Mother archetype is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but not necessarily my experience of nature."</p>
<p>He then paraphrased a quote from Stephen Fry "People seem to forget that it is in nature without human intervention, nature in it's purest form is all life on Earth leaves a life of starvation and dies violently and that is Nature."</p>
<p>Taking that mentality Jaffe joked that "Caduceus was his nice way of explaining that, and Asha is his mean way of saying it."</p>
<h2>A Family Of Gods</h2>
<p>Having spoken about Asha for some time I wanted to dive into the relationship that she has with others at the table. Talking specifically about the meeting between the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods at the end of episode 1 I commended everyone on their ability to play such a convincing family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked what kind of prep work was done to establish these relations I once again got a short but sweet answer, "none."</p>
<p>Jaffe continued "Roleplayers roleplaying and I can see what Brennan didn't want us to play Betrayer Gods. Honestly, all of us did the 'Can we be a Betrayer God?' but that was quickly squashed."</p>

<p>"I had never really given much thought on the gods as people in Exandria, and treating them more as a family, I don't know how it hadn't occurred to me that they have personality, that they are more of a roman/greecian pantheon."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Years of D&amp;D have numbed me to the notion that Gods are just engines for Paladin"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While he's been playing D&amp;D since High School Jaffe explained that Gods in the games have always felt just like additional rules and that he never really enjoyed the way that they interfaced into the game. "This is the first time I'm going 'Oh wow, these guys are actually cool. How have I not known this for over a decade?"</p>
<p>"I realized also that Asha had a favorite sibling and that they were a Betrayer God and I was like 'oh my god, this is weird that I'm suddenly having this very intense love for one of the characters.'"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Honestly, I wish we'd had nine more episodes. This is three episodes and I want to spend more time with each character including the NPC"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Active Listening Makes A Good D&amp;D Player</h2>
<p>Noticing Jaffe moving as Asha even when the audience might not notice amid other conversations I asked how he feels remaining in character enhances his performance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-facial-reaction-critical-role-downfall.jpg?itok=s2Nq6dUH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-facial-reaction-critical-role-downfall.jpg?itok=p-4gbaDb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jaffe embodies Asha as he focuses on active speakers with a 'Wild' look</figcaption></figure><p>"It's Active Listening, there's nothing worse for a D&amp;D game that people who don't listen," Jaffe talked on experiences of poetry readings in coffee houses where poets would leave as soon as their part was over. "You're supposed to be participating. You should be the audience you want. 90% of being a player at a D&amp;D table is being the audience for your friends and that's more important, at least for me."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"90% of being a player at a D&amp;D table is being the audience for your friends"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaffe continued to explain that the importance of engaging when you're part of the audience isn't just to show interest but without paying attention "you're not going to be as interesting, you're not going to have enough to say, you're not going to be able to relate to these people"</p>
<p>"I also love physicality for characters, being in that mindspace means you're sitting there forming opinions, forming notions of the things you want to do with the other players, the things you want to say."</p>
<p>Joking about his specific situation at the Critical Role table Jaffe also added "Especially when you're at a table with people who are really talented it's really easy to look like an idiot"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-in-costume.jpg?itok=ZauEFq61 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/taliesin-jaffe-in-costume.jpg?itok=wvVKtZwr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taliesin Jaffe emerging in costume at The Greek for Episode 98 of Critical Role Campaign 3</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does Ashton of Bells Hells Think Of Downfall?</h2>
<p>Ashton, one of Bells Hells most cynical critics of the Gods, is another active viewer of the events of Downfall. Talking on how Ashton might be processing the revelations of this three episode event Jaffe admitted "I didn't know until we actually got there, it was such an intense experience for me that relating it to [Ashton] is hard"</p>
<p>"Ashton has been really trying to fix the things that are fucking up their life because there's not enough time left to blow up [his] life three more times."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't even know how to answer that because I'm still working it out myself"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having to decide on some semblance of an answer Jaffe remarked "It definitely both made things worse and better. [...] Is it better that you know the Gods are people or is it worse?"</p>
<p>While not revealing much for the conclusion of Downfall Jaffe did simply state that there will be some "interesting moments" before bursting out into laughter that he simply didn't know how else to put it.</p>

What drew you to bring horror to racing?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For those who don’t know, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was originally a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fan game before it was rebranded. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had a community in-joke about a kart racer spin-off, and that’s where I got the inspiration from!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What interesting elements did horror bring to the idea of a racing game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I loved how a health bar changed the entire feel of the game. Most kart racers don’t have health, so seeing racers get beat up by power-ups before exploding in a gruesome death definitely contributed to the game’s identity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In what ways do you feel this mechanic alters the emotions players go through while playing? How does it alter the feel of the racing play compared to other racing games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The simple act of having a health bar that can result in death in a kart racer makes it feel more visceral. It makes players feel more fragile, seeing as a death sends them to the back of the pack or gives them a Game Over during boss fights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> offers an array of grisly beings and unsettling beasts as racers. Can you tell us a bit about how you designed the various characters and the opponents we race against?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The enemies that weren’t directly inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were pulled from the "generic Halloween spooky" side of culture. Things like walking skeletons, mummies, or evil corvids felt appropriate.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what ideas went into creating the equally unique vehicles in the game? How did you create such a variety of vehicles that all felt on-theme?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each kart is "owned" by one of the characters. When I designed the karts, I designed them as an extension of the characters. For example, Mistress Marie, keeper of the clocktower, rides a clock-themed kart.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts go into creating unique karts based on the type of monster that rides them?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I viewed the kart that was assigned to each racer as an extension of them. Mistress Mary of the Great Clocktower needed a kart and making it clock-themed made sense! The Outsider’s story was that he restrained himself on an operating table before he turned into a werewolf, and that's where the operating table kart idea came from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This game is not just about going fast, but also attacking your fellow racers. Can you tell us about how you chose the weapons for the game and how you developed them to be used and aimed by someone racing around complex tracks?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course! The first power-up that I made was the pistol. I liked the idea of using "rated M" weapons for a kart racer, as that is uncommon, and I wanted to make weapons that fit the horror theme. They, of course, were originally based on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> weapons, but even then, the idea of having a blood-soaked axe, a giant rusty razer, or a lever-action shotgun felt appropriate to the theme.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What ideas went into the other things players could do while rushing around (shooting beasts to increase speed, doing tricks, etc)?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the ideas came from using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like mechanics and grafting them onto a kart racer. It was kind of like how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Smash Brothers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses the mechanical identity of their characters and translates them into a fighting game.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us about some of the </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>-like mechanics you brought into this racing game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The countering system is what comes to mind immediately. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, attacking opens the player to countering by an enemy bullet. This means that randomly flailing around constantly is disincentivized and forces the player to be more considerate of their approach. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it’s drifting that opens players up to countering via enemy bullets. Drifting is one of the core mechanics of kart racers, so it felt appropriate to make it vulnerable to countering in this "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-inspired" kart racer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into how the weapons would operate (aiming, firing) while racing around a track? What thoughts went into things like weapon effects, firing speeds, trajectories, and the like when your battle arena involves racing around complex tracks?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first power-up I made was the pistol. I wanted it to be similar to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which skipped manual aiming and simply had the hunter fire toward the lock-on target to keep the pace of combat from slowing down. Skipping manual aiming and having the racer shoot toward an auto-lock-on target also keeps the player focusing on racing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to deciding the balance of the power-ups and levels, it’s a simple example of testing the game over and over again and “adjusting the dials” (so to speak) when it comes to effects, speeds, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nightmare Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> features boss battles as well. What ideas go into designing a boss fight in a horror racing game? How did you create interesting boss battles for your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea of boss battles was born from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like mechanical inspiration, but they also offered an opportunity to house all the unique ideas I had. Ideas like a platforming segment or a maze for players to get lost in (which normally wouldn’t work in the "race/battle mode" dichotomy the game exists within) could work in a boss fight, as those operate under a unique rule set.</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horror is often dark and gloomy, but having to fire weapons and race around opponents requires visual clarity to know where to drive and shoot. How did you create a world that felt bleak and foreboding while preserving the visual clarity players would need to keep things from being frustrating?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, due to the dark environment, creating a gameplay overlay was relatively easy: just make it bright! The lock-on icon is a white glow, the power ups were white flares, guns shoot white bullets, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to use a PSX visual style for the game? How did this affect the look and feel of the experience? How did it affect the design of the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My previous game was a PSX demake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and seeing as this was originally </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-themed, the assets carried over from that project. I am personally a big fan of the low-poly look, and it also made asset creation slightly easier as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to make a low-poly remake of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> in the first place?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was first introduced to the concept of video game demakes via a Neo Gaf forum in 2017 where people were making mock-up fake screenshots of popular games on older hardware. My favorite game is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and I had fond memories of the PS1 era (and it felt like it would fit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s aesthetic the best). The rest is history!</span></p><p>Images via LWMedia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to release the game for free?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game was always planned to be free, seeing as it was a fan game. Now that the game is an original design and IP, I could have put a price tag on it at the last second, but I felt like it might leave people feeling like they were bamboozled. So, I kept it free.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On that topic though, releasing the game for free released a lot of pressure on the players' side. A lot of discussion around a game is intrinsic to its perceived value compared to its actual asking price, and if the game is free, that all goes out the window. As a result, discussion around the game felt a lot more laid back (in a positive way!), and I still got money from it due to Itch.io’s "pay what you want" payment method, so it was a win-win for everyone!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Maybe Game Demos Aren’t Always A Good Thing]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/game-demos-schim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maybe-game-demos-aren%E2%80%99t-always-a-good-thing.932004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-demos-schim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in May, I wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/schim-demo-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the demo for shadow-platforming game <em>SCHiM</em></a>, a neat-looking indie game I’d been excited about for a while. The full game came out yesterday for PC and consoles; if you played the demo, it’s basically more of that. Maybe <em>too</em> much more, which is not something I expected to feel, and which is making me think a lot about the strengths and pitfalls of the recent glut of Steam demos.</p><p>I write a lot about <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/steam-next-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos</a> on Aftermath. It’s not a beat I intended to create; instead, they’re a good way for me to cover a lot of games without spending a ton of time or money, two things that are in much shorter supply than they used to be now that I own my own site. I like that I can give readers hands-on impressions of smaller or unknown games that they can also check out, instead of writing up a press preview that has limited access and feeds into the marketing machine. And while I’m not in the business of telling anyone what their time or money is worth, I know that things are tough all over, so I appreciate that money won’t be a barrier to a reader checking out a demo I wrote about if they’re interested. And, apart from work, demos are a good way for me to get a sense of whether I might like a game that I’ve either been hearing about or stumbled across.</p><p>With events like Next Fest, Steam has been leaning hard into demos of late, which has definitely increased my awareness of them. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ajbqhx/why_do_demos_have_such_a_big_comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent thread on a game dev subreddit</a>, some developers said they found an increase in wishlists following demos, which help <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/wishlist#:~:text=A%3A%20Wishlists%20can%20be%20an,game%20is%20on%20their%20wishlist." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost a game’s visibility</a>, or at least remind interested potential players when a game comes out. Others in the thread posited that demos can lead to press and influencer coverage that can help a game, or that demos have become more valuable as more players feel <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-days-before-this-day-in-the-day-before" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burned by games that don’t live up to their marketing hype</a>. Others, however, also saw downsides: that people get their fix of a game from its demo and don’t subsequently buy it, or that demos can hurt larger games, or those that already have strong marketing, more than they help. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that making a demo is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/should-you-release-a-demo-for-your-game-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of work</a>, and that there’s no guarantee they’re <a href="https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an accurate representation</a> of a full game.</p><p>Which brings me back to <em>SCHiM</em>, a game I’d been excited about since its reveal and whose demo I really enjoyed. A quick recap: You play as a little shadow guy, which is a splotch with adorable googly eyes, who becomes detached from their person and has to find their way back to him. In the full game, you do that across 65 levels of various lengths by jumping from shadow to shadow. Hopping between stationary objects gives way to catching rides on passersby or cars, bouncing off signs or clotheslines, solving little environmental puzzles to create new shadows, or timing your jumps between flickering lights.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SCHiM - Launch Trailer | PC &amp; Consoles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4p8ZWSSAhXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The demo gave a glimpse of the narrative that, as a truncated slice, felt a little confusing. Seeing the full story, told wordlessly, made it compelling and surprisingly moving. You watch the person go through some struggles–a breakup, losing his job, going back to what I think is his hometown to recuperate–and it’s a relatable narrative premise that definitely made me feel for the person and want to see his story through.</p><p>But in terms of gameplay, you mostly do the same thing in the demo you do in the full game. This isn’t a knock–you would hope a demo would be an accurate slice!–but the trouble came for me once I realized that while <em>SCHiM</em>’s bigger levels are creative–traversing a giant automated factory, or exploring the different enclosures at a zoo–and they’re a lot of fun to move through, the game never quite does anything new with the core mechanic the demo shows off. After the first 20 or so levels showed me what the game had to offer, the experience started to feel draggy and repetitive. Despite the number of levels, the game itself only takes a handful of hours to complete, so it doesn’t quite wear out its welcome, but I found myself ready to be done with it far sooner than I expected to when I first booted up the full game, eager to have more of the experience I’d enjoyed so much in the demo.</p><p>When I imagined what I would tell a friend if they asked me about <em>SCHiM</em>, the first response that came to mind was, “The full game is cool, but you could really just play the demo.” It made me wonder if the demo actually hurt the full game for me, showing me the best of what <em>SCHiM</em> had to offer in a way that made the full game feel disappointing. Would I have been less dissatisfied with the shape of the game if the shortened experience of the demo hadn’t been so strong?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/developers-tell-us-why-early-access-games-are-better-than-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing popularity of early access games</a>, as players we know how we can burn ourselves out on a game or develop opinions on something that isn’t finished. Do demos have the same problem? Early access games are works-in-progress; while demos are as well, they’re also curated experiences, whether on Steam or at a convention or press event. Designing one is surely a careful balancing act between representing a game well and leaving players wanting more, a careful line to walk with pitfalls on both sides.</p><p>I still essentially enjoyed <em>SCHiM</em>; it’s charming and, as I wrote in May, “feels like <em>play</em> in the way games can sometimes lose sight of.” But it’s weird to feel like the demo was <em>better</em> than the full game, whose only major difference from the demo was that it was longer. For all a demo’s potential strengths, maybe it’s better to experience a game in its entirety once it’s ready, to have the experience developers are <em>actually</em> making and not one designed with the extraneous variables of marketing and Steam wishlists in mind.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An ESRB listing has appeared for a game called&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, potentially suggesting that a sequel to the popular PvPvE shooter is in the works.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rating</a>&nbsp;is, as you'd probably expect from a followup to&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, Mature 17+ owing to "blood and gore" and "violence". The listing also warns that the game will contain in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hunt-showdown">the first game</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, whatever it turns out to be, will be set in the Victorian era and will revolve around the use of "bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols" to kill both monsters and other players, according to the ESRB.</p>

<p>According to the ESRB, the game will feature a type of zombie that "explodes into blood and viscera when killed", as well as another one that wears "human skin as a cape". Well, we've all had some pretty extreme Friday nights, no?</p>
<p>I'm not a&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>aficionado, but I'm pretty sure the aforementioned descriptions don't neatly fit any of the game's existing monsters, so&nbsp;<em>1896 </em>could&nbsp;be a followup or a new game rather than an expanded re-release of the original.</p>
<p>Sadly, we haven't had an official announcement from Crytek yet, so we'll have to fall back on speculation and this ESRB rating for now. Hopefully, we'll hear something more in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible that this is the name Crytek is giving to the current-gen version of&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, which is due to arrive sometime after the PS4 and Xbox One versions are <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/hunt-showdown-to-sunset-on-ps4-xbox-one-from-15th-of-august" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sunsetted in August</a>.</p>
<p>That new version is set to <a href="https://www.crytek.com/news/hunt-showdown-reveals-upgrade-coming-15th-august-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bring an engine change</a>, UI improvements, and a new map to the game, among other things, although Crytek has already announced the relaunch without referring to it as&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>.</p>
<p>It's all to play for right now, so watch this space for any further information from Crytek. Until then, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/hunt-showdown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hunt-showdown/9ncmq9dxgxf6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hunt-showdown-review-bayou-bounty-blues">take a look at our review here</a> to see how it shakes out.</p>
