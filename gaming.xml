			<p>Firaxis has launched the next update for Civilization VII, which has made some of the changes listed from the content roadmap that they released. Most of the content from the update are updates and suggestions that have been left by the community and the feedback provided. Below are some of the highlights of the update.</p>
<p>First is the new Natural Wonder that all players will be able to discover for free, which is the Bermuda Triangle. Cross-play between PC and consoles will also be re-enabled when this update releases. The update includes UI adjustments and addressing reported issues from the dedicated community.</p>
<p>For those that manage to make it to the Modern Age, there have now been some major changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory, as AI leaders have now been given a better opportunity at completing a Cultural Victory. This means that players can expect to see fewer Explorer Unit stacks scattered across the map.</p>
<p>Those going for a Religious Victory will now be able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. When players create their own Missionary Units, they will automatically follow the player's chosen Religion.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-disperse-an-independent-power-in-civilization-7/">Dispersing Independent Powers</a> is a large part of Civilization VII, and previously, land units were the only ones able to disperse them. Now, Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers, which can be incredibly helpful if you don't have units in that area.</p>
<p>Along with this update, it's announced that the first in-game event that was planned for Civilization VII will instead be postponed to a later update. This includes future events as well, with them all taking a backseat so that the developers can focus on prioritizing quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide.</p>
<p>After today's update, there will then be another major update taking place this month, with Update 1.1.1 of Civilization VII slated for March 25 (subject to change). This will add in the Quick Move functionality, as well as the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities and a new Natural Wonder, which is available to all players.</p>
<p>Looking even further into the future, the developers are planning on adding new map sizes for all platforms except Nintendo Switch, mod tools and Steam Workshop support, and further customizations that can be made to a player's game.</p>
<p>If you want the nitty-gritty of each change made in today's update to Civilization VII, or any future updates, you can find the information on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Civilization VII website</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Sony has announced the new PlayStation Beta program. You may remember participating in previous limited-time beta programs for various system updates for PlayStation consoles, but this will be a unified Beta program going forward. Sony says it will be an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up for future beta testing across a wide range of PlayStation experiences.</p>
<p>With a single sign-up to the Beta Program at PlayStation, users may register their interest in testing access to participating games for the PlayStation 5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on the official PlayStation website. Interested users only need to register to be considered for all these different betas, and if they receive an invitation to a specific beta, it's of course up to them to decide whether to take part.</p>
<p>Here are the requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players must have a valid PlayStation Network account in good standing with a current email address. Accounts with restrictions or violations may not be eligible.</li>
<li>Players must live in the region where the PlayStation Beta program is available on PlayStation. For example, it is not yet available in Italy, as well as likely in many other countries across the world at this time.</li>
<li>Players must be of legal age in their region.</li>
<li>It's free to join, and registration is open worldwide from today <a href="http://playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this address</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sony also clarifies that sometimes there simply may be more interest than they can accommodate. Joining the PlayStation Beta program will allow you to be considered for beta participation, but it doesn't guarantee that you will be selected for a beta test.</p>

            <p>
Monolith Productions co-founder Jace Hall has expressed a strong interest in remaking rancid horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> and its sequel, Condemned 2: Bloodshot. It's not entirely clear how he'd do this, given that Monolith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">no longer exists even as a brand name</a>, following cuts at parent company Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, and that Hall himself doesn't seem to be directly involved with game development or publishing these days. That said, he <em>is</em> the sole current owner of the Condemned intellectual property. So if a remake is going to happen, it'll need to happen through him.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All this comes in the form of a single tweet, following a grieving Monolith fan's request to "make the Condemned 1 &amp; 2 Remake &amp; quite f**king around". Hall <a href="https://x.com/JaceHall/status/1896149517063663708">responded</a>: "I will see what may be possible. Absolutely no promises. Please have ZERO expectations. This will take me some time."
</p>
<p>
Hall left Monolith in 2003 - two years before Criminal Origins launched on Xbox 360 - to work in an executive role at Warner. While at Warner, he co-led plans for a Condemned connected universe, spilling into the realm of film, but these ambitions never quite came to fruition. Hall departed Warner in 2008 to work at a string of outfits broadly concerned with game-as-service business models, entertainment production and esports. 
</p>
<p>
Even as he has moved between roles, however, Hall hasn't forgotten about Condemned. Back in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726144727/https://www.facebook.com/JaceHallShow/posts/10152999663109303">wrote on Facebook</a> that "I am consistently asked when a third game might be created" and that he is "contemplating finding an interested and proven Indie development team AND PROVIDING IT TO THEM, so that they can take over the franchise and move it forward".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/condemned-3-would-be-made-without-interference-or-limitations">Ian Games</a> subsequently, Hall reiterated that: "I am going to grant a license to use the Condemned franchise in general, and the chosen developer will be able to pick what kind of game they want to make. They can choose their vision of the content. They can build up momentum. Perhaps a prequel. Perhaps a simple mobile phone app for starters. It's all on the table. I'm open to hearing new ideas."
</p>
<p>
Would you like Condemned to return? I think Criminal Origins is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">a well-crafted horror game</a> with excellently vicious and antsy melee combat, but "well-crafted", here, risks being a justification for the fantasy of playing a cop who beats up homeless people and addicts with a pipe. That the cop's victims have been mutated and driven berserk by a sci-fantasy McGuffin doesn't really counter the argument that the game actively channels hatred towards the less fortunate, though Monolith are hardly the only horror game developers to do this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which game developer I'd trust to bring Condemned back. I guess the quickfix corrective optics would be to turn the tables and have you fight a bunch of deranged and screaming police.

                <p>Ubisoft's Far Cry multiplayer extraction shooter game has reportedly been rebooted as the game--once intended as part of Far Cry 7--has had developers shifted over to the latter game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft moved developers from working on the multiplayer game, called Project Maverick, over to Project Blackbird, which is Far Cry 7. This was reportedly done in December in order to make sure the development of Blackbird stayed on track.</p><p>The decision to reboot Maverick remains unclear, but it was reportedly due to Ubisoft's recent initiative to streamline development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">as it deals with its financial issues</a>. Ubisoft Montreal, the studio leading Maverick and Blackbird, will reportedly take the former back to Ubisoft Sherbrooke for more prototyping.</p><p>Another branch, Ubisoft Berlin, was also reportedly helping out with Maverick, but has seen more of its developers moved over to Blackbird as well as a different project.</p><p>It's unclear when Maverick will be ready for launch. However, some developers reportedly feel confident that Blackbird could still launch in 2026. Playtesting for Blackbird has reportedly already begun, and the feedback was positive, with testers reportedly saying that the game "played great" and apparently changed the traditional Far Cry formula in some ways, including its movement mechanics.</p><p>Maverick was reportedly set in Alaska, at least initially, with players having to survive against harsh weather, wild animals, soldiers, and other players.</p><p>Ubisoft is going through a tumultuous time as it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">closing studios and conducting multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. Ubisoft is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a>, and it sounds like Blackbird and Maverick both fit these templates.</p>

            <p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-latest-map">plenty of whispers and speculation</a>, today Activision confirmed what we were all hoping for: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and 4 are back, and getting remade from the ground up.</p>
<p>The upcoming combined remake will feature new skaters (so, professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">let slip he was part of the game ahead of today's announcement</a>), as well as "gnarlier tricks, an even sicker soundtrack, and, for the first time in 10 years - brand-new parks". That soundtrack will include songs from the original games such as Ace of Spades by Motorhead, as well as new tracks which "capture the spirit of modern skate culture".</p>
<p>The game will also boast cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p>

<p>"Developed with attention to detail by Iron Galaxy Studios and in collaboration with Tony Hawk and Activision, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 picks up seamlessly right where the critically acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> 1 and 2 game left off," the official blurb reads.</p>
<p>"Choose from a legendary pro skater roster that includes Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, and Bob Burnquist, or opt for the new skaters, including Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome. And, in true Tony Hawk's Pro Skater fashion, there will be secrets to unlock."</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store), and Nintendo Switch on 11th July. It will also be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting your hands on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/">you can pre-order now</a>. Those that do will gain access to the Foundry Demo coming in June (although, please note this demo will only be available across PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC), as well as the Wireframe Tony Shader at launch.</p>

<p>If you choose to plump for either the Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition, you will also get earlier access to the full game, beginning 8th July. The Digital Deluxe Edition of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will also give you access to other extras such as Doom Slayer and Revenant characters, in-game skate decks, Create-a-Skater items, and "more".</p>
<p>The Collector's Edition, meanwhile,  includes everything in the Digital Deluxe Edition, but also comes with a Limited-Edition full-size Birdhouse skateboard deck which has a printed Tony Hawk autograph.</p>

<p>Plans to give Pro Skater 3 and 4 the remake treatment were reportedly scrapped after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">Activision made the decision to merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> in 2021. But, that clearly wasn't the end of it after all, and in September last year, Tony Hawk himself teased something was in the pipeline. More pertinently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">Hawk revealed he had been "talking to Activision again" last September</a>, and added these talks were " insanely exciting" and he was "working on something" with the studio.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to get back on your boards when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 releases this summer?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He also has a fully charged Ultimate, letting you use the most powerful ability of any character being played. Double up on defensive ultimates, use a powerful offensive ultimate, then enjoy a few seconds playing as that character before reverting to Loki. Incredibly powerful and flexible, and one reason why Loki players have so much room for self-expression in how they play him.</p><p><strong>Regeneration Domain</strong> (LB) - One of the most powerful abilities in the entire game, Regeneration Domain spawns at your feet and those of each of your Doppelgangers. It reverses damage, converting it to healing, meaning it can completely negate enemy Ultimates and a wide range of attacks. Because of this, you can save an enemy across the map by spawning a Doppelganger next to them and activating the Domain. Incredibly powerful and worth more than its weight in gold. <em>(Can game moves have mass? -Ed)</em></p><p><strong>Doppelganger</strong> (Right Click / RB) - The key to Loki’s movement and enemy confusion. Creates a duplicate of himself which will remain immobile but imitate his actions. Because of this, it’s best to stand still when trying to confuse enemies, since only the <em>real </em>Loki could be strafing and jumping around. Attacks from Doppelgangers still deal damage to enemies and heal allies, so you always want to have two (the maximum) Doppelgangers out.</p><p><strong>Devious Exchange</strong> (B / Circle) - Switches places with whichever Doppelganger you are looking at. A fantastic way to move around the map, avoid enemy attacks, or get closer to the action. Always keep them guessing.</p><p><strong>Backstab</strong> (R3) - Loki has a melee attack, and it (appropriately) does more damage when attacking from behind. Remind them all how much betrayal stings.</p><p><strong>Deception</strong> (LT) - Turn invisible until you turn it off. A glorious way to avoid enemies, and it creates a Doppelganger at the location where you first activated it, making it a way to jump-start your duplicitous ‘shell game.’</p><p><strong>Laufeyson Reborn</strong> (Team-Up Ability: Y / Triangle) - Teaming up with Hela, Loki can be revived instantly if Hela gets a final blow while you are respawning. If you are still alive, you get Bonus Health instead. Nice bonus to playing with Hela.</p><h2 id="h8052"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play Loki?</strong></h2><p>Loki has an incredibly high ceiling, but he is also a competent healer and damager even without optimizing your trickery. For starters, make sure you always have two Doppelgangers out when engaging in battle. The clones will fire at your targets from wherever they are, meaning you can easily triangulate, sniping from upper angles (hitting enemies over walls and other obstructions), and healing allies from great distances.</p><figure id="" data-id="dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-recommend-id="image://dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-recommend-id="image://dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keep Regeneration Domain available, as it is (effectively) an “I Win” ability when used against powerful offensive enemy Ultimates. If enemy Duelists are flanking you, they’ll also be forced to retreat as they realize how futile their attacks are, and how formidable you and your clones are at fighting back while invincible.</p><p>The only exception are enemies like Spider-Man and Winter Soldier, who have abilities that can move you. If they can push or pull you out of your healing circle, it’s game over, so take them out first, or keep a teammate close.</p><p>If you have an Ultimate charged, you can turn the tables by transforming into them and using it, but make sure you have learned their abilities and Ultimates and what they do, or you’ll be making a quick trip to the Respawn Room.</p><p>Experiment with spawning clones on top of buildings, then swapping places with them, to reach truly bizarre locations to snipe and heal from. A skilled Loki can carry their team to victory with a powerful and versatile set of skills that can adapt to nearly any situation. He also rewards creative thinking in a way few other characters can.</p><hr><p>I may be playing the God of Lies, but you can (probably) trust me.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-update-110-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Firaxis and 2K have released&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1.0, the game's first major update, and it's got plenty of improvements and balance tweaks to hopefully improve your experience with the game.</p>

<p>First up, Firaxis says it's made some tweaks to the Geographic Society victory condition, improving "how this victory feels and plays". It should no longer be quite as easy to "breeze through this path when no other players are aiming for this victory".</p>

<p>Changes to this effect include Explorer units costing more, fewer Exploration Age artifacts spawning per continent, and the ability to study Natural Wonders for Artifacts, plus more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-update-1.1.0-france.jpg?itok=eL8JDdx8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-update-1.1.0-france.jpg?itok=oRL0tS8_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first major&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>update is here.</figcaption></figure><p>There are, of course, tons of other changes to both the PC and console versions of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>. On the PC side, these changes include improvements to the game's AI and various systems, as well as improvements for its UI.</p>

<p>Console changes are also pretty extensive, with many smaller changes to UI, gameplay systems, and more. You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1.0 <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not this is enough to placate players who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">still feel angry</a> about&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s launch remains to be seen. Last month, Firaxis <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">promised to address</a> players' common criticisms of the game, so let's hope the UI improvements in this update are a good start, at least.</p>

<p>The first half of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s inaugural paid DLC pack has gone live as part of this update as well, and it includes a new Leader, two new Civilizations, and new Natural Wonders. Again, though, you will have to pay to enjoy that stuff.</p>




<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is the latest mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>series of turn-based strategy games. It includes a new Age system to more clearly demarcate time periods, as well as changes to city-building, diplomacy, and more.</p>

<p>You can check&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 has a new Sid Meier's game update that makes changes to Sid Meier's user interface, leader AI, Age mechanics, Mementos and naval unit handling. Developers Firaxis have also stirred in a free bonus Natural Wonder, Sid Meier's Bermuda Triangle.</p>
<p>Leaving aside for the moment the on-going arguments about whether (Sid Meier's - OK, enough of that now) Civilization 7 is an unambiguous low point for the series, or yet another flawed 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim that will find its feet via post-launch updates, I love the idea of a Bermuda Triangle just popping up in my simulation, like a black hole spawning in my fridge. I hope it works as in legends about the real-life Bermuda Triangle (or in the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>), with whole armies and fleets getting swallowed up in transit and/or scattered across the globe at random.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Formally titled Update 1.1.0, the patch is reportedly based on “community suggestions and feedback”. It’s live today and – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/upcoming-civilization-vii-expansion-release-dates-seemingly-leaked-by-nintendo">as rumoured last week</a> - accompanies the first part of the paid Crossroads Of The World DLC Collection, which features a new leader, Ada Lovelace, the new civs Great Britain (in the Modern Age) and Carthage (in Antiquity), and a Natural Wonder pack with four more Natural Wonders: Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca.
</p>
<p>
The developers had planned to launch Civilization 7’s first in-game Event, Natural Wonder Battle, alongside the update, but “events are now being postponed to a later update to allow us more time to prioritize quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide”. 
</p>
<p>
Here’s a PR-supplied highlights reel for Update 1.1.0. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- New Natural Wonder to discover: Bermuda Triangle (free to all players)
</p>
<p>
- Additional UI adjustments, polish, and addressing of reported issues
</p>
<p>
- Significant changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory; AI leaders will also be better at completing a Cultural Victory (so expect fewer Explorer Unit stacks!)
</p>
<p>
- Now able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. Note that when players create their own Missionary Units, they will always follow the player’s chosen Religion
</p>
<p>
- Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers
</p>
<p>
- Balance pass on several Mementos
</p>
<p>
- Refinements to the Army Unpacking action
</p>
<p>
- Addressing reported issues with multiplayer and adding friends with a 2K Account
</p>
<p>
- For console players: all prior updates from Update 1.0.1 Patches 1, 2, and 3 will be implemented, in addition to the items noted above
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There’s another Civ 7 patcheroo on the way on 25th March, called Update 1.1.1. It introduces Mount Everest as a free Natural Wonder, adds quick move functionality, and tinkers further with the AI, amongst other things. It's timed to accompany the second half of the aforesaid Crossroads Of The World DLC, which adds another new leader, Simón Bolívar, together with Nepal (Modern Age) and Bulgaria (Exploration Age). Here’s a breakdown in advance:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Additional UI improvements and refinements; specifics will be shared later with the Update 1.1.1 Notes. Note: Ongoing improvements to the User Interface continues to be a top priority for the development team. The updates being introduced on March 25 are just one part of a much larger plan that aims to improve the UI over the next several months. 
</p>
<p>
- Scouting and Settling improvements for AI, including less aggressive “forward” settling by AI
</p>
<p>
- Adding Quick Move functionality
</p>
<p>
- Adding the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities
</p>
<p>
- Renaming the existing maps to be "Start Position: Balanced," which will be the default Start Position setting for multiplayer games
</p>
<p>
- Adding a new Start Position of "Standard," where the landforms on maps are less predictable, closer to how map generation works in Civ VI
</p>
<p>
- Adding an optional Restart button that rerolls the player’s map generation now that these less predictable start positions are possible
</p>
<p>
- New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest (free to all players)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In our fashionably late <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Civilization 7 review</a>, Actual Game Designer Greg Costikyan concluded that “despite its flaws, Civilization 7 sustains that “one more turn!” desire to plow through history and see what happens next.” I am certainly interested to see what happens next with Civ 7. Going by site stats, you are all very intrigued by it, despite some cogent and withering assessments of its failings.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/04/civilization-7-patch-1-1-0-released-for-all-platforms-patch-notes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Firaxis has released Update 1.1.0 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilzation-7">Civilization 7</a>, the patch bringing the first batch of UI improvements to the game, some AI adjustments and adding a new Natural Wonder to discover.</p>
<p>The update is out now across all platforms, PC and consoles, bringing their versions back into alignment as the console update also incorporates changes from hotfix patches 1, 2, and 3. Cross-play has also now been re-enabled.</p>


<p>In general, Firaxis has sought to address <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/firaxis-highlights-three-areas-theyll-improve-civilization-7-after-mixed-launch-reviews/">some of the main complaints that players of the game have had</a>, with the UI having come in for a lot of stick at launch. This is the first step for UI improvements that will continue with Update 1.1.1 later this month and through to further updates. For this update there’s things like fixing unit tooltips to remain within screen bounds, making scrollbars work when scrolling with a wheel, updates to the Leader Attribute Menu, and lots of other small tweaks to generally try and improve the UI.</p>
<p>There’s also AI improvements, so they’re able to better aim for a Cultural Victory – these have been overhauled for the Modern Age in general – a balance pass on Mementos, and fixes for converting Holy Cities in the Exploration Age.</p>
<p>Free for all players is the new Natural Wonder to discover, the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

<p>Here’s the PC patch notes for Civilization 7 Update 1.1.0 – <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">head here for console</a>:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI will now perform better at completing the Modern Cultural Legacy Path, by gaining Artifacts from Natural Wonders, researching at Museums/Universities, completing Civics, etc. (No more AI explorer stacks of doom!)</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Memento Text Updates</b></p>
<ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-to-lose-hellraisers-cenobite-next-month.1124955/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-chapter-leaving<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>will soon lose one of its killers in the form of Pinhead, the iconic Cenobite villain from Clive Barker's horror movie&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/hellraiser-last-chance-sale/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Behaviour says that since&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is a live service game, it's prone to "unexpected changes", and that the loss of the game's <i>Hellraiser&nbsp;</i>Chapter, which includes Pinhead and a number of other items, is one such change.</p>

<p>You'll no longer be able to purchase Pinhead or any of the associated cosmetics starting from April 4th at 11am Eastern (that's 8am Pacific and around 4pm GMT).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-cenobite-leaving-outfits.jpg?itok=Z5Ma8QpS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-cenobite-leaving-outfits.jpg?itok=NYXhfBd1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s Pinhead and his associated cosmetics will be leaving the game next month.</figcaption></figure><p>If you already happen to own the Cenobite Chapter, you'll still be able to access and play as Pinhead, and you'll also still retain access to your cosmetics and perks.</p>

<p>However, if you don't already own the Chapter, Pinhead's associated perks will be released to the general perk pool and will undergo a name change, with associated charms and achievements also being updated to reflect said change.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time characters from a major horror franchise have departed&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>; back in 2021, the Demogorgon and other&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>characters were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-stranger-things-sale-has-big-discounts-for-crossover-characters" rel="nofollow">removed from the game's store</a>.</p>

<p>Two years later, Behaviour <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/stranger-things-chapter-returns/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reintroduced</a>&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>characters and cosmetics to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, so hey - maybe there's hope for Pinhead and the Chatterer yet. Let's hope so.</p>




<p>Pinhead isn't leaving&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>until April, so if you do happen to want to pick up his Chapter and you haven't already done so, Behaviour is holding a sale right now that slashes 50% off the game's&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser</em>&nbsp;stuff.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dead-by-daylight/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-by-daylight/C0N22P73QZ60" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dead-by-daylight-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqx2H_OcaYrd24HMgTDhi2LLQdMszh3cFkDbcHxt5hYtWgwxlEU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the Cenobite Chapter is still available until April 4th across all of these platforms as well.</p>

<p>"4090 performance at $549."</p>
<p>That’s what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/TFxntB61jvs?si=MUT1U0gNSmHFRw0T&amp;t=1402">said</a> of the GeForce RTX 5070 when he announced the card at CES in January. Thanks to AI, this new midrange GPU would be able to match the frame rates of what had been the fastest consumer GPU that had previously existed for around one-third the price.</p>
<p>Let's dispel that notion up front. No, the GeForce RTX 5070 is not as fast as an RTX 4090, not without some very creative comparing of non-comparable numbers. Per usual for the 50-series, Nvidia is leaning on its AI-generated interpolated frames for the bulk of its claimed performance improvements. In terms of actual rendering speed, the 5070 isn’t even as fast as a 4080 or a 4070 Ti. It’s barely faster than last year’s 4070 Super, and it has disproportionately higher power usage.</p>


<p>For all that, it's still not necessarily a <em>bad</em> card—it's a little faster than the $599 4070 Super at the same $549 price that Nvidia used for the RTX 4070. It still represents Nvidia's minimum viable 4K GPU, once you factor in DLSS upscaling, and it’s well suited for people with 1440p monitors.</p>
<p>But it's a hard card to get excited about, and unlike every other 50-series GPU released so far, it actually has to compete against something—AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 series. I can't talk in detail about how these cards all stack up until later this week, but suffice it to say that Nvidia could use something a bit more impressive than the RTX 5070 at this price.</p>

<p>The 5070's CUDA core count falls right in between the RTX 4070 and the 4070 Super's, where the 5080 and 5070 Ti both included small increases from their previous-generation counterparts. To boost speeds over the 4070 Super, this means Nvidia is leaning on architectural improvements in Blackwell, the memory bandwidth increase from GDDR7 (a fairly significant 33 percent increase), and increased GPU clock speeds (the memory switch and clock speed boosts likely explain the higher power consumption).</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The 5070 gives you 12GB of memory, which still clears that crucial “more than 8GB” bar you’ll want for higher-than-1080p resolutions and ultra-quality textures, though as time goes on, it may be more limiting at 4K if that’s a resolution you’re hoping to hit with this card.</p>
<p>The number that sticks out in a bad way is the power consumption—a maximum of 250 W under load, 30 W more than the old 4070 Super. The 5070 series is still far more power-efficient than older cards like the RTX 3070 or 3080, but efficiency is no longer as much of an advantage for the 5070 as it was for the 4070 series.</p>

<p>We reviewed the Founders Edition of the card provided by Nvidia, and it uses a different two-slot design than the much larger, much more powerful RTX 5090 and 5080 cards. It's the same physical size as the 4070 and 4060 Founders Edition cards, but with an updated power connector that's set at an angle instead of sticking out directly from the top of the card. Nvidia has updated the cooler design, too, moving both fans to the same side of the card rather than placing one on each side.</p>

      The RTX 5070 runs a bit warmer than other cards we've tested recently.

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Whether it's because of the updated cooler or the higher power consumption or both, the 5070 actually runs hotter than any other card in our current round of testing, including (by a few degrees) the 5090. The card runs a bit loud under load—that's not a scientific measurement, but I noticed it more than I did when testing either the 5090 Founders Edition or the 4070-series Founders Editions. It's something to keep an eye on for any smaller or lower-end 5070 cards from partners that use smaller double-fan cooler designs, though we doubt it will be an issue for the triple-fan monstrosities.</p>

<h3>Testbed notes</h3>

<p>Our testbed is the same as it's been since we updated it for the RTX 5090 review—a Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the heart of the build to minimize the likelihood that CPU performance will cap any of our GPUs' frame rates.</p>
<p>We've tested the 5070 at 4K and 1440p. Cards in this $500 to $600 price range tend to be a better fit for a 1440p high-refresh-rate gaming monitor, especially if you're hoping to play without DLSS or other upscaling technologies available.</p>
<p>But if you play older or lighter games, if you don't mind upscalers, and if you can turn down a few settings, hitting 60 frames per second at 4K is often within the realm of possibility. It's certainly the least I would spend if I was hoping to play on a 4K monitor.</p>
<h2>Performance and power</h2>


<p>The 5070 usually represents a mid-single-digit performance increase over the 4070 Super despite having fewer CUDA cores. It's about 20 percent faster than the RTX 4070—a comparison Nvidia would probably prefer, since the 5070 is technically replacing the 4070 at $549 and not the 4070 Super at $599. But the launch MSRPs for the 50-series have been mostly imaginary so far due to a combination of supply, demand, and people buying cards just so they can resell them for more money. We'd assume the same will hold true for the RTX 5070 until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>There were a couple of exceptions in our suite that performed strangely no matter how many times we re-tested them or how many times we tried clearing our shader cache or reinstalling drivers, and one game that benefitted from an outsized increase. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in Ultra mode with ray-tracing disabled showed a larger improvement than the other games we tested—24 percent faster than the 4070 Super, and 72 percent faster than the 4070. It was an outlier, but some games may benefit more than others.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>in Overdrive mode with DLSS turned off both gave abnormally low or otherwise strange numbers—we've presented those here for the sake of transparency, and we've communicated our findings to Nvidia, but we'd take these with a grain of salt when comparing results. <em>Horizon</em> seems to have some kind of issue with DLSS frame generation regardless of GPU, with low frame rates and odd visual artifacts across all the GeForce cards we've tested with recent drivers.</p>

<p>On the AMD side, we can't compare the 5070 directly to the RX 9070 series yet, but it's worth noting that the 5070 outperforms the old RX 7900 GRE by a small but consistent amount in our benchmarks without ray-tracing effects (the gap in ray-traced games is larger because of AMD's typical performance deficit in these games).</p>
<p>AMD says that the $549 RX 9070 and $599 9070 XT should be 21 percent and 42 percent faster (respectively) than the RX 7900 GRE on average. That could spell trouble for the 5070, but it remains to be seen whether AMD has fixed its ray-tracing performance problems and how much the cards' power efficiency has improved.</p>


<p>We ran our 1440p benchmarks on the GeForce RTX 3070, too, to give a bit more context for upgraders. The 5070 is usually between 40 and 70 percent faster than the 3070 here, a card that will find itself more and more limited by its 8GB of RAM as time goes on. The 5070 is still a good upgrade from the 3070; it's just not all <em>that</em> much better of an upgrade than what you could get from a 4070 Super a year ago. As usual, the older your card is, the better the upgrade will feel, even if the generation-over-generation improvement is small.</p>

      The 5070's small increase in performance is matched with a larger increase to power consumption.

<p>In exchange for five or six percent better performance, the 5070 uses 13.5 percent more power under load than the 4070 Super did. Nvidia was so far ahead of AMD and the RTX 30-series on efficiency with the RTX 40-series GPUs that one relatively inefficient upgrade cycle doesn't really wreck things, but we do generally like to see power consumption either increase proportionally with performance or for performance to increase more than power consumption does.</p>

<p>Improving efficiency was always going to be tough for the 50-series, since the Blackwell GPU dies are manufactured using a 4nm TSMC process similar to what Nvidia used for the Ada Lovelace GPU dies for the 40-series. But the 5070 ends up slightly worse on this metric than the other 50-series cards.</p>
<h3>Frame generation comparisons and caveats</h3>

      A 5070 can go as fast as a 4090... if you use two entirely different performance metrics.

<p>When you turn frame generation on, you can see the source of Jensen Huang's "4090 performance for $549" performance claim. The 5070 with DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) enabled in 4x mode has a similar average frame rate in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> compared to the RTX 4090 with the old Frame Generation mode enabled (now labeled "2x" in games that support MFG). That's because the 5070 is capable of generating three AI-interpolated frames for every rendered frame, rather than one.</p>
<p>But the 5070 (and, when they arrive, the 5060 series) demonstrates the limits of FG and MFG more than the other 50-series cards do. With MFG enabled,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> can hit over 80 frames per second on average with the Overdrive preset enabled. That sounds pretty good! Until you consider that the base frame rate (with DLSS upscaling enabled, but not any frame generation) is closer to 20 frames per second. With a base frame rate this low, user input will feel sluggish, and visual artifacts are plainly visible when objects are in motion.</p>
<p>DLSS MFG can still have its uses—the 5070 can push some pretty high frame rates at 1440p, and MFG could help you take better advantage of a 240 Hz or 360 Hz 1440p monitor than you could without MFG enabled. But it remains a relatively niche technology that's useful under certain circumstances, not the broad cure-all for mediocre performance that Nvidia's charts imply it is.</p>

<h2>It could be better, or at least cheaper</h2>

<p>The GeForce RTX 4070 and 4070 Super were some of the best values in Nvidia's lineup last generation, offering the same performance as high-end 30-series cards and outstanding power efficiency for a little less money than you'd spend on an RTX 3080 or 3090.</p>

<p>Now that it's here, it's hard to classify the RTX 5070 as anything other than a disappointment. It's just barely, by the skin of its figurative teeth, faster than the 4070 Super for the same $549 MSRP as the regular 4070. This technically makes it an improvement, along with support for multi-frame generation. But this nearly imperceptible performance improvement comes with a 13.5 percent increase in power consumption under load, which seems like a bad trade-off any way you cut it.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 feels like the kind of product you make when you're not particularly worried about what your competition is doing. The&nbsp;<em>entire</em> 50-series has sort of felt like that so far, between the astronomically high price of the RTX 5090 and the so-so performance improvements for the 5080 and 5070 Ti.&nbsp;But it's different for the RTX 5070 because AMD actually has an answer for it coming soon.</p>
<p>AMD's RX 7600, 7700, and 7800 GPUs may not have been smash-hit sales successes for its last generation, but stiffer competition at and under $600 did help pull Nvidia's pricing down to earth a bit. Soon we'll know whether the RX 9070 series will exert a similar pull—or if it can actually manage to wrest some market share back from Nvidia after years of trending in the wrong direction.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great 1440p performance—and can stretch to 4K with the right settings</li>
<li>Same price as the old RX 4070 and a little cheaper than the 4070 Super (in theory)</li>
<li>Compact design that should fit in just about any case</li>
<li>Reasonably power-efficient when compared to older RTX 30-series or Radeon cards</li>
<li>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is a situationally useful technology</li>
<li>Wide ecosystem support for DLSS, CUDA, and other Nvidia software features</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Higher power consumption for not that much better performance</li>
<li>A few odd performance results that will hopefully be ironed out by driver and/or game updates</li>
<li>Founders Edition runs a bit hot</li>
<li>12GB of RAM feels stingy</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia's grandiose apples-to-oranges performance comparisons</li>
<li>Availability remains a big question mark</li>
</ul>
