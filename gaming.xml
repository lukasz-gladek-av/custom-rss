			<p>Ahead of their launch later this week, NVIDIA has reminded players of a few more titles that will be launching with support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4, including Anno 117: Pax Romana, Assetto Corsa Rally, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/">new rally racing game from Supernova Games Studios and 505 Games</a>, which also marks the first time the Assetto Corsa series has ventured into the world of rally racing. It was built on an adapted version of KUNOS Simulazioni's physics engine that has been the foundation for the entire Assetto Corsa series. Assetto Corsa Rally is also the second Assetto Corsa release of the year after Assetto Corsa EVO.</p>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation when it launches in early access on November 13, 2025, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 needs no introduction as the latest entry in the long-running annual shooter series, which is launching this coming Friday, November 14, 2025, with support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is another new entry in a long-running series, though a very different kind of game from Call of Duty. This new city-builder and strategy game puts players in Ancient Rome and charges them with deciding between instituting Roman traditions in its new Celtic colonies, or if you'll kick off a new era of Ancient Rome, letting Celtic traditions mix with Rome's to create something entirely new.</p>



<p>It'll arrive on PC on November 13, 2025, and with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Lastly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332430/Chip_n_Clawz_vs_The_Brainioids/">Chip n' Clawz vs. The Brainoids</a> is a new action-strategy game from developer Snapshot Games and publisher Arc Games from the creator of XCOM, Julian Gollop. It's a mix of third-person action and real-time strategy gameplay, and after launching earlier this year in August, it'll add support for DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana, Black Ops 7, and Assetto Corsa Rally will <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-add-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-anno-117-pax-romana-in-november-2025/">also be available to play through NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>.</p>

            <p>Ye gads, there’s three of them. You <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-valves-forty-majillion-secret-hardware-projects-is-called-the-steam-frame-probably">may have heard</a> that a Valve hardware announcement was on the cards, but the Steam custodians’ biggest  metal-and-circuits reveal since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> actually concerns a power trio: a new Steam Machine, a new Steam Controller, and the Steam Frame hybrid VR headset. They're all official, and all coming (pricing and exact dates TBA) in early 2026.</p>
<p>I’ve had some quality hands-on time with them myself, having been mysteriously summoned to Valve HQ late last month (flying/accommodating on our own dime, before anyone gets clever). Full thoughts can be found in the links below, and I’ll say this up front: all three have a clear Steam Deck influence, be it the design language, the value of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-proton-the-reason-most-steam-deck-games-work-has-a-version-100-beta-to-try">Proton</a>-aided game compatibility, or simply the pleasure of a quality thumbstick. If you liked the handheld then... well, you might not <em>necessarily</em> like the Steam Machine, Controller, or Frame, but you’ll have already read the shorthand on where they’re coming from.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more features and insights coming later today and this week, based on interviews with Valve’s in-house designers and engineers. In the meantime, let’s do some specs lists here as well. Why not, eh. The Steam Machine is set to be Valve’s most powerful in-house hardware piece thus far, leaning on a discrete AMD GPU to run modern games at upscaled 4K, while the redesigned Steam Controller sacrifices some of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goodnight-sweet-steam-controller">original model’s idiosyncrasies</a> in pursuit of better all-roundedness. The Steam Frame is perhaps both the most ambitious and the riskiest: its modular design, groundbreaking support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-arm64-game-testing-points-towards-new-steam-hardware-if-vaguely">Steam games on ARM hardware</a>, and combination of quality PC VR with standalone headset play all show great promise, but not the kind that seemed imminently fulfillable at the time of my preview session.</p>
<h3>Steam Machine (2026) specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> 6-core AMD Zen 4</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Semi-custom AMD RDNA 3 with 28 Compute Units, 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB (not including VRAM)</li>
<li><strong>SSD:</strong> 512GB or 2TB</li>
<li><strong>Ports:</strong> 1x microSD, 2x USB3, 2x USB2, 1x USB Type C, 1x DisplayPort 1.4, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x Ethernet</li>
<li><strong>Wireless:</strong> Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, integrated Steam Controller receiver</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> SteamOS</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steam Controller (2026) specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thumbsticks:</strong> 2x TMR magnetic thumbsticks</li>
<li><strong>Trackpads:</strong> 2x capacitive trackpads with haptics</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz (over Steam Controller Puck), Bluetooth, USB</li>
<li><strong>Gyro controls:</strong> Yes, with capacitive ‘Grip sense’ sensor</li>
<li><strong>Battery life:</strong> 35h</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> SteamOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Ios/Android with Steam Link</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steam Frame specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>SoC:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</li>
<li><strong>Lenses:</strong> Pancake optics, LCD, 2160x2160 per eye</li>
<li><strong>Field of View:</strong> 110 degrees</li>
<li><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 72-120Hz (144Hz in Experimental mode)</li>
<li><strong>Tracking:</strong> 4x external cameras for controller and headset tracking, 2x interior cameras for eye tracking</li>
<li><strong>Audio:</strong> Dual speaker drivers (per ear), integrated into headstrap</li>
<li><strong>SSD:</strong> 256GB or 1TB</li>
<li><strong>Ports:</strong> 1x microSD, 1x PCIe expansion port with camera passthrough</li>
<li><strong>Wireless:</strong> Dual Wi-Fi 7/Wi-Fi 6E </li>
<li><strong>Battery:</strong> Rechageable 21.6Whr Li-On</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> SteamOS</li>
<li><strong>Controllers:</strong> Full 6-DOF tracking and IMU support, traditional gamepad inputs, capacitive finger tracking, haptic feedback, AA batteries (40h life)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there’s no concrete release date or pricing for these yet, though Valve engineer Jeremy Selan told me that the while the Steam Frame specifically would be a "premium" VR headset. it'll still likely be priced "less than [the] Index." That's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review">Valve Index</a> headset, the full kit of which remains at the same £919 / $999 pricepoint it launched at in 2019. We'll report any further details ahead of release next year.</p>

<p>The rumors were true after all. Valve has announced the Steam Frame VR headset, it’s first headset since the Valve Index was released in 2019. </p>



<p>Rumors and reports around the Steam Frame have been around for some time, but they really began to pick up steam in September when a trademark filing discovered the likely name of the device. Then, in October, it was reported that the headset had entered mass production iwhile files on Steam were updated that signaled a release was imminent. </p>

<p>Valve is back in the “console” business. The Washington-based company has officially announced its next-gen Steam Machine to the world.</p>



<p>Known internally as “Fremont”, this new console has been rumored for a long time. This summer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks for the device</a> even appeared on Geekbench.</p>











<p>This isn’t the first time Steam has tried the standalone box. Back in 2015, the first generation of Steam Machines were released, but they didn’t perform too well and were quickly discontinued. </p>



<p>Developing Story…</p>

<p>Rockstar is facing legal troubles due to recent firings, with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) taking matters into their own hands. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the GTA 6 developer recently fired employees for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giving out company secrets</a>. The fired workers then arranged a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protest</a> outside Take-Two’s London office with IWGB, claiming they were fired “in a blatant act of union busting”. Now, IWGB has issued a legal claim against Rockstar for the recent firings. </p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-due-to-alleged-union-busting">Rockstar Hit With Legal Claim Due to Alleged Union Busting</h2>



<p>In a legal statement shared with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the IWGB reveals that they are representing employees who Rockstar Games recently fired. IWGB believes that they were dismissed in circumstances that “amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity.” The statement adds that despite IGWB attempting to meet Rockstar and “resolve the matter through negotiation”, the latter has refused to meet and “persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful.”</p>



<p>Therefore, IWGB has “issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants.” The president of IWGB, Alex Marshall, added that they are confident that this is a case of “plain and simple union busting” and they will “mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers.” </p>



<p>The statement added that “Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.” Marshall concluded, stating that “this case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers – we will not be intimidated.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-arc-raiders-map-will-open-after-%E2%80%98breaking-new-ground%E2%80%99-community-event.1351510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has lifted the lid a little further on the North Line update, which kicks off tomorrow. Over the next few days, players will be challenged with a new Community Event, called ‘Breaking New Ground’. In this event, the Raiders will need to contribute crafting materials to collectively fuel the push into the new map, Stella Montis.</p>



<p>The faster the Raiders complete the challenge, the sooner the new map will be unlocked, Embark Studios has confirmed.</p>







<h2 id="h-breaking-new-ground-comes-to-arc-raiders-tomorrow">Breaking New Ground Comes to ARC Raiders Tomorrow</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has a new community event that effectively kickstarts the North Line update, dropping tomorrow on all platforms. This update will see the game’s first new map arrive in Stella Montis, a cold and sterile facility dug deep into the mountains above all the other maps.</p>



<p>The update also ushers in two new ARC enemies, the Matriarch and the Shredder. It has been said that the Matriarch makes the Queen look friendly, and the Shredder poses a challenge in tight environments.</p>



<p>For Breaking New Ground, players need to contribute the following to the collective effort:</p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Parts</li>



<li>Fabric</li>



<li>Chemicals</li>



<li>Rubber Parts</li>



<li>Plastic Parts</li>
</ul>



<p>This event also introduces Merits, a new currency type that ‘will fuel the next phase of progression’. Once the tunnel leading to Stella Montis has been opened up, Staking Our Claim, a new progression path, will open.</p>







<p>Embark Studios has also confirmed that new gameplay items and weapons are being added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/arc-raiders-loaded-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> with the North Line update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New legendary weapon</li>



<li>Three new mines</li>



<li>Two new grenades</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders’ post-launch roadmap starts here and unravels further in December with the Cold Snap update, which in turn brings about the Flickering Flames event.</p>



<p>It’s also when players will have the first opportunity to reset their accounts, <strong>and </strong>it’s when snow blankets the game.</p>

<p>Even in these days of mostly incremental, not-too-exciting GPU upgrades, the graphics card in a gaming PC or graphics-centric workstation will still feel its age faster than your CPU will. And the chance to upgrade that one component for hundreds of dollars instead of spending thousands replacing the entire machine is an appealing proposition.</p>
<p>Upgradeable, swappable GPUs would also make your laptop more flexible—you can pick and choose from various GPUs from multiple vendors based on what you want and need, whether that’s raw performance, power efficiency, Linux support, or CUDA capabilities.</p>
<p>Framework’s first upgrade to the Laptop 16—the company’s first upgrade to&nbsp;<em>any</em> of its products aside from the original Laptop 13—gets us pretty close to that reality. The laptop can now support two interchangeable motherboards: one with an older AMD Ryzen 7040-series CPU and one with a new Ryzen AI 300-series CPU. And both motherboards can be used either with just an integrated GPU or with dedicated GPUs from both AMD and Nvidia.</p>
<p>The Nvidia GeForce 5070 graphics module is the most exciting and significant part of this batch of updates, but there are plenty of other updates and revisions to the laptop’s external and internal components, too. These upgrades don’t address all of our problems with the initial version of the laptop, but they do help quite a bit. And a steady flow of updates like these would definitely make the Laptop 16 a platform worth investing in.</p>

<p>Framework treats each of its laptops as a platform to be modified and built upon rather than something to be wholly redesigned and replaced every time it’s updated. So these reviews necessarily re-cover ground we have already covered—I’ve also reused some of the photos from last time, since this is quite literally the same laptop in most respects. I’ll <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-frameworks-laptop-16-is-unique-laudable-fascinating-and-flawed/">point you to the earlier review</a> for detailed notes on the build process and how the laptop is put together.</p>

<p>To summarize our high-level notes about the look, feel, and design of the Framework Laptop 16: While the Framework Laptop 13 can plausibly claim to be in the same size and weight class as portables like the 13-inch MacBook Air, the Framework Laptop 16 is generally larger and heavier than the likes of the 16-inch MacBook Pro or portable PC workstations like the Lenovo ThinkPad P1 or Dell 16 Premium. That’s doubly true once you actually add a dedicated graphics module to the Laptop 16—these protrude a couple of inches from the back of the laptop and add around two-thirds of a pound to its weight.</p>

<p>You certainly&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>find laptops from the major PC OEMs that come close to or even exceed the size and weight of the Laptop 16. But in most cases, you’ll find that comparably specced and priced laptops are an inch or two less deep and at least half a pound lighter than the Laptop 16 with a dedicated GPU installed.</p>
<p>But if you’re buying from Framework, you’re probably at least notionally interested in customizing, upgrading, and repairing your laptop over time, all things that Framework continues to do better than any other company.</p>
<p>The Laptop 16’s customizable keyboard deck is still probably its coolest feature—it’s a magnetically attached series of panels that allows you to remove and replace components without worrying about the delicate and finicky ribbon cables the Laptop 13 uses. Practically, the most important aspect of this customizable keyboard area is that it lets you decide whether you want to install a dedicated number pad or not; this also allows you to choose whether you want the trackpad to be <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/possible-input-module-combinations-on-framework-laptop-16-rJZi7BcwT">aligned</a> with the center of the laptop or with wherever the middle of the keyboard is.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>It might look a little rough, but the customizable keyboard deck is still probably the coolest thing about the Laptop 16 in day-to-day use.</span>

  </div>

<p>But Framework also sells an assortment of other functional and cosmetic panels and spacers to let users customize the laptop to their liking. The coolest, oddest accessories are still probably the <a href="https://frame.work/products/16-led-matrix?v=FRAKDE0001">LED matrix spacers</a> and the clear, legend-less <a href="https://frame.work/products/keyboard-module?v=FRAKEB00AC">keyboard</a> and <a href="https://frame.work/products/16-rgb-macropad?v=FRAKDR0001">number pad</a> modules. We still think this assortment of panels gives the system a vaguely unfinished look, but Framework is clearly going for function over form here.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The Laptop 16 also continues to use Framework’s customizable, swappable Expansion Card modules. In theory, these let you pick the number and type of ports your laptop has, as well as customize your port setup on the fly based on what you need. But as with all AMD Ryzen-based Framework Laptops, there are some <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/expansion-card-slot-functionality-on-framework-laptop-16-amd-ryzen-ai-300-series-r1ikPxZKxg">limits to what each port can do</a>.</p>

<p>According to Framework’s support page, there’s no single Expansion Card slot that is truly universal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ports 1 and 4 support full 40Gbps USB 4 transfer speeds, display outputs, and up to 240 W charging, but if you use a USB-A Expansion Card in those slots, you’ll increase power use and reduce battery life.</li>
<li>Ports 2 and 4 support display outputs, up to 240 W charging, and lower power usage for USB-A ports, but they top out at 10Gbps USB 3.2 transfer speeds. Additionally, port 5 (the middle port on the right side of the laptop, if you’re looking at it head-on) supports the DisplayPort 1.4 standard where the others support DisplayPort 2.1.</li>
<li>Ports 3 and 4 are limited to 10Gbps USB 3.2 transfer speeds and don’t support display outputs or charging.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Laptop 16 also doesn’t include a dedicated headphone jack, so users will need to burn one of their Expansion Card slots to get one.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, most users will be able to come up with a port arrangement that fits their needs, and it’s still handy to be able to add and remove things like Ethernet ports, HDMI ports, or SD card readers on an as-needed basis. But choosing the right Expansion Card slot for the job will still require some forethought, and customizable ports aren’t as much of a selling point for a 16-inch laptop as they are for a 13-inch laptop (the Framework Laptop 13 was partly a response to laptops like the MacBook Air and Dell XPS 13 that <em>only</em> came with a small number of USB-C ports; larger laptops have mostly kept their larger number and variety of ports).</p>

<h2>What’s new in 2025’s Framework Laptop 16?</h2>


<p>An upgraded motherboard and a new graphics module form the heart of this year’s Laptop 16 upgrade. The motherboard steps up from AMD Ryzen 7040-series processors to AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 and Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chips. These are the same processors Framework put <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/review-ryzen-ai-cpu-makes-this-the-fastest-the-framework-laptop-13-has-ever-been/">into the Laptop 13 earlier this year</a>, though they ought to be able to run a bit faster in the Laptop 16 due to its larger heatsink and dual-fan cooling system.</p>
<p>Along with an upgrade from Zen 4-based CPU cores to Zen 5 cores, the Ryzen AI series includes an upgraded neural processing unit (NPU) that is fast enough to earn Microsoft’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">Copilot+ PC label</a>. These PCs have access to a handful of unique Windows 11 AI and machine-learning features (yes, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/in-depth-with-windows-11-recall-and-what-microsoft-has-and-hasnt-fixed/">Recall</a>, but not&nbsp;<em>just</em> Recall) that are processed locally rather than in the cloud. If you don’t care about these features, you can mostly just ignore them, but if you do care, this is the first version of the Laptop 16 to support them.</p>
<p>Most of the new motherboard’s other specs and features are pretty similar to the first-generation version; there are two SO-DIMM slots for up to 96GB of DDR5-5600, one M.2 2280 slot for the system’s main SSD, and one M.2 2230 slot for a secondary SSD. Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth connectivity are provided by an AMD RZ717 Wi-Fi card that can at least theoretically also be replaced with something faster down the line if you want.</p>
<p>The more exciting upgrade, however, may be the GeForce RTX 5070 GPU. This is the first time Framework has offered an Nvidia product—its other GPUs have all come from either Intel or AMD—and it gives the new Laptop 16 access to Nvidia technologies like DLSS and CUDA, as well as much-improved performance for games with ray-traced lighting effects.</p>
<p>Those hoping for truly high-end graphics options for the Laptop 16 will need to keep waiting, though. The laptop version of the RTX 5070 is actually the same chip as the desktop version of the RTX 5060, a $300 graphics card with 8GB of RAM. As much as it adds to the Laptop 16, it still won’t let you come anywhere near 4K in most modern games, and for some, it may even struggle to take full advantage of the internal 165 Hz 1600p screen. Professional workloads (including AI workloads) that require more graphics RAM will also find the mobile 5070 lacking.</p>

<p>Other components have gotten small updates as well. For those who upgrade an existing Laptop 16 with the new motherboard, Framework is selling 2nd-generation keyboard and number pad components. But their main update over the originals is new firmware that “includes a fix to prevent the system from waking while carried in a bag.” Owners of the original keyboard can <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/keyboard-firmware-update-framework-laptop-16-r1LayV4Age">install a firmware update</a> to get the same functionality (and make their input modules compatible with the new board).</p>

<p>Upgraders should also note that the original system’s 180 W power adapter has been replaced with a 240 W model, the maximum amount of power that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/new-usb-c-type-2-1-standard-offers-up-to-240-w-power-delivery/">current USB-C and USB-PD standards</a> are capable of delivering. You can charge the laptop with just about any USB-C power brick, but anything lower than 240 W risks reducing performance (or having the battery drain faster than it can charge).</p>
<p>Finally, the laptop uses a second-generation 16-inch, 2560×1600, 165 Hz LCD screen. It’s essentially identical in every way to the first-generation screen, but it formally supports G-Sync, Nvidia’s adaptive sync implementation. The original screen can still be used with the new motherboard, but it only supports AMD’s FreeSync, and Framework told us a few months ago that the panel supplier had no experience providing consumer-facing firmware updates that might add G-Sync to the old display. It’s probably not worth replacing the entire screen for, but it’s worth noting whether you’re upgrading the laptop or buying a new one.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Framework sent us the lower-end Ryzen AI 7 350 processor configuration for our new board, making it difficult to do straightforward apples-to-apples comparisons to the high-end Ryzen 9 7940HS in our first-generation Framework board. We did test the new chip, and you’ll see its results in our charts.</p>
<p>We’ve also provided numbers from the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 in the <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606/">Asus Zenbook S16 UM5606W</a> to show approximately where you can expect the high-end Framework Laptop 16 configuration to land (Framework’s integrated graphics performance will be marginally worse since it’s using slower socketed RAM rather than LPDDR5X; other numbers may differ based on how each manufacturer has configured the chip’s power usage and thermal behavior). We’ve also included numbers from the same chip in the Framework Laptop 13, though Framework’s spec sheets indicate that the chips have different power limits and thus will perform differently.</p>

<p>We were able to test the new GeForce GPU in multiple configurations—both paired with the new Ryzen AI 7 350 processor and with the old Ryzen 9 7940HS chip. This should give anyone who bought the original Laptop 16 an idea of what kind of performance increase they can expect from the new GPU alone. In all, we’ve tested or re-tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ryzen 7 7940HS CPU from the first-generation Laptop 16 and its integrated Radeon 780M GPU</li>
<li>The Ryzen 7 7940HS and the original Radeon RX 7700S GPU module</li>
<li>The Ryzen 7 7940HS and the new GeForce RTX 5070 GPU module, for upgraders who only want to grab the new GPU</li>
<li>The Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU and the GeForce RTX 5070 GPU</li>
</ul>
<p>We also did some light testing on the Radeon 860M integrated GPU included with the Ryzen AI 7 350.</p>
<p>All the Laptop 16 performance tests were run with Windows’ Best Performance power preset enabled, which will slightly boost performance at the expense of power efficiency.</p>
<p>Given all of those hardware combinations, we simply ran out of time to test the new motherboard with the old Radeon RX 7700S GPU—Framework is continuing to sell it, so it is a realistic combination of components. But our RTX 5070 testing suggests that these GPUs will perform pretty much the same regardless of which CPU you pair them with.</p>


<p>If you’re buying the cheaper Laptop 16 with the Ryzen AI 7 350, the good news is that it generally performs at least as well as—and usually a bit better than—the high-end Ryzen 9 7940HS from the last-generation model. Performance is also pretty similar to the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 in smaller, thinner laptops—the extra power and cooling capacity in the Laptop 16 is paying off here. People choosing between a PC and a Mac should note that none of these Ryzen chips come anywhere near the M4 Pro used in comparably priced 16-inch MacBook Pros, but that’s just where the PC ecosystem is these days.</p>

<p>How big an upgrade the GeForce 5070 will be depends on the game you’re playing. In titles like <em>Borderlands 3</em> that naturally run a bit better on AMD’s GPUs, there’s not much of a difference at all. In games like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with heavy ray-tracing effects enabled, the mobile RTX 5070 can be nearly twice as fast as the RX 7700S.</p>

<p>Most games will fall somewhere in between those two extremes; our tests show that the improvements hover between 20 and 30 percent most of the time, just a shade less than the 30 to 40 percent improvement that Framework claimed in <a href="https://frame.work/blog/introducing-the-new-framework-laptop-16-with-nvidia">its original announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond raw performance, the other thing you get with an Nvidia GPU is access to a bunch of important proprietary technologies like DLSS upscaling and CUDA—these technologies are often better and more widely supported than the equivalent technologies that AMD’s or Intel’s GPUs use, thanks in part to Nvidia’s overall dominance of the dedicated GPU market.</p>
<p>In the tests we’ve run on them, the Radeon 860M and 890M are both respectable integrated GPUs (the lower-end 860M typically falls just short of last generation’s top-end 780M, but it’s very close). They’re never able to provide more than a fraction of the Radeon RX 7700S’s performance, let alone the RTX 5070, but they’ll handle a lot of lighter games at 1080p. I would not buy a system this large or heavy just to use it with an integrated GPU.</p>

      It’s expensive and quirky, but the Framework Laptop 16 is worth considering because it’s so different from what most other laptop makers are doing.

<p>Our original Framework Laptop 16 review called it “fascinating but flawed,” and the parts that made it flawed haven’t really changed much over the last two years. It’s still relatively large and heavy; the Expansion Card system still makes less sense in a larger laptop than it does in a thin-and-light; the puzzle-like grid of input modules and spacers looks kind of rough and unfinished.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But the upgrades do help to shift things in the Laptop 16’s favor. Its modular and upgradeable design was always a theoretical selling point, but the laptop now actually offers options that other laptops don’t.</p>
<p>The presence of both AMD and Nvidia GPUs is a big step up in flexibility for both gaming and professional applications. The GeForce module is a better all-around choice, with slightly to significantly faster game performance and proprietary technologies like DLSS and CUDA, while the Radeon GPU is a cheaper option with better support for Linux.</p>
<p>Given their cost, I still wish that these GPUs were more powerful—they’re between $350 or <a href="https://frame.work/products/16-graphics-module-amd-radeon-rx-7700s?v=FRAKMB0004">$449</a> for the Radeon RX 7700S and between $650 and <a href="https://frame.work/products/laptop16-graphics-module-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070">$699</a> for the RTX 5070 (prices vary a bit and are cheaper when you’re buying them together with a new laptop rather than buying them separately). You’ll basically always spend more for a gaming laptop than you will for a gaming desktop with similar or better performance, but that does feel like an awful lot to spend for GPUs that are still limited to 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Cost is a major issue for the Laptop 16 in general. You may save money in the long run by buying a laptop that you can replace piece-by-piece as you need to rather than all at once. But it’s <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100006740%20601451280%20601471598&amp;Order=1">not even remotely difficult</a> to find similar specs from the major PC makers for hundreds of dollars less. We can’t vouch for the build quality or longevity of any of those PCs, but it does mean that you have to be willing to pay an awful lot <em>just&nbsp;</em>for Framework’s modularity and upgradeability. That’s true to some degree of the Laptop 13 as well, but the price gap between the 13 and competing systems isn’t as large as it is for the 16.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Whatever its lingering issues, the Framework Laptop 16 is still worth considering because there’s nothing else quite like it, at least if you’re in the market for something semi-portable and semi-powerful. The MacBook Pro exists if you want something more appliance-like, and there’s a whole spectrum of gaming and workstation PCs in between with all kinds of specs, sizes, and prices. To stand out from those devices, it’s probably better to be unique than to be perfect, and the reformulated Laptop 16 certainly clears that bar.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modular, repairable, upgradeable design that’s made to last</li>
<li>Cool, customizable keyboard deck</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce GPU option gives the Laptop 16 access to some gaming and GPU computing features that weren’t usable with AMD GPUs</li>
<li>GPU upgrade can be added to first-generation Framework Laptop 16</li>
<li>New processors are a decent performance improvement and are worth considering for new buyers</li>
<li>Old Ryzen 7040-series motherboard is sticking around as an entry-level option, knocking $100 off the former base price ($1,299 and up for a barebones DIY edition, $1,599 and up for the cheapest pre-built)</li>
<li>Framework’s software support <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/looking-at-frameworks-progress-on-software-support-for-its-repairable-laptops/">has gotten better in the last year</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Big and bulky for the specs you get</li>
<li>Mix-and-match input modules and spacers give it a rough, unfinished sort of look</li>
<li>Ryzen AI motherboards are more expensive than the originals were when they launched</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’ll cost you—the absolute bare minimum price for Ryzen AI 7 350 and RTX 5070 combo is $2,149, and that’s without RAM, an SSD, or an operating system</li>
</ul>

Along with Steam Deck, these are devices designed to work together, optimized for Steam while continuing to operate as open platforms," Valve added in a press release.</p><p>The Steam Deck has been well-received since it first launched several years ago--and helped kick off a new line of mobile gaming PCs from other companies--and Valve is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-2-release-is-over-two-years-away-according-to-new-rumor/1100-6534362/">new and upgraded model that might launch in 2027</a>.

                <p>Battlefield Redsec launched recently, and among the complaints about the battle royale game was that it has no olos playlist. One may be coming, however.</p><p>Design director Justin Wiebe told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/keep-your-ear-to-the-ground-battlefield-6-devs-hear-the-cries-for-battle-royale-solo-queue-in-redsec" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, "I would say keep your ear to the ground on the future of solos." For now, however, Wiebe wanted to talk more about the reasons why Redsec has no solos playlist.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn8k1g3vMDU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rn8k1g3vMDU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for why Redsec doesn't have a solos playlist, Wiebe said the game was built as a "squad-based experience" and it's not as simple as you might think to add solos. "In my mind, that's not something you just turn on and just say, 'OK, solos,'" he said.</p><p>Wiebe added: "There needs to be enough thought put into it because we built a squad-based experience. At its foundation, the game was designed for squads to play together, with each of them having tactical abilities and options, and training paths that unlock new perks. A lot of those perks are very oriented towards helping the squad, not helping the individual."</p><p>"I we were just to throw that out and say, 'Well, now you can just play solos, and you're unlocking these abilities that don't even matter to you,' that feels like a fail."</p><p>If Redsec were to get a solos playlist, Wiebe said it would need to be done "in a way that makes sense for players, that actually takes the mechanics and makes them work for making solos play better."</p><p>For now, Redsec offers Duos or Squads playlists where people can play in groups of two or four. Redsec's Gauntlet mode, meanwhile, supports teams of four.</p><p>As for Battlefield 6, the multiplayer game continues to expand in Season 1 with the release of the California Resistance update on November 18. Among other things, it adds the new map Eastwood.</p>

This quest requires you to round up a key on Blue Gate and use it to open one of the armored patrol cars scattered around the middle portion of the map. In this guide, we'll tell you where to find the key and how to spot one of these vehicles.</p><p>You need to extract from Blue Gate once you've completed this quest, so bring in a good loadout--including a solid shield and weapon you're comfortable with--to reduce any concerns that you might lose some good stuff if you find yourself in a battle.</p><p>Once you're ready to head out, here's how to complete the Armored Transport quest.</p><h2>Where to find the Armored Patrol Car Key</h2><p>The first step to completing Armored Transports is to find the Patrol Car Key. This item is found in the Checkpoint POI in the center of the map. This is a dangerous location often filled with powerful ARCs like Bastions and Rocketeers--not to mention other raiders. Be careful when approaching and navigating the area.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601172-share_20251112_0535150.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4601172" data-ratio="0.55929824561404" data-width="2850" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601172-share_20251112_0535150.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4601172"></a><figcaption>Checkpoint guard huts location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601172-share_20251112_0535150.jpeg"></figure><p>Look inside the guard huts in this area to find the Patrol Car Key sitting on a folder. <strong>We've most commonly noted it in the far-left guard hut, but it can appear in others, too</strong>. Use the pic below to note what a guard hut looks like. There will be several lined up in a row.

The bad news is that the spawns are rather randomized. The good news is that they're still relatively easy to find within the Checkpoint POI.</p><p>To find an armored patrol car, you'll just need to head directly north of where you found the Patrol Car Key and <strong>enter the large tunnel filled with vehicles</strong>. The path to the armored patrol car is often lined with wasps, hornets, and probably a rocketeer and a bastion either just outside the tunnel or inside of it, so staying well hidden and using smoke grenades or the cloaking device, if you're lucky enough to have one, will be extremely helpful here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601170-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4601170" data-ratio="0.56168468132687" data-width="2683" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601170-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4601170"></a><figcaption>Enter this large tunnel to seek an armored patrol car.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601170-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>There are tons of patrol cars throughout this interior area, but most will have already been hollowed out.

            <p>Distribution for the newly announced Steam hardware will be the same as the Steam Deck, Valve has confirmed, though it's working on improvements.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Kaci Aitchison Boyle from Valve's PR team discussed how distribution will work for the release of the new hardware. Essentially, Valve will be self-distributing just like it did with the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>However, players have criticised the distribution methods in the past, due to delays or missed deliveries across several regions, as well as a slow global rollout.</p>
<p>Aitchison Boyle has assured that Valve is making improvements.</p>
<p>"Right now, we are distributing the exact same way as Steam Deck," she said, adding customers can expect the same availability and partners across regions.</p>
<p>"For us, it's important to just keep making Steam distribution better and better - and distribute times, add regions and things like that.</p>
<p>"We've been working on that in the background. Even just from the Steam Deck launch, I think now the experience of buying one of our harder products on the West Coast is quite a bit better than it was a few years ago. We've also been adding regions like Australia last year.</p>
<p>"So we're continually working on improving Steam distribution for hardware."</p>
<p>Valve has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">today announced new Steam hardware</a>, namely a standalone Steam Frame VR headset, as well as Steam Machine console and Steam Controller. There's no release date yet, but they're expected next year.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how widely available they'll be.</p>

            <p>Valve's new Steam hardware has been developed based on the team's experience of PC gaming, rather than comparing to other console makers like PlayStation or Xbox.</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">today announced new Steam hardware</a>, namely a standalone Steam Frame VR headset, a Steam Machine console, and Steam Controller. But rather than entering the console space to compete with established companies, Valve's new hardware is an evolution of PC gaming.</p>
<p>"We typically just work back from our own experience playing PC games and what we wish was possible to do and what we hear our users say as well," Kaci Aitchison Boyle from Valve's PR team told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"PC gaming has a lot of value to offer. There are a lot of game genres that started on PC because it's an open platform where people could mod and experiment and do things that are not necessarily possible if the distribution of software is restricted in any way."</p>
<p>She added: "We don't really tend to work back from what's happening in other spaces and we try and focus on our audience."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Microsoft has just released its ROG Ally X handheld</a> in partnership with Asus, seemingly in direct competition with Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"If anything, we're kind of excited that other people are looking at the handheld space, the PC handheld space, because we see it as more options for people to play all of their games," said Aitchison Boyle.</p>
<p>"So we kind of see it as a sign of success that Steam Deck was actually something very meaningful and valuable for customers. If SteamOS lets the same dynamic apply to the kind of set-top box or living room form-factor, we'll be really happy with that as well."</p><p>Valve's new Steam hardware will be released next year, though release dates are currently unknown. If you're hoping to get your hands on it all, know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-confirms-its-continually-improving-how-it-distributes-hardware-ahead-of-the-release-of-its-new-steam-machines">Valve will continue to self-distribute hardware just as it did with the Steam Deck</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It feels like just yesterday that Revolution Software's classic point-and-click adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars</a>, was 'reforged' on Switch 1. It was, in fact, a year ago (almost to the day), but that hasn't stopped the studio's reforging efforts. The reforged has been reforged, you could say, as Shadow of the Templars has today arrived back on the eShop as a fancy new Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>The catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> popped up on the eShop this morning, where it is now available to pick up for <strong>€29.99/$29.99/£24.99</strong> as standard, or as a <strong>€4.99/$4.99/£4.99</strong> upgrade pack for all those with the Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>As you might expect from a point-and-click, the big addition this time around is Mouse Mode. Yes, the Joy-Con 2 can be flipped sideways and used to add an element of precision to your pointing and clicking. The resolution has also been boosted up to 4K in Docked Mode, and 1080p in Handheld, so you can soak up all the gorgeous 'reforged' art.</p>
<p>"Using the mouse feature is arguably the way that [the game] was always intended," Revolution's co-founder, Charles Cecil, told us recently when we sat down to talk all things Broken Sword on Switch 2, "a lot of the criticisms that were made quite rightly on release last year have since been addressed and obviously go into the Switch 2 as the native version".</p>
<p>It's all a case of bringing the team's vision of the original '90s release to life, as Charles told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What we wanted to do is be absolutely true to the original intent, because we promised fans that this was going be the same game, but enhanced. So what we really focused on was what existed at the time.</p><p>

For the sprites, we went back to the original character sheets that were drawn back in 1996, interpreted them and then brought those across to the low-resolution sprites that had been upscaled and redrew them all.</p><p>

We looked back at Tin Tin characters, and went, 'yeah, that's the kind of thing that we want' because in an adventure game, you want very expressive characters, you want the gameplay to flow through how the characters behave and how they look, so that the puzzles become logical.</p><p>

As far as the backgrounds are concerned, we pretty quickly went back to the original line art, which I had scanned in a very high resolution, and our digital artists then painted over that. But everything was intended to be in 4K. That's what we painted it to be.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>And just in case this will be your first run-in with Shadow of the Templars, here's a brief rundown of what you can expect, courtesy of Revolution Software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Step out onto the streets of Paris as American tourist George Stobbart finds himself embroiled in a mysterious journey of intrigue and jeopardy.<br>
- Enjoy a globe-spanning adventure, exploring exotic locations, solving ancient mysteries, and thwarting a dark conspiracy to reveal the secret truths of the Knights Templar.<br>
- Voyage through the game's iconic locations illustrated in beautiful 4K on Nintendo platforms for the first time.<br>
- Listen to enhanced audio as Revolution delivers the finest, most stunning version of George and Nico's original adventure to date.<br>
- Switch between the original 1996 version of the game and the new reforged visuals at the click of a button.<br>
- Play the game the way that you want to - choose between a ‘traditional mode' for people who enjoy adventures the way they used to be, and a ‘story mode' for those who want subtle hints to ensure they never get frustrated.<br>
- Switch between Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, touchscreen, and controller play styles whenever you choose..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll be sharing more of our discussion with Charles in the coming days, so keep an eye out for details on all things Broken Sword on Switch 2.</p>

            <p>
With as young a medium as games is (and it is young, as old as we all might feel), it's no surprise that it would burgeon new genres, and that said genres would be called into question. Metroidvanias! That's a potentially silly one, with a common argument being that it tells you nothing about the genre itself. I prefer Japan's search action as a name myself, though I am but one humble games journalist. A genre I hadn't called into question until today, however, is extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, a name that a former Bungie lead apparently disliked so much he tried to get the studio's marketing team to make something else up for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Bungie lead in question is the developer's former director of product management Chris Sides, who left the studio last year. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqwje5N5ArA">Shooter Monthly</a> podcast (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-director-different-genre-name-for-marathon-extraction-shooter-dumb/">TheGamePost</a>) of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, Sides said that "The problem is, Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it’s not. The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, 'Can we please create a different genre name,' because extraction shooter is so dumb. It’s the only genre where its name is a mechanic."
</p>
<p>
Sides called into question as to whether or not Helldivers 2 is an extraction shooter simply because you can extract, arguing that it's not because it's not like, as an example, Escape From Tarkov. "So, the terminology of the genre is already terrible; it really makes it hard to compare these games," Sides said.
</p>
<p>
I think that Sides is right to frame it in terms of a marketing perspective, because I think within the world of games genre is much more about selling a game than it is about denoting a particular expectation of it. A good film marketer does not sell one solely based on its combination of genres, yet games marketing does this frequently; I'm so glad you made a roguelike deckbuilder, but what is it actually about? Hit me with that first!
</p><p>
That's kind of the real issue, that marketing is incredibly genre-forward, and part of why I think Marathon has struggled to find an identity. Sure, I understand the basic principle of the thing I am doing in Marathon, I want to be given a stronger reason as to why I'm doing it, and to feel some of what Bungie can do so well, their social elements. If we're thinking about marketing, we first need to be thinking about what makes the game special! That's a better place to start than fixating on a genre that is still in the midst of figuring itself out, if you ask me.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good news: Sony just announced a new<a href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><em> Ratchet &amp; Clank</em></a> game. Bad news: It’s some free-to-play mobile arena shooter thing.</p> <p>On November 12, PlayStation Studios and Insomniac announced <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em>. The game is being created by OhBibi, <a href="https://www.ohbibi.com/games">a mobile game developer located in France</a> which&nbsp;has previously created cartoony, colorful action-focused third-person shooters. And what do you know, that’s exactly what<em> Ranger Rumble</em> appears to be in the game’s first trailer.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.rangerrumble.com/?utm_source=SoftLaunch&amp;utm_medium=PreReg&amp;utm_campaign=Socials&amp;utm_id=RangerRumble_SoftLaunch">According to the upcoming game’s website</a>,<em> Ranger Rumble</em> will feature “iconic characters from the <span><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> franchise” as well as big guns and explosions, which are hallmarks of the long-running series that started back on the PS2. PlayStation Studios describes <em>Ranger Rumble</em> as a “fast-paced multiplayer platformer arena shooter,” which, yeah, seems accurate.<br> </span></p>

 <p><span>“​</span>Experience the&nbsp;<span>humor, action</span>, and energy of the&nbsp;<span>iconic universe</span> in a bold new real-time multiplayer format,” says the game’s website. “Play as a Legendary Hero from the past, now with unique abilities. Go solo or team up with other Rangers online in <span>thrilling multiplayer games</span> built for every kind of player.”</p> <p>No release date was announced, but it is supposedly coming to mobile platforms “soon.” You can pre-register now.</p> <p>I think visually, <em>Ranger Rumble</em> looks great. It feels like a Saturday morning cartoon spin on the <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> universe, and I’m here for that. However, I’ve tried multiple times to enjoy multiplayer shooters on mobile phones using touch controls, and I hate it. And sure, many of them let you plug in a controller and play that way, but at that point, I’d rather just play a game on PC or console. Perhaps <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em> will eventually make the leap to PS4/PS5 and PC, but for now, I’m not sure I’ll play it. At least Sony hasn’t forgotten about<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank.</em> So that’s nice!</p> <p>This also lines up with past comments from <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-playstation-jim-ryan-xbox-game-pass-activision-1850880301">former PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-mobile-games-apps">who in 2021 explained in investor relations documents</a> that Sony was looking to invest more in mobile games based on famous franchises. I can’t wait for the <em>Sly Cooper</em> match-three game.</p>

It's a rather staggering amount of new content for a game that just released, so let's dive in and see what the fuss is all about.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_s_new_in_Arc_Raiders__North_Line_update">What's new in Arc Raiders' North Line update</a><ul><li><a href="#New_map_and_community_unlock_event">New map and community unlock event</a></li><li><a href="#New_enemies">New enemies</a></li><li><a href="#New_rifle__grenades__and_mines">New rifle, grenades, and mines</a></li><li><a href="#New_quests">New quests</a></li><li><a href="#More_on_the_way_in_December">More on the way in December</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="What_s_new_in_Arc_Raiders__North_Line_update">What's new in Arc Raiders' North Line update</h2><p>There's plenty of new stuff to see in Arc Raiders' North Line update, with the star of the show being the brand-new Stella Montis map. But the fun doesn't stop with new locations to explore. Here's what to know about everything new in the North Line update.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<h3 id="New_map_and_community_unlock_event">New map and community unlock event</h3><p>The game's first four maps have been joined by a fifth called Stella Montis. Referred to as "cold, pristine, and filled with the remnants of humanity's lost ambitions," Stella Montis will presumably be an unforgiving map filled with snow or icy conditions.</p><p>This new map requires the community to work together to open, however, meaning it won't be available immediately. This multi-phase community event--called Breaking New Ground--will begin at <strong>1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET</strong> and ask players to figure out how to open the path to Stella Montis via the tunnels in Speranza.</p><p>As everyone works toward contributing resources to the tunnel efforts, they'll earn a new currency called Merits that will help push things to a second phase of the event called "Staking Our Claim," which will unleash players into Stella Montis with an all-new progression track, challenges, and rewards. This portion of the event will last until December.</p><h3 id="New_enemies">New enemies</h3><p>The North Line update also includes two new ARC foes for players to take down: Matriarch and Shredder.</p><p>The Matriarch is described as "a hulking ARC that makes the Queen look friendly by comparison," so you'll want to start getting your Wolfpacks and Hullcrackers ready. This giant enemy will only spawn during certain map conditions, similarly to the Queen's Harvester event.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Shredder is exclusively available to fight on Stella Montis, and it's expected to force players into close-quarters encounters. In a game where even a hit or two can spell disaster, the Shredder sounds terrifying by name alone.</p><h3 id="New_rifle__grenades__and_mines">New rifle, grenades, and mines</h3><p>Another weapon called the Aphelion joins the fray, too, adding another energy-based firearm for players to use when tackling the ARC. In addition to this fresh weapon are two new grenades--Seeker Grenade and Trailblazer Grenade--and three new mines--Pulse Mine, Deadline Mine, and Gas Mine.</p><h3 id="New_quests">New quests</h3><p>Lastly, players can continue helping Speranza with a new questline focused on Stella Montis and the resources (and dangers) that await there. We'll be updating our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a> with these as we dive in and begin taking on the ARC in Stella Montis.</p><h3 id="More_on_the_way_in_December">More on the way in December</h3><p>The North Line update is just the beginning of a long road ahead for raiders enjoying their time in Arc Raiders. Embark Studios has already teased what to expect in its next major update, saying, "The North Line is just the beginning of Arc Raiders’ post-launch roadmap. The next update, Cold Snap, arrives this December--introducing the Flickering Flames event, new snowfall Map Condition, the awaited Expedition Project Raider reset, and more."</p>

<figure data-uuid="31542b1164f6d"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Details" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31542b1164f6d/mario-galaxy-movie-details.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has revealed our first proper look at <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a></strong>, with a trailer that lasts all of 2:25. Nope, that's not very long, but there are a lot of details crammed in there.</p>
<p>To make sure you caught all of the little touches, we've assembled the following rundown of every neat detail, reference, and callback we spotted in the first 'Mario Movie 2' trailer. So, get your fine-tooth combs at the ready, and let's tackle this sucker frame by frame...</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer</h2>
<p>Before we dive in, here's the trailer in all its glory if you want to catch up on the whole thing:</p>

<p>All good? Let's crack out the 'caps...</p>
<h2 id="everything-you-missed-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">Everything You Missed In The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer</h2>
<p>We'll work through the trailer chronologically, starting with sweet little Bowser in his sweet little castle...</p>
<h3 id="mario-x-the-scream">Mario X The Scream</h3>
<figure data-uuid="488024737cdac"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/488024737cdac/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A funny little one to start. It seems that Bowser is a bit of a proto-expressionism fan, as his painting of a particularly bony Mario bears an uncanny resemblance to Edvard Munch's '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream">The Scream</a>'.</p>
<p>It also has a similar appearance to the 'shocked Mario' pose in the first movie's plumbing commercial, but we prefer to think that Bowser is a fan of the classics.</p>
<h3 id="koopa-clown-car">Koopa Clown Car</h3>

<p>We might not get a look at the movie rendition, but one of Bowser's background paintings reveals that Bowser Jr's iconic Koopa Clown Car <em>is</em> a thing in the Mario Movie universe. Just look at how happy the little guy is in his flying machine!</p>
<h3 id="launch-stars">Launch Stars</h3>
<figure data-uuid="db7ad5c3ef939"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db7ad5c3ef939/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the trailer, we see Peach and Toad head off into space via a Launch Star — the mode of transport that anyone who has played either of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy</a> games will be very familiar with.</p>
<p>"Onward and upwards," right? Oops, wrong game!</p>
<h3 id="drip-drop-galaxy">Drip Drop Galaxy</h3>
<figure data-uuid="dbf7fe3e7e2d7"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbf7fe3e7e2d7/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, we can't be 100% sure on this, but the Blooper-filled underwater world that we see Peach and Toad travel past looks mighty similar to the 'Drip Drop Galaxy' from Mario's first intergalactic Wii adventure. There appears to be an extra floating palm tree island on the water's surface, but the sandy core and spherical shape immediately brought the 'Giant Eel Outbreak' mission to mind.</p>
<p>There's also a doughnut-shaped planet in the background that vaguely resembles one of the platforms in 'Gusty Garden Galaxy', though we're less sure about that one.</p>
<h3 id="tostarena-sticker">Tostarena Sticker</h3>

<p>It's not just locales from the Galaxy games that will be cropping up in the movie, mind you. We also get a glimpse at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a>'s Tostarena, complete with its upside-down pyramids and sand dunes.</p>
<p>If you really pay attention in one shot, you'll even see that Luigi's bike is sporting a Tostarena sticker, similar to the one you can pick up from the planet's Crazy Cap store.</p>
<h3 id="ninjis-back">Ninji's Back</h3>
<figure data-uuid="28b9afa767f29"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/28b9afa767f29/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ninji has had a bit of a moment in recent years, after appearing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and it looks like the cameos will keep on coming in the Galaxy movie.</p>
<p>Here, we see a bunch of Ninjis getting their buttons kicked in by Princess Peach, which is... more violent-sounding than we intended it to be.</p>
<h3 id="a-giant-casino">A Giant Casino</h3>
<figure data-uuid="8cfcae47eee0b"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8cfcae47eee0b/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That very Ninji fight takes place in what appears to be a giant casino cube, complete with dozens of slot machines lining the walls and a giant roulette wheel on the floor.</p>
<p>Whether it's a callback to the Luigi's Casino minigames in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/super_mario_64_ds">Super Mario 64 DS</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a>, or the Casino Delfino from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, it looks like a cool setpiece.</p>
<h3 id="wonder-bowser-jr">Wonder Bowser Jr.</h3>

<p>Bowser Jr. arrives on the scene and instantly adopts a similar appearance to his Wonder form from Mario Wonder. This appears to stem from a magical paintbrush à la Mario Sunshine (note how it's embossed with Bowser Jr's face this time, not E. Gadd's) rather than a Wonder Flower, but there's no denying that purple skin, green hair and neon face mask fit the bill.</p>
<h3 id="roaslinas-ice-world">Roaslina's Ice World</h3>

<p>We're not entirely sure where Rosalina is holed up at the end of the first trailer, but those buildings in the background look distinctly like the ones found in the 'Rosalina's Ice World' track from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_kart_7">Mario Kart 7</a>, or, at a push, 'Starview Peak' from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The ground doesn't look snowy enough to suggest Illumination has gone whole-hog on this inspiration, but at least the central tower with its magical floating rings appears to have made the cut.</p>
<h3 id="megaleg">Megaleg</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7edf6e52b29a9"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7edf6e52b29a9/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just in case the giant robot seen facing off against Rosalina didn't ring any bells, that's Megaleg, a robotic boss from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Mario Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>In the game, the boss is under the command of Bowser Jr., and based on the soft <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far#mario-movie-2-cast">Safdie</a> tones emanating from it in the trailer, we'd say that same is true of the movie version.</p>
<h3 id="baby-luma">Baby Luma</h3>
<figure data-uuid="536d4a65d8d7a"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/536d4a65d8d7a/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're jumping ahead to the extra little slice of footage from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjMaKQskW8">full movie Direct</a> here, but take a look at that tiny Baby Luma listening to Rosalina's story! It has a little dummy!</p>
<p>Gosh, those plushies are going to sell like crazy...</p>
<h3 id="paper-mario-storybook">Paper Mario Storybook</h3>
<figure data-uuid="e0e1ea3ba4e80"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0e1ea3ba4e80/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rosalinas-storybook-from-super-mario-galaxy-goes-on-sale-this-november">Rosalina's storybook</a> itself. Unlike the storybook from the Galaxy games, the visuals here have a certain papery charm. It's almost as if some animators at Illumination have played a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> game or two, no?</p>
<p>Oh, <em>ohhhh</em>, what if the storybook sections of the film are animated like stop-motion papercraft! Perhaps a bit too ambitious, but we can dream.</p>
