            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s 83-inch S85F TV proves that OLED screens have finally gotten big enough to turn your living room into a real home theater. This 2025 model packs 20 neural networks that upscale everything to stunning 4K clarity and the OLED panel delivers deep blacks and vivid colors that LCD technology can’t match. The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/">just slashed the price to $2,497 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the original $4,297 sticker</a>, which marks <strong>an all-time low for an 83-inch OLED with this level of AI processing power</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI Processing Works While You Watch</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen2 processor has 20 specialized neural networks</strong> that each work on a different part of image quality, such as sharpness, color accuracy, motion handling, and brightness optimization. These networks look at each frame in real time and find objects, faces, and scenes so they can make specific improvements instead of blanket processing that can make some content look too sharp or too bright.</p>
<p>When you stream a show that was made in 1080p or lower,<strong> the AI upscaling doesn’t just stretch the picture to fit the 4K panel</strong> but it also fills in missing details by guessing what should be there based on patterns it sees. This means that older movies and TV shows become clearer and more defined, so they can be watched on an 83-inch screen without looking pixelated or soft around the edges.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Vision AI goes even further by <strong>automatically changing settings based on the type of content you’re watching</strong>: Sports get better motion smoothing to keep fast camera pans clear, while movies get a different kind of treatment that keeps the cinematic feel with the right color grading and motion handling. You never have to go into settings menus or change picture modes by hand because the processor makes these changes automatically as scenes change in the same piece of content.</p>



<p>The<strong> OLED HDR feature makes contrast that LCD panels can’t match</strong> because each pixel makes its own light instead of using a backlight that bleeds into dark areas. When a scene goes from a bright outdoor shot to a dark interior shot, you can see true blacks in the shadows and highlights that stay bright without washing out the whole frame. This self-emissive technology lets you sit at wider angles without changing the color or lowering the contrast.</p>
<p>When you watch nature documentaries, cooking shows, or anything else where accurate color reproduction changes how you see the picture, Pantone validation makes sure that the colors match real-world references. Instead of looking too pink or orange like some TVs that value bright colors over accuracy, skin tones look natural in different lighting and ethnic groups. This validation process checks the display output against Pantone’s color standards.</p>



<p><em>Object Tracking Sound Lite</em> makes <strong>sounds that move across the screen to match where the action is happening</strong> in the frame: This makes the game feel more real, even if you’re using the built-in speakers instead of a surround sound system. The sound moves with the car as it drives from left to right instead of staying in the center channel and it helps your brain naturally connect visual and audio cues. <strong>Alexa integration lets you control the TV</strong>, look for content, and manage smart home devices without having to get up from your chair.</p>
<p>Right now, you can save $1,800 off the regular price of $2,497, and you get the <strong>newest model from 2025 with better AI processing</strong> that older models don’t have. This Cyber Monday deal is great for anyone who wants to improve their home theater and the huge screen, self-lit OLED pixels, and neural network upscaling work&nbsp; make streaming services, gaming, and regular TV watching feel like high-quality entertainment that is worth the money.</p>

Engineered for both work and play, the V2 Iskur supports your upper and lower back, features adjustable armrests, and offers thicker padding to keep you comfortable for long stretches. This model also has a wider seat compared to the original iteration, allowing for more even pressure distribution. An integrated lumbar arch support helps you maintain a healthy posture, and the chair offers an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees for a more relaxed position. One thing to note is that the V2 Iskur will require assembly, but it's easy and relatively quick thanks to the included instructions.</p><p><strong>Razer Iskur V2 Gaming Chair Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Ergonomic-Gaming-Built/dp/B0DP5SY554?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a> -- $250 (<del>$300</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Ergonomic-Gaming-Built/dp/B0DXS1BVCB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light Gray</a> -- $250 (<del>$300</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>Amazon also has several other <a href="https://amzn.to/48ex6Ek" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer gaming chairs on sale</a> currently.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/galaxy-buds-3-pro-go-for-new-all-time-low-samsung-wants-to-sell-10x-more-than-airpods-this-cyber-monday-2000648805</link>
            <guid>1368367</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s goal with their AI-powered earbuds was to make them understand how you listen instead of making you change how you listen – and they did this before Apple even announced that the AirPods Pro 3 would have similar features. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro has adaptive intelligence</strong> that automatically changes based on your surroundings and makes them smarter than anything else you have in your ears right now.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">lowered the price of these silver earbuds from $249 to just $159 for Cyber Monday weekend</a>. This is the lowest price ever for Samsung’s best wireless earbuds. Since Apple’s latest model doesn’t beat these on any important spec, this deal is even better for anyone who wants high-quality sound without the high price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI That Hears What You Say</h2>
<p>Samsung made these earbuds with Galaxy AI technology which does the hard work for you so you don’t have to think about it. The adaptive active noise cancellation <strong>always keeps an eye on your surroundings and changes itself on the fly</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with settings when you go from a quiet office to a busy street. This means that when the earbuds sense that the environment is louder, they automatically turn up the noise cancellation. And when you need to hear conversations or announcements around you, they turn it down.</p>
<p>The adaptive equalizer goes even further by looking at how the buds fit in your ear and changing the sound profile to fit: Everyone’s ears are different, so the same earbuds can sound very different to different people.</p>



<p>The new fit fixes one of the biggest problems people had with older Galaxy Buds models: they were uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Samsung changed the design of these Buds 3 Pro to a canal style and the stems are shaped like blades which helps with <strong>stability and keeps the weight evenly distributed</strong>. When you use the stems, they light up with a soft glow. This looks cool and also makes them easier to find when you put them down in low light.</p>
<p>The Real-Time Interpreter feature turns these earbuds into a t<strong>ravel buddy that helps you talk to people in person</strong> who don’t speak the same language. When you turn on this feature, the person speaking Spanish hears their language through the phone speaker, and you hear the English translation directly in your ears. This makes the conversation flow smoothly without both people having to huddle around a screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>sound quality is good because there are two amplifiers and planar tweeters</strong> that handle high frequencies well and keep distortion low even when the volume is high. The dedicated high and low frequency channels keep bass and treble processing separate. This keeps tracks with a lot of instruments in different frequency ranges from getting muddy. You can hear this separation best in orchestral music or thick electronic music, where cheaper earbuds tend to make everything sound like a wall of sound.</p>
<p>At $159, you’re getting Samsung’s best earbuds for $90 less than their normal price: This puts them in the same price range as mid-range options that don’t have any AI features. The <strong>two-year Amazon-only warranty</strong> gives you twice the coverage you would normally get.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-crash-to-all-time-low-year-round-lighting-cheaper-than-budget-holiday-lights-2000648801</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting systems get rid of the yearly hassle of putting up and taking down disposable holiday lights every winter, then storing the tangled strands that always stop working the next year. Govee’s permanent outdoor lights “Pro” stay up all year on your roofline or eaves and you can change the color scheme for holidays, seasons, or everyday accent lighting with just a few taps in an app.</p>
<p>Installation is surprisingly easy because the clips have adhesive backs that attach each light in about eight seconds: This gets rid of the ladder gymnastics and frustration that make hanging lights the most hated chore. Normally, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">200-foot kit with 120 RGBIC LED lights costs $759 but Amazon is currently offering it for just $459, which is the lowest price ever</a>. This deal started on Black Friday and will last through Cyber Monday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Gives You Real Color Flexibility</h2>
<p>The RGBWWIC label means that <strong>each bulb has six separate LED chips: red, green, blue, warm white, cool white</strong>&nbsp;and an integrated circuit control that lets you control each light separately. This wider range of colors goes beyond basic RGB systems that have trouble getting whites right. It gives you bright, saturated colors for parties and holidays, as well as natural warm and cool whites that are good for everyday outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>warm white mode at 2700K makes the room feel cozy</strong>, like old-fashioned Edison bulbs. The <strong>cool white mode at 6500K</strong>, on the other hand, gives off bright light that is great for security or task lighting around doorways and walkways.<strong> Each light can give off up to 50 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is bright enough to light up the outside of your home instead of just adding decorative touches that get lost in street lighting.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design makes the light into a triangular beam pattern that cuts down on harsh glare while still letting people on the street and in nearby homes see it. This optical engineering stops the raw LED bulbs from blinding people when they look directly at them, making the display more pleasant for you and anyone who walks by your house. The<strong> 75 pre-programmed scene modes</strong> have animated effects like color waves, twinkling patterns, and gradient transitions that move across the whole 200-foot run.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app lets you control each LED individually so you can change the colors of different parts of your roofline to make patterns, text, or images on the outside of your home. You could show off the colors of your favorite sports team, write messages for special occasions, or make patterns of the American flag for patriotic holidays without having to buy different light strings.</p>
<p>The <strong>lights and power adapter both have an IP67 waterproof rating</strong>&nbsp;which means that they can be submerged in water up to 1 meter deep without being damaged. This makes them very safe from rain, snow, and sprinkler overspray. The <strong>IP65</strong> control box doesn’t protect as well but it can still handle heavy rain and dust without any problems. <strong>Govee says these lights will last for 50,000 hours</strong> which is more than 5 years of continuous use or decades of normal seasonal use.</p>



<p>To install, use the included VHB (Very High Bond) adhesive and clips to attach the lights 2 to 4 inches away from the wall or soffit. Each clip snaps onto the light housing and sticks to the outside of your house. This keeps the bulb at the right angle and distance for the best light distribution. The system comes in 16.4-foot sections that connect with waterproof joints. This lets you go around corners, over different rooflines, or skip parts where things like chimneys get in the way.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday price of $459 instead of $759 makes permanent outdoor lighting cost less than many homeowners spend on disposable lights over just a few years, while delivering capabilities that temporary strands can’t approach.</p>

            <p>
I understand why walking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sims</a> aren't really a thing any more. Some of the earliest big names like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a>, and arguably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> all came at a time where indie games were growing in popularity, but were still predominantly 2D. Something simple like a walking sim is obviously quite resourceful compared to contemporary AAA games, but now the indie scene has blown up to the point where mechanics-first genres like roguelikes are dominating. Except I like walking sims! So when a game like nophenia, a walking sim where you're a wolfgirl with a flip phone exploring different dream worlds, shows up, I'm going to pay attention.

There is a real boldness to nophenia's very simple Steam page. "There is… no game," the about section explains. "You walk around and explore brutalist but also dream-like environments." Aside from that, it explains that there are dedicated "sit" and "howl" buttons because "wolfgirls are super cool" (wolfgirls are super cool), and lists out the controls. Mysterious…

Luckily, there's a (very short, I should note) demo to try out. It really is as simple as it describes, you can walk or run around, jump, but primarily you're taking in the sights. And these sights are quite lonely. There's no one else around, apart from in one dream where there is an infinitely passing train. In another dream, umbrellas strewn across a flooded road imply passersby. You let out a howl, only for it to not be reciprocated. All you can do is press forward, more so figuratively, moving from one dream to the next, taking all the time you want in each of them, unable to return to the previous one.
</p>
<p>
I like the flip phone pause menu too. There's a quality of longing in the demo for some kind of quiet, a sense of digital escape. It doesn't feel like an accident that you start in a messy bedroom with a boarded up door, the main source of light coming from a computer, the current source of all evil in this world. There's a photo mode too, and while aesthetically you're not using your flip phone, that's obviously the vibe, with the screenshots it produces outputting at a measly but nostalgic 640x480p.
</p><p>
Everything nophenia has going for it makes a strong argument for the value of walking sims. They're a genre that forces us to take our time, slow down a little, stay with our thoughts, and that seems to come through thematically here as well.
</p>
<p>
What other dreams nophenia might hold, I look forward to seeing whenever it arrives in early 2026. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3979330/nophenia/">here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-sold-out-after-black-friday-chaos-amazon-offers-ps5-pro-at-record-low-this-cyber-monday-2000648789</link>
            <guid>1368343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The PS5 Slim, both the Digital and Standard editions, sold out completely during Black Friday sales. But the good news is that Amazon just cut the price of the PS5 Pro for Cyber Monday weekend and gives shoppers a rare chance to get Sony’s very best console at a record low price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This PlayStation 5 Pro usually costs $749, but the current deal brings the price down to $648</a>, a record low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True 4K Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>GPU in the PS5 Pro has 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory than the base PS5</strong> and gives it the power to run demanding games at full 4K resolution without using upscaling tricks. You won’t have to choose between frame rate and resolution anymore when you play games that are optimized for the Pro because the Pro can handle both at the same time.</p>
<p>PS5 Pro enhancement patches for games like Spider-Man 2, Horizon Forbidden West, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <strong>unlock higher resolutions, better textures, and smoother performance that the base PS5 hardware</strong> can’t keep up with. You will immediately notice the difference in image clarity when there is a lot of movement or in detailed open-world environments where the standard PS5 drops resolution to keep performance up.</p>
<p>PlayStation <em>Spectral Super Resolution</em> is a custom <strong>AI-driven upscaling technology</strong> that looks at game images at the pixel level and reconstructs detail that is close to native 4K quality from lower resolution inputs. This machine learning method works differently from simple checkerboard rendering because it looks at how each pixel should look based on trained models instead of just filling in the gaps between existing pixels. <strong>PSSR lets games render at 1440p or 1800p internally and then upscale to 4K with very little loss of quality</strong>.</p>



<p>Dedicated hardware acceleration <strong>speeds up ray tracing calculations by up to three time</strong>s compared to the base console and makes ray tracing much better. Ray-traced reflections, shadows and global illumination effects that used to slow down frame rates on standard PS5 now run at playable speeds. This makes these visual improvements useful instead of just tech demos that you admire for a short time before turning them off.</p>
<p>The <strong>2TB internal SSD doubles the storage space of the first PS5 models</strong> which is good because modern games often take up more than 100GB with all their updates and DLC. With this extra storage, you can keep a dozen AAA games ready to play without having to delete and redownload them all the time based on what you want to play that night.</p>



<p>The <strong>console doesn’t come with a disc drive</strong> so you’ll have to buy games and movies digitally unless you spend $79 on Sony’s optional external drive. This choice keeps costs down, but it also means that there are no used game markets, no sharing games with friends, and no watching 4K Blu-rays without buying more.</p>
<p>The <strong>included DualSense controller has the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong> that made the PS5’s tactile experience stand out. These features set PlayStation apart from its competitors. The console has Wi-Fi 7, which makes downloads faster and streaming more stable. It also has USB-C ports on the front for easy charging of accessories.</p>
<p>The Pro costs only $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition when both are at full price, which is a very small premium for double the storage and much better performance. You’re getting hardware that will last for years and play the best settings on upcoming games, ray tracing features that make gameplay better instead of just screenshots, and instant upgrades to your current game library.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">As the game shifts from Chapter 6 - 7.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developer Epic Games has announced that 10.5 million players just tuned in for Zero Hour, the highly-anticipated live event that featured heroes from the world's biggest franchises turning up Avengers: Endgame-style to save the day. Online, at least 3 million more watched the event via streaming platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Man, Superman, Godzilla and the KPop Demon Hunters were just some of the characters who made appearances within the event, as Fortnite's finest gathered to defeat the Dark Presence, the game's latest Big Bad. Many of the characters appearing in the event had been teased ahead of time, though exactly what would happen was left uncertain. And indeed, despite going multiple rounds with King Kong and a Star Destroyer, the Dark Presence was still left standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest surprise of the event was quite how much Fortnite celebrated its own beloved lore, with the Dark Presence finally defeated thanks to a last-ditch decision by Jonesy to call in the game's  villainous Cube. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full Fortnite Zero Hour live event gameplay! 🎬</p><p>Epic just pulled off its own version of Avengers Endgame 🔥</p><p>How would you rate the event out of 10? 👀<a href="https://t.co/ifWqkeNKF6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ifWqkeNKF6</a></p></div>— Beebom Gaming (@beebomgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/beebomgaming/status/1994851824491532353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now sharing gameplay of the event and finding numerous Easter eggs, such as characters from Steal the Brainrot being featured in the background, and Hatsune Miku joining the battle while perched on Godzilla's head. I particularly love this fan creation, which overlays Avengers: Endgame's score on top of Zero Hour's "portals" sequence:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite Zero Hour Event (with Endgame Music)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteZeroHour?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#FortniteZeroHour</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/6Jacvsq3px" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Jacvsq3px</a></p>— ABALDY (@ABaldy64) <a href="https://twitter.com/ABaldy64/status/1994857279796253165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty here, too, for Fortnite lore fans to digest. As Hope herself questioned, who was piloting the Mecha Team Leader mech? (A member of the Seven?) Will the destruction of the Cube lead to its mothership reappearing? (Yes, see below!) And how is Epic Games going to top this next year? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the event's gameplay portion complete, some players reported seeing their games abruptly crash as an unexpected cutscene began to air. The cinematic, which you can watch in full below, quickly sums up Fortnite's clearly now-revived original storyline and makes absolutely clear that the game is returning to its focus on its heroic Seven, and their battle against the Cube's civilization, dubbed The Last Reality.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, players were treated to a quick glimpse at what's next for the game (and yes, Epic Games couldn't resist making a 6-7 joke in the process). Fortnite Chapter 7 will begin with our heroes enjoying life on a new map themed around the southern US. There are Fortnite-y versions of Hollywood and Area 51 to explore, while fresh gameplay changes include wingsuits and drivable Reboot Vans. Everything seems pretty chill, until The Last Reality's mothership does indeed turn up (and promptly blows up Fortnite's beloved Battle Bus!)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And after <em>that</em>, for those still connected, Fortnite really did call it a day. The game is now offline for a number of hours, with the launch of Chapter 7 due as the game comes back online later tonight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Crikey, it's been a long time coming, but it looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> is finally coming to a close… next year. Up until earlier this week, the fifth and final episode of The Long Dark's Wintermute DLC was due to be released by the end of the year. As you've probably gathered, the end of the year is very close now, so as a result, episode five has been delayed, but it is a delay that at least comes with a concrete release date.
</p>
<p>
The release date in question is March 31st, 2026, about four months away. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hinterland">Hinterland</a> Studio explained the delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">Steam post</a> thusly: "While the majority of the episode content is now finished, there was just no way for us to wrap up the remaining cinematic work, the soundtrack, or complete the last bit of mission polish in time for the end of this year as we had originally planned. So we’re taking a couple of extra months to finish that work, then to optimize, fix the bugs, and get it ready for console certification and launch for the end of March."

<p>
With this delay and formal release date announcement came a new trailer too, showing off bits and pieces of what you can expect from episode five, which is titled The Light at the End of All Things. A bit of a wordy title, but, I suppose it goes with the emotional angle the trailer went for. It's just a lot of shots of scenery you'll presumably experience with a melancholic voice over, like a town next to a frozen lake, a boat at night time while an aurora borealis shines above, and some kind of radar station. The last bit of dialogue you hear is "nothing lasts forever," which, sheesh, that's a real bummer my guy!
</p><p>
In any case, while this might be the end of The Long Dark, it's not the end of The Long Dark (the series). About a year ago Hinterlands announced that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-2-announced-with-co-op-multiplayer-new-urban-areas-and-sanity-system">working on a sequel</a>, called Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 (can't tell you why Blackfrost isn't a subtitle, seems bad for branding, but what do I know). This one will feature things like co-op multiplayer, some urban areas, and a sanity system, so if this last episode of The Long Dark doesn't scratch certain itches for you, it's possible its sequel will.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley posted some mysterious images this morning. However, it seems fans have already&nbsp;started to figure out what those teases could be.</p>



<p>On December 11th, The Game Awards are set to go live on social media. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, the event celebrates the best of the year’s games. This year is host to a plethora of amazing titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. However, in recent shows, it’s also been home to huge reveals like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. This morning, Geoff Keighley and The Game Awards’ socials posted <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1994816833464217796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weird photos of a mysterious statue</a> and location. Now, it seems the mystery is going a bit deeper thanks to one fan’s journey to said locale.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-awards-mysterious-statue-seen-in-real-life-hints-at-future-reveal">The Game Awards’ Mysterious Statue Seen in Real Life, Hints at Future Reveal</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned before, The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley released a picture of a statue and a desert location in New Mexico. Fans on Reddit speculated everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1p9uzuu/another_teaser_for_the_game_awards_do_you_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1p9vgwx/dont_believe_his_lies_dont_believe_his_lies_dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Half-Life</a>. However, user <a href="https://x.com/TotallyNOTTrio/status/1994843343575224514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TotallyNOTTrio</a> noticed they lived not far from it and took a trip to the site. There, as pictured above, we get a closer look at the statue, which is adorned with demon-like creatures and a big yellow eye with tentacles. According to the user, the staff on location were quiet about what it could actually mean.</p>



<p>Luckily, it seems fans are already hard at work conjuring what it could be. The most likely consensus is that it’s for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s Saros</a>, as the visual design and architecture look similar to the upcoming Housemarque title. Perhaps a bit of a stretch, fans are hoping it’s referring to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/julian-lefay-father-elder-scrolls-passed-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls</a>, as both series have eldritch enemies and a similar visual style. Plus, the series are no strangers to The Game Awards, so the collaboration isn’t out of left field. Its fans are going crazy on Reddit, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/1p9vswt/this_geoff_post_on_twitter_what_you_guys_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">referencing the armor as one of Kratos</a>‘ and others believing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1p9nef1/youre_thinking_about_the_teaser_wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it has a connection to Oblivion</a>.</p>



<p>Another one, Diablo 4, is another good choice, given it feels like it’s time for a new expansion, and the statue fits with something one could see in-game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1p9mf6w/geoff_keighley_dropped_this_new_expansion_or_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans on the subreddit</a> do think that, while it does go too far for an expansion, it could tease the Paladin class’s addition to the game. Additionally, it could very well be a new game from a big studio, given the marketing strategy. Unfortunately, it may be some time before it’s known what exactly it is, but it’s certainly one great way to market your game.</p>



<p>What do you think the statue is referring to? Saros? God of War? Elder Scrolls? Diablo? Another franchise? Leave a comment below or on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Doom By Fate monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards and get ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>If you’re afraid of the dark, then this game is definitely not for you. Quite clearly inspired by Dead By Daylight, Doom By Fate is a popular survival horror <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players are thrown into short rounds in a dark place with a deadly killer on the loose. The main objective of the game is to survive through the night without getting killed, but that’s easier said than done. Although players have the option to jump and sprint, getting away from the killer is no easy task.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Surviving in a limited space when there’s a murderous killer on the loose is hard enough, but throw in the fact that you also have to complete objectives, and you have quite the challenge on your hands. Considering this, it’s essential for the players to try and coordinate to have the higest chance of surviving through the round. As expected, the killer’s job is simply to eliminate all of the players before the timer runs out. With a variety of playable survivor characters to unlock, Doom By Fate encourages grinding, as a lot of cash is required to make most purchases. This is where Doom By Fate codes can come to your rescue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-doom-by-fate-codes">Expired Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Doom By Fate, as the game only came out recently. It’s currently in Alpha, so more codes and content updates are likely on the horizon. The moment any of the active codes expire, they will promptly be moved to this section of the page. Moreover, players are urged to use the active codes and reap the rewards before they eventually expire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many Roblox games nowadays demand that players join the game’s <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/35983705/what-is-what-is#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Roblox developer group</a> and like the game before unlocking the code redemption feature for them, and Doom By Fate falls into that category too. Once that’s done, however, redeeming codes is a simple process that requires next to no effort. Here’s a step-by-step guide:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Doom By Fate.</li>



<li>Click on the Settings button at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Hit the Enter key to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-doom-by-fate-codes">How To Get More Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>Considering that the game is still in alpha, it’s not surprising that there’s only one active code at the moment. However, the sheer amount of popularity that game has received means that more codes are surely on the horizon. New codes are released through the game’s socials and Discord server, so tracking both of those might be a good idea. A better idea though, would be to simply bookmark this page and check in every so often, as we update this article with new codes as soon as they drop.&nbsp;</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, Kill Bill, was famously so long that it was split into two separate movies: Kill Bill Volume 1 and its sequel, Volume 2, released about half a year apart back in the early aughts. Soon, it'll celebrate a re-release, Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, which stitches the movies back together and adds new scenes, too. But even a movie of its length has scenes left on the cutting room floor. Using Epic's Unreal Engine, Tarantino is closing a chapter of his career that's been more than 20 years in the making.</p><p dir="ltr">Totally separate from the new scenes found within The Whole Bloody Affair, The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge is a roughly 10-minute scene built in Unreal Engine that brings together the Kill Bill series and, unexpectedly--or perhaps not--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>. I recently attended the premiere of Yuki's Revenge at the packed Vista Theater in Los Angeles, alongside Tarantino and "The Bride" herself, Uma Thurman, who were on hand to debut this long-lost scene now that it's found its surprising home.</p><p dir="ltr">The scene, Tarantino explained after the showing, was always considered by him to have happened in the canon of the Kill Bill story. "The audience just didn't see it," he explained, as it wasn't feasible at that time for the cast and crew to film what is essentially another bloody fight scene in a movie already full of them. Its absence was known to film buffs and fans of the director <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jvv8n/the_missing_chapter_of_kill_bill_yukis_revenge/" rel="nofollow ">going back years</a>, with many wishing it had made it into the movie originally.</p><p dir="ltr">Tarantino explained how Epic approached him ahead of Fortnite Chapter 7, interested to learn if he had any story ideas that they could produce together for the West Coast- and Hollywood-themed season, Pacific Break. Always looking to make a splash--for last year's big beat, Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice played a surprise concert in Times Square--Epic wanted to roll out something from the famous director to promote Fortnite's new chapter, which will presumably span the next year if tradition holds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612472"></a><figcaption>Yuki's Revenge was once assumed lost to history. Instead, it lives on in Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As it so happens, Tarantino revealed to the developer-publisher that he'd been sitting on a scene he'd dearly missed for 20+ years. The timing seemed impeccable. Epic would get its next big thing. Tarantino would close the book on something that he'd probably given up on making years ago. And so, somehow, Fortnite--where nothing really feels impossible anymore--is now home to a never-before-seen lost chapter from Quentin Tarantino's filmography.</p><p dir="ltr">Uma Thurman returned to provide voice and face capture for her starring role, and the vignette plays out much like the rest of the movie, but it's where it's not so faithful that I find it most interesting. Fortnite doesn't depict blood, so neither does Yuki's Revenge. There's also, naturally, a distinct lack of swear words that comes off as uncanny in a Tarantino-involved production. In the chapter's funniest recurring bit, characters other than The Bride and Yuki are depicted by Fortnite originals, like Peely, the bipedal banana and Skull Trooper, who spectates with a big bucket of popcorn in his lap while Kill Bill's violent femmes kick up dust in the streets.</p><p dir="ltr">The end result makes for a peculiar crossover, but one that illustrates Fortnite's unprecedented staying power. Epic has plans to grow Fortnite well beyond being the "battle royale" game, and we see these plans come to fruition on the perpetual treadmill of updates in the game, as the studio continues to rebuild Fortnite like the Ship of Theseus.</p><p dir="ltr">Things like Fortnite Festival and Creative mode illustrate this to a certain audience--those already logging in to play video games. But as the studio continues exploring what "Fortnite" even means, not just today, but 10 years from now, this lost chapter from Kill Bill provides another vantage point into that future. Fortnite can be a battle royale game. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-5v5-first-person-ballistic-mode-is-now-live/1100-6528379/" data-ref-id="1100-6528379">Counter-Strike</a>. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wont-call-this-fortnite-2-but-it-feels-that-way-to-me/1100-6519829/" data-ref-id="1100-6519829">Rock Band, or Minecraft, or Mario Kart</a>. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ariana-grande-rift-tour-watch-it-here/1100-6494920/" data-ref-id="1100-6494920">an Ariana Grande concert</a>. It can be a 20-year-in-the-making lost chapter from Kill Bill, too. What is Fortnite? Increasingly, Fortnite is whatever it wants to be.</p><p dir="ltr">Yuki's Revenge debuts in Fortnite on November 30.</p>

            <p>
When I first caught a very quick glimpse at Into the Fire, the kind of glimpse where you more just see a character design amidst a bunch of fire, I thought it was a new simulation game. A fireman <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>, that kind of thing, the kind of game I'm sure exists already without needing to Google it. Into the Fire is not that at all. There is fire, and there is rescue, but there are also ancient mysteries amongst natural disasters, fiery, destructive jellyfish-esque spirits, and a tantalizing mix of science-fiction, folklore, and the supernatural.
</p>
<p>
Remember The Invincible? Well, Into the Fire is from the same devs, and while our newly anointed editorial director Julian had some misgivings about The Invincible in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-invincible-review">review</a> at the time, my curiosity with Starward Industries' next has still been piqued. Details are quite light on who you are in Into the Fire, apart from the fact that you're a "bold explorer struggling to survive during a volcanic eruption on Dante’s Archipelago." Hang on… have we got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hell-maiden-makes-a-compelling-case-for-mixing-hades-vampire-survivors-anime-and-uh-dantes-divine-comedy">yet another</a> Divine Comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dantes-epic-poem-la-divina-commedia-is-getting-turned-into-a-videogame-again">adaptation</a> on our hands here? I suppose time will tell.
</p>
<p>
The core loop appears to be this: there is a hub, seemingly nearish to said volcano, where you can do bits of crafting and upgrading, rest a bit, find some lore, and choose your equipment before heading out on missions. Your equipment looks like quite standard firefighting stuff, like a big ole axe, and a fire extinguisher attached to your back that you spray across fires to put them out.
</p>
<p>
For the missions themselves, things look tricky, based on the game's latest trailer (as seen above). There's those aforementioned sort of jellyfish fire spirits you have to fend off, amongst others for one. But there's also the rescuing people. This isn't like, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, where you can foist them on your backpack, you actually have to carry them, and that might mean across thin planks of wood above a burning pit. Amongst the action it looks like there is a borderline puzzley navigational element that'll put your quick mapping skills and reflexes to the test.
</p><p>
As it stands, there's no release date for this game other than sometime in 2026, but whenever it does launch it'll do so in early access. In the meantime, you can wishlist Into the Fire here if it takes your fancy.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Servers Down For Chapter 7 Launch]]></title>

<p>Fortner servers are down ahead of the launch of Chapter 7, following the huge end-of-chapter event that marked an end to the previous chapter.</p>



<p>The Zero Point live event was stacked with collabs, including the likes of Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and Homer Simpson, and servers immediately went offline after the conclusion of the event in preparation for Chapter 7’s launch.</p>



<p>Taking the Fortnite servers down immediately was an unexpected move by many, considering the usual start time of downtime for new content is at 2 AM ET, but Epic Games announced the downtime in advance of the event to give players a heads up.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-downtime-end">When Will Fortnite Downtime End?</h2>

<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1994771674793996483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> ahead of the event, Epic Games stated that downtime would commence immediately after the event’s conclusion, and in-game, a precise countdown was shared.</p>



<p>Fittingly for Chapter 7, downtime will last four seven hours, and there is a live countdown available in-game. That downtime is a similar length to what was witnessed prior to the launch of Chapter 6, though there could still be server issues when the season commences.</p>



<p>A host of players complained on social media of being disconnected during the live event, which had over 10 million active players watching the action, and server instability may be present when Chapter 7 first kicks off.</p>



<p>It will be late in the evening in the United States, however, and the middle of the night for Europe, which may reduce the flood of players heading into the game immediately when servers return.</p>



<p>During downtime, several prominent content creators will be publishing footage from an early access Chapter 7 launch event, similar to what was seen ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>

In the meantime, though, Fortnite's servers are offline for maintenance and to deploy the Chapter 7 update. There's no bug here--Fortnite is offline on purpose. But it shouldn't be down for long.</p><p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em> Servers are back online as of 4:30 PM PT. Chapter 7 has begun!</p><h2>When will Fortnite Chapter 7 start?</h2><p>In the past, the start of a new chapter came with longer periods of downtime--like a day or more--but these days Epic tends to treat new season and new chapter updates the same as it would a regular mid-month patch. That means you can expect Fortnite to be offline for between 4 and 7 hours, with Chapter 7 likely launching <strong>in the evening on Saturday, November 29, likely around 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET</strong>--primetime, in other words.</p><p>We guarantee nothing, however, as these launches don't always go smoothly. Just a month ago, when the Simpsons season began, all seemed well when Fortnite returned from maintenance--but after an hour, the servers crashed and the game went back offline for a while. And there was another update earlier this year that ended up taking Fortnite offline for an entire additional day. But such incidents are rare, and most updates go off without major hitches.</p><p>When Chapter 7 launches, it'll come with a pretty loaded battle pass, teased by Epic to feature Marty McFly from Back to the Future and Beatrix "The Bride" Kiddo from Kill Bill.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-zero-profit-on-beats-solo-4-50-hour-wireless-headphones-at-cyber-monday-low-2000648763</link>
            <guid>1368232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the premium headphone market, big names like Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats compete with each other by offering different features and prices to different types of listeners. The <strong>Beats Solo 4 is the perfect choice if you want great sound quality, spatial head tracking, and modern connectivity features</strong> without having to pay extra for active noise cancellation.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday weekend, Amazon has the lowest price ever on this model which competes directly with models that cost a lot more: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The regular price is $199, but it’s now only $129</a>. Instead of cramming in every possible tech feature, they focused on battery life, comfort, and sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long battery life and compatibility with all devices</h2>
<p>Beats designed the <strong>Solo 4 to last up to 50 hours on a single charge</strong> which changes the way you use wireless headphones all week long. You can fly across the country several times, go to work every day for two weeks or binge-watch entire TV shows without having to look for a charging cable. The USB-C charging port has fast fuel technology that lets you <strong>play for 5 hours on a 10-minute charge</strong> when you’re running late. The <strong>Solo 4 connects to both iOS and Android devices</strong> via Bluetooth so you don’t have to worry about being stuck in one ecosystem if you switch between platforms for work and play.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm drivers in each ear cup make Beats’ “custom acoustic platform,”</strong> which adjusts the frequency response to give you strong bass without drowning out vocals and instruments in the mid and high ranges. You will be able to hear the thump of kick drums and bass lines clearly while still being able to understand every word in podcasts or other content with a lot of dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make listening more immersive by tying sound to your device instead of your head movements. When you turn your head while watching a movie, the sound stays in the same place on the screen, just like it does in a real theater. This feature turns on automatically when you play content that works with it on Apple devices and some Android phones.</p>
<p>To fix the comfort issues that plagued earlier Solo models during long wear sessions, Beats changed the headband and ear cushions: The very light construction spreads pressure more evenly over your head, and the soft foam cushions make a tight seal without the vice-grip feeling that gives you headaches after an hour. The on-ear design folds flat into a small shape that fits easily into backpacks or carry-on bags.</p>



<p>The matte black finish doesn’t show fingerprints and scratches as easily as glossy finishes, which show every smudge within hours of opening the box. <strong>Beats comes with a 3.5mm audio cable</strong> so you can connect to older devices that don’t have Bluetooth or keep listening when the battery dies after a long time of use.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal brings the price of the Solo 4 down from $199 to $129 and puts it in direct competition with budget models that give up battery life, build quality, or platform compatibility. You’re getting a high-end Beats product for less than what many mid-range brands charge, plus the brand recognition and customer service that come with owning an Apple product.</p>

            <p>
All that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-warn-that-monster-hunter-rise-world-and-wilds-might-not-run-on-windows-10-pcs-after-october-14th">trouble going on with Monster Hunter Wilds</a> aside, for a good long while now Capcom has been doing quite well for itself. Multiple quite well liked Resident Evil games, fresh new bits like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and even a few remasters, namely for the Ace Attorney games (throw a dog a bone and give us a new one of those, though Capcom), but also for series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising</a> that also haven't had a new entry in a while. Well, for now at least, as a new report suggests a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising</a> might be in our future.
</p>
<p>
This comes from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood">MP1ST</a>, whose sources have informed them of a new Dead Rising game that's supposedly been in the works since at least 2024 with the codename Rec. According to the report, protagonist of the first game Frank West will be making a return, with the belief being that it's a direct sequel to the first entry - MP1ST notes they couldn't completely confirm this part, however, so it could still be a completely new game.
</p>
<p>
In terms of other details MP1St are more confident in, the game will apparently be set in Hollywood, specifically on a big, enclosed movie studio lot. The villain of the game is supposedly a film director that forces Frank, amongst others, into completing different trials for the purpose of making his "perfect movie."
</p>
<p>
There wasn't any word on a release date, it's worth noting, so you should probably still expect it to be a while away. And, with all rumours, take it with a good pinch of salt. If Capcom are working on a new Dead Rising, though, I'll be curious to see how it lands. The original series was self-indulgent in a way that felt very of its time - the remaster of the first one, for instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-rising-remaster-no-longer-gives-you-points-for-erotica-creepshots-because-its-not-required-or-appropriate">doesn't give you points for "Erotica" creepshots</a> on the grounds of not being "required" or "appropriate", a clear sign of different times. Perhaps we need to think more deeply about the unceremonious slaughtering of zombies more too! For now, time will tell whether this rumour comes true.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-beam-with-dolby-atmos-hits-record-low-on-amazon-black-soundbar-for-cyber-monday-at-zero-margin-2000648759</link>
            <guid>1368214</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos is known for making high-quality audio products and the Beam (Gen 2) shows why <strong>the company is still the best in the soundbar business</strong>. TVs these days are getting thinner and more stylish but that slim design comes with a trade-off: the built-in speakers don’t have enough room to make good sound. This makes a frustrating gap between beautiful 4K visuals and disappointing audio that ruins movies, shows, and music.</p>
<p>The Sonos Beam fixes this by turning your living room into a mini theater with Dolby Atmos support and smart home integration. For Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">you can get it for $349, which is $150 less than its normal price of $499</a>. This is the lowest price ever and makes premium sound more affordable than ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Quality Sound Technology in a Small Package</h2>
<p>The Beam has great hardware in a surprisingly small frame that won’t take over your entertainment center. The <strong>speaker array has one center tweeter, four full-range woofers, and three passive radiators</strong> that work together to make 200 watts of total output power. Five Class-D digital amplifiers power the array. With this setup, the soundbar can handle frequencies as low as 50.4 Hz and gives it deep bass without needing a separate subwoofer for most people. <strong>Dolby Atmos</strong> processing is what really makes the magic happen: It makes virtual height channels that bounce sound off your ceiling to make it sound like it’s coming from above.</p>



<p>The Beam from Sonos is more than just a TV and movie player: When your screen is off, <strong>the soundbar becomes a high-tech music streaming device</strong> that connects to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and many other services through built-in Wi-Fi. The <em>Trueplay</em> tuning technology uses the microphone on your iPhone to figure out how sound travels in your room and automatically changes the sound profile to make up for furniture, wall materials, and the shape of the room.</p>
<p>You can use the Sonos app, your current TV remote through HDMI-ARC, Apple AirPlay 2 for iOS users, or voice commands through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant to control everything. It only takes a few minutes to set up because you only need two cables: one HDMI cable to connect to your TV and one power cord. This means you won’t have to deal with the mess of wires that come with most surround sound systems.</p>



<p>Sonos is better than its competitors because you can add more devices to it while their ecosystems are closed and don’t allow for many upgrades. You can start with just the Beam and then add a Sonos Sub for deeper bass or pair two Sonos One speakers as rear channels to get real 5.1 surround sound. You can play music in different rooms or make a whole-home audio system that plays the same content in all of them because every Sonos speaker connects wirelessly to your home network.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal is a great deal for anyone who takes their home entertainment seriously because it’s only $349 instead of the usual $499. Soundbars that work with Dolby Atmos usually cost $600 or more. Cheaper options, on the other hand, may not be as well built, may not support apps, or may not be able to be expanded in the future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/digital-picture-frame-hits-55-off-on-amazon-60k-photo-storage-cheaper-than-basic-wall-frames-now-2000648754</link>

              <p>Digital picture frames fix the problem of printed photos collecting dust in albums that no one ever opens: They turn your favorite memories into a display that changes every day and is seen by everyone. With modern WiFi-enabled frames, family members can send photos from anywhere using a simple app which means that grandparents can get pictures of their grandkids right away without having to know how to use cloud storage or email attachments.</p>
<p>The 10.1-inch frame from <em>Euphro</em> makes everything easier with a touchscreen interface that anyone can use, even if they’ve never owned a smartphone or tablet. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/">Cyber Monday sale brought the price down from the usual $99 to $45</a> which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. That discount makes sense for a frame that has a lot of storage, a clear display, and easy photo sharing, all in a package that anyone can use without any technical knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>WiFi Sharing That Works and Isn’t Confusing</h2>
<p>The <strong>frame connects to your home’s Wi-Fi network</strong> through a simple setup process that shows you how to do it on the touchscreen. Once it’s connected, anyone you give permission to can send photos through the free <em>Uhale</em> app which is available for both iPhone and Android devices. Family members can easily get to your frame by downloading the app, making an account and asking for access with a unique code and you can then approve their request with just one tap. When you send photos through the app, they show up on the frame right away: This is the magical moment when grandma sees her grandson’s first day of school photos pop up in real time from hundreds of miles away.</p>



<p>The <strong>10.1-inch IPS touchscreen has a resolution of 1280×800</strong> which is enough to show photos clearly without the blurry, pixelated look that cheaper frames give. IPS technology keeps the colors true and bright even when you look at the screen from the side. Older LCD panels would wash out if you weren’t standing right in front of them. You can pause the slideshow to look at a favorite photo or skip over pictures you’ve seen recently with the touch interface, which responds smoothly to swipes and taps. Depending on how you set it up, you can turn the frame from portrait to landscape mode.</p>
<p>The <strong>internal storage can hold up to 32GB, which is enough for about 60,000 photos</strong> at the resolution of a typical smartphone so you’ll run out of wall space before you run out of memory. The <strong>frame can also take microSD cards</strong>&nbsp;but most people never get close to filling up the internal storage, even after years of regular photo uploads. You can send files directly from cameras, phones, or computers without having to worry about compatibility issues because JPEG, PNG, and MP4 files are just a few of the many image and video formats that work without conversion.</p>



<p>You can change how photos look by changing the order they show up in, the speed of the slideshow, and the transition effects between images. If some photos don’t fit the season or mood, you can hide them from the rotation. The frame will remember these settings until you change them. You can set the display order to show the newest photos first, shuffle them randomly, or play them in order of when they were taken.</p>
<p>Cutting the price by $54 makes this frame cheap enough to buy on a whim, and it has features that frames that cost twice as much have a hard time matching.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You should want the best out of your home entertainment setup. And that doesn’t just mean investing in a good TV for video quality. You’ve got to give audio some love too. Sure, a fancy 85-kinch OLED smart TV is going to look awesome in your living room, and while built-in TV speaker have gotten better over the years, they still don’t hold a candle to a dedicated surround sound system. This JBL soundbar and subwoofer combo offer a great improvement to your home entertainment soundscape without you needing to empty your bank account. And best of all, it’s on sale right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Normally the JBL Bar 500 goes for $650, but for a limited time deal for Black Friday week, you can get it for just $400.</a></p>
<p>This JBL soundbar measures across at exactly 101.7 centimeters. That can comfortably fit atop your media center right in front of your TV. The subwoofer works wirelessly, which means you don’t need to hide cables running from one side of the room to the other. That measures 10 inches high and will be the difference between a bass that booms and a bass that&nbsp;<strong>BOOMS</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With support for both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam surround sound, you can bring theater-like quality sound and feels like it’s coming from all directions in a 3D space, fully immersing your in the audio. And it does so without actually needing any additional surround sound speakers — just the 5.1-channnel&nbsp; system.</p>
<h2>Enhanced Dialogue</h2>
<p>Now one of the main reasons to upgrade to a soundbar over your TV’s built-in speakers is dialogue. TV shows and movies nowadays have a tendency to be mixed with more robust audio setups in mind. This is why when playing off just your TV speakers, you might sometimes find it hard to actually make out what anyone is saying. However, if you go to increase the volume, suddenly the next scene has erratically loud sound effects like explosions, gun fire, or even just background music.</p>



<p>The JBL 500 sound bar gives you the option to enhance dialogue separately from the rest of the audio. PureVoice Dialogue Enhancements algorithmically isolates and amplifies vocal clarity so that you don’t feel forced to always watch with the subtitles turned on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Tons of other smart features are packed into the JBL Bar 500 soundbar and subwoofer.</a> With Wi-Fi support, you can connect to your sound system from other devices on your network. Stream music to them over AirPlay from an iPhone or MacBook. You can even pair the soundbar with an Alexa smart home hub can control the speaker with voice commands.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> developer Team Cherry has revealed it won't be making the trip to The Game Awards next month, as the team believes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> will sweep the Game of the Year award.</p>
<p>Asked by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet">Bloomberg</a> if the studio was prepping for a visit to LA, co-founder William Pellen diplomatically said: "Maybe not. We’re pretty busy."</p>

<p>"This year I think we're safe. I think Expedition 33 [will win]," Pellen explained. "It's exceptional and broadly palatable. Whereas we're on that knife's edge, where it appeals to some and infuriates others."</p>
<p>In the same interview, Team Cherry also commented on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-hollow-knight-silksong-is-totally-fine-say-team-cherry-but-studio-is-largely-happy-with-difficulty-balance">the use of mods following heated debates over the game's imposing challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Silksong's difficulty level has been an ongoing discussion since the game finally released back in September. Developer Ari Gibson previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled</a>", though this wasn't enough for some. Soon after Silksong came out, several mods were released for the game, which added certain adjustable variables like damage and health.</p>
<p>On its release, we awarded Silksong five stars. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Eurogamer's Silksong review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Right now, Team Cherry's future is pretty unclear. There is some kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> DLC that'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">coming somewhere along the line</a>, but understandably the developer is keeping their cards close to their chest in terms of what's actually next. They certainly do have some ideas on how they would expand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, i.e. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-knows-if-well-ever-get-another-hollow-knight-but-if-we-do-you-can-expect-them-to-be-as-standalone-as-silksong">by not making any direct sequels</a>, much like how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> isn't one. But in a recent interview, Team Cherry spoke (ever so slightly) more openly about their own future and how the thing that might get in their way most is, well, death.
</p>
<p>
Lead dev's Ari Gibson and William Pellen were asked about, unsurprisingly, all things Hollow Knight in an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, notably how they're planning to allocate their time post Silksong. "We do have other games that we plan to make. The only time concern really is - and we’ve talked about this before - death," Gibson explained. "It’s not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it’d be nice to do a few more games. Apparently our timeframe still allows us to fit a few more in. Short of an unexpected tragedy."
</p>
<p>
Obviously quite a morbid sentiment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-morbid-one-kojima-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-for-kojima-productions-to-use-after-he-dies">one a number of devs seem to be thinking about as they get older</a>, although it's what Gibson says about future, hypothetical, non-Hollow Knight games that interests me: "We have said we’ll go elsewhere as well. Although we’ve also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with."
</p>
<p>
I find that particular thought process about Team Cherry's work curious, as it's very much the framework of an auteur. You can see this kind of thing in Hidetaka Miyazaki's games at FromSoftware, there are obvious, thematic connections between his games, even if staff may change between them, and it's those thematic connections that I'd be more curious to see in a future, non-Hollow Knight Team Cherry game.
</p><p>
When asked if they're sick of working on Hollow Knight, Gibson said that wasn't the case "at all," and they'd be happy to work on another one if forced to. On the other side, they'd also be interested in exploring their usual tastes but in a "slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with."
</p>
<p>
I'm always quite a fan of new attempts at relaying the same message but in different ways, it's something Guillermo del Toro does in his work, often looking at "the other," through different lenses. To me, the Hollow Knight games are very much about systems of power, and how power is distributed or withheld, so I hope if we do get something different from Team Cherry, it's at least as interesting as that.

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Quietly Moves Its Remaining 15.6″ Portable Gaming Monitor Stock Into Record-Low Clearance After 10K+ Black Friday Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/15-6-inch-kyy-portable-gaming-monitor-2000644924</link>
            <guid>1368178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen can often feel limited, especially if you’re someone who needs to work with multiple applications at the same time. Those who use a laptop as their main work or play device can benefit from adding a second, portable display to their setup, and today is a great time to bring one home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/">Amazon is currently offering quite a few impressive Cyber Monday deals, which also drops the price of the 15.6-inch KYY portable monitor to just $66.</a> That’s after a 34% discount on its $100 price tag, and the offer is open to all shoppers. Both Prime and non-Prime members can take advantage of it. Though it’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Display Modes for All Your Needs</h2>
<p>In a sleek, lightweight build, you’re getting a nice 15.6-inch screen. The size is similar to what most standard laptops offer, so you won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between both. The same goes for the visuals. The portable monitor offers a 1920×1080 resolution, which translates into brighter colors and sharper details. The advanced IPS matte screen supports a 178-degree full viewing angle, meaning you can enjoy consistent visuals from all directions. Basically, you don’t have to sit directly in front of the screen to view the content. This is great for when you have multiple people around; those at the back or on the side will be able to see just as clearly.</p>



<p>You can choose between multiple display modes (including mirror, extend, second screen only, and portrait mode), depending on what you need. Need to run two programs side by side? The extended mode gives you access to both. Reading through long documents? Portrait mode should work best!</p>
<p>The monitor includes two fully functional USB-C ports, which means you can connect it with just a single cable for both power and display, as long as your device supports Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode. The setup is plug-and-play, so you don’t need to worry about installing any complicated drivers to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/">Even better, it comes with a smart cover that not just protects it from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand you can use to prop the monitor up</a>. In short, if you have been wanting to expand your work or play setup with something that’s easy to carry around, this portable monitor can be a valuable addition.</p>

              <p>Dyson comes out with a new vacuum model almost every year, and the V11 is a big step up in the brand’s cordless line with 185 air watts of suction that makes a real difference on both carpets and hard floors.</p>
<p>On Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">the price dropped from $629 to $399 which is a new all-time low</a> for a model that still competes with Dyson’s newest models. That discount is important because you’re getting tech that was top-of-the-line just a few years ago, but now it’s priced more like mid-range competitors that can’t match its suction power, autonomy or build quality.</p>

<p>You can switch between three different power settings on the V11 using a button on the handle and it lets you control how much battery life you give up for cleaning power.<em> Auto mode</em> uses sensors in the cleaner head to figure out what kind of floor it is and changes the suction automatically. It increases suction on carpets and decreases it on hard floors to save battery life while still cleaning well. <strong>Eco mode extends runtime by up to 60 minutes</strong> by lowering suction to its lowest effective level. This is great for quick daily cleaning of hard surfaces that don’t need maximum power. When you turn on <em>boost mode</em>, it gives you the full 185 air watts for a few minutes of deep cleaning.</p>



<p>The <strong>LCD screen on top of the vacuum shows you what power mode you’re in</strong>, how much time is left until it runs out, and maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned or there are blockages. This real-time feedback takes away the guesswork that comes with other cordless vacuums. You won’t have to wonder if you have enough power to finish the room or if the loss of suction means a clog or just a full bin.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head has a <strong>brush bar that spins and has technology that keeps long hair and pet fur from getting stuck</strong> in the bristles: This means you don’t have to spend as much time cutting up tangles off the roller with scissors. The brush bar works on all kinds of floors without needing to be adjusted by hand and it moves smoothly from area rugs to tile to hardwood while still cleaning well.</p>



<p>It only takes a <strong>few seconds to switch the vacuum to handheld mode</strong> by removing the wand and connecting tools directly to the motor body. This makes it a powerful tool for cleaning furniture, stairs, and car interiors. The mini soft dusting brush can clean delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching them, and the crevice tool can get into baseboards and tight corners that regular vacuum heads can’t reach.</p>
<p>Advanced <strong>HEPA filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> which includes common allergens like dust mites, pollen, and pet dander that can make people allergic. The sealed filtration system makes sure that the air that comes out of the vacuum cleaner is cleaner than the air that goes in and it is a big help for people with asthma or allergies.</p>
<p>Dyson offers a<strong> two-year warranty on the V11</strong> and <strong>lifetime support through their app</strong> which has maintenance guides and troubleshooting help when problems come up. The vacuum is only 6.6 pounds when fully assembled, which makes it light enough to carry up the stairs without any trouble but heavy enough to handle daily use. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the battery and keeps the vacuum and tools in one neat place so you don’t have to search through closets to find them.</p>
<p>Taking $230 off the price of a Dyson vacuum is a great deal, especially for a model that still works as well as vacuums that cost a lot more.</p>
