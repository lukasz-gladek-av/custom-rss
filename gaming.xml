            <p>It looks like Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from the Terminator series may be coming to Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>According to dataminer <a href="https://x.com/interloko/status/1805357202481594595">Interloko</a>, six more characters will be coming to NetherRealm's fighter, likely as part of the next DLC pack, as well as two arenas and five new announcers.</p>

<p>Leaked Mortal Kombat 1 characters from <a href="https://x.com/interloko">Interloko</a>'s datamining efforts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyrax</li>
<li>Sektor</li>

<li>Ghostface (Scream)</li>
<li>Conan the Barbarian</li>
<li>T-1000 (Terminator)</li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion of Ghostface in this list isn't exactly a surprise. Last year, dataminers managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1703601270953513035">unearth evidence</a> that alluded to some unannounced DLC content, and Scream's masked slasher was included in a list of voice lines that were discovered in the game. Mortal Kombat's cyborg Cyrax was also included here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in September, Mortal Kombat boss Ed Boon shared an image of some of media's most famous slasher-flick faces, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ed-boon-gets-tongues-wagging-with-ghostface-and-jigsaw-tease-for-mortal-kombat-1">Ghostface was present among them</a>. Many surmised this was a clue from the developer that these less than friendly foes would soon be making their way into Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the game's DLC.</p>
<p>I just wonder if this leak does prove accurate, Arnie will voice Conan... We will update you when we know more.</p> <div>

					</p></div><div>

						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The wait for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> was extremely long, but it was well worth it, as Remedy Entertainment put out something that wasn't just a simple survival horror game but an intense experience that is very difficult to forget.&nbsp; While another entry in the series won't be seeing the light of day anytime soon, especially with Remedy working on multiple titles (including the second entry in the Control series and remakes of the first two entries in the Max Payne series) the base Alan Wake 2 game isn't the last we will see of the tormented writer for a long time, thanks to the two planned expansions, Night Springs and Lake House. The former is already out and the subject of today's review.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.06.24-12.40.51.14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Alan Wake 2: Night Springs DLC is a rather short expansion comprised of three episodes starring three characters of the Remedy Connected Universe: the waitress Rose Marigold, Control's main character Jesse Faden, and Shawn Ashmore, the real-life actor who plays the sheriff in Alan Wake 2 as well as Jack Joyce from Quantum Break. While they are somewhat separated from the main story, the three additional episodes are masterfully woven into the Alan Wake world, as they are part of the Night Springs TV show, an in-universe TV show that was mentioned in multiple Remedy Entertainment titles. Better yet, the TV show premise allowed the developers to bring back the amazing Mr. Door, played by David Harewood, who provides an introduction for the three episodes and has a central role in one of them.</p>
<p>Having been conceived as episodes of a TV show, the three additional scenarios included in Alan Wake 2: Night Springs are not particularly long, lasting between 30 minutes and a little over an hour. And while they don't really shake up the gameplay formula of the base game, they are extremely entertaining. Remedy went all out with the wackiness, presenting some scenarios that could have been, maybe, too much even for the main game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.06.24-12.51.27.40-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The first episode of the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is Number One Fan. Controlling the waitress Rose Marigold, players will have to save Alan Wake, who is holed up inside his mansion, an army of haters summoned by his evil twin brother (who is actually Mr. Scratch). Right from the start, it's clear how this scenario is, by far, the furthest in terms of atmosphere and gameplay from the base game. From receiving Alan Wake's distress signal from a Big Mouth Billy Bass to the banners and graffiti around town highlighting how the waitress and the writer are meant for each other and the 50s rock soundtrack, it's clear how the team wanted to go for a humorous, surreal tone. Needless to say, they succeed. The haters' comments are particularly funny and quite a bit meta, shouting to the world that Alan Wake is just a Stephen King knock-off, which I'm pretty sure is something that must have come to more than a few players' minds when experiencing the base game. Gameplay-wise, this episode does away with most of the survival-horror mechanics of the base game, including the flashlight mechanics, essentially offering the player infinite armor for two powerful weapons and, thus, the chance to go all out on enemies for a rather fun, and gory, romp.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.06.24-23.45.14.95-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The second episode of the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is North Star, starring Control's Jesse Faden. On her journey to find her brother, the young woman ends up in Coffee World, not knowing she will come into contact with a government conspiracy set around... coffee. While less in-your-face humorous and more in line in terms of mechanics and atmosphere with the base game, North Star is still pretty hilarious in its own way. Much like the previous episode, the one starring Jesse Faden is rather straightforward despite the inclusion of some simple puzzles and the return of the flashlight mechanics, though I was a little disappointed how none of her powers made even a brief appearance during the 40 minutes or so of her episode.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Alan-Wake-2-Screenshot-2024.06.25-00.20.06.01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The third, and definitely the most interesting episode of the three, is Time Breaker. This episode stars actor Shawn Ashmore, who has been hired to star in Sam Lake's latest game, not knowing he will end up in the clutches of the mysterious Mr.Door, who will bring him on a psychedelic journey where realities collide and the surreal becomes very, very real. While the gameplay is pretty much in line with the North Star episode, this episode is considerably better than the other two and the one that feels the closest to the base experience. It is possibly even more daring than the base game in terms of visual presentation, masterfully blending together some very different styles, something that alone makes it worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>While it does not offer much in terms of gameplay, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a worthy DLC to experience for all fans of the base game and Remedy Entertainment's titles. Free from the limitations imposed by the base game's narrative, which was fairly loose to begin with, Sam Lake and his team have gone all out to provide some extremely entertaining scenarios that, unfortunately, are over way too soon and leave the player wanting more. Hopefully, the next expansion, Lake House, will offer something a bit meatier to complement the masterful storytelling that is as well showcased in Night Springs as it is in the base game.</p>

<p>With its three entertaining scenarios showcasing Remedy Entertainment's narrative and visual design prowess, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a more than worthy DLC for all fans of the base game and the Finnish developer, provided they can keep their expectations in check. The expansion's short length, a little over two and a half hours, and its stripped-down gameplay will inevitably disappoint those looking for something more substantial</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-ps2-emulation-issues/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-ps2-emulation-issues-don%E2%80%99t-bode-well-for-the-rumored-ps3-emulation.911604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-ps2-emulation-issues/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A first round of PlayStation 2 games playable via a new PlayStation 5 emulator was made available recently, but they don't bode well at all for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-playstation-3-backwards-compatibility/">native PS3 backward compatibility</a> Sony is rumored to be working on.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri20Y6E89LE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at this first batch of games, which include Tomb Raider: Legend and Sly Cooper, highlighting how emulation is really poor for both games. For the game starring Lara Croft, the experience is marred by a blurry image, which isn't the result of a low resolution, which nonetheless saw a slight boost over the original release, but of bad choices in image treatment that lead to bad results. The available visual modes are also bad, such as those featuring some bad CRT filters that fail to recreate the feel of older televisions. At the very least, games feature both NTSC and PAL options sporting 60 Hz and 50 Hz modes, respectively, and some performance improvements.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 2 Emulation on PS5 Tested... And We've Got Issues" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ri20Y6E89LE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It is really baffling how Sony can't seem to get PlayStation 5 backward compatibility right, as even the previous PS4 emulator used to play PS2 games on the current generation console is extremely flawed, making other options, such as upscalers and emulators, much better in terms of image quality. With the PlayStation 3 being a notoriously more complicated system to emulate, Sony not getting PS2 emulation right is definitely concerning. Hopefully, things will be improved in the future to offer proper backward compatibility that can do justice to these classic titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24185973/fantastic-four-mcu-time-period-setting-kevin-feige<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CFzEKc"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072946/fantastic-four-movie-robot-herbie-marvel"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a> is the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s biggest mystery, and maybe it’s greatest hope. Beyond who’s playing each member of Marvel’s first family, we’ve been in the dark about most other details until now. On the first episode of the new Official Marvel podcast, president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, appeared as a guest and revealed that <em>Fantastic Four</em> will in fact be a period piece, rather than taking place in the modern day MCU. </p>
<p id="xUxhz5">Fans first started speculating that the series might take the universe back in time when its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23715214/fantastic-four-2025-cast-marvel-movie-pedro-pascal-joseph-quinn">first artwork was revealed, which was in a decidedly mid-century style</a>. While the primary purpose of the art was to reveal the actors behind each member of the team — with Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Ebon-Moss Bachrach as Ben Grimm, and Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm — it also suggested to many fans that the movie might take place in the ’60s, the same decade that the Fantastic Four debuted. </p>
<p id="DaIPSL">But while Feige seems to confirm in his podcast appearance that the movie will take place in the ’60s, he also can’t help but include a few mysterious details to make sure the movie’s intrigue is intact. </p>
<p id="gXHlb1">“So it is a period piece,” Feige said. “There was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24121000/marvel-fantastic-four-movie-hints-free-comics">another piece of art we released with Johnny Storm flying in the air and making a Four symbol</a> and there was a cityscape in the corner of that image. And there were a lot of smart people who noticed that that cityscape didn’t look exactly like the New York that we know, or the New York that existed in the ’60s in our world. Those are some smart, smart observations.” </p>
<p id="dtjhAs">This could mean that the movie takes place in an alternate dimension, and the Fantastic Four gang gets sent to the MCU’s Earth during the plot, or maybe it’s some other Multiversal shenanigans, but either way Feige isn’t giving us any details just yet. </p>
<p id="B8fnP4">One other bit of news the Marvel boss shares that should be particularly exciting for fans is that the movie will start filming the day after Comic-Con 2024, which means that <em>Fantastic Four</em> will be in production in just about a month. </p>
<p id="Bzl5Rk">As for what we know for sure, <em>Fantastic Four</em> is due out in theaters on July 25, 2025. Along with the core cast, the movie will also star Ralph Ineson as Galactus, Julia Garner as Shalla-Bal (the Silver Surfer), as well as Paul Walter Hauser, Natasha Lyonne, and John Malkovich in unannounced roles.</p>

<p>Atari announced this morning that publishing subsidiary Infogrames has acquired the <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> series from previous owner tinyBuild Inc. This marks the second casual, physics-heavy multiplayer game Infogrames has absorbed this year following April’s move to grab <em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-relaunches-infogrames-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a></em> also from tinyBuild. <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> has released numerous games in the franchise, including VR titles and the most recent <em>Surgeon Simulator 2: Access All Areas</em>, which released in 2020 for PC and 2021 for Xbox.</p>



<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> has the player performing numerous surgical tasks of escalating complexity and strangeness all while having to contend with realtime physics and other obstacles. With these additions to relaunched Infogrames label, it seems like the publisher might be a new bastion for chaos simulators popular on streaming platforms.</p>



<p>Officially, Atari says via press release that Infogrames will “acquire IP and publish games that fall outside the core portfolio of IP associated with the Atari brand.” They also note that, consistent with their parent company’s general ethos, Infogrames “sees game preservation as a core component of its mission.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>the Steelbook edition of <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em> on Switch comes with this stuff</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> acquisition adds to an already busy week for Atari, who announced Tuesday they will add 39 games to <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em>, an expanded version of the critically acclaimed game/interactive digital museum/documentary. The new version of the title will have its own digital release across all modern platforms and a physical release for PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, the latter getting an additional Steelbook edition retailing for $49.99 with some fancy extras.</p>



<p>Folks who have already purchased <em>Atari 50</em> will be able to get the additions found in <em>The Anniversary Collection</em> in DLC later this year. <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em> comes out on October 25.</p>



<p>Between this week’s developments and their acquisition of the Intellivision name and library in May, Atari is having an extremely busy year so far. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">All of this and they’re not stuck with figuring out what to do with the Amico</a>.

			<p>The improvements brought by Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen and Nanite may not be enough to justify the massive hit to the performance they cause, as highlighted by new comparison videos shared online this week.</p>
<p>The new comparison videos, put together by Cycu1, showcase the Unreal Engine 4.27 and 4.25 versions of Abandoned Warehouse and Ancient Temple tech demos developed by Scan Factory with their Unreal Engine 5.1 ports. Both videos highlight how the difference in shadows and accurate lighting is not that massive to justify the performance hit in both demos, which is often close to a 100 FPS difference on an RTX 4080 GPU.</p>
<p><iframe title="Abandoned Werehouse Demo Unreal Engine 4.27 vs Unreal Engine 5.1 RTX 4080 Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViDILolphuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Ancient Temple Demo Unreal Engine 4.25 vs Unreal Engine 5.1 RTX 4080 Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRflwKil6MI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have seen the Unreal Engine 5 <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-native-4k-rtx-4080/">pushing current generation high-end GPUs to their limit</a>, as the RTX 4080 struggles to run some tech demos with decent performance at native 4K resolution. As such, it's clear that the new version of the engine by Epic needs plenty more work to deliver smooth gaming experiences, although it seems like playing at native 4K resolution may be something that only a few players with the best possible rigs will be able to do in the future, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/">upscaling is an important feature of the engine that is expected to be used</a> by developers to achieve playable framerates.</p>
<p>The latest version of the engine by Epic is Unreal Engine 5.4. You can learn more about it by heading over to its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fromsoftware-just-made-the-elden-ring-dlc-a-little-bit-easier.911571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186316/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-notes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YLXwTH">FromSoftware has released a surprise mini-patch — or “<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">calibration update</a>,” as it’s calling it — for <em>Elden Ring</em> that should ease the steep difficulty challenge posed by its new expansion, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>.</p>
<p id="ysn0zk">The patch adjusts the way Shadow Realm Blessings, a crucial character advancement system in the DLC, will scale. The blessings increase the attack and defense of player characters and their spirit summons through the collection of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178006/scadutree-fragment-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178007/revered-spirit-ashes-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Revered Spirit Ashes</a>.</p>
<p id="HlXFmh">FromSoftware says it has increased the value of the blessings for the first half of players’ progress, and then made progression for the second half more gradual. The final level of enhancements has also been upped slightly.</p>
<p id="0UV0TA">In short, this adjusted power curve should mean players feel more powerful in the early parts of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, where the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180254/all-dlc-boss-locations-bosses-in-order">first few bosses</a> have been giving the community serious trouble. The final boss should be a bit easier now, too.</p>
<p id="hndE9i">Note that you need to log in to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s multiplayer server for the changes to apply. The version number displayed on the title menu screen should be 1.12.2.</p>
<p id="hV7myH">That’s it for changes in this small emergency patch. However, FromSoftware also noted that it has confirmed a bug in the PC version of the game that causes raytracing to be enabled when loading save data from previous versions of the game. If you’re suffering from poor performance, the developer recommends checking your graphics settings to ensure raytracing hasn’t been unintentionally turned on.</p>
<p id="U4FQ56">Further balance changes and bug fixes will be coming in a future patch, FromSoftware said.</p>

        <p>Nexon's title earned double that of Tencent's best-selling game Honor of Kings</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Tencent and Nexon's latest release Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile exceeded $270 million during its first month of release in China, according to Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/tencent-s-new-game-doubles-honor-of-kings-sales-in-first-month">Bloomberg</a>, the mobile title also ranked in the top spot for downloads and revenues on Apple's App Store following its release on May 21. It also earned twice as much as Tencent's best-selling game Honor of Kings.</p>
<p>The spin-off of Nexon's Dungeon &amp; Fighter series initially launched in South Korea in 2022, with Tencent earning the publishing rights of the game for China shortly after. Its release was delayed due to government restrictions, as noted by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/dungeon-and-fighter-mobiles-first-month-of-ios-revenue-was-twice-that-of-honor-of-kings/">PocketGamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Since its release, Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile has been occupying the top positions for the iOS charts in all categories," said Sensor Tower's senior director of Asia-Pacific marketing Nan Lu.</p>
<p>"This is a very impressive start, and it has been stable as well. The future performance will depend on Tencent's operations and continuous update of the game."</p>

            <p>Playground Games is delisting Forza Horizon 4 from online stores at the end of the year, due to "licensing and agreements" with the game's partners.</p>
<p>On 15th December, Forza Horizon 4 will be removed from digital storefronts on PC and Xbox. This includes Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The upcoming delisting means the new Series and Festival Playlist that started earlier this week, and which runs until 22nd August, will be the last. After this time, players will no longer be able to access the playlist screen, other than to see the festival playlist history.</p>

<p>"Even though there won't be any more Festival Playlists after Series 77 (August 22), you will still be able to see the Forza Events screen which will include a selection of daily and weekly challenges," Playground Games shared in a <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting">blog</a>. Completing these challenges and Forzathon Live Events will earn players Forzathon Points, which can be exchanged for Backstage Passes.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 4's DLC has already been delisted, meaning from now on this content can only be acquired through purchases of the game's Deluxe or Ultimate Edition versions.</p>
<p>"Players who already own the game and its content will be able to download and play it as normal, including its offline, online, and multiplayer features," Playground said. "Physical copies of the game purchased after [15th December] will also work and will be able to use online features."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Attention Forza Horizon 4 players!  </p><p>We have an important announcement regarding how FH4’s Festival Playlist will work after Series 77 (from July 25 until August 22) and its availability in digital stores after December 15.  </p><p>Please, read the complete update here:… <a href="https://t.co/sFrZU5sjOq">pic.twitter.com/sFrZU5sjOq</a></p></div>— Forza Horizon (@ForzaHorizon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1805650519853351346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Ahead of December's digital delisting, Playground will sell Forza Horizon 4 cheaper - though pricing is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Anyone who played the base game via Xbox's Game Pass subscription service and subsequently purchased DLC will be provided with a "token" for the game they can redeem, Playground also said.</p>
<p>"By having an active, full-paid (not discounted) Xbox Game Pass subscription on 6/25 you will be eligible to receive a game token if you have purchased any extra content for Forza Horizon 4 through your Xbox Message Center," it said, adding these codes will start being distributed in the coming days.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much for enjoying the content updates we have brought to this game," the Forza team closed. "Remember to make the most of the remaining time of the Festival Playlist and that when the game is delisted, you'll still be able to play it as you always have."</p>
<p>Former Eurogamer editor in chief Oli Welsh called the game  "another sumptuous, endlessly entertaining automotive playground" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-4-review-racing-great-rolls-gingerly-into-new-era">Forza Horizon 4 review from 2018</a>.</p>

            <p>When I finished my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">review</a> for Soulslike Lies Of P, the devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-casual-soulslikers-lies-of-ps-latest-update-makes-it-dramatically-easier">released a patch</a> not long after that nerfed bosses and made things for ol' Pinnochio easier overall. Sod's Law struck that day… and it's returned with a smirk. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> has just been patched, making its Shadow Realm Blessings stronger from the off, and in turn, things a little easier for everybody. Such is the life of a reviewer, eh.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In what FromSoftware are calling "<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">Calibration Update - Version 1.12.2</a>", they've buffed the power of the Shadow Realm Blessings you'll find scattered exclusively throughout Erdtree's areas. Both Scadutree Fragments and Revered Ash Blessings have had their attack and damage negation increased for the "first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements". Once you've obtained the first half, later blessings will see more of a gradual increase to your stats.</p>
<p>In addition, the attack and damage negation granted by the "final level" of those blessings has been slightly increased. There aren't any concrete stats to analyse here, but the general gist is simple to understand: Blessings are strongerer.</p>
<p>To get the update you'll need to login to the multiplayer servers once you've booted up the game. You'll know if you're on the right build if you see "1.12.2" at the bottom right of the title menu. FromSoft says later "balance adjustments as well as bug fixes" are planned for a future patch.</p>
<p>And if you've been experiencing performance issues, the patch notes say to check in System &gt; Graphics Settings &gt; Raytracing Quality settings and see if it's been toggled to turn on automatically. If it has, it might be worth switching it off and seeing if things improve.</p>
<p>Erdtree <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">launched to a mixed reception on Steam</a>, despite a positive critical reception. That came down to performance issues, but mainly, the DLC's difficulty when it comes to bosses being particularly overbearing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-mod-resets-the-difficulty-to-elden-ring-levels-and-gets-rid-of-scadutree-fragments">A mod</a> was even released that balanced Erdtree's enemies to be more in line with the base game.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm fine with FromSoft lowering the difficulty and agree with Nic's sentiment in the "mixed reception" piece that the pushback is valid, but I don't think the game deserves to be bombed because it's particularly challenging. Erdtree's bosses are definitely more nightmarish in their damage output and design, but Erdtree gives you tools to make life easier, moreso than any other entry in the Souls catalogue. Like the Blessings, like the summonable pals or online co-op, like the copious number of builds and elixir combinations.</p>
<p>If you're struggling, I'd advise going off and seeking out those Blessings (with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragment-locations">help of this guide</a> that rounds them all up) as well as rejigging your set up. You can do it! I mean, you beat Elden Ring to get here, right?</p>

			<p>Known Unreal Engine 5 concept artist TeaserPlay is working on a brand-new UE5-powered horror game - Homeless.</p>
<p>Late last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/gravehard-shift-teaserplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported</a> that the artist and his two-man studio DarkPhobia Games were working on atmospheric horror title Graveyard Shift. This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2636420/Graveyard_Shift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game is now available via Steam</a> and has been positively received. Fast forward eight months, and TeaserPlay has now announced that he's working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3018910/Homeless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeless</a> - a horror title set in New York in the 90s. In the game, players play as security guard Albert, patrolling the subway tunnels during which he encountering a rather sinister individual. Gameplay mechanics for Homeless include investigation, puzzle-solving, exploration, and occasional gun-play. "As communication lines go down, you find yourself trapped with a flesh-eating predator, you must navigate the new York streets and subway corridors, uncover The Vulture's dark past, and stop him before becoming his next meal", the description of Homeless reads.</p>
<p>"The gameplay emphasizes the player's sense of responsibility as a security guard. The level design is intended to make the player feel like a real security guard. You'll need to check CCTV, patrol the area, and investigate suspicious activity like a real security guard."</p>
<p>We've included the reveal trailer for this upcoming new horror game below. Let us know what you think.</p>

        <p>Atari relaunched Infogrames in April</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Atari's Infogrames label has picked up the Surgeon Simulator series from TinyBuild.</p>
<p>The publishing division was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-relaunches-infogrames-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service">relaunched by Atari in April</a> to focus on games outside of Atari's core portfolio of IP. Alongside that launch, the firm announced the acquisition of the Totally Reliable Delivery Service, also from TinyBuild.</p>
<p>Surgeon Simulator is a comedy medical operation simulator developed by Bossa Studios. Titles in the franchise include the 2013 original, the 2016 VR game Surgeon Simulator VR: Meet the Medic, the 2018 Switch title Surgeon Simulator CPR and the 2020 sequel Surgeon Simulator 2: Access All Areas.</p>
<p>Infogrames says it plans to expand the distribution of these games, explore merchandising opportunities and potentially develop new titles.</p>
<p>“More than 10 years after the release of the original, <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> remains a popular and unique franchise,” stated Infogrames manager Geoffroy Châteauvieux. “This was a rare opportunity to acquire a game with a timeless appeal, and we are excited to have <em>Surgeon Simulator </em>within the Infogrames portfolio.”</p>
<p>Infogrames was founded in 1983 in Paris, and grew aggressively through the 1990s and early 2000s via a slew of acquisitions. It licensed the Atari brand in 2003 and rebranded the business under that name. What followed was a series of huge losses, resulting in cuts and closures, a company re-organisation and the full acquisition of Atari Inc. The firm's European distribution business was then sold to Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>After a few failed efforts to refocus the brand around different concepts, the current Atari leadership has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ataris-re-focus-on-retro">focused on the growing retro games market</a>, and has acquired several remaster and remake specialists, including <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-to-acquire-digital-eclipse-in-20m-deal">Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-to-acquire-nightdive-studios-for-10m">Nightdive Studios</a>. It has also acquired numerous IP catalogues, such as titles from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">Intellivison</a>, M Network Games and Stern Electronics (plus any more).</p>

            <p>
FromSoftware is well known for adding seemingly useless items or places in its games to get fans speculating about lore and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree is no different.
</p>
<p>
But there's one particular location that has fans stumped: the Scadutree Chalice.
</p>
<p>
This is a named location found after beating a specific boss, but it appears to serve no purpose. What could it be? <strong>Spoilers follow</strong>.

<p>
The Scadutree Chalice is found in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-get-to-shadow-keeps-back-gate-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">area behind the Shadow Keep</a>. Players will need to beat Commander Gaius first - he's the armoured boar-riding boss who reminds me a little of that orc in Twilight Princess.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, players can wander into a new area which leads up to an archway and a precipice overlooking the Scadutree that dominates the skyline. Here players will find an enormous unlit stone chalice with five fragments scattered around it.
</p>
<p>
Now, on a basic level, those fragments are incredibly useful as they're used to level the player's Shadow Blessing. But finding five in one place? That's definitely unusual.
</p>

<figcaption>Riding up to the archway and pondering the purpose of this chalice</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
So what is it for? My first thought was this would be the location to use Messmer's Kindling, but soon found a use for this elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
My own, loose theory is that the chalice relates to the Scadutree fragments. That's obvious considering the name and the fact it overlooks the tree. But is this where fragments are formed or their power distilled? Or were fragments used here in some sort of ritual, hence so many being scattered nearby?
</p>
<p>The item description for the fragments reads: "A splinter of the Scadutree that contains golden brilliance...It is said that when the Scadutree crumbles from its core that it will scatter across the entire realm of shadow. The people of the Erdtree collect the splinters and use them in prayer." Is that prayer only at Sites of Grace, or this chalice too?</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Katharine Castle has also been investigating, testing out multiple poses or wearing Gaius' armour, considering the nearby Albinauric drops his greaves. But so far, all to no avail.

<p>
Players on reddit have also been speculating, following a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dlszyr/does_anyone_know_what_the_scadutree_chalice_is_or/">post from XSidsgothemX</a>. They suggest it could relate to the Albinaurics, hence the shack nearby, perhaps hinting at how they're made, or that their blood is required?
</p>
<p>
"There's just no way its useless. I'm hopeful there's a secret quest we haven't discovered that allows interaction with the Scadutree," one reply reads.
</p>
<p>
Others have tried lighting the chalice with different pots, but with no effect. 
</p>
<p>
Another user, Rockerode, suggests the chalice could also relate to the Suppression Tower - this is found in the first area but serves no purpose beyond housing a chest. "I think between Scadutree chalice, suppression tower, and the trailer showing a scene none of us have unlocked there's something going on here," they propose, perhaps linking to some sort of quest to perform a ritual and cleanse the Scadutree. Is there a secret ending somewhere yet to be found?
</p>
<p>
Or maybe, just maybe, the chalice has no purpose beyond those five fragments. And that, certainly, is reward enough.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any theories on what the Scadutree Chalice is for, or represents?
</p>
<p>
Scadutree Fragments are integral to the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC as the primary method of character progression. Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">new patch for the game was released</a> which re-balances the scaling of their Blessings.

            <p>Celebrity streamer and Midnight Society co-founder Guy Beahm or "Dr Disrespect" has finally responded in full to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadrop-developer-midnight-society-cuts-ties-with-dr-disrespect-following-new-twitch-ban-allegations">allegations that he was banned from Twitch for sending sext messages to a minor</a>. In a much-edited statement on Xitter yesterday, Beahm confessed that, yes, he messaged an "individual minor" via the Twitch Whispers services in 2017, characterising the messages as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more".</p><!--more-->
<p>As we wrote in yesterday's report, Twitch cancelled a multiple-year exclusivity contract with Beahm, then one of the platform's biggest stars, in 2020. At the time, Twitch <a href="https://x.com/Shannon_Liao/status/1276617617730568195">would only say</a> that Beahm had acted "in violation of our Community Guidelines". Beahm sued Twitch over the ban in 2021, but the suit was eventually <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/drdisrespect-settles-his-lawsuit-with-twitch/">settled</a> with neither party admitting wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Last week, however, former Twitch strategic partnerships account director Cody Conners <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">accused</a> Beahm of "sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product" adding that Beahm "was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon", the company's semi-annual gaming convention. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a>'s Ash Parrish subsequently obtained comment from two unnamed former Twitch employees who corroborated Conners's account.</p>
<p>Beahm pushed back, rejecting the claim that he had been grooming a minor while saying that the terms of his settlement with Twitch forbade him from going into detail. "I didn't do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid," he <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">wrote on Xitter</a>.</p>
<p>Beahm's colleagues at The Midnight Society weren't convinced by his defence, announcing on Monday 24th June that they would ties with Beahm "in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals" following an internal inquiry.</p>
<p>Which brings us to last night, when Beahm finally addressed the allegations directly in <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089">a lengthy Xitter statement</a>. "Everyone has been wanting to know why I was banned from twitch, but for reasons outside of my control, I was not allowed to say anything for the last several years," Beahm writes in the post. "Now that two former twitch employees have publicly disclosed the accusations, I can now tell you my side of the story regarding the ban.</p>
<p>"Were there twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me.</p>
<p>"Now, from a moral standpoint I'll absolutely take responsibility," it continues. "I should have never entertained these conversations to begin with. That's on me. That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father. It should have never happened. I get it. I'm not perfect and I'll fucking own my shit."</p>
<p>The last line would be more convincing if the post hadn't been repeatedly edited since publication to first remove, then restore the word "minor", as you can see by clicking the "last edited" text at the bottom. In general, the post strikes me as a very rambling, loud but elusive way of saying "yes, I did the thing they're accused me of".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the post, Beahm apologises to The Midnight Society, presenting his departure from the studio as a collective decision, rather than one imposed on him. He also describes "remarks and labels being thrown around" that he is a "predator or pedophile" as "exaggerations", commenting "that's a different level of disgust that I fucking hate even hearing about". Finally, he insists that he's not going to let being caught sending a minor dodgy messages interfere with his career.</p>
<p>"If you're uncomfortable with this entire statement and think I'm a piece of shit, that's fine," the post concludes. "But I'm not fucking going anywhere. I'm not the same guy that made this mistake all those years ago. I'm taking an extended vacation with my family as mentioned on stream and I'm coming back with a heavy weight off my shoulders. They want me to disappear... yeah fucking right."</p>
<p>Ah yes, the infamous "they", that cabal of nay-sayers hell-bent on bringing down a good man for the merest offence of maybe just possibly being a little bit of a creep. Going by the comments on the X-post, I'm not sure Beahm's fans are clamouring for his return from holiday.</p>

            <p>With a groan, it rises. The first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> is a piece of horror game history, and it has just come shambling back to PC after a long time putrefying. Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil">digital download</a>, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It's going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Resident Evil was first ported to Windows back in 1997, after its release on PlayStation. It got a few re-releases soon after that, mostly updated editions. But time scratches all surfaces, and the PC port was left languishing even while the old version of the game reappeared digitally on the classics catalogue of PlayStation. Now, it's playable again on PC. (Well, it's long been playable to anyone who cared enough to emulate it, but that's another story...)</p>
<p>The GOG re-release promises very few changes, aside from support for modern controllers,  "new rendering options" and "improved timing of the cutscenes". It's fun to read the original description that would have been splashed on the back of the game's box. "Completely uncut, with even more blood, graphic violence and gory scenes than the worldwide monster hit version on PlayStation," it says. Please understand, it was the 1990s, people <em>loved</em> seeing exposed intestines. It was an interesting decade.</p>
<p>The sequels are also going to see a re-release. "Capcom's Resident Evil series has defined and revolutionized the survival horror genre," say GOG in a post <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/capcom_and_gog_join_forces_to_release_the_original_resident_evil_trilogy_2ad34">on their forums</a>, where they point out you can now wishlist <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2?source=news">both</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3?source=news">sequels</a>. None of these should be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(2002_video_game)">Resident Evil remake</a> of 2002, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-2-review">Resident Evil 2 remake</a> of 2019, or the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-3-review">Resident Evil 3 remake</a> of 2020. But those are all pretty swell survival horrors too.</p>
<p>My personal memory of Resident Evil is getting it from a friend while hankering badly for its sequel, which I was reading about in every magazine I could find. I played up until the first zombie, whose iconic head-turn freaked me the flip out, whereupon I stopped playing and went to hang out with my dad in another well-lit room. I told this story enough times that my brother now recounts it as a memory of his own. That's okay, it's a good memory, we can share it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-defeat-bayle-the-dread/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is filled to the brim with powerful enemies, but very few can compete with Bayle the Dread, one of the most fearsome dragons created by FromSoftware. Taking down this enemy is rather difficult, but you can make your life easier in several different ways.</p>
<p>Bayle the Dread is fought at the summit of the Jagged Peak, which can be reached easily by climbing the mountain. The location is pretty linear, so simply following the main path will allow you to reach the summit. However, you will have to fight two bosses, the Jagged Peak Drake and the Ancient Dragon Senessax, on the way, so be prepared for some intense fights. Also, make sure to speak with Igon at Pillar Path Waypoint, read Igon's message at the Dragon Pit Terminus, visit the Grand Altar of Dragon Communion to speak with the Dragon Priestess to be able to summon Igon during the Bayle fight and receive his gear when the Dread has been defeated.</p>
<p>Preparation is extremely important to have an easier time against Bayle the Dread in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. For starters, the boss is meant to be some sort of ultimate challenge, and so its difficulty is on par with that of the boss of Enir-Ilim. For this reason, it's best to attempt to take down the dragon after improving the Scadutree Blessing as much as possible and level up Vigor to at least 60, as the dragon hits extremely hard and can one-shot you with some of its attacks. To increase your survivability, equip Boltdrake and Flamedrake Talismans to increase Fire and Lighting damage reduction. If your build allows you to use it, the Ancient Dragon Hunter's Great Katana is an excellent weapon to use, thanks to its Weapon Skill, Dragonwound Slash, which unleashes a powerful ranged attack with its charged version that can be easily directed at the dragon's head by simply locking onto it. If you have no means of hitting the dragon's head consistently, you will have to attack the damaged leg. Hitting any other part of the body will deal lower damage, making the battle longer than it should and increasing the chance of your defeat in the process.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp; - Bayle the Dread First Phase</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240625010439_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As soon as you cross the fog wall, before doing anything else, you should summon Igon by interacting with his sign by the arena's entrance. As the NPC is summoned when the battle has already begun, Bayle's HP will not increase, so he can be a pretty decent help. Also, you need to summon him to complete his quest, so make sure to always do so.</p>
<p>Once Igon has been summoned, you may want to use your Spirit Ashes summon to get an extra helping hand. As Bayle is pretty aggressive, you will have to do so during one of the same windows of opportunities you will use to attack the dragon, so after the breath attacks, the bite attack, which is signaled by a glow in the dragon's mouth, or after he has performed the spinning tail attack.</p>
<p>The first phase of the fight is actually pretty easy to get through if you're careful. Instead of locking onto the boss, wait for the dragon to come closer to you and get under its body to attack the damaged leg. The vast majority of times, you can attack the leg a couple of times, get away to avoid the breath attack, rinse and repeat. The timing to avoid the breath attack is pretty strict, so do not dodge roll unless you are at light equipment load. If the dragon is targeting Igon, doing this is even easier, as Bayle won't even attempt to retaliate with one of his breath attacks.</p>
<p>If you're using a ranged or magic build, you will have to watch out for more attacks. Thankfully, they are rather telegraphed and somewhat easy to avoid. The first breath attack, which shoots a beam of fire and lighting straight at you, can be avoided by running to the side, while the other with the advancing flames can be avoided by rolling into it. The aforementioned tail-spinning attack can be recognized by the dragon's stepping back and can be easily avoided by dodging it as well. The crashing down attack, which comes after Bayle leaps in the air, can be avoided by dodging into it as well, but refrain from attacking for too long, as this attack has low recovery, and you risk getting hit if you overextend.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp; - Bayle the Dread Second Phase</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240626115335_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you have depleted half of his life, the second phase of the fight will begin. During this, Bayle will often fly around the arena to unleash hell on you. Avoiding the projectiles from the air and the ground attacks is simple enough, but you will have to be even more careful when approaching him to attack or when healing. In phase 2, staying below the dragon to attack his damaged leg is still a viable strategy, possibly even so, but his attack patterns become faster and more unpredictable, so never get greedy unless you are sure your next flurry of attacks will take the boss down.</p>
<p>Once you have defeated Bayle the Dread, you will get the Bayle's Heart item, which can be traded at the Grand Altar of Dragon Communion for Bayle's Flame Lightning or Bayle's Tyranny. In the area, you can also pick the Priestess Heart, which can be used to turn into a dragon, and the Flowerstone Gavel weapon.</p>

        <p>Ghost of Tsushima and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door debuted as the top earners on their respective platforms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Fortnite continues to lead Newzoo's revenue and user engagement charts for May, having topped both the previous month.</p>
<p>This is according to the research firm's monthly engagement and revenue charts for games across PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch across six markets including the US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>The Top five for both charts remained the same as in April, being led by Fortnite followed by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, 3, and Warzone 2.0, Minecraft, Roblox, and Grand Theft Auto 5.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's free-to-play shooter XDefiant, which launched on May 21 following a closed beta, jumped the charts from No.33 to No.6 in terms of monthly active users.</p>
<p>The Top 20 revenue earners featured two new releases, including the PC port of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima in fifth place and Nintendo's remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in sixth place.</p>
<p>Both games debuted in first place on their respective platform charts, with Newzoo acknowledging that Ghost of Tsushima's release on PC boosted sales on PlayStation as well.</p>
<p>Elden Ring also rose 17 places in the overall revenue ranking, with its revenue increasing across all platforms prior to the release of its Shadow of the Erdtree DLC on June 21.</p>

<p>A dataminer has leaked upcoming DLC characters for Mortal Kombat 1, which is said to include Terminators T-1000.</p>



<p>According to the leaker interloko via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=566SCksuvtk&amp;ab_channel=Interloko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, six upcoming characters will soon be coming to Mortal Kombat 1. While the leaker says that the information is “100% confirmed” in his video, it should be stressed that this information has been datamined and has the potential to not be released. That being said, the six characters include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cyrax</li>



<li>Sektor</li>



<li>Noob Saibot</li>



<li>Ghostface</li>



<li>Conan the Barbarian</li>



<li>T-1000</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition to the six characters, the leaker also found references to five new game announcers and two brand-new arenas.</p>



<p>In September 2023, dataminers had already found <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-ghostface-halloween/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">code references </a>to Ghost Face, which Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon teased in a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1707508202638602342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a>. Back then, the same dataminer who found references to Ghost Face also found references for Noob Saibot, Cyrax, and Conan the Barbarian. </p>



<p>The recent findings could suggest that the characters are nearing a release.</p>

        <p>Founded by AAA veterans Brandon Dillon and Richard Foge</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Industry veterans Brandon Dillon and Richard Foge have announced the creation of their studio, called 2weeks.</p>
<p>The developer will focus on short prototypes that will be released on the web for everyone to play, and further developed into full games if well received. The idea is to prevent install barriers and having these bite-sized titles as accessible as possible, making it appealing to emerging markets as well.</p>
<p>Dillon will be acting as CEO, coming from a role as VP of engineering at Possibility Space. He also previously worked at Oculus for over six years, Double fine Productions for three, and ArenaNet for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Foge will be 2weeks' CCO. He also comes from a role at Possibility Space as VP of design, having previously worked at ArenaNet, bSony Santa Monica, Undead Labs, Probably Monsters, and more.</p>
<p>2weeks has already released its first prototype, Homestretch Bet, a mix between horse racing and Texas hold 'em.</p>

            <p>The human body is a wonderfully complex organism, and it’s well worth trusting your instincts when it comes to feeling repulsed by certain things. We know that if the milk looks bad and smells bad, it is bad. Do not taste the forbidden yogurt, as much as it calls to you. How, then, to interpret my visceral repulsion to the most disgusting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> build yet seen? So gross, in fact, that YouTuber SYROBE has managed to beat the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> DLC’s infamously ridiculous final boss in a mere 13 seconds. Here’s the video. Massive spoilers, obviously.</p>

<figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v20jFYM0nLI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The build uses the lightning variant of the new perfume bottle weapon - specifically, its ash of war ability Rolling Sparks. SYROBE credits the weapon classes’ multiple exploding hitboxes for its silly damage potential, and says the ash of war condenses these usually diffuse hitboxes into a single area when aimed downwards. He’s also got the maximum Scadutree blessing, which boosts his stats in the DLC area. Rounding the build off are a bevvy of buffs from equipment, such as the black dumpling hat, the madness talisman, and the lightning cracked tear. He’s done the math, basically, and the math is sickening.</p>
<p>After breaking down the build, SYROBE completes his victory lap by melting the final boss of the DLC in a world record 13 seconds. Coincidentally, that’s also my own record for how long I can last against the same boss without getting pounded into the dirt. </p>
<p>It’s early days yet, but this sort of discovery does suggest that Shadow Of The Erdtree’s increased difficulty comes alongside various ways to mitigate it aside from the more apparent Scadutree fragments. Might the players who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">found the DLC too obnoxious</a> change their minds now? Is Mizayaki having a crack at his sweatier fans by making the most powerful weapon yet seen a gentle nod to always pack deodorant? Will this inspire me to try a different weapon to the same greatsword I’ve been using for twenty hours now? Who knows!</p>

            <p>
A patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has been released that revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings.
</p>
<p>
The DLC includes this new scaling system to boost the attack and defence of both your character and your spirit summons, by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes respectively.
</p>
<p>
Now the scaling has been revised so that the effects are greater for the first few levels, before becoming more gradual later.

<p>

After that, the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased (there is a fixed number of fragments to collect).
</p>
<p>
The difficulty of the DLC has been a major talking point since its release, in particular players finding the quest initially too difficult and then struggling with the final boss. This balance revision should assist players in both regards.
</p>
<p>
The patch also addresses graphics settings on PC, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-falls-to-a-mixed-steam-rating-as-pc-players-complain-about-difficulty-and-performance">players complained on Steam of performance issues</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">patch notes</a> confirm a bug has been found where ray tracing settings are automatically enabled when loading saved data from a previous version of the game.
</p>
<p>
Further, if the frame rate is unstable, it's recommended to check if ray tracing is enabled in the system menu and set this to off.
</p>
<p>
Future patches will offer other balance adjustments (including enemy difficulty in NG+), fix bugs, and update performance.
</p>
<p>
Elden Ring publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-publisher-calls-out-shadow-of-the-erdtree-players-struggling-with-the-difficulty">Bandai Namco previously suggested struggling players focus on levelling up their Blessings</a>, but this new patch is a more direct change.

</p>
<p>
The release of the DLC has provided a fresh reason for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamers-continue-to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-in-weird-and-wonderful-ways">streamers to play the game in weird and wonderful ways</a>, including with their mind.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-balance-gets-tweaked-with-update-1-12-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the main complaints <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-user-reviews-are-mixed-citing-excessive-difficulty-and-performance-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading to 'Mixed' user reviews</a> for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is the expansion's supposed unbalance. As if to answer users' complaints, developer FromSoftware has released Calibration update 1.12.2, tweaking the scaling of Shadow Realm Blessings as detailed below.</p>
<p><em>Attack and damage negation curve scaling of the&nbsp;<b>Shadow Realm Blessings</b>&nbsp;have been revised.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of&nbsp;<b>Blessing enhancements</b>, and the second half will now be more gradual.</em></li>
<li><em>The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The calibration update can be applied by logging into the multiplayer server.</em></p>
<p><em>If the Calibration Ver. listed at the bottom right of the title menu is not "1.12.2", then select LOGIN and apply the latest regulations before enjoying the game.</em></p>
<p>Granted, this is a relatively small change, and FromSoftware is fully aware of that. The patch notes for Calibration update 1.12.2 end with a mention of further balance changes and bug fixes coming in a future Shadow of the Erdtree update.</p>
<p>Additionally, the developers said there is a bug where sometimes loading a save from a previous version of Elden Ring will enable ray tracing on PC. Check your graphics settings to confirm whether it has been incorrectly enabled on your system.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree may have gotten a lukewarm reception from some users, but it still received excellent reviews from critics. Our Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it a perfect score</a>:</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world.</em></p>

			<p>Nearly a year after its September 2023 launch, Counter-Strike 2 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4257672198473442891?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> the first batch of community maps. Thera and Mills have been added to the Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch map groups, Memento and Assembly to the Wingman map pool, and Pool Day to the Arms Race map pool.</p>
<p>This Counter-Strike 2 update also makes it easier to gain badges and improves the MVP panel, with Premier matches getting a new animated panel. Finally, a bunch of new graphics-related settings (including a dedicated frame pacing option) are available for tweaking, as detailed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings Recommendations</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if your display's refresh rate is set below its maximum at startup. Using your display's highest refresh rate is generally recommended.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync support is detected but not enabled at startup. Using G-Sync is generally recommended if your system supports it.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync is enabled but not V-Sync and/or NVIDIA Reflex. It is generally recommended to enable all three settings together when they are available. Note that applying these settings will limit your frame rate to your display's refresh rate or slightly lower, which is usually the smoothest-looking and lowest input latency settings combination.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Removed "Main Menu Background Scenery" and "Item Inspect Background Scenery" settings from the Video Settings page. These settings are still available on the Main Menu and in the Item Inspect screens respectively.</em></li>
<li><em>The "Refresh Rate" setting now shows your display's current refresh rate in Windowed and Fullscreen Windowed modes.</em></li>
<li><em>Removed the "Laptop Power Savings" setting which has never actually been configurable in CS2.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a "Frame Pacing" section to the Advanced Video settings page.</em></li>
<li><em>Added an "NVIDIA G-Sync" row to the Frame Pacing section which tells you whether or not G-Sync is active with your current display settings. This row may be hidden if you're using the Vulkan renderer or if you're not using an NVIDIA graphics card.</em></li>
<li><em>Added "Maximum FPS In Game" and "Maximum FPS In Menus" sliders to the Frame Pacing section. These control the fps_max and fps_max_ui convars respectively.</em></li>
<li><em>Increased the default "Maximum FPS In Menus" setting from 120 FPS to 200 FPS.</em></li>
<li><em>The Advanced Video visual preview now uses the "In Game" maximum FPS instead of the "In Menus" maximum</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Counter-Strike 2 remains the most popular game on Steam, with the exception of rare peaks like PUBG and <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-6-million-units-in-4-days-passes-1-5-million-concurrent-steam-players-puredarks-fsr3-mod-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palworld</a>. In the last 24 hours, Valve's competitive first-person shooter game registered a peak of 1.37 million players, over twice as many as the second game (Dota 2, also made by Valve).</p>

  <p id="s5niyx">The original Windows PC version of Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil</em> is now available through digital storefront GOG, letting PC players experience the groundbreaking survival horror classic as it was back in 1996. PC versions of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/21/18187446/resident-evil-2-history-capcom-hideki-kamiya"><em>Resident Evil 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/18/21027264/resident-evil-3-was-a-spin-off-until-capcom-changed-its-mind-at-the-last-minute"><em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em></a> are also getting a re-release through GOG, the company announced Wednesday.</p>
<p id="Vy8s59">The re-release of <em>Resident Evil</em> for PC includes all of its original content with “quality of life improvements and enhanced compatibility for modern systems.” As with other PC releases through GOG, <em>Resident Evil</em>’s PC version is DRM-free.</p>
<p id="ohJw7S">Additionally, <em>Resident Evil 2</em> and <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> are available to wishlist through GOG, and available for pre-purchase in a trilogy bundle.</p>
<p id="hlyWeD">The original <em>Resident Evil</em> was released first for PlayStation in 1996. Capcom later ported the game to Windows, a release that included uncensored footage not available in the original PlayStation version. The PC version of <em>Resident Evil</em> also had two additional unlockable weapons: the Ingram submachine gun for Jill Valentine and Minimi light machine gun for Chris Redfield. Jill and Chris also got PC-exclusive unlockable costumes.</p>

<p id="rQk0av"><em>Resident Evil 2</em>’s PC version was based on the PlayStation “Dual Shock Ver.” re-release of the game, and included high-resolution character models and an art gallery. <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> for PC also featured enhanced 3D character models and higher-resolution graphics, but was dinged by players for its keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p id="GVDJPW">Capcom has remade the first four mainline games in the Resident Evil franchise over the past two decades, but the GOG re-releases will give survival horror fans a chance to replay the originals in their original, tank-controlled forms, albeit with some modern conveniences.</p>

      </p></div><div><p>The original 1996 <a title="Platforms > PC [20,544 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> release of <em>Resident Evil</em> is now available for PC via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the original PC releases of <em><a title="Games > Resident Evil 2 (2019) [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/resident-evil-2-2019">Resident Evil 2</a></em> and <em><a title="Games > Resident Evil 3 (2020) [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/resident-evil-3-2020">Resident Evil 3</a>: Nemesis</em> are coming soon, GOG and <a title="Companies > Capcom [2,496 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> announced. <span id="more-894649"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>This iconic classic is now available with all its original content intact, featuring quality of life improvements and enhanced compatibility for modern systems. As part of GOG’s ongoing effort to protect and preserve classic games, <em>Resident Evil</em> is now available on the DRM-free GOG store.</p><p>Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil</em> series has defined and revolutionized the <a title="Genres > Survival [293 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Horror [433 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> genre, with the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, and <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> being standout titles that have captivated gamers worldwide. While <em>Resident Evil</em> set the stage, introducing players to the eerie Spencer Mansion and navigating them through terrifying encounters and intricate puzzles, its atmospheric tension and innovative gameplay mechanics laid the foundation for the series’ success. <em>Resident Evil 2</em> and <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> successfully expanded the universe, delivering unforgettable experiences that deepened the franchise’s lore and horror elements.</p><p>That’s not all, though—for the complete <em>Resident Evil</em> experience, we decided to invite someone special to tell us something more about the series. It’s Suzi Hunter, also known as TheSphereHunter! In an exclusive video, Suzi will introduce the history of the franchise and tell the story of its originals’ revival, while interviewing some of the most interesting figures that took part in the process—including GOG’s very own technical producer Adam Ziolkowski, as well as head of business development Bartosz Kwietniewski.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a set of videos below.</p><!-- AD: content -->
