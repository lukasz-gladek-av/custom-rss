            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The release date for upcoming mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>appears to have been leaked ahead of an official reveal later today hat's likely to contain said information.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fan site&nbsp;<a href="https://personacentral.com/p5x-english-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Persona Central</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease" rel="nofollow">teased for a Western release earlier this week</a>, now has live listings across the Play Store, the App Store, and Steam. Apple's App Store is the one to give the game away, listing an expected release date of June 26th.</p>

<p>Of course, since neither the Steam page nor the Play Store listing have the same date, Apple's date could be a placeholder, but that seems unlikely given how oddly specific said date would be if it was just for demonstration purposes.</p>

You'll play as a new original character who's "thrust into a changed world drained of hope" following a "nightmare".</p>

<p>Before long, he meets an "eloquent owl named Lefaye" and "a long-nosed man" alongside a "beauty donned in blue", which presumably refers to Igor and his new assistant character. Evidently, twin youngsters Caroline and Justine will not be returning for&nbsp;<em>The Phantom X</em>.</p>

<p>Like the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>, you'll be switching between the Metaverse and the real world, exploring dungeons and balancing your adventuring life with socializing and building relationships.</p>

<p>Combat will follow the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>&nbsp;rather than either of its spinoffs; it'll be a strictly turn-based affair, so don't expect to be doing any <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5-strikers" rel="nofollow">real-time hack-and-slash-style fighting</a> or grid-based tactical strategizing here.</p>

We then had the pleasure of participating at a press panel with Soulframe creative director Geoff Crookes, Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair, community director Megan Everett, and Warframe principal writer Kat Kingsley to talk about development on the two games.</p><p dir="ltr">Warframe highlights included a new narrative chapter coming in June, the 61st Warframe Oraxia (aka Spiderframe), and a Primed version of the existing Warframe, Yareli. However, Soulframe is the big focus right now--the game is entering its 10th playtest, which heavily focuses on weapon customization.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Soulframe: Preludes - Gameplay Spotlight Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Gotta catch ‘em all</h2><p dir="ltr">The latest Soulframe gameplay reveal includes an upgrade system that Sinclair claims is "not at all like Pokemon." In the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/soulframe-preludes-gameplay-spotlight-trailer/2300-6465971/">Soulframe: Preludes trailer,</a> you can see an example of a creature you can equip that looks like a googly-eyed spider (similar to the dust creatures in Spirited Away). The trailer also introduces sidearms, which are meant to be used alongside a primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Right now, Soulframe is in its 10th "Prelude"--its version of alpha testing. When asked about the focus of P10, Sinclair said, "It's really about weapon customization."</p><p dir="ltr">"We're still early in the game. We're changing a lot of things in the game, and I think we spent a lot more time than we expected to on fundamentals, where the game is one-third the speed of Warframe and it's a ton of melee focus, and that really took us a lot longer."</p><p dir="ltr">Creatures and sidearms further expand the loadout possibilities, so it isn't just a plug-and-play kind of game. It seems to require some critical thinking and encourages the player to get more creative beyond just hacking or shooting at an enemy to defeat it.</p><p dir="ltr">"For P10, you're going to have what is somewhere between a living monster and a mod, if you know Warframe," Sinclair said of the creature-collecting system. "So, you'll be collecting these [creatures] and that will give you a lot of different ways that your sword [could be] different [from] my sword. As you rank it up, it's going to have more things that you can upgrade and you'll be hunting around for these little guys and trying to capture them and put them into your weapons."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495493"></a><figcaption>You can't have too many pets.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's similar to the modding system in Warframe, which the team heavily drew inspiration from. However, in the same way Warframe doesn't want to repeat itself and make another time-travel story right away, Soulframe doesn't want to just copy and paste the mod system without thinking it through clearly. DE has already done something similar with its Soulframe Preludes, modifying existing features like factions in Warframe and recreating a similar but different version in Soulframe.</p><p dir="ltr">As Crookes put it, "Warframe is just adrenaline. And [Soulframe's] slower, which fits with this pastoral romanticism, right? So we resisted having a secondary for a long time."</p><p dir="ltr">Its "pastoral romanticism" ties in with other Soulframe inspirations like Princess Mononoke, which was mentioned briefly in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soulframe-is-heavily-inspired-by-princess-mononoke-studio-ghibli-and-ico/1100-6517404/">our Soulframe interview from 2023</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I can't really get distinct with gameplay stuff," Crookes said about Mononoke-related inspirations, "but the animation reference is a big thing that we looked at. You know, like the corruption on [Prince Ashitaka's] arm and the violence that that created, and there's a contrast between those things."</p><p dir="ltr">He brought up pacts, Soulframe's equivalent of Warframe's frames, which also drew inspiration from Mononoke. "Pacts are the thing you equip, and it gives you your power set and your class. So we're always kind of thinking about how that theme and that dynamic kind of is specific to the world that it comes from and what the contrast is with that."</p><p dir="ltr">In that sense, it's hard to pinpoint the exact idea of pacts from the overall theme of Mononoke's emphasis on the might of nature. "So there's nothing really kind of like that we can rip out from one another. You destroy pollution. You heal the land. Save animals," he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495494" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495494"></a><figcaption>Soulframe drops the futuristic frames for the more fantastical pacts.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Forever alone gamers</h2><p dir="ltr">Digital Extremes hasn't announced the specifics when it comes to the social features in Soulframe, but Crookes did confirm that they aimed to make the game enjoyable for both solo and co-op players.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah, the co-op is a huge part of it, but I don't think we're going to make it mandatory," he said. "We're putting out a community event now that will encourage collaboration with the community, but a lot of people in the studio call themselves forever-alone gamers. When they play online, they're like...Together alone."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Sinclair, about 25% of Warframe's players exclusively play solo and they let them do as they please, so they are taking the same approach with Soulframe. That said, the team encourages players to try co-op when they can. One of these co-op features takes advantage of the theme of ancestry in Soulframe.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're trying something really soft [to] push people into the co-op who normally shy away from it. We want to encourage [people to see the] benefits of meeting players in the world," Crookes said. "We have this theme of ancestry in the game that we have in there right now as a light foundation that we want to build on, so that if you have a family history with another player in the game world, there might be certain benefits to share from each other when you play together."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495492" data-ratio="0.56230747689723" data-width="3571" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495492"></a><figcaption>The best of friends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">He also mentions adding message boards in the game, though they realize it's a "brave" thing to do because they need to trust players to give them full freedom over their messages (instead of, for example, pre-set messages). As for other cooperative gameplay features, Soulframe has factions called "enclaves" and hubs that you can join to socialize with people who are in a similar guild.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're going to try to reinforce people helping each other out in the game by leaving hints or suggestions or things that help people in certain zones in the overworld," Crookes said.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lessons learned</h2><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is far from finished, but Digital Extremes has been very open about its development. It credits a lot of the progress it's made on Soulframe so far to the early players that spent hours on the game and gave in-depth feedback on what to improve.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we started this game, a lot of people said this can't work again," said Sinclair. "Like the world's different, you can't do Warframe again--[you can't] release a small game, get a community, [and] focus on community rather than focus on having 500 hours of content, and we said, 'No, we think that can work again.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"We tend to be more insecure about our product than we should be," he admitted. "So I think, when we were talking about making the intro to Soulframe, we were thinking, 'Okay, we've got to make a two-hour single-player quest to introduce them to the world and get people to understand the setting and the conflicts, and then open the gates for them.'"</p><p dir="ltr">However, when the team was actually getting the game live, they realized that this approach wouldn't work. "We [were] like, 'No, we're going to hurt the game if we do this, and we need to kind of embrace what we're doing right with Warframe, but just kind of think about the new player experience a bit more.'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495495" data-ratio="0.56253776435045" data-width="1655" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495495"></a><figcaption>Soulframe is more than a little different from Warframe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is a much different game than Warframe, so it wasn't always possible to create a rewarding experience by following the same path, like the adjustments they needed to make to game speed early in development. That adjustment continues to be a struggle years later. Sinclair mentions a time last year where they were "torn to shreds" because of a faulty Soulframe demo and decided that they should slow down development considerably to focus on perfecting the fundamentals. Because of that, they've just started to flesh out things like weapon customization and build crafting. The creatures shown in the latest trailer are a part of that.</p><p dir="ltr">"Warframe is a huge power fantasy, whereas [in] Soulframe, the time to kill one enemy is dramatically different, which means you can really look at every frame of the animation--the foot clipping in the ground--and I think that's what really bummed me out about last year's TennoCon," said Sinclair.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was very proud of what we showed. It's a smaller team, [and they] made it very quickly. The Nimrod, Verminia, all that shit, the dynamic weather things that happen, [all of that] really, really cool stuff… But one enemy slipped through a wall, and it was like, 'This game is jank, right?' It took us a few months to recover from that. Just in terms of headspace and morale."</p><p dir="ltr">One of the goals DE has for itself is committing to a structured schedule for Soulframe like it already has for Warframe. As Sinclair said, "We really got a bit of a bad habit last year with our Prelude's updates where we keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it. You see what Warframe is doing and how fast it's going."</p><p dir="ltr">"It's like, okay, remember, we're still DE. We still have to really make sure we're not biting off too much and getting interesting work."</p><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is currently in development for PC. Digital Extremes hints at more to come during TennoCon 2025 in July.</p>

                <p>Today marks the official launch of Nubs!: Arena, a chaotic arena brawler developed by Glowfish Interactive and Rangatang. Anywhere from four to 20 players can battle each other or team up in the game. And the devs are so eager to introduce players to Nubs!: Arena that they are giving it away for free for the next 24 hours.</p><p>Players who want to give Nubs!: Arena a shot only need to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337860/Nubs_Arena/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visit its Steam page</a> and claim it before the free promotion ends tomorrow, May 16. The launch trailer for Nubs!: Arena has also been released to give everyone a taste of the party-style brawl that awaits them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCsUuBaMdQo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bCsUuBaMdQo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This game supports local co-op with up to four players, while 20 players is the limit online. There are numerous traps and power-ups in the arena, and knocked-out player-characters are actually transformed into stars. The players can still run while turned into a star, and they're going to have to put their legs to the test. Because if any of the other players capture the stars before they respawn as their regular character, then the corresponding player is eliminated from the game.</p><p>Nubs!: Arena includes a number of strange and absurd weapons and power-ups, and players will be able to extensively customize their characters. The game also features roguelite progression and each match is fast-paced to keep the action moving for casual gamers.</p><p>In other free-game news, PlayStation Plus subscribers can now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-may-2025/1100-6531161/" data-ref-id="1100-6531161">grab their free games for May</a>, including Ark: Survival Evolved. Those titles will only be available until June 2.</p>

                <p>Death Stranding was a polarizing game when it was first released, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">but for the upcoming sequel</a>, previews and early reviews for the game have largely been positive. In a recent interview, game director Hideo Kojima explained how he was happy to see test audiences react more favorably to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, but he also explained how this had left him feeling conflicted.</p><p>"Sony is pleased, of course, but I do wish I was a bit more controversial," Kojima said to Edge Magazine (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/test-death-stranding-2-reviews/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "Blockbuster films need an 80% approval rating--I don't want to make games like that. I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market or selling millions of copies. That’s not what I'm aiming for."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Death Stranding 2 - On The Beach Trailer Full Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima did acknowledge the paradox of this approach, as while he may not be aiming to appeal to the broader gaming market, Death Stranding 2 still needs to sell a sizable number of units if he wants to keep the lights on at Kojima Productions and pay his staff. The other benefit to reviews being divided over a game is that it allows a developer like Kojima to receive constructive criticism and implement improvements, both in the base game and a potential sequel. At the same time, Kojima says that he won't alter themes or story based on feedback from players.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</a> is a good example of this approach, as it added new content and quality-of-life improvements to the game while keeping the story intact. Death Stranding 2 also appears to have taken a considerable amount of feedback into account, as the game is aiming to appeal to a broader range of players with a more action-focused direction.</p><p>"Once I retrained myself to play it as a stealth-action game, it greatly improved my enjoyment and I started looking forward to camps of enemies," Dan Ryckert wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/">Death Stranding 2 preview</a>. "Like the first game, it can be meditative in the quiet moments as you traverse the environment. But when the game wants to get loud, it does not hold back."</p><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on June 24 for PS5, and if you're looking to play it in style, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">preorder a limited-edition DualSense controller</a> inspired by the game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-knows-what-death-stranding-3-could-be-but-he-wont-make-it-himself/1100-6531404/">Kojima also spoke about the possibility of Death Stranding 3</a>, but he'd like to pass the development baton to someone else for the potential threequel.</p>

            <p>
Developer NetherRealm has surprise-launched a Definite Edition of 2023's divisive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, and some fans are taking it as a sign that development is coming to an end.
</p>
<p>
NetherRealm released its Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition overnight on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC with minimal fanfare. It bundles together the main game, its Khaos Reigns story expansion, Shang Tsung, two Kombat Packs featuring additional fighters and Kameo characters, some in-game currency, and a selection of skins. Animality finishing moves have also been added in a free update for all players.
</p>
<p>
All that equates to around 18 months of post-launch support following Mortal Kombat 1's divisive arrival back in 2023. Chris Moyse criticised the game's "receding features, underbaked mechanics, and a dated online experience" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-1-review">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat 1 review</a>, and the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-1-players-hit-back-at-freemium-model-dlc-pricing">drew further complaints</a> as the extent of its aggressive post-launch monetisation became clear. In the time since, NetherRealm has continued its schedule of DLC releases - now collected in the Definitive Edition - culminating in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-first-look-at-terminators-t-1000-mortal-kombat-1-finisher-is-terrifying">arrival of Terminator's T-1000</a> in March.

<p>
However, following the character's release, there's been little talk of future DLC plans, beyond a couple of skins intended to tie-in with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-poster-reveals-first-look-at-karl-urbans-johnny-cage">this year's Mortal Kombat movie sequel</a>, and player numbers - on Steam at least - have settled in the low thousands, barely higher than those of the now-six-year-old <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-11">Mortal Kombat 11</a>. It's in this context fans are interpreting the launch of Mortal Kombat 1's Definitive Edition as a development death knell, with many mocking NetherRealm boss Ed Boone's <a href="https://x.com/interloko/status/1922693458772312189">earlier promise</a> the studio would "work on the game for years to come", and his <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1838566106119749948">more recent commitment</a> to "supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come."
</p>
<p>
"The arrival of the definitive edition meant it was over with the previous games, so... I guess that was it," noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmhhqw/this_means_its_over/">one poster on the Mortal Kombat subreddit</a>, which is currently awash with similar sentiments of largely resigned apathy. Others have pointedly resurfaced claims made by a reliable leaker last year that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h0eozm/mortal_kombat_1_leaker_says_all_year_3_content/">Mortal Kombat 1 development would be ending</a> amid poor DLC sales. "We can always hold out hope for more Beige skins with red trim," joked another.
</p>
<p>
Mortal Kombat publisher Warner Bros. (which reported a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">48 percent drop in gaming revenue</a> earlier this week) hasn't explicitly confirmed the end of Mortal Kombat 1's development following its Definitive Edition release, but we've contacted the company for more information.
</p>
<p>
Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition, should you be interested, costs £54.99/$69.99 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, while Switch players can pick it up for $59.99. There's also a £49.99/$59.99 Definitive Edition Upgrade ($49.99 on Switch) for Mortal Kombat 1 owners wanting to get everything in the new version without purchasing each bit of DLC separately.

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is set to be a better-received game than its predecessor, but Hideo Kojima wishes it weren't the case, as he does not aim to create games that appeal to the mass market.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/test-death-stranding-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a>, in the latest issue of Edge Magazine, the legendary game designer revealed that the second entry in the series launching next month on PlayStation 5 is doing much better in test reviews than its predecessor, but he wished it weren't so. Back with the original, Hideo Kojima did a lot of monitoring tests, and he found out that four out of ten people would love the game, while the other six would say that it would be a terrible game. This, Kojima-san noted, is a good balance, which Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is not striking, as everyone seems to be positive about the game. Sony is obviously pleased by the game doing so well in test reviews, but he wished it was a bit more controversial, as he is not interested in appealing to the mass market or selling millions of copies, although he recognizes that he can't afford to release a failure as he needs to take care of his studio and staff. But ultimately, Kojima-san wants to create something new that no one else has done before.</p>
<p>If I had been part of the original Death Stranding test reviews, I would have been among the four who thought it was a great game. While the game does have some issues, like the moment-to-moment gameplay sometimes getting dull, Death Stranding is among Hideo Kojima's best games, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">review</a>, so I can only be excited about what Death Stranding 2: On the Beach could offer to top its predecessor. Thankfully, it won't take long for anybody to find out, as the game launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">June 26th</a> on PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

			<p>A new STALKER 2 patch has gone live today, packing 700 fixes and improvements with a focus on combat.</p>

<p>Besides introducing combat improvements, the new STALKER 2 patch also introduces some balance changes, including increased armor piercing value for the RPM-74 weapon, increased damage and concussion distance for RPG, rebalanced stashes in the Zaton region, bug fixes and technical updates, which include improved pathing for NPCs, improvements for scripted NPC animations, improved sound obstruction for grenades thrown outside from an indoor location, enhanced facial animations and more. The full patch notes can be found on the game's<a href="https://www.stalker2.com/news/patch-1-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-patch-1-4-brings-big-improvements-to-combat-ai-and-more.1189929/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-patch-14<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Patch 1.4, and it's bringing tons of improvements to the game's combat mechanics, plus more changes to the much-vaunted A-Life AI system and lots of other tweaks.</p>

<p>Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12" rel="nofollow">last few</a> major&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, there's no single star of the show here; it's all about the minor adjustments that all come together to create what will hopefully be a slightly less janky game.</p>

<p>Combat changes include mutants now being able to eat corpses using an animation if they're nearby, as well as entering an "alert" state if something happens near them. You'll have to be on your toes if you don't want to fall foul of mutants now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-patch-1.4-night.jpg?itok=4fE9uiJm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-patch-1.4-night.jpg?itok=sbwKAwvR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has received another big patch.</figcaption></figure><p>Humans are also much smarter now thanks to this update; they'll seek cover more often, "always try to hide before shooting", and won't rush forward if you don't need them. They'll also use trees as cover now, which is a nice addition.</p>

<p>Plenty of other big improvements have been made to the way humans do battle in&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>as well; they'll throw grenades only when flushing out targets (rather than on cooldown), flank more often, and use tougher close combat measures in Veteran and Stalker difficulty modes.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life system, which has been the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">subject of some controversy</a> in the past, has also received a few tweaks, although they're much less extensive than they have been in previous patches.</p>

<p>A-Life NPCs will now behave less erratically when attacking enemy lairs, and an issue involving A-Life NPCs not moving when "transitioning to offline" has also been fixed. It's not much, but it's useful nonetheless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-patch-1.4-poppies.jpg?itok=kDIGjJ94 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-patch-1.4-poppies.jpg?itok=cKtXw-Sl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You should notice that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s NPCs are a bit smarter now.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to read the full list of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Patch 1.4 changes, you can do so via the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/news/patch-1-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>. Be aware that while it's not quite as long as previous updates, it's still a pretty long list.</p>

<p>This patch comes just a day after GSC Game World <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced the release date</a> for the upcoming Enhanced Edition upgrade for the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone</em>&nbsp;trilogy, which is bringing visual and gameplay improvements to the classic shooters next week.</p>

			<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdMBChercPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new episode</a> of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Creator's Voice interviews, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford heaped praise on the upcoming console, calling it perfect for Borderlands 4 and very powerful given the form factor.</p>
<p><em>To have Nintendo Switch 2 in hand while we're making Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 is really exciting. Usually, we'll have to port a game to a platform, but in this case, we're making Borderlands 4 for the Nintendo Switch 2. And I think that when you play Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2, you'll realize that with the cooperative experience and how we can use the Nintendo Switch 2 platform to connect with friends, share our game with friends, it's pretty astonishing how perfect this platform is for Borderlands 4. </em></p>
<p><em>The most exciting thing to me about the console is to see where we're going to go with this new connected world. Gaming is a shared social experience. It's why we, as developers, continue to make games that have adventure, but adventure with friends as well. The console makes that accessible to us as developers, to players, to our friend groups. Wherever they are in this weird, wild world, we can explore the Borderlands together.</em></p>
<p><em>The Switch 2 has been a joy to work with. It's very powerful. It's an incredible machine in a very tight form factor, and we love being on the bleeding edge with our graphics and the experience that we're creating. And the Nintendo Switch 2 makes all that possible. We don't feel like we're fighting the system. We feel like the system is enabling us and empowering us to make the best version of Borderlands 4 we can. As a game developer, it's awesome.</em></p>
<p>It's worth noting that Borderlands 4 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and has promised a large and completely seamless world with no loading between areas. That the Switch 2 can fully support such a game is certainly encouraging, though not entirely surprising after learning that games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws are also coming to the platform.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4's release date has recently been <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought forward to September 12</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Nintendo console</a> will debut on the market on June 5.</p>

            <p>Grotesque new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platform game</a> Gennady takes place in a squelchy, eminently punchable world of procedurally generated, wriggling alien cubes. Burst a cube and you'll be rewarded with juicy, golden maggots and a shower of delightful green ooze. Sometimes the ooze spawns a grotty little janitor monster, who slinks up behind you with mop in tentacle. Yes, this is a game in which the filth tries to clean up after itself. Good luck with that, filth. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfgXyaDlI70" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Gennady is not one of your classic feelgood platformers. It's a misanthropic mix of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earthworm-jim">Earthworm Jim</a>, with some exuberant comicbook animation and roguelite progression elements to accompany the hop 'n' bop 'n' blasting.</p>
<p>You play a grumpy middle-aged man in heart-print boxers. What you are doing here in this realm of squirming bioblocks is anybody's guess, but Gennady - assuming that's his name - seems mighty irked about something. "You are as much of a light as I am of a moth," he comments gnomically in the trailer. It seems possible you will be able to transform into a moth, given that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430010/Gennady/">the Steam page</a> already stipulates that you can transform into a squirrel. </p>
<p>There's a demo on that Steam page. I've had a pop at the opening Meat Processing area. It's an enjoyably mushy creation with some novel flourishes - when you die, there's a progression minigame in which you shoot falling items to retain them for your next run. I do feel sorry for the enemies, though, all of whom might be cousins of Dr Zoidberg, and all of whom appear to be employees of whatever hell factory this game is set in. You can also recruit Frienemies, which are essentially game modifiers in pettable form.</p>
<p>In general, I worry that Gennady's misanthropy might hew towards the "teenage boy writing his name in dog poop" end of the moodboard. There's a touch of knowing sexism, with a big-boobed tentacle storekeeper who (going by the WIP art on the Steam feed) tells you that her eyes are up here, sweetie. Of possible relevance: the tutorial level pop-ups archly mention that there's no princess to rescue, though there is, apparently, a Queen. I imagine she's the source of all the larvae.</p>
<p>Mixed feelings about Gennady's doomy masculine edginess notwithstanding, I have a basic, automatic enthusiasm for anything that reminds me faintly of Earthworm Jim. There's no release date yet. Developers Feed 64 are an outsourcing team based in Armenia, whose past creations include <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Feed64.Throworm&amp;pli=1">this free-to-play mobile game about lobbing worms up a shaft</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Game 6 (our next project) will happen the way it will happen thanks to you,” Jorjani said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That seemingly innocuous quote sparked concern from one fan who said it suggested Arrowhead was “already abandoning a good chunk of dev time and money from Helldivers 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jorjani quickly shut that down, insisting: "Nah. It's ALL Helldivers 2 for now. A very, very small team will spin up something later this year and go at it sloowly. Helldivers is our main focus and will be for a loooong time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, how long does Jorjani expect content updates for Helldivers 2 to last?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As long as you folks keep playing and buying Super Credits we can keep it going," Jorjani said, pointing to Helldivers 2's virtual currency that's used to buy Premium Warbonds. "Last summer we were kinda screwing the pooch so it looked like we wouldn't be able to keep the train going for a long time - but we turned the ship around, you support us a lot so it's looking bright."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s an interesting follow-up comment from Jorjani, in response to one fan who called on Arrowhead to make its next game available in all regions and avoid the region-locking purchase debacle the Sony-published Helldivers 2 has suffered from: "The next game is 100% funded by ourselves so we'll call 100% of those shots." That suggests Arrowhead isn't going with Sony or any other company for its next game, which in turn suggests it's not Helldivers 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Game 6 and how its development will (hopefully) differ from the "rough", eight-year slog that was Helldivers 2, Jorjani said Arrowhead wants to nail the "core s**t" early on before moving on to making the rest of the game this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the most part of the development cycle games plain suck," Jorjani explained. "Very seldom are they truly fun from the get-go. And for Helldivers taking eight years to make it was rough for the longest time. But it came together in the end. The ONLY way to know is to playtest playtest playtest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For our next game we're doing things in a much smarter way and nailing a lot of the core s**t early on (as you should) then make the rest."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this tallies with previous comments from Arrowhead developers, who’ve said they want Helldivers 2 to last for years to come. Let’s remember, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks"><u>Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time</u></a>, with an astonishing 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. It is a record no first-party Sony-developed game will likely ever beat. But so much has happened since that initial explosive release: a dramatic U-turn on PSN account requirements on Steam, review-bomb campaigns, and a community often at war with Helldivers 2 itself as nerfs and buffs either go too far or not far enough. So you'd be forgiven for wondering whether enthusiasm for Helldivers 2 at Arrowhead might have waned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Alex Bolle, production director on Helldivers 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">recently told IGN</a> “we want it to be around for years and years and years to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are? And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, recent leaks (one from PlayStation itself) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-playstation-leak-suggests-players-will-fight-against-the-illuminate-on-super-earth-itself-next-week-and-now-gameplay-of-super-earth-mega-cities-has-leaked-too">point to the imminent release of Super Earth as a playable map</a>, as the Illuminate eventually make it to our home planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Infamous idle game Cookie Clicker is getting launched for actual consoles - so prepare to never turn your TV off, ever again.
</p>
<p>
The bizarre browser-based bakery time-waster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infamous-idle-game-cookie-clicker-is-getting-a-steam-release">previously got a launch on Steam back in 2021</a>, so perhaps its forthcoming leap to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S shouldn't come as a total surprise.

Cookie Clicker's eShop page specifically lists a release date for the game's console version - 22nd May - and a price, $4.99. This is the same amount that Cookie Clicker also costs on Steam - and here in the UK, that translates to £4.29.
</p>
<p>
Originally launched in 2013, Cookie Clicker is a menace to productivity and your home energy bill (unless you play at work, then good luck to you). From humble beginnings clicking to create virtual cookies, you can create a sci-fi baking empire powered by increasingly odd means - and also by employing lots of virtual grannies. The longer you leave the game running, the more you make, and the deeper you get sucked down its doughy rabbit hole.

            <p>Electronic Arts, publishers of Clive Barker's Undying and Pooh and Tigger's Hunny Safari, have let employees know that they're ending full remote working and hiring, and implementing return to office for all employees as part of hybrid work plans, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">reports IGN</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In-person work results in a "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players," said CEO and unholy human-blazer hybrid Andrew Wilson in an email to employees, viewed by IGN. As a player, I do wish these people would stop speaking for me to make their employees' lives worse</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means that all employees of the company within 30 miles of an EA building will be forced to transition to a hybrid work model with at least three days a week in office. Those outside this radius will be, according to the somewhat ominous wording in an email to employees from president Laura Miele, "considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid".</p>
<p>IGN chatted to several employees anonymously, who report feeling upset, confused, or unsure about what will happen to their jobs if they couldn't move within that 30 mile radius. "Existing remote workers would have their 'exemptions' to return to office 'sunset' sometime in the next 3 to 24 months," two sources explained to IGN. Childcare, medical conditions, and long commutes were all given as reasons. RTO mandates are sometimes referred to as "quiet layoffs"  due to these sorts of issues - at some level, EA must be aware that some of their employees would find it impossible to meet the new requirements.</p>
<p>EA recently laid off around 300 workers, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">around 100 at Titanfall studio Respawn</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">they laid off 5% of their workforce, close to 670</a>. Andrew Wilson and Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took home around $40 million between them in 2024</a>. According to one Ebay listing I found, this is enough to buy 3 million second hand copies of Pooh and Tigger's Hunny Safari - far more copies than anyone would ever need.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
EA has detailed a new in-office working policy that will see all local employees return at least three days a week, and largely phase out remote roles.
</p>
<p>
The changes mean any employee living within a 30-mile radius will be required to commute at least three days a week under a new hyrbid policy. 
</p>
<p>
Employees working outside of that 30-mile radius will continue to work remotely unless their role is designated oherwise - though there's uncertainty over EA saying it will additionally  "sunset the Offsite Local work model" over the next "three to 24 months", depending on location.
</p>
<p>
Staff members this affects told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN</a> they believe this means existing remote workers will have their "exemptions" removed over the next two years, with uncertainty over any remote working after that time. 
</p>
<p>
Certainly, it sounds like fully remote work will be an exception going forward. Any exception to the above policies or future hiring for a remote position will need direct approval from EA CEO Andrew Wilson or company president Laura Miele, the latter said in an email, describing the changes as a shift from "a decentralised approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model".
</p>
<p>
Explaining the changes, Wilson said in-person work was EA's preference as it provided "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for detail on how this policy will impact the company's UK studios. 
</p>
<p>Numerous employers are attempting to bring staff back to offices following years of remote working - to a mixed response. In March 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developers-blast-rockstars-reckless-decision-to-return-to-office-full-time">developers working on GTA 6 criticised Rockstar for telling employees they must return to the office full-time</a> with just a month's notice, calling the decision "reckless". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Call%20of%20Duty:%20Black%20Ops%206%20developers%20protest%20over%20office%20working%20policy">Protests were held by Call of Duty developers</a> in autumn last year over Activision's return-to-office plans, around the same time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Ubisoft%20staff%20told%20to%20strike%20over%20remote%20working%20changes">Ubisoft workers also went on strike in Paris</a>.

		<p>Ubisoft has decided to extend the development timelines for some of its “biggest productions”, in order to try and ensure they meet the high bar set by the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, both by critics and at the tills.</p>
<p>These are unnamed titles that did not have confirmed launch windows, pushing their release back to mid-2026, 2027 or early 2028 and generally giving development teams longer to work on projects. The suggestion that these are their top tier games, and from an investor call Q&amp;A, this would refer to the publisher’s top brands, including Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six, The Division and Ghost Recon.</p>


<p>“After a review of our pipeline,” CEO Yves Guillemot said, “we have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success. As a consequence, FY2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands.”</p>
<p>This gives an indication to investors that there will not be a massive budget release this financial year. The company still has committed launches for Anno 117: Pax Romana, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/10/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-now-set-for-2026/">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>, The Division Resurgence spin-off, Rainbow Six Mobile, Rainbow Six Siege X, and some unannounced titles within this window.</p>
<p>FY 2024-25 was down on the previous year, despite the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in March, after the underperformance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> last summer. However, AC Shadows should have a long tail into FY 2025-26 that, alongside the new titles, should keep things steady through this year for the successive years to improve upon.</p>

<p>Announced back in March, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">Ubisoft is creating a new subsidiary in financial partnership with Tencent</a> to act as a new home for some of its biggest studios and franchise – specifically Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. The expectation is that this will be fully formed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>That comes after their “cost savings program” (read: layoffs) that took place over the last few years. Guillemot says they “are committed to going further” (read: more layoffs) and will aim to make additional savings of €100 million in the next two years. The company cut around 3,000 jobs in the last two years to save €200 million, so simple maths suggests that 1,500 more jobs will be cut in the next year or two. That’s always reassuring to hear for employees…</p>

Games has announced and released Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition, which it described as "the most extensive version" of the gory fighting game. But for fans, the release of the Definitive Edition has sparked significant concern that NetherRealm has now moved on from the game, and that it won’t see any new DLC characters or significant content updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition offers the main game packaged together with previously released downloadable content, including the Khaos Reigns story expansion, Kombat Pack 1, and Kombat Pack 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Definitive Edition also adds new character skins for Johnny Cage, Kitana, Scorpion, and Shao Khan “inspired” by the upcoming Mortal Kombat 2 film, the Mortal Kombat (2021) movie character skin for Sub-Zero; and the tournament themed character skin (outfit) for Liu Kang.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans, The Definitive Edition feels like a line has been drawn under Mortal Kombat 1. While Warner Bros. is known for its definitive and ultimate editions, and indeed NetherRealm games tend to get them, this time there is a sense of finality to the release. And with no announcements forthcoming about a Kombat Pack 3 or anything else meaningful for Mortal Kombat 1, fans believe that March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character will go down as the game's final content drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, it’s a big disappointment for hardcore Mortal Kombat 1 fans, who had hoped for significantly longer term support for the game. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon</a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: “NetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game is done, it’s their way of saying ‘Goodbye! Come back the next year or two for another overly priced game bloated with guest characters!’ " <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmiyaw/the_game_just_fucking_came_out_dude_what_the_hell/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said a clearly disgruntled redditor</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“MK1 officially has a shorter content lifespan than the f***ing Texas Chainsaw Massacre game lmao,” said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. NetherRealm is yet to make a similar announcement for Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now">Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</a>, the pink ninja developer Ed Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator was the final DLC character added to Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 has sold 5 million copies, with the franchise now up to 100 million. Mortal Kombat 11 became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Stab-o-sneak merchants Ubisoft are pushing back the release of several unspecified big name projects in the wake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which CEO Yves Guillemot says "has reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand". The tactical snoop 'n' shoot peddlers are also looking to cut costs by at least €100 million across their organisation, following a difficult year in which they've partnered with Tencent to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">launch a new corporate subsidiary</a> dedicated to their most popular games.</p><!--more-->
<p>"This year has been a challenging one for Ubisoft, with mixed dynamics across our portfolio, amid intense industry competition," observed Guillemot in <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">Ubi's latest earnings results</a>, adding that the company's overall earnings for the past year are "slightly below objective". He says they're in a strong position regardless thanks to the "discipline applied across the Group", which presumably includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">those mass layoffs in January</a>, amongst other cutbacks. According to the earnings call, Ubisoft have shrunk their staff headcount by "around 3,000" since the end of September 2022.</p>
<p>By "discipline", Guillemot is also probably referring to Ubisoft's repeated delaying of Assassin's Creed Shadows to ensure a more positive reception than that achieved by last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. He says the delay has paid off, with Shadows having the second highest launch day revenue of any game in the series. "The launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows was a defining moment," the Ubiboss continued. "It reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand, with a highly favourable community response from long-time fans and new players alike."</p>
<p>Guillemot says Ubisoft have completed their cost-cutting plans "ahead of schedule". Still, management remain focussed on "discipline", with plans for "additional savings of at least €100m over the next two years to drive structural efficiencies and reinforce the foundations of our organization". So, more job losses then?</p>
<p>Ubisoft are also still completing the creation of their new Tencent-backed subsidiary, which will oversee development of future Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six games. We can expect a "new organisation" to be announced later this year. The publishers have also "decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success", which means that "[Financial Year] 2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands."</p>
<p>The rest of Ubisoft's 2025 and early 2026 will look relatively trim by comparison. On PC, we can expect <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> and Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era, together with expansions for Assassin's Creed Shadows and, just possibly, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time remake</a>.</p>
<p>An accompanying <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/6pXJlDFC1Nrw8mwM4M8Nr8/d4036561f95076c3acdb1003819058ef/Ubisoft_FY25_Slideshow_vfinal.pdf">slideshow presentation</a> maintains Ubisoft's commitment to the two wolves that lurk inside every triple-A game company - "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> adventures" and "GaaS-native experiences", aka live service games. They want to both "improve the quality of narrative-driven solo experiences" and serve up "richer multiplayer features with more frequent content updates".</p>
<p>I don't see any mention here of "disciplining" executive salaries and compensation, but to give the Devil his due, Guillemot has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-is-taking-a-large-paycut">taken paycuts over poor company performance</a> in the past.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/15/valve-refutes-reports-of-a-steam-data-leak-this-was-not-a-breach-of-steam-systems/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following reports of a Steam data leak over the weekend, Valve has investigated the issue and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/533224478739530145?l=english">issued a statement</a> to firstly refute reports that this is a breach of their systems, and to reassure users that there is no need to change passwords or amend security settings.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">LinkedIn post</a> claimed that a trove of leaked data from Steam included over 89 million user records, but while this initially appeared concerning, fears were allayed somewhat when an update explained that this related to real-time TFA SMS logs – time-sensitive codes that are sent via text message for two factor authentication. This still suggested that a hacker had infiltrated the overarching security system, but had only gained “backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly.”</p>


<p>Valve has now issued a statement following their own analysis and confirmed that “was<strong> NOT</strong> a breach of Steam systems,” that details within the leak “did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data,”&nbsp;and that users “you do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event.”</p>
<p>What they do advise, however, is that users should set up the Steam Mobile Authenticator.</p>
<p>Using SMS messages for TFA is an outdated and less secure method of providing a time-sensitive code to users. SMS messages are not encrypted, so if a bad actor were able to intercept those authentication codes in time, they would be able to use them in conjunction with account details and passwords to gain access to an account.</p>

<p>Using an authenticator app with an automatically rotating and generated code from a secure key or that is reliant on encrypted push notifications is much more secure, as this requires access to a trusted device in addition to login and password. Furthermore, Steam now has a more automated login system where you can scan a QR code using the Steam Mobile Authenticator and not have to input account details at all.</p>
<p>Even with these security options, you do still need to be wary of unexpected emails and messages prompting you to login to personal accounts. There’s always more and more advanced attempts by naughty people to try and fool you into giving them your stuff.</p>
<p>But for now, if you’re happy and content with your Steam login set up, there’s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Valve’s statement in full:</p>
<p><em>You may have seen reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined&nbsp;<b>this was NOT a breach of Steam systems.</b><wbr></em></p>

<p><em>We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.<wbr></em></p>

<p><em>The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to. <b>The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data.</b> Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>You do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event. It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We recommend regularly checking your Steam account security at any time at&nbsp;<wbr></em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices?snr=1_2108_9__2107">https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices</a><wbr></em></p>

<p><em>We also recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if you haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about your account and your account’s safety.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/533224478739530145?l=english">Steam</a></em></p>
