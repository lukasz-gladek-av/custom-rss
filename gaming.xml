Delta, the popular app that allows users to emulate thousands of Nintendo games on iPhone and iPad, has finally found itself in legal hot water - but not from Nintendo itself. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Delta's developers were accused of copying their app's icon from Adobe, the company behind PhotoShop - and have now rushed to change it to avoid being kicked off the App Store by Apple.
</p>
<p>
"Adobe threatened legal action unless we changed our app icon - so we did!" the app wrote in its latest patch notes, explaining its hastily-changed icon design. "Hope y'all like it!"

<p>
The drama unfolded earlier this month in a succession of emails to Delta, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24159268/delta-emulator-logo-change-app">The Verge</a> reported - firstly from Adobe's lawyers and then a day later from Apple itself, saying the app risked being delisted.
</p>
<p>
Adobe claimed Alpha's triangle-with-a-bit-cut-out logo was similar to its own triangle-with-a-bit-cut-out design. And, looking at them side-by-side, you can see the similarity.
</p>
<p>
But these logos are based on entirely different letters, Delta argued - while still changing its look to a scrambled version of its original as a placeholder.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
"We responded to both Apple and Adobe explaining our icon was a stylised Greek letter delta - not an A - but that we would update the Delta logo anyway to avoid confusion," Delta creator Riley Testut said.
</p>
<p>
Delta topped the iPhone App Store last month, following Apple's recent change in app store policy to officially allow video game emulator apps onto its storefront for the first time.
</p>
<p>
The app allows users to play downloaded ROMs of classics from the NES, SNES, N64 home consoles, as well as Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS handhelds.
</p>
<p>
It's not the first App Store emulator to get into trouble. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-pulls-iphone-gba-emulator-but-not-because-it-encourages-piracy">Apple pulled another Nintendo emulator</a> after it was discovered that the app itself was based on another emulator's code.
</p>
<p>
Last week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-a-ps1-emulator-rising-up-the-iphone-app-store-charts">free PS1 emulator for iPhone and iPad named Gamma</a> was also launched.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously contacted Nintendo for its stance on app store emulators, and was pointed to industry body Video Games Europe for a response.
</p>
<p>
"The industry is committed to protecting the creativity and hard work of video game developers," a Video Games Europe spokesperson said. "Illegal circumvention of copyright protections or engaging in copyright piracy stifles innovation and hampers the development of the entertainment experiences that are enjoyed by millions of players around the world."
</p>
<p>
Could more Nintendo consoles be emulated on iPhone in the future? Not for now, according to Nintendo hacker and dataminer OatmealDome, who has demonstrated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamecube-and-wii-emulation-on-iphone-unlikely-due-to-technical-constraints-rather-than-piracy-concerns">GameCube and Wii emulation on iPhone is unlikely</a> due to technical constraints.

            <p>
Fans have released Mario Builder 64, a PC toolbox to create levels based on the N64 classic.
</p>
<p>
Where Nintendo's own Super Mario Maker games allow players to create 2D courses using NES, SNES and modern visuals, <a href="https://romhacking.com/hack/mario-builder-64">Mario Builder 64</a> allows for 3D courses filled with familiar assets, enemies, and stars to hunt for - all running on N64 open source.

</p>
<p>
A trailer for the game shows building and Mario platforming in action and has since gone viral.
</p>

<p>

The game allows players to build levels using what seems to be an intuitive interface, selecting from plenty of platform assets as well as environmental themes and skyboxes. The trailer includes obstacle course-like levels floating in the sky, as well as levels that feel more open world and underwater levels.
</p>
<p>
Levels are then uploaded and available for others to play. The trailer shows off a selection, including red coin challenges, bosses and exploration-focused levels, speed-run levels and more.
</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Mario Builder 64 has been released. Much time and effort was poured into this project and I couldn't be happier to share it with all of you.

<p>
In short, this is spectacular and a clear evolutionary step for the Mario Maker series.
</p>
<p>
Will Nintendo allow Mario Builder 64 to survive? Unlikely, but perhaps somewhere there's an official equivalent in the works? Please?!
</p>
<p>
Nintendo fans have already been playing ROMs on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/popular-iphone-emulator-in-legal-trouble-but-not-from-nintendo">Delta emulator app on iPhone</a>, which has proven particularly popular.

</p>
<p>
Super Mario 64 was, of course, a launch game for the N64 in 1997 (in Europe), but 27 years later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-27-years-super-mario-64s-last-remaining-locked-door-has-finally-been-opened">its last remaining locked door has finally been opened</a>.

</p>
<p>
The first Super Mario Maker was released on WiiU in 2015 and was followed up by a Switch sequel in 2019. "A quirky and powerful construction toy that's fun to play with even if you aren't trying to make anything," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-maker-2-review-whether-youre-building-or-not-this-is-a-joy">Eurogamer Super Mario Maker 2 review</a>.

</p>
<p>
A 3D evolution would make a great addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Switch 2</a>, though don't expect that console until next year at least.

            <p>20 years after leaving Elder Scrolls, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-tips-guide">Starfield</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> makers Bethesda Game Studios, veteran writer and quest designer Douglas Goodall has returned to classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> with an expansive new quest mod.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54525?tab=description">Red Wisdom: An Ashlander Prophecy</a> - which features writing from Goodall under secret cyberpunk alias AFFA - offers players the chance to "Join forces with wide-eyed Nirani to unlock the hidden truths that lie within the sacred burial sites of the tribes." The project - which you can find over at NexusMods - is a collaboration with fellow modders Greatness7 and Melchior Dahrk. Melchior Dahrk especially looks to be an extremely prolific modder, with <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/MelchiorDahrk/mods?gameId=100">99 projects</a> under their belt, most of them for Morrowind. "Explore a new angle to Ashlander lore, confront wild beasts and Daedric interlopers, and piece together the puzzle which may shape the fate of Morrowind," the page continues. Here are some more details, straight from the Silt Strider’s proboscis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing by AFFA aka Douglas Goodall</li>
<li>Explore a brand new grotto used by the Ahemmusa tribe to "bury" their dead</li>
<li>Visit the exterior burial sites of the Erabenimsun and Zainab tribes</li>
<li>Collect four elemental-themed Ashlander trinkets - all with custom art</li>
<li>Experience new Ashlander lore through the trials of a young Wise Woman apprentice</li>
<li>Interoperability features like tooltips, achievements, graphic herbalism, and quest notification icons</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Goodall has previously released a <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/AFFA/mods?gameId=100">trio of smaller mods</a> for Morrowind, one of which added "about 30" low level quests. Cheers for the spot, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/20-years-after-quitting-bethesda-veteran-morrowind-dev-returns-to-the-funky-rpg-to-create-new-mods/">Games Radar</a>. Between the mod, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ardenfall">Ardenfall </a>demo, and the recently-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>, you can now spend the weekend pretending its 2002 again - one that contains the "Morrowind of another timeline," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-needs-a-morrowind-remake-when-you-can-explore-the-beautiful-nightmare-of-dread-delusion">reckons Brendy</a>. Two Morrowinds in the same timeline sounds like a paradox waiting to happen, but at least you’ll have options while history strains to reconfigure itself around you.</p>

        <p>The offer is reportedly expected to be £2.2 billion</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Keywords Studios has confirmed it's in "advanced discussions" with private equity firm EQT to buy the developer.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/75886c5a-0f4f-4573-8844-a62efd518a68">Financial Times</a>, the offer is expected to be £2.2 billion. EQT is negotiating a cash offer of £25.5 per share.</p>
<p>In a statement issued this morning, Keywords said EQT previously approached the studio with four "unsolicited proposals" which were rejected, but this one is a "significant increase" from the initial proposal, Keywords' board said, and one it "would be minded to recommend" to the company's shareholders.</p>
<p>For now, shareholders are "strongly advised to take no action."</p>
<p>The EQT Group has until June 15 to make a formal offer.</p>
<p>"The board remains confident in the company's growth strategy of building the only truly global platform providing solutions to the video games and entertainment industries, both organically and through acquisitions, and EQT is supportive of this strategy," the developer's board said.</p>
<p>Keyword Studios has grown its services empire significantly in recent years with a number of acquisitions, the most recent being the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/keywords-acquires-the-multiplayer-group-from-improbable-for-765m">purchase of The Multiplayer Guys from Improbable for £76.5 million</a>.</p>
<p>The company has over 70 facilities around the world, offering services such as QA, localisation, art, audio, marketing, and game development.</p>

        <p>But Digital segment beat all forecasts and expects 384% rise in profit next fiscal year</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Bandai Namco has released its full-year financial results, showing a solid year for its overall business in the face of declines from its video games segment.</p>
<p>The Japanese publisher recorded record high net sales of <strong> </strong>¥1.05 trillion ($6.74 billion) and saw full-year profit rise more than 12% to ¥101.4 billion ($651.4 million).</p>
<p>But while the Digital segment, which handles Bandai Namco's video game operations, saw both sales and profit fall year-on-year, all of its results were ahead of previous forecasts — by ¥5.2 billion ($33.4 million) in the case of profit.</p>
<p>The publisher expects a stronger performance from its video games business for the year ending March 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥1.05 trillion ($6.74 billion, up 6%)</li>
<li><strong>Operating profit: </strong>¥90.6 billion ($582 million, down 22%)</li>
<li><strong>Net profit: </strong>¥101.4 billion ($651.4 million, up 12.3%)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Digital (incl. video games)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥372.6 billion ($2.39 billion, down -3.4%%)</li>
<li><strong>Profit: </strong>¥6.2 billion ($39.8 million, down 87%)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>Bandai Namco reported "favourable sales" for its biggest home console releases, Armored Core 6 and Tekken 8, as well as strong contributions from its mobile apps, but noted that its PC online games fell short of their targets.</p>
<p>The publisher also noted that it recorded both a valuation loss and disposal loss during the fiscal year. This was due to a reevaluation of its title lineup in Digital, which was part of its current Mid-Term Plan to improve operating profitability.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the publisher has strong expectations for Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which releases on June 21, and teased that it will release "several new titles" in the second half, which should improve its performance in the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>Most of the growth for the fiscal year ended March 2024 came from its Toys &amp; Hobby segment, with sales of Gundam figures and new trading card games for One Piece and Dragon Ball cited as key successes.</p>
<p>Despite the declines in certain segments and overall operating profit, Bandai Namco beat its forecasts for total net sales, operating profit and net profit.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company expects to grow overall next year, although is forecasting a 20% drop in profits. However, its Digital profits are expected to increase by 384% year-on-year.</p>
<h2>The forecast</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥1.08 trillion ($6.9 billion, up 2.8%%)</li>
<li><strong>Operating profit: </strong>¥115 billion ($738.7 million, up 27%%)</li>
<li><strong>Net profit: </strong>¥81 billion ($520.3 million, down 20%)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Digital (incl. video games)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥370 billion ($2.38 billion, down -0.6%%)</li>
<li><strong>Profit: </strong>¥30 billion ($192.7 million, up 384%)</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-has-entered-adjustment-phase-voice-acting-and-motion-capture-finished/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2 has entered an adjustment phase that will last for roughly one year, according to creator Hideo Kojima.</p>
<p>That's what Kojima said during the most recent episode of his NHK radio show “Hideo Kojima’s Radio: Infinity” (<a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202405/5569" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> Famitsu, and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/death-stranding-2-filming-completed-according-to-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by Automaton Media). During the broadcast of the show's second episode, the legendary designer talked about the Death Stranding sequel and revealed that shooting and recording with the cast has been completed. In addition, Kojima mentioned that the game will now enter an adjustment phase, during which he and his team will be refining transitions between scenes and controls, as well as improving the game’s overall clarity and entertainment value.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is slated for</a> a release on PS5 sometime next year. An exact release date has yet to be announced. An exciting <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new trailer</a> for the game (including the confirmation of the 2025 release window) was released back in January of this year. Interestingly, during the NHK radio show broadcast, Kojima also talked about this trailer, and said that he wanted to show off the game's theme, overall look as well as gameplay. In addition, Kojima said that he wanted to show that the characters are connected to each other. We've included January's trailer, as debuted during PlayStation's State of Play event, below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 On The Beach - State of Play Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wbLstJHlC4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH sees Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Troy Baker return to Hideo Kojima’s genre defying universe. They will be joined by Elle Fanning, Shioli Kutsuna, and Academy Award-winning film director George Miller.<br>
</em><em>Hideo Kojima is joined by longtime collaborator Yoji Shinkawa who will direct character and mechanical design, with Ludvig Forssell and Kyle Cooper reprising their roles as musical director and title designer, respectively.</em></p>
<p>After various rumors, Death Stranding 2 was first teased during The Game Awards 2022. The game is the sequel to 2019's Death Stranding.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been just four days since Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR's CUT launched on PC, and already, it looks like another win for Sony.</p>
<p>Around twelve hours ago, SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2215430/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> a new concurrent player peak record for the game. At 77K users, Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR's Cut has surpassed Sony Santa Monica's God of War, which peaked at 75K. Of course, Helldivers 2 is in another league entirely with its peak of 458K concurrent users from three months ago. Then again, Helldivers 2 is a purely online game, a category that regularly dominates Steam charts. While Ghost of Tsushima offers a cooperative multiplayer mode called Legends, it was added for free post-launch as more of a thank-you for players. The game's meat and bones is the vast single player campaign.</p>
<p>User reception has also been favorable. 88% of the over nine thousand user reviews are positive, thanks to the polished port delivered by Nixxes. The game offers features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLAA</a>, NVIDIA Reflex, AMD FSR Frame Generation, and Intel XeSS. PC gamers can also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-dlss-upscaling-fsr-3-frame-gen-simultaneous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mix and match upscalers</a>; the creator of benchmarking software CapFrameX mentioned getting over 100FPS at 3840x1600 with an Intel Arc A770 card on High Settings, Intel XeSS set to Quality, and AMD FSR Frame Generation enabled.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with Ghost of Tsushima, here's what I thought of the game when I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed it</a> for PlayStation 4, rating it 9/10:</p>
<p><em>Ghost of Tsushima is Sucker Punch's best game yet and a great open world title capable of measuring to some of the biggest names in the genre. The excellent rendition of feudal Japan, along with its well-written characters and story, make Ghost of Tsushima stand out as the last must-have PlayStation 4 exclusive.</em></p>
<p>The game was also a great commercial success, selling nearly 10 million copies in the first two years after its debut on the console. John Wick director Chad Stahelski is even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directing a live-action adaptation</a>.</p>

            <p>This week on RPS: secret plans and clever tricks. Also, a bunch of new videogames, none of them particularly Enormous or Crocodilian. We open on Monday 20th May with the extremely Alice B-friendly combo of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521600/LittleKnown_Galaxy/">Little-Known Galaxy</a>, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-sweet-life-sim-is-stardew-meets-star-trek-and-you-can-try-the-demo-now">Stardew Valley meets Star Trek</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179170/A_Tower_Full_of_Cats/">A Tower Full Of Cats</a>, a hidden object puzzler featuring a tower full of dogs, I mean cats. All very upbeat. Well, hold that thought, because on the 21st, it's time for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a>, another slice of Celtic sort-of-psychosis from Ninja Theory, which is as grim as the accompanying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-trail">Paper Trail</a> is *checks Nic's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paper-trail-review">review</a>* incredibly annoying?</p> <!--more-->
<p>On 22nd May there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2153750/Venture_to_the_Vile/">Venture To The Vile</a>, a 2.5D metroidvania which is already doing a nice line in background animations and scenery, <a href="https://rkgk.com/">RKGK/Rakugaki</a>, a 3D platformer in which you are a graffiti artist tagging up a neo-brutalist city, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/isles-of-sea-and-sky">Isles Of Sea &amp; Sky</a>, which is Zelda but also sokoban. 23rd May introduces the long-anticipated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hauntii">Hauntii</a>, a ghostly twin-stick puzzle-shooter rendered in two-tone line art, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1658920/Crown_Wars_The_Black_Prince/">Crown Wars: The Black Prince</a>, which is sort of XCOM but French and from the 14th century. On the 24th, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2882440/DEVIL_BLADE_REBOOT/">a reboot of Devil Blade</a>, a 1996 shmup with a pretty glorious mix of sprites and 3D environments.</p>
<p>As ever, these recommendations are but the perishable emissions of our crumbling mortal intellects, and we have doubtless skimmed over one or more videogames of note. I trust you'll be getting all up in my grill about that in the comments. Also as ever, this week's videogames are manna for the Maw, that atrocious quantum edifice of famine and plunder, which we must once again try to appease by means of the below newsblog. I've been working on a glossary of Maw vocalisations. I'm pretty sure that "BZZTYGHTAHJHJ" is Mawese for "Fallout 5 release date", while "xh'nglar ghhgrhjw'nafh" means "is Wuthering Wave leftist" and "EEEEEEEEEEEEE" translates to "Microsoft opens new studio". Have a fun week all.</p>

    In a stunning coincidence primarily of interest to me only, Steam has 3 Legacy Of Kain Games for under a quid each, and GOG has the other (Blood Omen), also for under a quid - or around 85% off all round. With all the money you save, you could buy a beanbag to sit in and sulk about the lack of Soul Reaver 1.

			<p>The Dragon Ball Sparking Zero release date might very well have been leaked via Bandai Namco's own website.</p>
<p>Last week we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new rating</a> for the upcoming fighting title, which suggests that the game isn't that far out. Fast forward a couple of days and we might now have a more exact release date - October 1st, 2024. At least, that's what a datamine from Bandai Namco's website appears to hint at. As <a href="https://x.com/SrgioM3/status/1791878710162755999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by X user and YouTuber&nbsp;<span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/SrgioM3">@SrgioM3 </a>(and <a href="https://x.com/DbsHype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by X user @DbsHype), the publisher's website mentions an October 1st release for the game, which suggests that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero (from the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series) will be out in less than five months from now. We've included the video that @SrgioM3 made on the game's release date below:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="EXACT Release Date | Dragon Ball Z Sparking Zero (Datamine)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6u7BzD-OOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, this could merely be a placeholder date, but other entries in the series, including&nbsp;<span>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi (originally published as Dragon Ball Z: Sparking!),&nbsp;</span><span>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2, and&nbsp;</span><span id="Dragon_Ball_Z:_Budokai_Tenkaichi_3_(2007)">Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, were all released in October (in Japan). We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.</span></p>
<p>Sparking Zero, the newest entry in the Budokai Tenkaichi series was officially announced back in December of last year. The game will be powered by Unreal Engine 5, and is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (via Steam).</p>
<p>“This is the DRAGON BALL fighting game players have been waiting for, bringing a new sequel for one of the most beloved game series based on the franchise to a new generation of players,” said Mike Chang, VP of marketing and Digital Business, Bandai Namco Entertainment America Inc., upon the game's announcement. “It has been more than 15 years since DRAGON BALL Z: Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;pioneered arena brawlers, and&nbsp;DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO&nbsp;continues the legacy while adding new genre-defining features made possible only with the latest game platforms to deliver one of the most immersive anime game experiences of all time.”</p>
<p>We've included the announcement trailer alongside some of the game's main features below:</p>
<ul>
<li role="presentation">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO&nbsp;brings back the revered 3D action battle game series previously known as Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;in the West</li>
<li role="presentation">Arriving on new-gen consoles and PC, this is the first entry in the series since Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;3&nbsp;released in 2007 on PlayStation 2</li>
<li role="presentation">Engage in exhilarating battles with exceptional visual fidelity, fighting arenas with destructible environments, and an incredible roster of DRAGON BALL fighters</li>

<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Pokemon Company has revealed <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em>, the next set in the beloved TCG. This set will add a selection of new cards in August 2024, some of which were first seen in <em>The Hidden Treasures of Area Zero</em> DLCs. </p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"><em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> is set to add a bunch of new cards for competitive players to add to their decks and experiment with, as well as some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rarest-pokemon-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredibly desirable collectibles</a>. Perhaps most exciting of all, it’s going to add a new foil variant to shiny cards that are going to make foil pulls from packs even more exciting. All <em>Pokemon TCG</em> fans should be keeping an eye on this one because it’s going to really change the game when it drops. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-is-the-release-date-for-pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable" data-injectable="false">When is the release date for <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"><strong>The release date for the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> is August 2, 2024.</strong> This is when retailers will be able to sell products from the set, though there could be prerelease events leading up to that date that will allow fans to get their hands on cards early, depending on what their local game stores offer. </p>
 <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="151" data-injectable="false">The only exception to this is the <strong><em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> Booster Bundle, which will go on sale on September 6, 2024.</strong> </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What is the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set?</h2> <figure data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false"><strong>The <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set will introduce brand new aspects to the TCG, including Pecharunt.</strong> This Pokemon was originally discovered in <em>The Hidden Treasures of Area Zero</em> DLCs for <em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, and it’s coming to the TCG as a Darkness-Type. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">Players will be able to use Pecharunt ex to let them switch in another Darkness-Type Pokemon that’s currently benched with its Subjugating Chains ability. It can also be paired with the Pokemon you’ll recognize from when you first encountered it, Okidogi ex, Munkidori ex, and Fezandipiti ex for various combos. </p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">What I think might be the most exciting part of this set is the fact that it adds another unique foil pattern. These will still be Parallel Foils, but they’ll feature a new foil style surrounding the artwork of the card. You can check if you get one of these using the expansion code in the bottom left-hand corner of the card. It should show an illustrated white box with black text if it’s one of these new variants from the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Where to buy the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true"><strong>Your local game store is the best place to purchase any products from the <em>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Shrouded Fable</em> set.</strong> These stores help keep the game alive and offer exclusive opportunities to collectors. However, they’re not available to everyone, especially if you live out in the sticks like me. So, for those of you who need an online retailer, these are the best ones to use. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pokemon Center Online</a> (US &amp; UK)</strong>: The Pokemon Center Online is the most reliable retailer of <em>Pokemon TCG</em> products. It’s also a great place to check in for exclusive products that you might not be able to get elsewhere. I’ve seen particularly good deals on there from time to time, but they sell out fast. </li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.chaoscards.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chaos Cards</a> (US &amp; UK)</strong>: I’ve used Chaos Cards before for TCG products, and they’ve always delivered my goods on time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="467" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Learning the rules of how to play <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is all you need to do in order to have fun at most tables. But at some point in your journey as a Planeswalker, you may run into an opponent whose deck always has the upper hand against yours. This boils down to the balancing system within MTG, which, like many competitive games, is roughly based on a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” system. The concept is easy to follow, but it isn’t as simple as it sounds.</p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">In <em>Magic: The Gathering,</em> there are numerous <strong>deck archetypes</strong> that represent our rock, paper, and scissors. At the core of MTG (and other card and video games), there are three primary archetypes: Aggro, Control, and Combo. This guide will go over these three archetypes and the Keyword Abilities that contribute to their success. By the end, you’ll be able to identify the archetype of any given deck, along with its strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-three-core-deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-mtg" data-injectable="false">The three core deck archetypes in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG)</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Aggro</strong> (Aggressive) deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Starting with one of the easiest-to-understand archetypes, Aggro decks are everything that you think of when you hear “aggressive.” The strategy is to be in your opponent’s face, hitting hard and fast. To do this, Aggro decks primarily contain cards of the <strong>Red</strong> mana color due to its cheap creatures and<strong> Burn</strong> spells (such as Lightning Bolt) which are capable of dealing raw damage to any target.</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Some abilities that thrive in Aggro decks are <strong>Haste</strong>, <strong>Prowess</strong>, and <strong>Trample</strong>. These abilities allow creatures to dish out damage quickly and efficiently. Remember, the goal of an Aggro deck is to be fast and overwhelm your opponents before they have a chance to establish themselves. You’ll be looking to swing (attack) with all of your creatures in every combat phase, if possible.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="924" data-injectable="true">Although most Aggro decks in MTG use Red cards, that isn’t to say that other colors can’t be used to build aggressive decks. One of the weaknesses of Red cards is the lack of removal and denial options. Pairing Red with colors that cover its shortcomings, such as Black or Blue, will make for a slightly less aggressive but more well-rounded deck. The popular <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-magic-the-gathering-color-combination-names-explained/">Gruul Aggro combination</a> uses Red cards to establish an early board advantage and then uses enchants and +1/+1 counters from <strong>Green</strong> cards to form a powerful mid-game roster.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">If you can’t defeat your opponent quickly enough, your army of small creatures won’t be able to stand up against the fearsome monstrosities built by<strong> Ramp</strong> decks or the various gimmicks that <strong>Combo</strong> decks employ.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Combo</strong> deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Combo decks are the paper to Aggro decks’ rock, but that metaphor doesn’t paint the whole picture. Your strategy becomes a matter of putting together the pieces of a puzzle. Reliably drawing those pieces and defending your work in progress are the keys to being a successful Combo player. This is why Combo archetypes in MTG perform so well against Aggro strategies; There isn’t a fear of a Counterspell or Exile card awaiting your grand finale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Each Combo deck has an overall win condition, with most having a few lesser combos included. While there isn’t a particular color that is overrepresented in Combo decks, there are many boxes that need to be checked to succeed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="60" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">Helpful spells and abilities for Combo decks in MTG include:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Tutor </strong>cards allow you to search your library for specific card types.</li> <li>Spells or permanents with <strong>Hexproof</strong>, <strong>Indestructible</strong>, or <strong>Ward</strong>, which effectively increases the cost to target a permanent with spells or abilities.</li> <li>Triggers or abilities such as “enter the battlefield (ETB)” or “Whenever you…” provide a focus for the deck to be built around.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">An example of a win condition for a Combo deck would be <strong>Revel in Riches</strong>. By utilizing the <strong>Pirates</strong> tribe and their various means of <strong>Treasure</strong> generation or cards such as <strong>Brass’s Bounty</strong>, victory is easily attainable.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false"> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <figure><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> </figure> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">With an ideal starting hand, Combo decks easily spiral out of control and become a dominant force at the table– or simply win the game. But as we mentioned at the beginning of this guide, this concept is only simple on paper. While Combo strategies excel against Aggro decks, they fall victim to the disruption that <strong>Control </strong>archetypes specialize in. A simple Counterspell or various forms of removal could put a stop to a Combo deck before it has the chance to get the ball rolling.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><strong>Control</strong> deck archetypes in MTG</h3> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">With a Control deck, you’re disrupting the opponents’ strategy in every way that you can. This is done with <strong>Counterspells</strong>, forms of removal such as <strong>Destroy</strong> or <strong>Exile</strong> cards, or advanced strategies such as <strong>Mill</strong> or <strong>Discard</strong>. It’s because of these tools that Combo decks fear going up against Control decks.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Colors that are synonymous with Control decks are Blue, White, and Black. Each of these colors provides the means to put a stop to any deck strategy out there– so long as you have the cards in hand and mana to spare.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="62" data-injectable="false">Helpful spells and abilities for Control decks in MTG include:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Scry</strong> and <strong>Surveil</strong> cards along with sources of card <strong>Draw</strong> in order to keep a healthy amount of solutions in your hand to address any issues that arise.</li> <li>Removal cards range from soft-removal options such as <strong>Bounce</strong> (return target permanent to its owner’s hand) to hard-removal in the form of <strong>Destroy</strong> or <strong>Exile</strong> cards.</li> <li>Abilities that effectively increase the number of spells at your disposal. These would be Flashback or Magecraft spells or any card that allows you to “return Instant or Sorcery cards from your graveyard.”&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">But while Control decks seem to have all of the solutions for dealing with other deck archetypes, they struggle to close out games on their own. Control decks are notorious for running very few creatures, which greatly limits their offensive capabilities and makes defending those creatures a necessary task for victory. Many Control players resort to unconventional win conditions such as<strong> Laboratory Maniac</strong> or the various <strong>Jace Planeswalkers</strong> and their card drawing and milling mechanics.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Control decks can easily dismantle the strategies of Combo decks but struggle to keep up with the output of creatures and spells cast by Aggro players. Players of Control decks will frequently lose mana advantage to Aggro players due to the cost differences between the two. Eventually, Control players will run out of answers to Aggro players’ numerous questions, and defeat becomes inevitable.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Other deck archetypes in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG)</h2> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">Aggro, Combo, and Control archetypes are the foundation of many decks within MTG. There are a vast number of strategies that build off of one or a combination of multiple archetypes to create a unique playstyle. Archetypes such as <strong>Tempo</strong> or <strong>Midrange</strong> fuse the strategies of Aggro and Control decks but deploy them at opposing stages of the game.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Wizards of the Coast continues to expand the number of archetypes that exist in the game by<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/magic-the-gathering-ever-set-released/"> introducing new abilities with every set</a>. But at its core, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> will forever be one of the most captivating games of Rock, Paper, Scissors ever.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mw3-cut-credits-scene-surfaces/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Modern Warfare 3 (2011) was the ultimate ending to one of the greatest trilogies in the history of the franchise. It was a monumental run from start to finish, taking players from COD 4: Modern Warfare in 2007 to the grand finale in 2011’s MW3. In the middle, we were blessed to receive Modern Warfare 2, widely considered to be the best Call of Duty game ever (perhaps behind Black Ops).</p>



<p>Now, thirteen years after Modern Warfare 3 was released, a cut post-credits scene has emerged online, showcasing a subtle change that brings about a massively different ending for the 2011 game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-small-but-mighty">Small but Mighty</h2>



<p>At the end of Modern Warfare 3, Captain Price finally thwarts Vladimir Makarov, securing justice in the most poetic (and brutal) way possible. As he sits back and marvels at his work, he pulls out his trademark cigar, lights up, and then the screen fades to black, with the game simply drifting away, marking an end to the trilogy.</p>



<p>However, in the new clip that has surfaced online – which is a total of 60 seconds long – we see the same sequence unfold, but there are a couple of minor differences.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MW3 Cut Post-Credits Scene (4K)" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/De7Axarv12E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Across the room, we see a shadowy, suited figure appear, which many have claimed is a representation of Death. His identity is never confirmed as he looks at the scene before him and walks off, with Captain Price losing grip of his cigar and having it roll to the floor, before again, the game fades into darkness. We then see a picture of the four key characters we followed through the trilogy, which is a nod to the fact that they’ve all met their untimely end.</p>



<p>Only Infinity Ward knows the identity of this figure, as the content was ultimately cut from the game and never saw the light of day – until now.</p>

<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">“In from the Cold” is a level 83 MSQ quest in Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, which involves you playing not as yourself but as an Unknown Imperial who needs to get back to Camp Broken Glass within a specified time limit. It’s a challenging quest but also incredibly memorable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">To complete “In from the Cold”, you’ll need to make your way back to Camp Broken Glass very slowly, navigating the unfamiliar Garlean streets while trying to avoid as much conflict as possible. I’d recommend setting aside roughly 45 minutes to an hour to complete this quest.</p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">You do not, by default, have any health regeneration during this quest, although you can rarely find potions that grant a five-minute regeneration buff. You can also find Med Kits, which will restore 35% of the Unknown Imperial’s maximum HP, but you can only carry a certain number of these at any one time. Both of these items can be found by interacting with the many clickable elements encountered during the quest.</p>
 <h2 id="h-getting-to-know-the-unknown-imperial" data-injectable="false">Getting to know the Unknown Imperial</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">After you’re transported into the body of the Unknown Imperial, you’ll lose all of your regular abilities and have to quickly get acquainted with some new ones. For those who regularly play as a Tank Job, particularly Paladin, these will be familiar:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Fight or Flight:</strong> <ul> <li>Increases weapon damage by 25% for 25 seconds. Has a 60-second cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Fast Blade:</strong> <ul> <li>A sword weapon skill that executes an attack at 200 potency.&nbsp;</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Riot Blade:&nbsp;</strong> <ul> <li>Deals damage to a single target with 170 potency, increasing to 300 potency when used after Fast Blade.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Rage of Halone:</strong> <ul> <li>Paladin Job skill which delivers an attack with 100 potency, increasing to 330 potency when used after Riot Blade.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Rampart:</strong> <ul> <li>Reduces incoming damage by 10% for 20 seconds. Has a 90-second cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="h-surviving-your-first-enemy-encounter" data-injectable="false">Surviving your first enemy encounter</h2> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">To begin with, you’ll only have a time limit of 25 minutes to reach Camp Broken Glass, although this will change as you progress through the quest. While you should avoid as much conflict as you can during this quest, some enemies need to be fought, and the first one is just ahead and to the East.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">The most challenging part of this first fight is the fact that you don’t regenerate health, so the biggest piece of advice I can give is to avoid any telegraphed attacks and make sure you use Fight or Flight and Rampart whenever they’re available.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="197" data-current-count="197" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve defeated this soldier, interact with his corpse to find a Med Kit and use it to restore some of the health you lost during the fight, then interact with it again to pay your respects.</p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">After this encounter, you’ll be warned that in order to survive, you’ll need to avoid any unwanted attention. With this in mind, you now need to find a way out of the first area you find yourself in.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-get-the-magitek-reaper-in-working-order" data-injectable="false">Get the Magitek Reaper in working order</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">Head South and interact with the Immobilized Magitek Reaper (X:23.6, Y:16.9). Doing this will allow you to progress by unlocking the next two things you need to do. While you’re in the area, make sure to interact with the Wrecked Magitek Reaper (X:25.4, Y:16.5) to loot a Med Kit.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">Next, head to one of the buildings to the West of the Immobilized Magitek Reaper and interact with him. He’ll give you the identification key required to use the Immobilized Magitek Reaper, but you’ll need some fuel if you’re hoping to get it working again.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">To find the fuel, in the form of a Ceruleum Tank, head to the East and find the Fuel-concealing Wreckage (X:27.4, Y:13.4). Interacting with this wreckage will provide you with a Ceruleum Tank, but this poses a problem – you’ll enter into Transporting mode and, while carrying the Tank, you’ll be unable to use any of the Unknown Imperial’s abilities.</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">If you take any damage while Transporting the Tank, you will drop it and have to defeat the threat. Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to pick it up again and continue onwards towards the Magitek Reaper. Interact with it while holding the Ceruleum Tank, and you’ll now have a fully operational Reaper.</p> <h2 id="h-use-the-repaired-magitek-reaper-to-clear-the-way-forwards" data-injectable="false">Use the repaired Magitek Reaper to clear the way forwards</h2> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Now that you can use the Reaper to assist you in your journey back to Camp Broken Glass, you’ll have three new abilities to become familiar with, all of which do 5,000 damage each and are enough to one-shot each of the enemies you’ll encounter during the coming sequence:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Magitek Cannon</strong> <ul> <li>Ground-target AoE with a short cast time and no cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Diffractive Magitek Cannon</strong> <ul> <li>Line-attack AoE, which has a short cast time and a short cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>High-power Magitek Cannon</strong> <ul> <li>A much larger AoE variation of Magitek Cannon, which has a short cooldown.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">There will be multiple mobs of Magitek units which need to be defeated. Some of these will come in waves, meaning you’ll need to pay attention and adjust yourself accordingly:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Large mobs of units to the West, in front of the curtain of light blocking your way. Any attack is appropriate to take these out pretty efficiently.</li> <li>Mobs of 5-7 Magitek Slasher units in the center of the area. Use Magitek Cannon to focus an attack to take them down.</li> <li>Magitek Vanguards which spawn and use telegraphed abilities, which need to be avoided before taking out the Vanguards. The larger, High-power Magitek Cannon is perfect to defeat these.</li> <li>Magitek Death Claws will slowly approach in a line. Use Diffractive Magitek Cannon to take out the line in one shot.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve defeated all of the different waves of enemies, you’ll be able to dismount the Magitek Reaper and make your way past the now-disappeared curtain of light. Once you’re through, two Tempered Imperial Soldiers will appear, but these can be avoided pretty easily by simply walking behind them to avoid drawing attention to yourself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false">Make your way South and then West, moving under the broken segments where a bridge used to be, to get to the next challenge.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-protect-the-imperial-citizens" data-injectable="false">Protect the Imperial Citizens</h2> <figure data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">There’s a lot of local wildlife in the next area who are attacking some Imperial Citizens. You’ll need to defeat these creatures while continuing your journey North West. Thankfully, you’re unlikely to draw any aggro from these creatures as they’re pretty focused on their original targets, so you can take them out pretty easily.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="49" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">The types of enemies you’ll need to defeat are:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"> <li>Morozko</li> <li>Ceruleum Zoblyn</li> <li>Almasty</li> <li>Eblan Bear</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">While you can fight these creatures in any order, I’d recommend taking out the bigger ones first, as they’re likely to do more damage to the people you’re trying to protect. You’ll also be helped by some other civilians.</p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">After defeating the creatures and heading further North, you’ll encounter some more enemies. This time, you’ll have to defeat some Corrupted and Transformed Imperial Soldiers. The best method to do this is by focusing your attention on the Transformed Imperial Soldiers, because the civilians with you have entered a Magitek Reaper to take on the Corrupted Soldier.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">At some point during this battle, the Corrupted Imperial will explode with a telegraphed AoE. You can avoid death by finding the safe spot behind the Magitek Reaper and sheltering there, but you won’t get out of this unscathed.</p> <h2 id="h-drag-yourself-to-safety" data-injectable="false">Drag yourself to safety&nbsp;</h2> <figure data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">The blast from the Corrupted Soldier will render you unconscious for a short while, with the screen going black. Don’t worry, you haven’t failed, this was supposed to happen.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">When you wake up, you’ll immediately be thrown into an Active Time Event. During this, you’ll need to quickly and repeatedly press any button you have at your disposal in order to remain conscious and drag yourself away from the battle. You start off going very slowly as you’re weighed down with debuffs, but as these drop off you do pick up some speed. Thankfully, you don’t have to do this for the entire distance to Camp Broken Glass, just to the end of the street. This can take roughly ten seconds, so avoid hand cramps by alternating hands.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed the Active Time Event, a cutscene will play and then you’ll wake up in your own body, free to talk to Alisaie in order to complete “In from the Cold”.</p>

			<p>Chinese developer Game Science has published a short but sweet new trailer for its debut action RPG title, Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>As you might remember, the game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in August 2020 with a gorgeous video that showcased 13 minutes of gameplay. However, at that time, Game Science admitted there was still a lot of work to do, and the video was meant more as a recruiting tool than anything else.</p>
<p>In early 2021, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-new-trailer-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that the team was targeting a 2023 release window. At Gamescom 2021, Game Science <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-unreal-engine-5-ray-tracing-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> Black Myth: Wukong was being made with Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Eventually, the development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-is-the-first-2023-game-to-be-delayed-to-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> their debut title to 2024, and we now know the game is set to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-august-20-launch-date-and-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 20</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reveals-star-wars-outlaws-black-myth-wukong-and-naraka-bladepoint-are-all-getting-dlss-3-and-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support</a> NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 (including Ray Reconstruction) and full path tracing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong - WeGame Tonight 2024 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpH2sUkdRE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by Journey to the West, the Chinese novel published in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty and attributed to Wu Cheng'en. It is considered one of the greatest Classic Chinese Novels and may even be the most popular Asian novel of all time.</p>
<p>As the Destined One, players will roam through a land steeped in mythology, encountering various powerful foes. Players will also master various staff techniques and freely combine different spells, abilities, weapons, and equipment to find the winning strategy that best suits their combat style.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-assassins-creed-shadows-editions-and-where-to-buy-them/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-assassins-creed-shadows-editions-and-where-to-buy-them<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since Ubisoft released the original <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, there has been a plethora of special editions of every entry. As a fan who adores the franchise, I find it pretty expensive to pick up all the editions, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is no exception. </p> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">When <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/assassins-creed-shadows-carves-a-bloody-path-through-feudal-japan-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft revealed <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, it was ready to go with all of the game’s special editions. Within minutes, you could find every digital edition and start seeking out the physical ones if you knew where to look. Unfortunately, Ubisoft has a habit of making exclusive deals with specific retailers, meaning you need to buy a few copies of the game if you want to collect every edition. </p>
 <h2 id="h-every-edition-of-assassin-s-creed-shadows-and-where-to-buy-them" data-injectable="false">Every edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and where to buy them</h2> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Below, I’ve listed all the editions of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> you can buy and where you can get them. I’ll keep the list up to date as new retailers pop up because products like the Collector’s Edition can come to certain regions, such as the UK, pretty late. Note that all editions are available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S except the Collector’s Edition, which has no Xbox version. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Standard Edition (physical &amp; digital)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">The Standard Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is the base game and nothing more. While looking around, I couldn’t even see any pre-order bonuses for this edition. That might even be to its detriment because most retailers selling a physical copy of the game are selling a more premium version. The only exception is GameStop in the US, which charges the same price for the box with no bonuses.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">This is the edition to get if you’re not bothered by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-locking-dlc-behind-season-passes-isnt-anything-new-but-it-still-sucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extra quests locked behind pre-orders or season passes</a>. The issue is, you’ll be spending as much on this version of the game as you will one that comes with a free steelbook. However, if you have a digital-only console, it’s the cheapest version available to you at $69.99/£69.99 on all digital storefronts.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Standard Edition with Free Steelbook (physical-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via The Game Collection</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">One of the best physical editions of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ Standard Edition is available with a free steelbook case. It costs about the same as the digital-only Standard Edition once you take shipping into account, but you get a shiny steelbook to add to your collection. </p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">This isn’t something I’d usually go in for because you get the steelbook with the Collector’s Edition, though this one appears to be a retailer exclusive. However, if you don’t want to spend that much, this will cost you £56.95 from <a href="https://www.thegamecollection.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Collection</a> in the UK. I can’t find a listing in the US, but I’ve seen that this sort of exclusive deal is traditionally something <a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart</a> would do.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Special Edition (physical-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via GAME</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Strangely, the Special Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is cheaper than the Standard Edition, but you will need to take shipping into account, which could round it back up. However, I’d say it’s worth the price because not only do you get the physical boxed copy, but you also get the pre-order bonus quest, Thrown to the Dogs, and the Yasuke Sekiryu Character Pack. This pack contains an exclusive gear set, mount, trinket, and weapon. </p>
 <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="202" data-injectable="false">This edition is exclusive to <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GAME</a> in the UK and costs £64.99. I can’t find a US listing for it, but you can also get the bonuses from this edition in the Ultimate and Collector’s Editions. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Limited Edition (physical-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">The Limited Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is Amazon’s exclusive version of the game. It contains everything the Special Edition does, except its Sekiryu Character Pack is for Naoe, not Yasuke. As with the Special Edition, this character pack is also available in the Ultimate and Collector’s Editions, but not the box that says “Limited Edition” on it, which is what you’re really buying this edition for. </p>
 <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="159" data-injectable="false">The Limited Edition costs $69.99/£64.99 and is widely available on your regional version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ref=nav_logo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>. It is probably the best value-for-money pick on the list. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Gold Edition (physical &amp; digital)</h3> <figure data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via GAME</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">The Gold Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is where things start to get interesting. It packs in the base game, the pre-order bonus quest, three days of early access, and the game’s season pass. That season pass entitles you to two upcoming expansions and another exclusive mission. </p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">This edition is available on all digital storefronts for $109.99/£94.99. You can also purchase a physical version of the Gold Edition from GAME in the UK or Amazon worldwide for roughly $5/£5 less, but you’ll need to factor in shipping. As with the other physical editions, I’d say this one is worth getting a boxed copy of for the case and accompanying DLC notes. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Ultimate Edition (digital-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">This is the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game I’ve seen in a long time without a physical version of the Ultimate Edition you can buy separately. While it’s digital-only and will cost you $114.99/$129.99 on all digital storefronts, it’s got a lot of content in it.</p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">The Ultimate Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> contains the base game, the pre-order bonus quest, season pass, three days of early access, and the Ultimate Pack. This pack contains the Sekiryu Character Pack for both Yasuke and Naoe mentioned in other editions, as well as the Red Dragon filter for Photo Mode and five additional character skill points. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Collector’s Edition (physical-only)</h3> <figure data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via GAME</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">The Collector’s Edition of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is a thing of beauty. It includes everything in the Ultimate Edition. In fact, it’s the only way to get a boxed version of that edition, as well as a host of physical goodies. These are as follows. </p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Ultimate Edition physical case</li> <li>Collector’s Edition steelbook (different from the TGC one)</li> <li>Naoe’s Katana Tsuba</li> <li>Replica World Map</li> <li>Collector’s World Map</li> <li>Creed Wall Scroll</li> <li>2 Sumi Lithographs</li> <li>Naoe &amp; Yasuke Statue</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="124" data-injectable="false">This edition is the most expensive of them all, costing £239.99 from UK retailer GAME and $279.99 from <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/">GameSto</a><a href="https://www.gamestop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">p</a> in the US. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What do you need to buy to own everything for<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">You need to buy the following editions to own everything you can possibly get for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, both in-game and physical collector’s items. </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> with TGC Exclusive Free Steelbook</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Special Edition</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Limited Edition</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Gold Edition (physical)</li> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Collector’s Edition</li> </ul> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="false">If you want to save some money, you could wait until after the game’s release, early 2025, to pick up the cheaper physical editions at a discount. I don’t see them retaining their value, but the Collector’s Editions always do. It’s worth remembering that for the Special Edition, Limited Edition, and Gold Editions, you’re only after the cases, so you can buy very used copies to complete your set.</p>

<p data-characters="271" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">FromSoftware has revealed one of the new foes players will meet in <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC. While it’s currently unknown if this character is a boss or a regular enemy, fans are already hard at work trying to figure out what or who they may be.</p> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">The latest in what fans know to be a<em> </em>very long line of unsettling <em>Elden Ring</em> enemies was revealed to us in a post on FromSoftware’s official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1791468858106069215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em> X/Twitter</a> account. The enemy, partially obscured by a cloak of ominous shadows, leaves quite the first impression. With its lifeless grey skin, wicked twin crescent blades, and cracked golden mask, this enemy looks like it stepped straight out of a nightmare just to cut you to ribbons.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">Within minutes of this absolute nightmare’s grand unveiling, the <em>Elden Ring</em> fandom came together to speculate over what, or who, it could be. <em>Elden Ring</em> loves to hide hints about its character’s origins and alignment within their designs, and players were quick to form theories about this masked ghoul.</p>
 <h2 id="h-new-elden-ring-enemy-may-be-an-omen-of-things-to-come-in-shadow-of-the-erdtree" data-injectable="false">New Elden Ring enemy may be an omen of things to come in Shadow of the Erdtree</h2> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">One of the most popular theories is that this enemy is related to the Omens, bloated, axe-wielding giants who pop up in several areas of the Lands Between. In addition to their massive size, Omens are known for the gigantic horns sprouting from their heads, which look <em>very </em>similar to the ones featured in the new enemy’s rent mask. Coincidences don’t happen often in <em>Elden Ring’s </em>visual design, so this new opponent is likely connected to the Omens somehow.</p>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">Fans were also quick to notice another interesting detail: this new enemy is female, or at the very least, has feminine features. X user SweetPeachGames noted<a href="https://twitter.com/SweetPeachGames/status/1791469391336427744"> in this post</a> that the enemy’s feet were distinctly feminine, with smaller toes and a curved instep. </p> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Other users noticed that the creature casts a distinctly uterine silhouette. Motherhood, blood ties, and birth are significant themes in <em>Elden Ring</em>, so I’d feel safe betting that this was an intentional decision by the designers.</p>
 <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Visions of dancer <a href="https://t.co/Mm7Dup4LBd">pic.twitter.com/Mm7Dup4LBd</a></p>— Syrobe (@SyrobeNA) <a href="https://twitter.com/SyrobeNA/status/1791565173473624117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">Another unsettling detail about this creature is that it’s <em>much taller </em>than it initially appears. By brightening the image, players discovered that the enemy has a hunched back, which means it will likely raise itself to its full height when players encounter it. This revelation drew X user <a href="https://x.com/SyrobeNA/status/1791565173473624117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Syrobe</a> to compare the new enemy and <em>Dark Souls III’</em>s Dancer of the Boreal Valley.</p> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="false"><em>Elden Ring Shadows of the Erdtree</em> is coming out on June 21, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/complete-guide-to-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=complete-guide-to-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Whether you’re looking to level up in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> or hoping to get your hands on some exclusive items, you shouldn’t overlook Wondrous Tails. It can seem pretty confusing at first, but once you’re used to it, it’s a quick and easy thing to tick off your weekly checklist.</p> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Wondrous Tails is a combination of incentive to run duties you might not have run for a while, and also a game of luck. For each successfully completed duty, you earn a stamp on a grid and if you’re lucky enough to get four stamps in a line, you get more worthwhile rewards. Completing nine duties guarantees you at least 50% of a level. That’s the TLDR; now let’s get into the details.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to unlock Wondrous Tails in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="83" data-current-count="83" data-injectable="false">Before you can unlock Wondrous Tails, you’ll need to have met a few requirements:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false"> <li>Have access to Idyllshire, which unlocks during the MSQ at level 58</li> <li>Be at least level 60 in any Disciple of War or Magic Job</li> </ul> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">If you’ve met these requirements, head to Idyllshire and pick up the quest called “Keeping Up with the Aliapohs” from the Unctuous Adventurer (X:7.0, Y:5.9). It’s a pretty easy quest; all you need to do is introduce yourself to Khloe Aliapoh. She’s a young Mi’qote who wants to hear all about your adventures, providing you with a journal to complete each week.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Khloe can be found in the same booth as the Faux Commander, so while you’re here, you may as well unlock <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/complete-faux-hollows-ffxiv-guide-how-to-unlock-unreal-trials-and-rewards/">Faux Hollows</a> while you’re here.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-play-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to play Wondrous Tails in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Each week, after the weekly reset happens, you can head to Idyllshire and pick up a new journal from Khloe (X:5.7, Y:6.1), which will then be stored within the Key Items tab of your inventory. Inside, there are two pages. The left page is the list of duties you can complete to earn seals, and the right side is the grid where these seals will be placed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">You can either complete nine individual listed duties to earn your seals or use your Second Chances to re-run the same duty repeatedly. Each time you complete a listed duty, you’ll earn a seal which will be randomly placed on the grid on the right side page of the journal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">The very good news is that, as long as the duty is not from the current expansion, you can run any of the duties unsynced. This is especially useful for low level content, such as the level 50 Extreme Trials, allowing you to get seals very quickly. I won’t go into too much detail about the duties that can be included, but the duties always include the following to choose from:</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true"> <li>Three Dungeons of any level</li> <li>One level 90 Dungeon</li> <li>Two level 50 Extreme Trials</li> <li>Two <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-every-alliance-raid-ffxiv/">Alliance Raids</a></li> <li>Three <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-ffxiv-raid-unlock-guide-coil-alexander-omega-eden-pandaemonium/">Normal Raids</a></li> <li>Five duties which can include any of the following types of content: <ul> <li>The Coils of Bahamut</li> <li>Extreme Raids at level 60 or above</li> <li>PvP</li> <li>Treasure Hunt</li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-deep-dungeon-how-to-unlock-palace-of-the-dead/">Deep Dungeons</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed nine duties, you’ll be able to hand your journal back into Khloe and claim your prizes and EXP. You have two weeks to complete the nine duties, and if you run out of time, you’ll have to pick up a fresh journal.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-earn-and-use-second-chances-for-wondrous-tails-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to earn and use Second Chances for Wondrous Tails in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve unlocked Wondrous Tails, you’ll start to earn Second Chances. These are earned every time you complete any duty within the game if one or more members of the party are new to the duty. You don’t need to currently possess a journal in order to earn second chances and you can have a maximum of nine Second Chances at any one time.</p> <p data-characters="42" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Second Chances can be used for two things:</p> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Action</strong></td><td><strong>Points needed</strong></td><td><strong>What it does</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Retry</td><td>1</td><td>Restores the status of a duty that has already been completed, allowing you to re-run it. Also removes one of the other duties.</td></tr><tr><td>Shuffle</td><td>2</td><td>When you have between 3 and 7 seals, you can use this to shuffle their positions on the grid.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking to complete a journal quickly, using Retry will allow you to re-run relatively low-level content, such as the level 50 extreme trials. As you need to complete nine duties to complete a journal and you have nine Second Chances, you can run the same content nine times.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Shuffle should be used if you’re having remarkably bad luck, as it might offer a chance to get three lines, which means you get the most worthwhile rewards when handing a journal back to Khloe. However, as this costs two points, you may need to run multiple different duties as a result.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-wondrous-tails-rewards-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">Wondrous Tails rewards in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-rewards-for-filling-out-a-journal" data-injectable="false"><strong>Rewards for filling out a journal</strong></h3> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">If you’ve completed nine duties and collected nine seals, you can hand it back to Khloe to receive your rewards. What you get depends on where your seals fell, with rewards increasing in value depending on how many lines you manage to get.</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>No. of lines</strong></td><td><strong>Rewards</strong></td></tr><tr><td>None(9 seals collected)</td><td>Guaranteed 50% of a level<br>Select one of the following:<br>– 1 Allagan Platinum Piece (10,000 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-gil-without-crafting-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">Gil</a>)<br>– 500 Allagan Tomestones of Poetics<br>– 1 Timeworn Ophiotauroskin Map</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Guaranteed 50% of a level<br>Select one of the following:<br>– 1 MGP Gold Card (30,000 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-way-to-get-mgp-ffxiv/">MGP</a>)<br>– 1 Khloe’s Bronze Certificate of Commendation<br>– 300 weekly capped Tomestones (currently Comedy)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Guaranteed 50% of a level<br>Select one of the following:<br>– 2 MGP Platinum Cards (100,000 MGP total)<br>– 1 Khloe’s Silver Certificate of Commendation<br>– 1000 uncapped Tomestones (currently Causality)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Guaranteed 50% of a level<br>Select one of the following:<br>– 20 MGP Platinum Cards (1,000,000 MGP total)<br>– 3 Khloe’s Silver Certificate of Commendation<br>– 1 Khloe’s Gold Certificate of Commendation</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p data-characters="263" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dead-by-daylight-chaos-shuffle-modifier-release-date-and-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chaos Shuffle Modifier Event</a></em> in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> brings a brand new game mode for players to dive into that changes the rules in a massive way. Not only is it a nice change of pace, but you can earn some great rewards by completing its Event Tome challenges. </p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Many of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>‘s events have their own Event Tome, but <em>Chaos Shuffle</em> is something special. It’s a Modifer, meaning it’s an entirely new game mode with some big changes to the standard Trial formula that make it a bit more of a challenge to complete challenges in. However, if you know what you’re doing, you’ll find these challenges pretty easy to bash out in one afternoon. </p>

The Event Tome is only available between May 16 to 23, 2024, so you’ll need to complete it quickly if you want to grab every reward on offer. Note that all of these challenges must be completed in the Chaos Shuffle Modifier playlist.</p>

 <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">These time-limited rewards are the best of the best for me because they won’t come around again.

 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">To make sure you’re playing <em>Chaos Shuffle</em> in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, you need to select the <em>Chaos Shuffle</em> mode from the home screen. It enters you into separate queues to play, which helps keep the standard Trial queue free of players who may not know what Perks they’re running. </p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="false">Of course, that’s the twist with <em>Chaos Shuffle</em>. It chooses four random Perks for you, so you have no idea which Perks you’re using in the Trial. It keeps things very interesting because you can’t simply lean on your usual strategies. You need to play to win.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-alhaitham-builds-in-genshin-impact/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-alhaitham-builds-in-genshin-impact<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="222" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Alhaitham is a 5-star Dendro DPS character in <em>Genshin Impact</em>. From his signature Light of Folar Incision to the budget-friendly Harbinger of Dawn, here are the best weapons and artifacts to make Alhaitham a formidable DPS.</p> <h2 id="h-best-weapons-for-alhaitham" data-injectable="false">Best weapons for Alhaitham</h2> <h3 id="h-light-of-foliar-incision" data-injectable="false">Light of Foliar Incision</h3> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false"><strong>Light of Foliar Incision is Alhaitham’s signature 5-star Sword and his best-in-slot.</strong> However, its advantage over other 5-star weapons is fairly small. I only recommend pulling for this weapon if you don’t have any of the other 5-star Swords below and don’t want to use a 4-star option.</p> <h3 id="h-primordial-jade-cutter-uraku-misugiri" data-injectable="false">Primordial Jade Cutter / Uraku Misugiri</h3> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">These two 5-star Swords are almost as good as Alhaitham’s signature if you happen to have them already. They offer high CRIT stats and passives that are at least somewhat usable. Consider a Geo teammate if using Uraku Misugiri, particularly <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli</a>.</p>
 <h3 id="h-mistsplitter-reforged-haran-geppaku-futsu-splendor-of-tranquil-waters" data-injectable="false">Mistsplitter Reforged / Haran Geppaku Futsu / Splendor of Tranquil Waters</h3> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">These 5-star Swords perform fairly similarly. They each have desirable CRIT stats, and Alhaitham can generally make use of their passive effects. Splendor of Tranquil Waters requires an HP-draining teammate to trigger its passive consistently. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-furina-builds-weapons-teams-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Furina</a> is currently the best teammate for this purpose.</p> <figure data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-wolf-fang-the-black-sword" data-injectable="false">Wolf-Fang / The Black Sword</h3> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Both of the 4-star Swords from the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-genshin-impact-battle-pass-weapons-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> are useful for Alhaitham. Wolf-Fang is the better of the two, especially with Refinements. At Refinement Rank 5, Wolf-Fang can perform better than some of the 5-stars above. This does, however, require you to buy the Battle Pass five times. You should weigh whether the $50 fixed cost is worth it for you.</p> <h3 id="h-toukabou-shigure-iron-sting" data-injectable="false">Toukabou Shigure / Iron Sting</h3> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">Toukabou Shigure and Iron Sting are the free-to-play 4-star options. Despite being obtainable for free, they’re not bad at all. Toukabou Shigure was a past event weapon, but Iron Sting can still be crafted for free using billets. Iron Sting Refinements improve Alhaitham’s damage by a small amount; there’s no need to use precious billets on them unless you want to.</p>
 <h3 id="h-harbinger-of-dawn" data-injectable="false">Harbinger of Dawn</h3> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">Harbinger of Dawn is a 3-star Sword, but it still provides value with its hefty CRIT stat and useful passive effect. Harbinger of Dawn is only worth using if you can consistently keep Alhaitham above 90% HP. If you can keep the passive up, Harbinger of Dawn can perform better than the 4-star options above. However, this may not be feasible with Furina or in Bloom-based teams.</p> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-artifact-sets-for-alhaitham" data-injectable="false">Best artifact sets for Alhaitham</h2> <h3 id="h-4pc-gilded-dreams" data-injectable="false">4pc Gilded Dreams</h3> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Gilded Dreams is Alhaitham’s best artifact set for his personal damage</strong>, assuming he has a teammate who can hold 4pc Deepwood Memories. This set gives a variable amount of Elemental Mastery and ATK, depending on his teammate composition. Luckily for Alhaitham, both of those stats are useful to him.</p> <h3 id="h-4pc-deepwood-memories" data-injectable="false">4pc Deepwood Memories</h3> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">If Alhaitham is the only Dendro character on the team, or if no one else can hold 4pc Deepwood Memories, then Alhaitham should hold it himself.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-rolling-out-steam-integration-in-cars">Less than 18 months after it was first rolled out</a>, Tesla is allegedly pulling Steam support from its vehicles.</p>
<p>Back in December 2022, Tesla confirmed games like Cuphead, Sonic, and Cyberpunk 2077 could be played as part of a native beta Steam app in the company's S and X models.</p>

<p>Now, according to <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/17/tesla-drops-steam-gaming-support-inside-vehicles/">Electrek</a>, the company is seemingly reversing that decision.</p>
<p>"Tesla is updating the gaming computer in your Model X, and your vehicle is no longer capable of playing Steam games," Tesla said in a brief statement sent to customers awaiting delivery of their S and X models (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tesla-is-dropping-steam-support-inside-its-new-cars/">VGC</a>). "All other entertainment and app functionalities are unaffected."</p>
<p>There's been no confirmation on why the functionality has been dropped, but it's thought existing Tesla owners already using the app are unaffected. 

</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-investigated-by-us-regulators-for-letting-drivers-play-games">Tesla was investigated by the US National Highways annd Traffic Safety Administration back in 2021</a> over its Passenger Play feature. Tesla responded by making Passenger Play "unusable" whilst the car is in motion, restricting Steam's functionality so it could only be used when the car was parked or being charged.</p>

<p data-characters="247" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The official <em>Fortnite</em> Twitter account has teased an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-is-teasing-a-fallout-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming <em>Fallout</em> collaboration</a>. By most accounts, more <em>Fallout</em> is a good thing, but for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76</a></em> players, it’s a bittersweet reminder of the battle royale mode their game lost years ago. </p> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true"><em>Fortnite</em> has seen crossover events with a massive roster of huge franchises, including heavy-hitters like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Stranger Things</em>. Now, thanks in part, I’m sure, to the success of Amazon’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallouts-tv-debut-is-a-hit-but-it-doesnt-guarantee-an-elder-scrolls-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout TV Show</a></em>, the game is getting a <em>Fallout</em> crossover that will undoubtedly see new mechanics based on the <em>Fallout</em> universe introduced to <em>Fortnite</em> for a few weeks alongside skins players must earn during that season if they want to keep them forever. </p>
 <h2 id="h-fallout-in-fortnite-isn-t-what-fallout-76-players-want" data-injectable="false">Fallout in Fortnite isn’t what Fallout 76 players want</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true"><em>Fallout</em> skins in <em>Fortnite</em> aren’t what all <em>Fallout</em> fans want, though. You see, <em>Fallout 76</em> had a battle royale mode once called <em>Nuclear Winter</em>. When it was initially released, I remember it feeling fairly out of place because the premise was pretty weak, but the gameplay, rewards, and lore were engrossing. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">At the time of writing, others who remember and played the game mode, and even those who jumped into the game after it was closed and have only seen screenshots or videos of it, are lightly lamenting its loss and wondering if there’s any space for it to return. </p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Creator <a href="https://x.com/LyleShnub/status/1791936399790239860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frederick on Twitter</a> points out the fun and flaws of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s <em>Nuclear Winter</em>. “It was a weird and unique experiment that re-invented the way you thought about the game’s systems and world. It was also bad, lol.” </p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">I can’t deny that this game mode was bad, but not for the reasons you might think. As it does for most franchises, Battle Royale works for <em>Fallout</em>, but Nuclear Winter didn’t work for <em>Fallout 76</em> because it was implemented very quickly. It felt very much like Bethesda saw <em>Fortnite</em>‘s success, decided it wanted a piece of it, and threw out a battle royale mode for its online <em>Fallout</em> game. </p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false"><em>Fallout 76</em> uses card-based Perks that you unlock more of as you level up your character. <em>Nuclear Winter</em> broke this system and contained many weapons that broke it even further. Mercifully, weapons and Perks from the game mode became locked to it, so you couldn’t level up a character in the battle royale mode and then dominate public survival servers. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">The rewards I loved the most were Holotapes. It’s difficult to know how many of these there were, but I believe there were dozens scattered around the Vault that acted as the lobby for the 52-player game mode. As you leveled up, you could access more rooms and find more Holotapes, telling the story of a supercomputer called ZAX. </p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">The computer was left in charge of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-known-fallout-vaults-canon-to-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vault 51</a> to create fictional scenarios and test humanity’s tribalism to its limits. By the end of the experiment, it had only succeeded in forcing Vault Dwellers to split and war with each other. Learning about this in <em>Fallout 76</em> was fascinating and a real treat while <em>Nuclear Winter</em> was live. </p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="false">Perhaps because of this division of progression, <em>Nuclear Winter</em>‘s player base dwindled fairly quickly until Bethesda deemed it necessary to shut the game mode down entirely in 2021. Some players in <em>Fallout 76</em> still have rewards from the game mode on their save files today as a memory of what was a brief and tumultuous time for the game. </p>

            <p>Capcom is once again remaking Resident Evil 1.</p>
<p>That's according to noted horror genre leaker Dusk Golem and survival horror YouTuber Biohazard Declassified, both of whom have stepped up this weekend with rumours that Capcom is looking to breathe new life into the game that started it all, the very first Resident Evil. [<strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1792062423983403391">Dusk Golem</a> has since distanced himself from the claim, and said it was shared by an imposter account.]</p>

<p>Biohazard Declassified says they received an anonymous email that claims the game – with the working title, Biohazard: Resident Evil 1 – will be slower paced than RE2 Remake, feature a "different this person camera", and explore RE1's lore "further".</p>
<p>It's also alleged that each Zombie will have their own unique model due to the small number of enemies within the game, "bullet sponge" enemies, and see the return of Crimson Heads.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🚨 NEW RESIDENT EVIL 1 REMAKE INFO 🚨</p><p>According to an anonymous email received by <a href="https://twitter.com/BioDeclassified?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BioDeclassified</a>:</p><p>- Working title: BIOHAZARD: RE1<br>- Will be slower paced than RE2 Remake<br>- Each Zombie will have their own unique model due to the small number of enemies within the game <br>- More… <a href="https://t.co/UqHH2a2NwL">pic.twitter.com/UqHH2a2NwL</a></p></div>— Will | Horror Game Central 👁️ (@ResiEvilCentral) <a href="https://twitter.com/ResiEvilCentral/status/1791591276560679084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Furthermore, there will be "no more pre-rendered backgrounds"; "each room will load up background assets and the rest of the assets will load when doors are opened. This is to improve visuals and lighting".</p>
<p>Golem took to social media on Sunday to substantiate the rumour.</p>
<p>"I can confirm that a new remake of Resident Evil 1 is in production and is scheduled to be released during the franchise's 30th anniversary in 2026," Golem said on X/Twitter.</p>
<blockquote data-context="false" data-id="wpBA2ey" lang="en"><a href="https://imgur.com/wpBA2ey"></a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"Some of the information circulating is true, such as the fact that it will be in third person. If I had to guess the same, it would probably be Resident Evil 1."</p>
<p>Whilst Golem has been correct about some early leaks – most notably those concerning Silent Hill 2 Remake, Alone in the Dark, and Resident Evil: Village – their record is not quite pristine, so this can only be taken as a rumour with a giant bucket of cautionary salt for now.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Golem made similar claims earlier this month, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-should-be-revealed-pretty-soon-and-release-next-year-leaker-suggests">Resident Evil 9 "should be revealed pretty soon and release next year"</a>.</p>
<p>"I have good news/rumours to deliver on Resident Evil 9," Dusk tweeted at the time. "The possible delay I had heard murmurs about can be pushed aside. [Resident Evil 9] should be revealed pretty soon and release next year. If what I heard previously holds true, should be in January. It'll have had about seven years in [development]."</p>

  <p id="uT4ygz">Netflix’s new animated movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24130971/thelma-the-unicorn-trailer-netflix-napoleon-dynamite"><em>Thelma the Unicorn</em></a> is full of soulful rock music, but one number stands out like a neon-colored sore thumb: “Here Comes the Cud.” And that’s deliberate. Flight of the Conchords’ Bret McKenzie designed “Here Comes the Cud” to be as disgustingly catchy and synthetic as possible. Creating a viral sensation — or at least, a number that could pass for a viral sensation within a movie’s fictional world — is a tall order. <em>Thelma</em> directors Jared Hess (<em>Napoleon Dynamite</em>) and Lynn Wang (Cartoon Network’s <a href="https://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/unikitty/index.html"><em>UniKitty! </em>series</a>) talked to Polygon about how they conceived and planned it.</p>
<p id="Aa4X3A">As pony-masquerading-as-a-unicorn Thelma (Brittany Howard) chases fame, her manager Vic Diamond (McKenzie’s Flight of the Conchords partner Jemaine Clement) sets her up with super-popular social-media influencer Danny Stallion (Fred Armisen), whose whole schtick is regurgitating cud for his followers. </p>
<p id="yesp8g">Wang says the filmmakers looked to real-world online behavior to shape the character. “Danny was kind of just an amalgamation of all kinds of over-the-top influencers,” she says.</p>

But Vic says superstars don’t write their own songs: “The Algorithm” does it for them. </p>

It’s incredibly catchy, yet its lyrics are about hacking up partially digested food, and it’s punctuated by burps and other bodily noises. It’s a far cry from the emotional, more personal songs Thelma belts out in a barn at the beginning of the movie. For Flight of the Conchords fans, its straight-faced humor, synthy music, and rap rhythms will also sound distinctly familiar.</p>

<p id="RXXNCk">“We had to establish Thelma’s brand of music and what kind of music was true to her that came out of her naturally, and then show how it gets corrupted by fame and stardom,” Hess says. “So it was fun to be able to show that contrast. Once it gets to ‘Here Comes the Cud,’ it all goes downhill.”</p>
<p id="Pw6RFA">The difference between the music Thelma writes for herself and the music the top stars in the world makes was very clearly defined. Wang and Hess collaborated with the movie’s songwriters and music producers to map out how that dynamic played into Thelma’s arc. </p>
<p id="uwSbS6">“<a href="https://www.taurastinson.com/">Taura Stinson</a>, Bret McKenzie, and all our songwriters really understood Thelma’s journey and what really needed to go into all of the lyrics to really help boost that emotional journey of hers,” says Wang. “But also making it really fun at the same time. Bret really brought the humor. It was really great.”</p>

<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Mountain Dew and gamers are one of those combinations that makes too much sense. It’s like peanut butter and jelly, or peanut butter and chocolate. This citrus-flavored concoction was incrementally developed by several individuals before PepsiCo acquired the rights. </p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">The taste, and combination of high-fructose corn syrup and caffeine, made it a hit with gamers who used it to fuel extended gaming sessions. PepsiCo, recognizing this, has made sure to promote the radioactive green drink with several games over the years.</p>  <figure data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h3 id="h-2004-the-mountain-dew-xbox" data-injectable="false">2004 – The Mountain Dew Xbox</h3> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">20 years ago, Microsoft and Mountain Dew came together in an unholy union to create the Limited Edition Mountain Dew Xbox. During the promotion, folks would need to accrue 550 points through Mountain Dew to unlock the option of purchasing the console for $100. While the total number of consoles produced is unknown, there’s an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MountainDewXbox/">active subreddit</a> trying to track down each one.</p> <h3 id="h-2005-every10minutes" data-injectable="false">2005 – Every10Minutes</h3> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">Continuing its partnership with Microsoft, Mountain Dew launched the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051003215805/http://pepsi.yahoo.com/everyten/home.php">Every10Minutes promotion</a>. Participants would earn points by purchasing PepsiCo products which would then be tied to an account on the official site. Then, every 10 minutes (hence the name), they could use those points to bid on the then-unreleased Xbox 360.</p>
 <h3 id="h-2006-g4" data-injectable="false">2006 – G4</h3> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Leaning more into the Mountain Dew Game Fuel branding, PepsiCo teamed up with DirecTV and G4 for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061018000351/http://www.championshipgamingseries.com/">Championship Gaming Invitational</a>. Additionally, participants in the event could win Mountain Dew’s “<a href="https://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video11359">Wall of Cash</a>” which contained “about a million dollars.”</p> <h3 id="h-2007-game-fuel-is-born" data-injectable="false">2007 – Game Fuel is born</h3> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Mountain Dew and gamers hit it off big with the <em>Halo 3</em> collaboration in 2007. This was the first incarnation of Game Fuel and would become the staple flavor moving forward. Bungie would work with several other companies to promote the title, including 7-Eleven, Burger King, and NASCAR.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><em><strong>Halo 3</strong></em> – Citrus Cherry <ul> <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314092710/http://www.bevreview.com/2007/08/12/review-mountain-dew-game-fuel/">BevReview</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/31/halo-3-box-arrives-at-ign-offices">IGN</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-2009-horde-or-alliance" data-injectable="false">2009 – Horde or Alliance?</h3> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Mountain Dew tapped another massively popular title in 2009, <em>World of Warcraft</em>. From what I remember and what I can dig up, there wasn’t anything specific being promoted as <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> was released in 2008 and <em>Cataclysm</em> wouldn’t hit until 2010. Either way, I loved Alliance Blue and definitely remember having a 12-pack in the fridge while bopping around Northrend.</p>

In an effort to entice them further, the two companies would reward players with Double XP in-game by redeeming codes. Thanks to Mountain Dew, you could watch your Prestige Level and blood sugar levels rise to unfathomable heights.</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">To sweeten the deal, Mountain Dew and Activision teamed up with the Dallas Cowboys to fly the winners of their <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2011/12/21/mountain-dew-mixes-modern-warfare-3-dallas-cowboys-stadiums-and-those-famous-cheerleaders/?sh=640bc0863266">Mega Fan Experience contest</a> down to the stadium where they played the shooter on a 160’x72′ screen from the 50-yard line.

This saw the return of the classic citrus cherry drink in addition to an iOS title, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-halo-4-king-of-the-hill-fueled-by-mountain-dew/">Halo 4: King of the Hill</a></em>.</p> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">Much like <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em>, <em>Halo 4</em> players could enjoy Double XP by redeeming codes from various Mountain Dew products. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2012/10/10/mountain-dew-exec-explains-why-halo-4-received-double-xp-over-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/?sh=4fc5e6a01ffe">In an interesting interview</a> with the then-Marketing Manager for Mountain Dew, Forbes was able to get some insight on the promotion.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><em><strong>Halo 4</strong></em> – Citrus Cherry</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/halo-4-master-chief-mountain-dew.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-2013-fewer-minutes" data-injectable="false">2013 – Fewer minutes</h3> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="735" data-injectable="true">2013 had the soft drink partnering with Microsoft’s gaming platform directly once again to promote the release of the Xbox One. Much like 2005’s Every10Minutes, participants could bid points collected from Mountain Dew purchases in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127083811/https://www.every2minutes.com/">Every2Minutes auctions</a>. The staple citrus cherry flavor was joined by a new flavor, electrifying berry, to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2013/06/13/win-a-special-mountain-dew-doritos-xbox-one-promotional-package/">promote the new console</a> and four titles.</p>

With the release of <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em>, its packaging was updated for the promotion and a companion flavor, lemonade, was released. Additionally, players could collect points from Mountain Dew and Doritos purchases to unlock in-game items via the “<a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/24521/article/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-promo-with-doritos-mountain-dew-revealed/">Fuel Up for Battle</a>” campaign.</p>

Rather than earn in-game gear like the previous year, participants could unlock Double XP for the <em>Zombies</em> mode through the “<a href="https://www.charlieintel.com/call-of-duty/mtn-dewdoritos-fuel-up-for-battle-promo-starts-oct-5th-at-12pm-et-2xp-in-zombies-available-on-all-platforms-32680/">Fuel Up for Battle</a>” campaign.

Citrus cherry was joined by mango heat for the promotion. Players could earn codes for nose art for their Titans in addition to Coliseum Tickets (the currency for the 1v1 Pilot-only duels) by purchasing Mountain Dew or hitting up the nearest <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160817005854/en/Buffalo-Wild-Wings-Partners-with-Electronic-Arts-and-Respawn-Entertainment-to-Provide-Guests-with-Exclusive-Codes-to-Unlock-Titanfall-2-Content">Buffalo Wild Wings</a>.</p>

In the now familiar setup, participants purchased products for codes to redeem for points for <a href="https://www.haloinfinitenews.com/post/doritos-mountain-dew-and-rockstar-promotion">in-game cosmetics for <em>Halo Infinite</em></a>.

Participants can purchase Mountain Dew and redeem the codes for points and spend them on things like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-adds-the-mountain-zu-a-mountain-dew-themed-bird-mount/">licensed Puma apparel and in-game mounts</a>.</p> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true"> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</strong></em></li> </ul>
 <h2 id="h-green-label-gaming" data-injectable="false">Green Label Gaming</h2> <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false">In 2007, Mountain Dew created Green Label Gaming. The organization sponsored both players and developers in addition to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110033742/http://greenlabel.com/gaming/">covering games on its site</a>. </p> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">The soft drink giant would go on to produce a 30-minute television special in 2008 for Spike TV known as “<a href="https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=82144">The Next Great Gaming Gods</a>.” In it, Geoff Keighley traveled the United States and Japan to meet with various game designers. Mountain Dew then sponsored a limited number of free downloads of the featured designers’ titles.</p>
 <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="133" data-injectable="false">In 2009, Green Label Gaming helped sponsor two gaming events, IGF (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101202193908/http://www.igf.com/2009/02/green_label_gaming_signs_up_fo.html">Independent Games Festival</a>) and GDC (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090302080519/http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/02/competition_imagine_the_games.html">Game Developers Conference</a>). </p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="false">In what appears to be the last major sponsored gaming event by Green Label Gaming in 2014, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-jam-reality-show-cancelled-as-indies-wouldnt-put-up-with-its-s">Green Label Game Jam</a> was a four-day event with the intention of developers competing for prizes.
