<figure data-uuid="3e8d957c9bbec"><a title="Kirby Air Riders amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e8d957c9bbec/kirby-air-riders-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has more amiibo that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> — that was already true when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">they were revealed during the September Nintendo Direct</a>, but a second one (that just aired) has unveiled three more.</p>
<p>Meta Knight and Shadow Star, King Dedede and Tank Star, and Chef Kawasaki and Hop Star will be joining the pricey set of amiibo in 2026. Meta Knight will swoop in on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, with King Dedede and Kawasaki to follow later in the year.</p>
<p>Like Kirby and Waddle Dee, these three are much bigger than your standard amiibo, but not only that, you can swap each of the characters between vehicles. They attach via magnets, meaning they clip on rather nicely indeed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Oh, and in the case of at least the Tank Star, you can change the positioning of the tracks and wheels, which will transform the vehicle in-game. Neat!</p>

<p>Now, of course, the price — nothing official has been revealed, but given that retailers are listing Kirby and Waddle Dee at $49.99 in the US, we have to imagine that these other three will also retail at the same price. That means if you want all five, you'll have to cough up around $250 plus tax. Ouch...</p>

<p>Tarnished Edition pushed to 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="b6a5ec64ea5f2"><a title="Elden Ring" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6a5ec64ea5f2/elden-ring.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are delaying the planned launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> on Switch 2 until next year.</p>
<p>Originally scheduled to arrive on Nintendo's console before the end of 2025, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">a post</a> from the game's official X account apologises to players and says the delay into 2026 is "to allow time for performance adjustments."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While development on #ELDENRING Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments.<br>
We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FromSoft's game was playable at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/gamescom">Gamescom</a> back in August, although various outlets (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">including ourselves</a>) reported disappointing performance on Nintendo's system, especially in handheld mode, with frame drops and stuttering especially noticeable in the more open areas.</p><div><figure data-videoid="DE5HpSoUj-c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60ecbbuqpizw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>The game launched elsewhere back in February 2022 to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/elden-ring">glowing reviews</a>, and was followed by the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_shadow_of_the_erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC in 2024, which will be included in the Tarnished Edition.</p>
<p>It's unsurprising, perhaps, that such an ambitious game might struggle on handheld hardware, but we'd hoped for a smooth, consistent experience on Switch 2 despite the familiar caveats of running a full-fat, cross-platform, home console game like this on portable hardware.</p>
<p>However, although it's disappointing to see this one slip into next year — at least for those of us who had holiday plans involving a trip to the Lands Between — if the devs need more time to make this edition not-quite-so-tarnished, so be it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-on-nintendo-switch-2-has-been-delayed-into-2026.1332796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20251023_eldenring_tarnishededition_postponement">announced today in a press release</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring, titled Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, will no longer be released in 2025 and has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>A statement from FromSoftware cites the reason for the delay as the game needing more time "<em>for game performance adjustments</em>." A more specific release window beyond 2026 was not provided.</p>



<p>"<em>While development is progressing wholeheartedly towards release</em>," the statement begins, "<em>it was deemed that more time is required for game performance adjustments and the decision to change the release date was made.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Further announcements will follow once a specific release date has been determined. We offer our sincere apologies for inconveniencing players who have been eagerly awaiting the release of this title. Thank you for your patience and support as we continue to make performance adjustments</em>."</p>



<p>Frankly, this delay isn't the biggest surprise. Besides the fact that the quality bar for technical performance in FromSoftware games is rocky at best, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">there were already reasonable concerns</a> with how this new version would run on the Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, it's more powerful than the first Switch and definitely has a shot at running Elden Ring with some degree of stability, but it's no surprise to learn that FromSoftware needs more time to try and figure that out.</p>



<p>And based on their track record, even when it arrives it'll likely do so with its fair share of performance issues anyways. Of course, we hope that's not the case, but FromSoftware can't even put out games on current-gen consoles and PCs without significant performance issues.</p>



<p>Elden Ring also isn't the only major title that won't be hitting its initial 2025 release window on Nintendo Switch 2. Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">recently delayed indefinitely,</a> while Gearbox continues to fix and resolve the performance issues the game had on other platforms and addressing what we can only assume to be serious performance issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, if you want to take Elden Ring with you on the go, the only option remains PC handhelds like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck </a>or the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing significant emulation improvements for several PS4 exclusives.</p>



<p>The new version of the emulator, which can be downloaded from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://shadps4.net/downloads/">its official website</a> by setting the Update Channel to Nightly, brings many current PlayStation 4 exclusives closer to a fully playable state on PC while also booting games that did not launch in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-0-11-0-unreal-engine-games/">previous versions of the emulator</a>, a crucial step for further emulation improvements.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProteinGaming-97">ProteinGaming</a> showcases how games like Ratchet &amp; Clank 2016, God of War III Remastered, The Order: 1886, the P.T. demo, Infamous: Second Son, Uncharted: Nathan Drake Collection, Gravity Rush and others run under the new version of the emulator on a system powered by an i5-12400F CPU, RTX 4060 GPU and 32 GB RAM. </p>



<p>While some games, like The Order 1886, are nowhere near playable, others have seen considerable performance improvements, like God of War III Remastered, Gravity Rush 2, and The Last Guardian. So, it may not be long before these games become fully playable on PC, even without an official port.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SHADPS4 0.11.1 Release - Huge Upgrades for PS4 Exclusives on PC!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G71o1fh_Rmg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While PlayStation 4 games becoming playable on PC would be more than enough for most players who never had the chance to try out these games on the original hardware, improved emulation could also lead to graphics and performance improvements. </p>



<p>Bloodborne, whose emulation was further improved in the new version of the ShadPS4 emulator, not only can be made to run at 60 FPS on PC, its visuals can be enhanced significantly with the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-remaster-project-update/">Remastered Project visual overhaul</a>, which introduces, among other improvements, dynamic shadows and is set to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-remaster-addressing-low-quality-meshes/">get another critical improvement down the line.</a></p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator, an up-to-date compatibility list and more can be found on the emulator's <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

A new day, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city builder</a>! Today the particular entry in this far reaching genre we're talking about is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/farthest-frontier">Farthest Frontier</a>, because it's leaving early access after more than three years in development. If you've never heard of it before, the simple answer is that Farthest Frontier is a medieval city builder. The longer answer includes all the things it does.
</p>
<p>
For one, there's apparently more than 190 buildings you can build, as you start your old timey town as just that before eventually growing it into a living, breathing city. Quite literally, as apparently villagers in the game live out their days in real time. You could pick a random villager, watch them as they head to work, see them delivering things to various townspeople. Sounds neat!

<p>
You can grow up to 12 different kinds of crops, all of which have specific needs from making sure the soil is appropriately fertile, to needing to prevent temperature-related damage, to good old fashioned diseases. There's invaders to be fought off too, if you don't have the game's pacifist mode turned on, requiring you to properly equip your village and its people to defend themselves.
</p><p>
In terms of the big 1.0 features, progression has apparently received a big revamp with a new 142-point tech tree. There'll be even more buildings, plus decorations and landmarks to build, and even a bridge system. You'll also find a new policy system, which according to a press release adds "more agency to civic management." Not to mention some updated animations, including for those aforementioned villagers.
</p>
<p>
If all of this sounds like it's up your alley, well, again, it's out today! And available to pick up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1044720/Farthest_Frontier/">here</a>! Go nuts!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you play <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> and enjoy trading skins for financial gain, you’re either real happy right now or, um, quite the opposite. Valve recently pushed an update to the game’s controversial marketplace that appears to have wildly shifted the value of some folks’ inventories, gutting the worth of some players’ stockpiles of skins while skyrocketing that of others. It’s <a href="https://x.com/pricempire/status/1981369304252645391">a dramatic shift</a> triggering a nearly $2 billion decrease in value to the market.</p> <p>In an update that makes an otherwise ordinary <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004?l=english">assortment of tweaks</a>, Valve altered the way <i>Counter-Strike</i>’s skin game works (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/counter-strike-2-community-left-in-shambles-along-with-steam-marketplace-after-valves-new-trade-up-update-turns-usd10-skins-into-usd1-000-skins-and-vice-versa-this-update-has-made-some-collectors-very-rich/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). The update allows folks to “trade up” what were previously seen as borderline worthless cosmetics, referred to as “red” by the community. These skins were previously worth around $10, but as of the new changes, folks can trade them up for skins worth four digits. That’s quite the shift.</p>

 <p>Turmoil ensued as these changes rocked the skin market. <a href="https://x.com/ThatBoyAqua/status/1981167900900909382">One player lost $1400</a> “in the span of 30 minutes” as the changes mucked up the value of their inventory. Of course, as such things go, others gained a ton of money, <a href="https://x.com/Serifaz_/status/1981167366689222980">sharing screenshots</a> of the massive jump in value of their inventory.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">*formerly $10 skins lmao <a href="https://t.co/XeBcWqJ03O">pic.twitter.com/XeBcWqJ03O</a></p> <p>— Serifaz 🌸 (@Serifaz_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Serifaz_/status/1981167366689222980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“At this point just go and gamble at a casino 😂” reads another post. But perhaps the most ridiculous shift in value was @smileybeef’s now nearly four-million-dollar (yes, you read that right) batch of “worthless red skins.” “How do I explain this to the IRS?” they said. To which <a href="https://x.com/0scarrrrrrrrr/status/1981220176012967986">one user replied</a> “Can you please launder it harder by buying me a Steam Deck?” <a href="https://x.com/bigballs232/status/1981189348071768429">Another chimed in</a> saying “everytime I refresh the market they get more expensive some are at like 3600%.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do I explain this to the IRS <a href="https://t.co/Cg7ldLw23U">pic.twitter.com/Cg7ldLw23U</a></p> <p>— psp1g (@smileybeef) <a href="https://twitter.com/smileybeef/status/1981141120051781834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I believe the technical term for this kinda stuff is “fucking nuts.”</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, my new sleep paralysis demon, started out as one of the most disappointing Mega Evolutions introduced in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>. The ethereal, alien-like starfish is one of the original 151 Pokémon and a longtime favorite among many fans. Folks had been asking Game Freak for a Mega Evolution for years, and numerous cool fan art concepts have been circulating on the internet for a long time, dating back to before </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was announced. What we got, however, is one of the goofiest-looking new forms in the game, one that many deemed unfitting of the original Pokémon’s mysterious design. However, after a lot of immediate backlash, Mega Starmie has reached the “so bad it’s good” status that Game Freak probably intended.</span></p>   <p><span>Mega Starmie’s big change is that it grows in size and its extremities become long enough that it can imitate human movement. So this gorgeous, jewel-wearing starfish turns into a freaky gremlin that runs around the battlefield like it’s in a Hanna Barbera cartoon. I admit, I hated its design when I first saw it. I’m not sure I’d say I’ve come around on it, but I can’t deny that it was an absolute beast during my playthrough that wiped the floor with so many of my foes’ teams. It was helpful that when it underwent this transformation, it was able to use its creepy-crawly legs to get across the battlefield more quickly, since its slow movement speed is one of its standard form’s weaknesses. And now that the initial shock is wearing off, players are starting to see the absurdity of Mega Starmie as endearing instead. It’s a meme Pokémon, but its human-like proportions have made it easy to graft onto just about anything.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mega Starmie containment breach<br>made in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blender?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blender</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/b3d?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#b3d</a> <a href="https://t.co/AjcGqSD01j">pic.twitter.com/AjcGqSD01j</a></p> <p>— cgchefs (@cgchefs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cgchefs/status/1979677950598643881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When the fajitas come out sizzlin <a href="https://t.co/fq3ASwVALs">pic.twitter.com/fq3ASwVALs</a></p> <p>— DOMROM (@DomRomArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/DomRomArt/status/1980829381846298962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">「待ちなさぁ～い！」 <a href="https://t.co/FRcVlWBiRE">pic.twitter.com/FRcVlWBiRE</a></p> <p>— いとた (@itota_art) <a href="https://twitter.com/itota_art/status/1980605381534777800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">Gm! <a href="https://t.co/8fnH1M7heO">pic.twitter.com/8fnH1M7heO</a></p> <p>— Pokémon Daily Post💫 (@PokeDailyPost) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokeDailyPost/status/1980544589908844591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">入浴中のメガスターミーのラテアート<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemon_LA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemon_LA</a> <a href="https://t.co/5sZJF12j8R">pic.twitter.com/5sZJF12j8R</a></p> <p>— じょーじ (@george_10g) <a href="https://twitter.com/george_10g/status/1979868926919291357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>Yeah, it might not be the Mega Evolution anyone expected, but it got people talking, and now Mega Starmie has somehow become a breakout…star…from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-erderee-expansion-open-world-rpg-1851774222">The Switch 2 port of FromSoftware’s open-world RPG, </a><em>Elden Ring,</em> has been delayed from 2025 until sometime in 2026. In two different statements about the delay, the devs explained that the port needed more time to improve performance. When <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> on Switch 2 was first seen by the public, many weren’t impressed by its frame rate.</p> <p>On October 23, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">the official <em>Elden Ring</em> Twitter account announced</a> that<em> Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2 was no longer launching in 2025 and had been delayed into next year to give the devs more time for “performance adjustments.”</p> <p><span>“While development on <em>Elden Ring</em></span><span><em> Tarnished Edition</em> continues wholeheartedly toward release,” posted the<em> Elden Ring</em> account, “we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments. We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.”</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1981359979119726764">Over on the official FromSoftware Twitter account</a>, the studio shared a lengthier message about the delay. Here’s the translated version of that statement:</p> <blockquote><p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition,</em> which was scheduled for release in 2025, we have determined that additional time is required for game performance adjustments, and we will therefore be changing the release to 2026. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to all users who have been looking forward to the release of this title. We will continue to make adjustments to deliver it in the best possible form, so we kindly ask for your understanding. Thank you very much for your patience.</p></blockquote> <p>Both statements make it clear that the open-world RPG, first released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2022, is struggling to run well on Nintendo’s Switch 2 console. This was clear when the game was demoed at Gamescom earlier this year, and footage showed it chugging horribly. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">Bandai Namco reportedly even stopped people from recording footage</a> of the game to avoid it being posted online. <em>Nintendo Life</em> video producer Felix Sanchez, after playing <em>Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2, said: “It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible.” Looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco are going to keep tinkering on the port until next year. Hopefully, that helps it run better when it finally launches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam’s Personal Calendar will help players discover new and upcoming games through a schedule of upcoming releases and personalized recommendations. </p>



<p>Personal Calendar is a store feature that will be available as a Steam Labs experiment. This will allow the company to gather feedback and make more improvements to this tool. It will show players not just recently released games but also upcoming games, and it has been filtered down to a collection that Steam believes the player is most likely to be interested in.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-steam-s-personal-calendar-work">How Does Steam’s Personal Calendar Work?</h2>



<p>Explained in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507342099205587494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, this new Steam tool will find players with similar playtime to the user and then look at the games they have been adding to their wishlists. The system will also look at the games the player plays the most (relative to other players) and spend most of their playtime in.&nbsp;Which means that the games and demos players put in for a few minutes won’t be recorded; only those they sink their teeth into will matter.</p>



<p>Steam’s Personal Calendar system will be retrained daily to incorporate the latest data. It has a new calendar view that lists soon-to-release titles, filters them to the set we recommend most for you, and maps them across time so you can see them at a glance. This view will also include the player’s wishlisted games. However, the Calendar is weekdays-only, since very few games are released on weekends, and they needed as much space as possible to show upcoming games. </p>



<p>There are some customisation controls, including the ability to filter by tag and adjust the number of results. Also, the page will filter games based on your&nbsp;store content preferences, such as Early Access titles, ignored products, ignored tags, and the general level of mature content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement confirmed that Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will no longer release for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025 and has been delayed to 2026. </p>



<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition’s development has been struggling slightly on Nintendo Switch 2, with the recent Gamescom 2025 demo not doing it many favours, as players pointed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-struggles-on-nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial framerate drops</a>. It seems that’s why the developers want to take more time before they deliver the final product. </p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-release-pushed-to-2026-date-still-unconfirmed">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Release Pushed to 2026, Date Still Unconfirmed</h2>



<p>The announcement about the delay comes through a post on the official Elden Ring <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post states that development for the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is moving “wholeheartedly toward release”; however, they have decided to delay the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments.” The developers have apologized to the players for the delay and thanked them for their patience and support. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>While development on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments. </p><p>We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support. <a href="https://t.co/TsLrhAWIGc">pic.twitter.com/TsLrhAWIGc</a></p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Overall, it’s a sound decision to delay the launch of the Elden Ring: Tarnished edition, as the game was genuinely suffering from very real performance issues. Players have reported framerates dropping to as low as 15 fps, while doing “the most simple stuff,” and when players “get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks.” The added time will help developers to work towards optimisation and provide a more solid build for release. </p>

    <p><span>Everything players can expect when the game launches.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [22,949 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> and <a title="Companies > Sora Ltd. [98 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sora-ltd">Sora Ltd.</a> game director <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ahiro Sakurai <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251023937868/en/" target="_blank">shared</a> more information on <em><a title="Games > Kirby Air Riders [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a></em> during the game’s second dedicated Nintendo Direct broadcast today, including the introducing of the story-driven Road Trip Mode, the return of Top Ride from <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>, and a “Global Test Ride” demo event set for November 8 to 9 and November 15 to 16. Sakurai also confirmed that no downloadable content is planned, nor is <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> planned to become an ongoing series. <span id="more-1001557"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>Headlining the presentation were the introduction of the story-driven Road Trip mode and the return of Top Ride, a mode originally introduced in the 2003 Nintendo <a title="Platforms > GameCube" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/gamecube">GameCube</a> game <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>. These game modes are just some of the features highlighted in this presentation, with Mr. Sakurai revealing how <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> expands its gameplay experience on <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> 2—including introducing a large roster of riders, the return of legendary machines, customizable features, online1 play and more. It’s time to get ready for a whole new level of fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [3,138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><p>And as for the new features and details covered in the presentation, here’s what Mr. Sakurai revealed about what you can expect when the game lands:</p><ul><li><strong>Top Ride</strong> – A game mode originally introduced in <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>, Top Ride is all about <a title="Genres > Racing [292 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> from a top-down perspective and includes courses inspired by those available in Air Ride mode. Just as in other game modes, you can choose your riders and machines separately. You can also use Quick Spins and Boost Charges, plus Copy Abilities such as Flash, which causes the rider to surge forward with electricity—rivals that are hit will be in for a shocking surprise! There are also items exclusive to Top Ride to help you gain even more of an advantage over your opponents, including Kaboomb, Drift Flames, Drill Driver and more! Top Ride can be played online with up to eight players, or offline with other three players2 on a single system and four CPUs.</li><li><strong>Road Trip</strong> – In today’s presentation, Mr. Sakurai introduced a new mode called Road Trip. Hit the road and complete different challenges from Air Ride, City Trial and Top Ride including races, battles, and Field Events—all the while collecting machines and items you can use between challenges. But this is no random Road Trip. There is a story behind why Kirby, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Starman and other riders are embarking on this journey, and it’s hinted at during the presentation …</li><li><strong>Paddock</strong> – In <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, there is a new way for friends to gather for online play in the paddock3. Acting like a lobby, this area lets players move around as a rider and set up matches, interact with friends and pick and choose which mode they’d like to play. It’s even possible for several matches to be happening within a single paddock. Players can also change the music. You can also send emotes, and work on character poses using the control sticks in combination.</li><li><strong>Swap <a title="Companies > Relay" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/relay">Relay</a></strong> – The presentation dove deeper into Air Ride mode, introducing a new type of race called Swap Relay. Here, you’ll select a machine for each individual lap and automatically swap machines as you complete laps. Find the right combos and experiment with different pairings of rider and machine. You can even relay with other players locally by handing off the controller like a baton!</li><li><strong>Transform Star</strong> – The Transform Star is both a star type flying machine and a bike type driving machine and is one of the new machines being introduced in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>! By rapidly moving the Left Stick you can swap between both types to keep your opponents on their toes.</li><li><strong>Checklist</strong> – The Checklist3 from <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> is back as well. As you clear certain objectives, a Checklist box gets flipped over. The more you achieve, the more unlockable content you can access. There are five Checklist tabs, representing Air Ride, Top Ride, City Trial, Road Trip and Online. Clicking on an unopened box which is next to opened box will take you right to that objective, all set up and ready to play. Rest assured that there are no riders or machines locked behind the Online tab, so completing that tab is not required. You can jump in immediately and start filling up your Checklist.</li><li><strong>amiibo</strong> – The presentation revealed more of the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> amiibo figures4, which are significantly larger than typical amiibo. Mr. Sakurai showcased <a title="Platforms > Meta [159 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a> Knight &amp; Shadow Star, King Dedede &amp; Tank Star and Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star. They, too, can swap riders and machines! Each rider, including those revealed in the three new two-part amiibo packs, is attached magnetically to their machine, and you can swap them out with other <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> amiibo, with the new combo appearing in the game as well! You will also be able to train up your amiibo Figure Player and increase their experience levels. The amiibo will launch on:<ul><li>Meta Knight &amp; Shadow Star – March 5, 2026</li><li>King Dedede &amp; Tank Star – 2026</li><li>Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star – 2026</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        </li><li><strong>And So Much More</strong> – The presentation confirmed the return of all nine Air Ride courses from the original game, from Fantasy Meadows to Nebula Belt, bringing the total number of courses to 18. The presentation later offered details on a new City Trial power-up item called the Mega Cannon. It also covered Stadiums, as well as boss battles which teased the debut of a boss battle exclusive opponent called Robo Dedede—a boss who can transform between Dedede mode and Car mode! There are also returning Copy Abilities and even ways to collect and rebuild the legendary machines Dragoon and Hydra!</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_1001701"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Mr. Sakurai also discussed some new online and multiplayer elements that will be available in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, giving players more chances to share the experience with friends and family:</p><ul><li><strong>Global Win Power</strong> – <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will feature a Class system and a new metric called Global Win Power3. First, your Class ranking is measured not with a letter grade, but with colors. The seven colors of the rainbow indicate your Class and help match you up with similarly leveled players online. Raising your Class level can inspire changes in City Trial, so keep an eye out. Each <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [622 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer game</a> mode also has its own Global Win Power ranking, which is based on your total number of wins. Although not directly related to your Class ranking, it will increase the more you play. Your Global Win Power is also displayed on your License.</li><li><strong>Licenses</strong> – Your online multiplayer experience starts with creating a License3. This is how others will be able to identify you when playing online and is viewable when competing against other players. You can customize it with glitter effects and stickers, as well as your own Street Name by pairing two pre-set terms together.</li><li><strong>Team Battles</strong> – Up to 16 players2 can play City Trial together and with Team Battles3, you can now split up the players into two teams of eight. Legendary machine parts can be shared between teammates—and whoever picks up the final piece gets to ride it! When ten or more players are competing, all players will be split into two of the same stadium and teams will compete for the high score.</li><li><strong>Hone Your Skills</strong> – As a single player, play Time Attack in either Air Ride or Top Ride modes and challenge yourself to get your best time over a set number of laps. Or play Free Run in either of those modes, too, and practice your moves or set your own <a title="Series > Persona [92 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>l Best in a pressure-free environment without any opponents in your way. In City Trial, you can use Free Run to explore Skyah without any time limits or obstacles.</li><li><strong>Expanded Roster</strong> – The presentation also revealed a few more of the characters you’ll be seeing in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> as playable riders. There’s the clever arachnid Taranza, the troublemaking duo of Lololo &amp; Lalala and more!</li></ul><p>The presentation further expanded on the ways you can customize your <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> experience, personalizing Air Ride machines, garages and even music.</p><ul><li><strong>Miles</strong> – How do you acquire customizable accessories? With Miles! You keep earning Miles while you’re playing—the more you play, the more you earn. You can then take this in-game currency to the Miles Shop where you can acquire machines, machine decorations, License decorations, and music tracks. You can even acquire customizable Headwear for your riders.</li><li><strong>My Machine</strong> – As you collect machines by playing, purchasing parts at the Miles Shop and completing Checklist challenges, you can add decals, accessories, patterns and effects to turn any machine into My Machine. Then take your personalized My Machine to the Machine Market where you can list it for sale for in-game currency and acquire machines designed by other players. The more your machine sells, the more expensive it gets (but don’t worry, you don’t actually lose the machine if it sells). In addition to decorating your machine, you can create your own custom garage to show off your unique rides. Invite friends from the paddock to come and hang, too!</li><li><strong>Gummies</strong> – New to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> are machine-shaped Gummies collectibles. They are shaped like the machines of opponents you’ve defeated—for every rival you place higher than in a competition, you’ll earn a Gummy of their machine. Inhale them, fire them into the sky and generally hold onto them as trophies of all the opponents you’ve defeated. Who knows, maybe you’ll become a Gummillionaire!</li><li><strong>My Music</strong> – Mr. Sakurai gave special mention to game composers Shogo Sakai and Noriyuki Iwadare, who worked on <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> and the <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> series respectively. Like <em><a title="Games > Super Smash Bros. Ultimate [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will have a My Music option that allows you to select what music you’d like to be playing during City Trial while you explore Skyah, including tracks from across the <em>Kirby</em> game series, bonus tracks and hidden tracks! There is also new music available on the <a title="Games > Nintendo Music [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/nintendo-music">Nintendo Music</a>5 smart device app today!</li></ul><p>And that’s not all. <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will also feature announcer voices in different languages and styles to choose from that provide commentary during races and narration during the Road Trip story. Players can also enjoy customizable button-mapping, visual effect options and a new Main Menu that gives you easy access to game modes, collectibles and other extras.</p><p><strong><em>Kirby Air Riders</em>: Global Test Ride</strong></p><p>Want to experience <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> ahead of its launch? Nintendo Switch Online members can get hands-on with the game in the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>: Global Test Ride event. The online demo event will take place on November 8 to 9 and November 15 to 16, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><ul><li>November 8 from 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. PT</li><li>November 8 from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. PT</li><li>November 9 from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. PT</li><li>November 15 from 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. PT</li><li>November 15 from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. PT</li><li>November 16 from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. PT</li></ul><p>During the Global Test Ride event, players can check out Lessons, Air Ride, and City Trial. For Air Ride, the following courses will be playable: Floria Fields, Waveflow Waters and Mount Amberfalls. Players can also jump into a paddock, in which they can create a room, invite friends to a City Trial or play with others worldwide. The paddock can accommodate up to 16 people during the Global Test Ride, while the retail version will allow up to 32 players.</p><p>The Global Test Ride software can be downloaded from Nintendo eShop starting the afternoon of Friday, November 7. Even before or outside the Global Test Ride timings, players can play Lessons.</p></blockquote><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [584 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on November 20.</p><p>Watch the full Direct below.

                <p>Elden Ring's Switch 2 port is not going to release on time. From Software and Bandai Namco have confirmed that the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition for Nintendo's console has been pushed to 2026.</p><p>Development "continues wholeheartedly," the developer said in a statement. But a delay was necessary to give the team time for "performance adjustments."</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/" data-ref-id="1100-6534171">people who played Elden Ring on Switch 2 said it was in rough shape</a>, with the frame rate in particular getting called out for being poor. Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/" data-ref-id="1100-6534171">forbade media from showing footage of the game</a>, so we haven't actually seen it in action as of yet, however.</p><p>"We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support," the developer said about the delay.</p><p>The Tarnished Edition includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Author George R.R. Martin worked on Elden Ring's backstory and lore.</p><p>Elden Ring was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-10-best-selling-games-of-2022-in-the-us/1100-6510556/">No. 2 best-selling game of 2022 in the US</a> and sold <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fromsoftware/comments/1hew72p/elden_ring_has_sold_over_286_million_copies_as_of/#:~:text=Full_Data_6240-,Elden%20Ring%20has%20sold%20over%2028.6%20million%20copies%20as%20of,IP%20of%20modern%20console%20generation" rel="nofollow ">nearly 30 million copies as of the end of 2024</a> across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. No sequel has been announced, but the standalone multiplayer spin-off, Elden Ring Nightreign, came out this past May. It's not confirmed for Switch 2, however.</p><p>Assuming it releases in 2026, Elden Ring will join From Software's The Duskbloods in launching for Switch 2 next year. That is a new action-RPG exclusive to Switch 2 developed by From Software and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>

Though this trailer looks great, don't get too excited yet because the game is targeting a console and PC release sometime in 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>Madngine says Project Tal "reimagined Korea's traditional Tal masks," as well as the mythology and Korean folklore that surrounds these special masks. It infuses this mythology into a fantasy open world for players to explore, and today's trailer showcases some of that world alongside the fast-paced action combat against huge monsters and more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Project Tal announcement trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see in the trailer, Project Tal features a companion system that ensures players aren't fighting alone in this dangerous world. Madngine says the companion system "dynamically responds to the player's combat style and environment" in a press release. Each NPC companion has unique abilities, combat roles, including up-close and ranged magic and melee prowess, and distinctive personalities.&nbsp;</p><p>"Project Tal combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG," Wemade Max Co. CEO Sohn Myun-seok writes in a press release. "With Madngine's technical expertise and artistic vision, we're creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage."</p><p>We'll have to wait until 2027 when Project Tal hits unspecified consoles and PC to see if that's the case.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are some additional Project Tal screenshots:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/11/nexon-unveils-woochi-the-wayfarer-a-single-player-korean-fantasy-action-adventure-game">read about Woochi the Wayfarer</a>, another single-player Korean fantasy action game in development, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4/relentless-exhausting-exhilarating"><em>Game Informer's </em>Ninja Gaiden 4 review</a> to find out why it's an action game we recommend you check out. &nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of our first official look at Project Tal?

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct stream brought a bit one hour drop of new information about Masuhiro Sakurai’s latest game, digging into changes both big and small for the game, revealing Top Ride and the brand new Road Trip mode, digging into specific menu settings, revealing a big set of Amiibo, and more.</p>
<p>A global online demo is set to take place at two points in November, on 8th-9th November and on 15th-16th November at 8AM-2PM UK time (UTC) on the first day, and then 12AM-6AM and 3PM-9PM on the second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct #2 10.23.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZHYjYHHiBM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Top Ride, the top-down racing style, has returned alongside the more kart racer-style Air Ride, and the vehicular combat stylings of City Trial. Compared to the GameCube original, there’s now a follow cam and the ability for all players to have their own view of the world, which will really help with the scale and the scope of the many stages featured in the game. Additionally, since this now uses the full selection Air Ride vehicles, and has two control methods so you can race however feels more natural.</p>
<p>Air Ride is the main racing mode, though, and there’s some big news here as well. There’s nine original circuits for this game, but there’s also all nine of the original game’s circuits included as well, from Fantasy meadows and Celestial Valley to Sky Sands. You’ll need to earn these original circuits, but they’ve all been rebuilt in their original layouts with new graphics –&nbsp;given the faster cruising speed in this sequel, the lap times will be a bit faster.</p>

<p>City Trial is the vehicular combat mode, gathering up stat points to enhance your vehicle before a final Stadium battle takes place. A new Team Battle mode takes the 16-player lobbies and splits them into two teams to work together, and then everyone to face off in the same Stadium.</p>
<p>A new game mode, Road Trip, which combines Air Ride, Top Ride and City Trial together in a string of challenges to take on, going head-to-head with rival characters. It builds up to encounters with a mysterious figure that provides some narrative impetus to this game’s solo play.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of this is meant to be enjoyed in multiplayer. There’s up to four player split screen, and when with two players you can choose the direction of the split-screen, which is neat. What’s good to hear is that Switch 1 controllers and the GameCube recreation controller will all be supported.</p>
<p>Heading online, you can do so socially, meeting up with friends in the Paddock, a lobby space where you run around, get to watch a big screen, select music and just hang.</p>
<p>For competitively minded players, you’ll have an online license that shows your Global Power Rating –&nbsp;literally a number of how many people you’re better than –&nbsp;and a coloured shape that acts as your rank. This rank is set individually per game mode, and can affect how City Trial matches play out. You’ll be able to customise your license with fresh backgrounds, and even sparkles.</p>
<p>Beyond all this, Sakurai-san regularly diverted to share new copy abilities, vehicles and riders. There’s a lot of characters to choose from here, including… Rock (the literal rock) and Rick, the hamster. There’s also a Transform Star vehicle, which swaps between star form and bike form modes (which feels a bit OP?), top speed Formula Star, jumping Hop Star, and so many more.</p>
<p>A full set of five Kirby Air Rider amiibo are on the way for Kirby, Bandana Waddle Dee, Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Chef Kawasaki, all with swappable Star vehicles. The Tank Star can also have its tracks reoriented. The amiibo let you save and train up an AI, but can also just be scanned to change the pose and models featured in your main menu cursor.</p>

<p>Here’s some more bullet point details:</p>
<ul>
<li>All localisation languages have both male and female announcers.</li>
<li>You can set a different announcer for matches and story narration.</li>
<li>Time Trial records are tracked per machine.</li>
<li>There are no online leaderboards.</li>
<li>City Trial has a Free Run mode to let you explore Skyah, test vehicles and more. Field Events won’t happen in this mode, though.</li>
<li>A Photo Mode is available throughout the game.</li>
<li>A Stadiums-only mode is available separate from City Trial</li>
<li>You can remove stadiums from City Trial, if you don’t like them, or set filters.</li>
<li>The VS. King Dedede Stadium has been reimagined as VS. Boss against the transforming Robo Dedede.</li>
<li>The Checklist returns with rewards for certain game missions and achievements, filling in a picture puzzle.</li>
<li>There’s a new vehicle decoration feature called My Machine.</li>
<li>A Machine Market lets you use earned currency to buy the designs of other players.</li>
<li>Riders can also be styled up with headware.</li>
<li>The earned currency is Miles from actively driving.</li>
<li>You’ll earn “gummies” from defeating rivals, and can mess around with them like a gummy-obsessed Scrooge McDuck.</li>
<li>The soundtrack comes from Shogo Sakai and Noriyuki Iwadare.</li>
<li>You can customise how likely tracks are to be played.</li>
<li>The main menu is themed after a desk</li>
<li>You can remap buttons, to the extend you could play the game one-handed.</li>
<li>Colour filters are in place to help with colourblindness.</li>
<li>You can change the FOV, reduce camera shake and more.</li>
<li>DLC is&nbsp;<em>not</em> planned for Kirby Air Riders – everything they want to put in the game is already there.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/popular-survival-game-enshrouded-launch-update-november-10/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/popular-survival-game-enshrouded-to-launch-%E2%80%98wake-of-the-water%E2%80%99-update-on-november-10.1332718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>German developer Keen Games announced that its popular survival game Enshrouded will receive its largest free content update on November 10.</p>



<p>The update, titled Wake of the Water, introduces dynamic water as well as swimming, a fishing mini-game, watering plants via watering can or irrigation, terraforming, and basebuilding within, around, and under water. Players will find new fish and land-based critters, like Veilwater Snapjaws, crabs, and capybaras. The latter can be tamed for those looking forward to having a capybara chilling at the base.</p>



<p>Wake of the Water introduces many more improvements to Enshrouded, though. The user interface has been reworked, and items have been rebalanced across the whole game. To begin with, weapon stats now match their name and visuals (e.g., Ice Coated Daggers now properly deal ice damage instead of just cut and pierce). Weapon durability has increased and now scales with both level and rarity, improving weapon longevity. That said, existing (pre-update) weapons will retain their current stats, so only new drops after this update will show the improvements.</p>



<p>Numerous new weapons have been added to enemy drops, which now scale with enemy level and range in rarity from common to legendary. Players can also craft any lore weapon previously unlocked, at any game stage and any item level. This lets fans upgrade favorites (like the light-emitting Whailing Blade) as they progress, countering unlucky RNG and supporting all playstyles. Armor, rings, and food items also received stat tweaks, bolstering their relevance and gameplay effectiveness for all classes and builds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Keen Games also fixed the long-time bug where loot chests could be repeatedly looted via server reload. Passive HP, stamina, and mana regeneration have also been adjusted, resulting in decreased regeneration in the mid-to-late game. This change is meant to prevent trivializing combat encounters while encouraging Enshrouded players to plan ahead by preparing potions, eating meals, etc.</p>



<p>The Wake of the Water update introduces some new consumable and decorative items and quality-of-life features: expect new items that provide buffs, ranging from food to decor, along with the ability to label chests and signs.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/">over four million players as part of its player base</a>, the Enshrouded team is slowly but surely getting closer to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned 1.0 launch on PC and consoles in 2026</a>. Will you jump in for this update or wait for the full version?</p>

			<p>If you had to rank the three video game console manufacturers based on how well they're doing commercially in 2025, the answer for numbers one and two could differ from person to person, with some seeing Nintendo as solidly in first, and others seeing PlayStation. But without a doubt, Microsoft and Xbox are in third place, and it's from this position, from well behind its two biggest competitors, that Microsoft and Xbox management are reportedly asking its studios to hit profit margin goals far above the industry average.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok">Bloomberg</a> shows that Microsoft and Xbox are setting <strong>30% profit margin</strong> goals for its internal studios. This isn't for every project, as the report clarifies that "<em>Not every project is expected to hit the 30% profit threshold,</em>" per Bloomberg's sources, "<em>but many Xbox developers and groups have been presented with the new target</em>."</p>



<p>The average profit margins for the rest of the industry have fallen between 17% and 22% since 2018, per the report and analysis from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Neil Barbour, analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, even distinguished 30% or higher margins as the kind of goal you'd set if you were "<em>a publisher that is really nailing it.</em>"</p>







<p>Thanks to court documents we saw as part of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/">closing out its Activision Blizzard acquisition in 2023</a>, we know that just two years ago, the profit margin for Xbox and the gaming division sat at just 12% for most of 2022. Once that merger closed in October 2023, Bloomberg's report claims that Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, implemented the new 30% goal, as if to say that Xbox needed to start making back the money that was spent on making franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush first-party franchises.</p>



<p>Gambles like putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/">haven't necessarily paid off though</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">at least that's how it seems</a>, since in the last two years after that 30% profit margin goal was set, Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">laid off thousands</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">employees within its gaming division</a>, closed <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">its own studios</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancelled several highly anticipated projects</a>. </p>



<p>It's worth pointing out that the layoffs aren't entirely due to Xbox Game Studios not hitting the profit margin. We know that while that goal exists, Microsoft has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">investing more into AI</a> and would seemingly close, cut, and sell off any project to free up capital to invest even more. But knowing that the company's leadership is asking its game studios to hit well above the industry average does help to explain how leadership gets to the conclusion that these <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">mass layoffs</a> and publishing its first-party titles on competing platforms are necessary.</p>



<p>Of course, you could argue that Amy Hood and Microsoft are setting the gaming division up to fail, because again, Microsoft is nowhere close to being the industry-leading titan we saw in its Xbox 360 days. The sentiment that Microsoft wants out of the video game business is one that continues to grow online, and if that's the end goal for Microsoft, then its playbook of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">cutting projects from its expert developers</a>, setting unreasonable profit margin goals, and constantly upsetting its consumer base with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">price hikes on products</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">services</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/">pushing features nobody asked for</a> is a solid one.</p>



<p>The report continues to say that the projects likely to get priority within Microsoft and Xbox will be "<em>cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls</em>," which also sounds like we're in for cheaply made games and live service bets that don't try to do anything other than make as much money as possible.</p>



<p>A Microsoft spokesperson quoted in the report adds, "<em>We look at the business as a whole, balancing creativity, innovation, and sustainability across a diverse portfolio of offerings. As with any creative business, sometimes that means making hard decisions and stopping work on things that are no longer working for a variety of reasons, and shifting resources toward the projects that are more aligned with our direction and priorities</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a lot of feedback on the XP farm nerfs, Battlefield 6 developers have revealed that progression is being tested on PvE and curated servers. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 XP farms and bot lobbies were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerfed</a> recently, after players were seen using them to primarily earn XP, player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.” However, since then, a lot of feedback has poured in, with players calling for solo lobbies for a more relaxed experience and the option to play as they wish. The developers have now responded to this feedback, revealing they will be testing progression in some curated BF6 servers. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-will-now-feature-progression-eligible-or-not-eligible-lobbies">Battlefield 6 Will Now Feature Progression Eligible or Not Eligible Lobbies </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/they-just-keep-winning-steam-was-already-beating-every-store-at-finding-games-and-it-just-got-better-with-custom-calendars-showing-recent-and-upcoming-games-valve-thinks-youll-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, community manager Shepard has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/811336158986581167/?ctp=2#c599667160179125243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to the feedback on the Battlefield 6 XP farm nerfs. Shepard first spoke about how the devs understand that many players “want full progression in solo/co-op and on curated custom servers—not just in matchmade PvP.” Some players have also expressed frustration with the game’s messaging regarding progression eligibility, whereas others worry about stat/leaderboard integrity and bot-farm exploits.</p>



<p>The developers understand that players with less time prefer low-stress PvE and still want meaningful unlocks, which is why they are enabling account XP and unlock/unlock-track progression in solo/co-op, as well as a curated list of community servers. However, to safeguard the integrity, K/D, leaderboards, and certain mastery tallies won’t update in these spaces during the test. If the data indicates low exploit/noise on these servers, they will expand eligibility. </p>



<p>At the same time, the developers don’t want XP farms in Battlefield 6, hence some anti-farm guardrails have been put in place. These include minimum difficulty, activity checks (AFK/loop detection), mixed target requirements, and sensible XP-per-minute caps. Any server that raises flags regarding exploits will lose its “Progression Eligible” status until the issue is fixed. Moreover, clear labelling will be put in place for Progression Eligible or Not Eligible on the browser and pre-match screens, with a short tooltip explaining the rationale.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2-review.1332700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If Star Trek is the optimistic dream of what humanity could become, The Outer Worlds 2 is the nihilistic nightmare of what it will probably be. Thankfully, both make for highly entertaining material to explore, and this second run through Obsidian’s corporate dystopia is a significant step up from the original. With a story that’s more grounded and interesting, significantly more competent combat, and an irresistible RPG grind, I had a blast putting my fist through the kafkaesque final frontier alongside a cast of memorable companions, even when a weak first act and some truly terrible enemy variety made the going less exciting. Across the more than 65 hours my completionist playthrough took, I fought with myself over moral dilemmas, giggled at absurd worldbuilding, and brought several would-be dictators to their knees – that’s exactly what the for-profit space doctor ordered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 is a good old-fashioned single-player, open-world RPG in the same vein as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review"><u>Dragon Age</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review"><u>Fallout</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review"><u>Avowed</u></a>. Y’know, the ones where you’re an especially cool person given undue authority to insert yourself into the various conflicts of the world and decide the fate of all living beings while collecting a cast of snarky companions in the process? Well, as a followup to 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review"><u>The Outer Worlds</u></a> and a sorta, kinda followup to 2010’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/19/fallout-new-vegas-review"><u>Fallout: New Vegas</u></a>, Obsidian is at it again with a very similar blueprint here. It lays out a new dystopia to shoot your way through as you level up, grab every piece of loot within reach, and solve all the galaxy’s long-standing problems in no time at all. It’s not the most novel concept, to be sure, but it’s one I love that we simply don’t get enough of, and pulls it off better than the vast majority of recent attempts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sequel returns to a wonderfully satirical alternate reality where unfettered capitalism has conquered the stars to turn majestic celestial bodies into tacky outdoor strip malls. Though it shares the same pessimistic vision for the future, it ditches the first game’s Halcyon system for a different part of the galaxy called Arcadia, with a fresh batch of planets for you to single-handedly decide the fate of. More prominent than the new planets to explore though is a distinct shift in tone. While there’s still plenty of goofy jokes and ways to make your trek through corporate-owned space completely absurd, this sequel is much more interested in telling a grounded story – one that focuses squarely on the politics of Arcadia’s various factions and repeatedly forces you to make judgement calls on which of these deeply flawed organizations is the lesser evil.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While there are still plenty of goofs, this sequel tells a more grounded story.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That bet on more serious topics and the delicate balance of warring political entities is one that pays off, thankfully, and I found myself genuinely torn by who to side with and even frustrated by my inability to appeal to the better angels of these selfish, power hungry monsters, which is exactly what I look for in these kinds of make-your-mark-on-the-world games. The way you’re positioned as a central figure who will decide which of these power-hungry factions will emerge victorious is quite reminiscent of one of my favorite Obsidian RPGs, Fallout: New Vegas, and just like with that one, there aren’t any truly good answers here. Auntie’s Choice is a supposedly freedom-forward capitalistic organization that actually functions as an oppressive, monopolistic pseudo-government that would make Helldivers 2 proud, while The Protectorate is an openly fascistic society that seeks to suppress any thought diverging from their orthodoxy, and choosing which of these two vipers nests gets to control the fate of an entire planet is rarely straightforward. Even the groups that seem more reasonable like the Order of the Ascendant, which uses science and math to predict the future as it tries to guide humanity towards enlightenment, will get caught casually committing atrocities to prevent some supposed future they’ve seen through their abacus, which made me ponder if their way of life was actually any better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When The Outer Worlds 2 is putting the political jockeying front and center, it’s sick as hell, and without question has some of the coolest worldbuilding and satisfyingly perilous moral dilemmas I’ve seen in some time – but it takes its sweet time getting there, mostly focusing on this conflict in its second half. For the first half of the story, you’ll instead prioritize a humdrum revenge quest I cared about so little that I actually forgot it was even the first act’s main focus by the time I reached credits. In fairness, they do use this early time to introduce you to the principle movers and shakers in Arcadia while you seek vengeance, which sets it up for a much stronger second act, but for the first 20 or so hours felt like the main story was quite slow and unengaging. It does rally if you can hang in there for a bit, but I wish it was more consistent throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One area that is much more consistent is the absolutely gripping RPG climb, which sunk its teeth into me from moment one with a near-constant stream of interesting decisions to make about who my character was and how in the heck he was going to be able to save the galaxy. With only two skill points earned per level to spend across 12 skills that make you good at everything from Leadership to Lockpicking, you’ve got some serious decisions to make about what you want to excel in. This becomes an even more stressful decision once you take a look at the enormous list of perks, which can only be unlocked if you’ve sufficiently bought into the relevant prerequisite skills. That includes things like the ability to pickpocket others, which only becomes available to those who have leveled up Sneak, or another perk that allows you to sell increasingly unbelievable lies as you improve your Speech skill. You’re only allowed to buy 15 of these bad boys before you hit the level cap of 30, so planning out your ideal spacefaring badass and making sure you’ve got the skills you need to get the job done becomes very compelling, and I found myself hungrily looking for enemies to kill and side quests to complete to feed my XP habit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The absolutely gripping RPG climb sunk its teeth into me from moment one.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the best part of this power climb is how it manifests in unexpected ways in the form of flaws. The Outer Worlds 2 tracks the things your character does in search of certain trends, then provides opportunities for you to lean into those quirks by offering benefits that come at a cost. For example, if you tend to steal a lot, you might be offered the Kleptomaniac flaw, which allows you to sell all your stolen goods for more money, but also makes your character steal things automatically from time-to-time, which can get you in quite a bit of trouble with the locals. Alternatively, if you skip through a lot of dialogue, you’ll be offered the Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome flaw, which gives you bonus XP but forces you to choose all your dialogue options under a very short time limit before choosing an option for you randomly. Each of these has pretty massive implications on how you play and are irreversible, which can lead to all sorts of hilarious mistakes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on in my playthrough, I was tempted by a Jack of All Trades flaw offered to me, which gave me a whole extra skill point every time I leveled up, but came at the cost of never being able to raise a skill more than one point above my lowest rated skill. This seemed like a pretty fair trade at the time, but I quickly realized that my character was now just bad at pretty much everything and constantly ran into roadblocks in my journey that made me thoroughly regret my decision (although it actually made for a pretty great way to play for the purposes of this review, since I got a taste of being semi-good at every skill on the roster). Even when these choices went on to haunt me for the rest of my playthrough, I couldn’t help but love them, and if anything it made me excited for subsequent playthroughs where I could learn from the error of my ways and perhaps stumble across some new flaws to saddle myself with.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 Character Creation - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor, you spend most of your time exploring the wild frontiers of untamed planets while staring down the barrel of a rifle and/or stabbing jugulars, and this is an area of significant improvement since the last time we were let loose in this setting. While the first Outer Worlds was mostly passable when it came to combat, this sequel manages to level up to “generally enjoyable” with snappier gunplay, improved mobility that has you sliding and double jumping around, and, most importantly, an arsenal of weapons that feels much better suited for the gloriously goofy sci-fi setting. I found so many weird and unexpected weapons with unique effects, like a shotgun that fires shots completely silently and instantly melts its target so bodies can’t be found (especially useful when trying to go undetected), and another weapon that started out weak but leveled up as I scored kills until is was an absolute beast (and which made me want to rewatch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/solo-leveling-season-1-review"><u>Solo Leveling</u></a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only that, but there are a ton of ways to customize your weapons and armor with loads of mods you can buy and craft. Those do things like reduce your damage output overall to gain explosive rounds or better protect yourself against a certain elemental effect – and this is without me going into some of the truly bonkers and unique options that I won’t spoil here! They really do a lot more to make your rewards for exploring and completing quests more interesting and befitting of the silly world around you, which makes all the difference in the world. As you might expect, combat still has its quirks, like how the reticle on weapons often feels a bit more slippery than I’d like and how enemies would sometimes manage to hit me in melee even though I’d double-jumped a meter over their head. If you’re (unrealistically) hoping this has caught up with the best practices of a proper FPS like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>, then you’re likely going to be disappointed, but it’s still at least a huge step up compared to the average open-world RPG, and that’s something.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest letdown with combat is definitely the enemy variety.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest letdown with combat is definitely the enemy variety, which usually features two or three types of wild animal on each world that you see way too much of for several hours at a time, alongside your standard humanoid enemies and a few robotic foes here and there. You’ll encounter a whole helluva lot of Raptidon creatures from the original, for example, and I found myself extremely sick of seeing them before I’d even left the first planet, much less by the time I entered the final stretch and was still running into them. It’s pretty disappointing that in a galaxy filled with so much promise, there’s practically no surprises in terms of the adversaries you face after only a few hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even worse, The Outer Worlds 2 does the same thing as Avowed where all the enemies you encounter are finite and placed in specific spots in the world, and once you kill them they’re gone for good. This means that eventually you’ll be running through large swathes of the map utterly devoid of life, which makes areas feel very empty and also removes any possibility for random and unexpected encounters to occur. I’m not entirely sure why Obsidian keeps taking this approach, as I thought it was a detriment in Avowed as well, but they’ve stuck with it here and I still don’t dig it. That said, there’s at least a pretty decent fast travel system that let me jump around to important areas rather than backtracking through completely dead space, which I feel like I did a fair amount in Avowed. So even though it was disappointing to see this approach return, I ran into the ramifications of it far less frequently.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of running around, The Outer Worlds 2 has four main destinations, each with their own particular vibe, usually dictated by whichever faction has controlling interest, from the monk-like temples hidden in the snow on Cloister to the busy backwaters in the jungles of Eden. Exploring each is a lot of fun as you kill stuff, learn about the world, recruit new members to your party, and feverishly check off every quest on the map. I felt like I was always finding someone interesting to talk to or some loot just out of reach for me to puzzle through. All of that usually made for a good time, apart from the previously mentioned enemy repetition and the empty map that results from killing them, which does make for a very feast and famine situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like real life, a story-focused RPG is only as good as the companions who follow you around, judging your every decision, and this is one area where The Outer Worlds 2 most improves upon its predecessor. The six mostly-memorable characters you befriend and travel alongside each stand as a representative of the respective organization from which they hail. For example, Tristan, a heavily-armored brute serves as the group’s cop, eager to carry out his authoritarian government’s twisted form of justice on pretty much everyone you meet, while Inez, an entrepreneurial combat medic, is constantly reminding you of the virtues of the so-called free market enterprises she grew up with. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite RPGs</h3><p>If you're looking to get transported to another world, here are my the best escape destinations I can think of!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-mass-effect-2-review"><u>Mass Effect</u></a> and Fallout before it, this tactic of making your party members serve as mouthpieces for each of the world’s factions is incredibly effective. It both immediately makes each companion’s worldview crystal clear and also helps you understand the powers at play and the philosophical disagreements that become pretty important for you to know as you start making decisions that massively alter the balance of power. Even if you’re not reading every journal entry you stumble across or following every bit of dialogue, it’s almost impossible not to become intimately familiar with Arcadia’s most important players just by absorbing it from your comrades, which makes it much easier to care about the story and the ultimate fate of the galaxy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there are still some companions who are a little less compelling, like Niles, an engineer who is mostly defined by a revenge quest that can resolve itself fairly early on in your journey, leaving little reason to bring him with you, and Valerie, a robot assistant who has some pretty amusing one-liners, but feels fairly disconnected from the story compared to the others. Unfortunately, these characters are the ones who appear earliest in the story, which makes a fairly bad first impression compared to how much better they eventually get. Although, now that I think about it… that is sorta a time-honored tradition in RPGs of this kind, isn’t it?</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 doesn’t try to rewrite Obsidian’s RPG playbook, but it’s yet another strong refinement, with smoother combat, diabolically compelling buildcrafting and loot, and a story that immediately made me want to start again to see an alternate outcome. The sluggish first act and lack of enemy variety make it a bit of a slog at certain times, but once its story of political intrigue kicks in and the new flaws and perks system gets its claws in you, it can be quite hard to put down. All these improvements put The Outer Worlds 2 that much closer to being the Fallout: New Vegas successor we hoped this series would be, and that’s worth getting excited about.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The bit of reporting I'm about to relay to you probably isn't surprising, but it's worth making sure you've got a pillow on standby to scream into once you've digested it. Microsoft, they of more money than a company could ever need or know what to do with, have reportedly spent the last two years pushing Xbox to deliver profit margins which are well above the industry average. Cue all of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everwild-screenshots-leak-after-microsoft-cancellation-and-youd-seemingly-have-been-a-walking-garden-centre">cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">shutterings</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins">Bloomberg</a> have reported this profits push, which they cite as having seen company execs set an across-the-board goal of 30% profit margins, or "accountability margins" as they're known in Microsoft corpospeak. Not every individual game or project is expected to hit the 30% mark, but lots of developers across Xbox have been made aware of the target, the report claims.</p>
<p>The 30% goal reportedly came into force from autumn 2023, when Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood's team took up a more prominent role, with Xbox moving away from a past which Bloomberg's sources claim wasn't as doggedly driven by financial metrics as the be all and end all.</p>
<p>To put the margin being aimed for in context, Bloomberg turn to data analytics firm S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, who put the average profit margin in the games industry at between 17% and 22% in recent years. Xbox's profit margins over the past six years are cited as has having landed somewhere between the 10% and 20% marks. According to S&amp;P analyst Neil Barbour, hitting 30% or more is "usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it".</p><p>Along with the move we've already seen Xbox make towards cross-platform releases which aim to maximise the cash a game can bring in, rather than using it as a tool to try and tempt players onto Xbox consoles or Game Pass, the report cites sources as having pointed to an increasing risk averseness in terms of the games Microsoft green light as a likely consequence going forwards. Basically, if it ain't massive and dripping with clear cash-grabbing potential, it might not get made. Meanwhile, on the hardware front, that division's suggested to possibly be in line for "a significant rethinking".</p>
<p>It's a state of affairs you could guess pretty easily just by reading the tea leaves of the corp's moves over the past year and a bit, but damn if it isn't still depressing to have the unnecessarily greedy motivation behind it all reported in black and white.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The five weeks between now and Black Friday are going to move way faster than you think — don’t they always? So when crazy-huge discounts pop up ahead of schedule, it’s smart to do some early-bird shopping. Here’s a fat, tasty worm of a tech deal that’s live now at Amazon: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4946/">Save 72% off the price of this 17-inch HP Flagship laptop bundled with Windows 11 Pro, an 8-core Intel processor, and more.</a> It’s just $720 — a huge dropdown from its list price of $2,600.</p>
<p>Will there be laptop deals on Black Friday and all throughout Cyber Week? Of course, and probably more than you could shake a stick at. But we can’t swear there will be one with specs like this HP Flagship: huge anti-glare HD+ display, processor hitting speeds up to 3.80GHz, UHD graphics, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for built-in storage. This deal could be a great opportunity to buy now so you can sit back and enjoy cold turkey sandwiches while everyone else is scrambling on Black Friday.</p>

<h2>Ready for Anything</h2>

                <p>With Fallout Day finally here and the internet buzzing with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">talk of remakes, remasters</a>, and maybe even a brand-new entry in Bethesda's iconic post-apocalyptic series, one Hollywood star has jumped into the conversation. Actor Danny Trejo, the fan-favorite tough guy from From Dusk Till Dawn, Machete, and Spy Kids--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/check-out-this-fallout-4-danny-trejo-character/1100-6433701/" data-ref-id="1100-6433701">and huge Fallout fan</a>--made his opinion crystal clear <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallout/p/DQHdlH_jQeS/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on social media</a>: He wants Fallout: New Vegas back--and now.</p><p>Trejo, who actually voiced the ghoul mechanic Raul Alfonso Tejada in New Vegas, commented on Bethesda's official Instagram post with, "Remaster New Vegas boss!" followed by a fire emoji. That message sent shockwaves through the Wasteland, garnering almost 1,600 likes.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trejo's wish wasn’t included in Bethesda’s official lineup for Fallout Day. During the celebration, the studio is set to show off more from Fallout 76's upcoming Burning Springs expansion out this December, and yes, that includes Walton Goggins returning as The Ghoul from the hit Fallout TV series. There are also updates coming to Fallout 4 and Fallout Shelter, plus new content via Creations, Bethesda's name for officially supported community mods. Fans can also expect merch drops, live events, and a post-show dedicated to the ever-passionate Fallout community.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589664" data-ratio="0.64071856287425" data-width="1169" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589664"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Instagram/Lan Pitts</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg"></figure><p>Fallout has had a pretty good year in reaching fans outside the games, partially thanks to the success of the Prime Video show. It even had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/universal-teases-fallout-and-five-nights-at-freddys-halloween-horror-nights-houses/1100-6533789/" data-ref-id="1100-6533789">its own haunted house at this year's Halloween Horror Nights</a> at Universal Studios. Professional sports are getting in on the fun with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pro-hockey-team-is-hosting-fallout-night-in-partnership-with-bethesda/1100-6535586/" data-ref-id="1100-6535586">themed jerseys for Fallout Night</a>.</p><p>Still, the rumor mill is spinning faster than a Gatling laser. With The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered now out and whispers of a Fallout 3 remaster having leaked back in 2023, fans are convinced that New Vegas might not be far behind. And while everyone's dreaming of a full Fallout 5 reveal, Bethesda has made it clear that it won't happen anytime soon, as the team is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">focusing on The Elder Scrolls VI first</a>.</p><p>Bethesda boss Todd Howard reminded fans earlier this year that the studio doesn't want to rush its next big project. "We totally get the desire for a new single-player game," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he told YouTuber MrMattyPlays last year</a>. "But these things take time--we just want to get it right."</p><p>The last mainline Fallout release was Fallout 4 back in 2015, followed by Fallout 76 in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/" data-ref-id="1100-6522828">which found a new surge of popularity thanks to Prime Video's Fallout TV show</a>. So while the vault door to Fallout 5 may stay sealed for a while longer, it's clear Bethesda wants every future entry to be a true nuclear event in gaming history.</p>
