The world's largest digital TTRPG distribution has implemented a new browsing option, allowing consumers to search for games and supplements made by human hands.</p>

<h2>The DrivethruRPG AI-Content Filter Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an update on <a href="https://help.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/articles/26794784634007-Customer-Experience-with-AI-Generated-Content-Within-Titles#h_01J97G88WDYDR5K4EXEH739R99" rel="nofollow">their official website</a>, the DrivethruRPG AI-Content filter lets users toggle how much content made by generative AI they see on the platform.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drivethrurpg-ai-content-filter-screenshot.jpg?itok=oPGuF4nO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drivethrurpg-ai-content-filter-screenshot.jpg?itok=A0JdXQD9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a User Account Settings under Additional Preferences, users can choose one of three options under "Creation Method." Handcrafted is for those who want games made by flesh and blood human beings. The worldbuilding, the text, the mechanics, and the artwork; all human-made.</p>

<p>Conversely, the Contains AI-Generated Content option is for those who are fine with products containing material made from generative AI programs. The product in question cannot be entirely AI-generated due to an official content policy by the platform. The third option, Creation Method Not Chosen, is the default.</p>

<p>If you are using the more recent version of DrivethruRPG, the AI-content filter is a simple on/off toggle alongside adult content.</p>

This is due to its current use across multiple tech companies <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem">actively stealing</a> work from users to train their programs.</p>

<p>This practice has also led to widespread energy usage and resource drainage. This is exemplified by Microsoft negotiating a deal to r<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5120581/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-microsoft-ai">eopen Three Mile Island</a> in the US as a power source for their own cloud and AI power usage.</p>

<p>It is a subject that hasn't just lead to greater scrutiny of material used in large productions, and it has lead to several publishers and creatives to take stances on their use.</p>

<p><em>Tales of the Valiant</em> designer and publisher Kobold Press <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank">is proudly anti-AI</a>. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vocalized support</a> of the use of AI in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, which lead to their communications director, Greg Tito, leaving the company. And recently the streaming service platform Netflix has announced they are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">going all in</a> on generative AI for their gaming division.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/foxhole">Foxhole</a> is one of my favourite games to read about, even if I don't play it. It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.
</p>
<p>Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

<p>Dropping bombs on the world below? I get it. Delivering paratroopers behind enemy lines? I love it. I'm less clear on how air-to-air combat works. There's a shot in the trailer of two nimble fighter planes diving and shooting down some bombers operating at a lower height, but I'm struggling to work out how that actually functions as a player action.
</p><p>Otherwise air combat plugs into Foxhole's vast battlefield is obvious ways. It expands the logistical side of the game, as players will need to work to support aircraft production and supply, and "every pilot is a player", as the trailer says, with players also able to play a gunner role onboard. 
</p>
<p>Foxhole Airborne follows on from Foxhole: Naval Warfare, which added ship-to-ship combat and beach landings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/foxholes-massive-naval-warfare-update-is-out-now-adding-gunboats-and-subs-to-its-persistent-battlefield">in October last year</a>. It means that the game will now feature land, sea and air combat all on the same persistent battlefield.
</p>
<p>Lest foot soldiers feel they're being neglected, an infantry update will arrive later this month on November 18th. It aims to revamp combat, with new anti-tank weaponry, close quarters combat, medic changes, and a stamina and suppression overhaul, among others. It sounds like a robust set of changes. You'll find screenshots of that, and of more planes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/505460/view/4438953498491486592">in a developer news post over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I need to entertain the notion that I have some power. I need to remember that fascism is a loser ideology and that it can be dismantled, and I will gain all of this by replaying Bethesda and MachineGames’ <em>Wolfenstein </em>games and literally tearing men-turned-monsters to pieces. <strong>If I can’t have the real thing, I want to virtually preside over the rotting husk of fascism in </strong><em><strong>Wolfenstein</strong></em><strong>, which is widely available on platforms but is specifically on PlayStation Plus’s Games Catalog (at the Extra tier or higher), Xbox Game Pass, and, by extension, PC Game Pass.</strong></p><p>In case you don’t know, <em>Wolfenstein </em>is a series of first-person shooters following B.J. Blazkowicz, an American soldier who effectively goes missing during World War II. In <em>Wolfenstein</em>’s version of history, the Allied Powers lose the war and the Nazis conquer the world. Their ineptitude and hate creeps into every facet of life as far as the eye can see. Though the first game in this rebooted series, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-makes-wolfenstein-the-new-order-so-great-1797195901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-makes-wolfenstein-the-new-order-so-great-1797195901"><em>The New Order</em></a></span>, largely takes place on the European front, the sequel shifts focus to America and beyond and interrogates how such an ideology could fit a country that once swore to combat it.</p><p>Nazis have been the de facto villains of a lot of stories both inside and outside of games, but the <em>Wolfenstein </em>reboots were the first games I played to take them deathly seriously. Perhaps <em>The New Order </em>was just a little ahead of the curve, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1819979622&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1819979622"><em>The New Colossus</em></a></span><em> </em>landed in 2017—mere months after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville—and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-six-months-later-1825582710&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-ii-six-months-later-1825582710">met the moment head-on</a></span>, depicting fascism in our country as though it were baked into our very being. Who am I to argue with that assessment now?<br></p><p>Besides its lofty interrogations of Nazism though, the <em>Wolfenstein </em>series is also well known for its gritty gameplay. Like its earliest incarnations, these shooters did <em>not </em>feature regenerating health, instead offering armor and health as pickups to be found around the map or in combat. Much like the <em>DOOM </em>reboot of 2016, this inspired players to push forward and be aggressive in order to survive, a tactic that sounds all too good right now. <em>Wolfenstein </em>forces you to be scrappy, and the skirmishes that arise from the tension of scrambling under such duress are among some of the genre’s best.<br></p><p>I’ve always described <em>Wolfenstein</em>’s action and gunplay as punchy. Its guns have a tremendous kick to them. They communicate an overwhelming, almost frightening amount of power, which makes it oh-so-good to point said weapons at literal Nazis. Over the course of the games, B.J.’s armory expands, but he also becomes a proper Nazi deterrent. Through means that I won’t entirely spoil, the man essentially becomes a hulking tank capable of smashing, slashing, and otherwise ripping fascists to shreds. Describing it now, I’m almost giddy to jump back into the games in the days to come.</p><p>I don’t know, y’all. That’s all I’ve got for you right now. I’m a ball of pure seething anger, and I can only really safely project that into a false reality by playing <em>Wolfenstein </em>at the moment. Otherwise, I’m feeling as defeated as many of you. The rest of my life was just decided for me overnight, and I could do little to stop it. Things are going to happen, exceptionally bad things, and I’ll be helpless to stop most of it. But I can shoot some Nazis in <em>Wolfenstein</em>, rally, and get back to the real fight as soon as I can. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokemon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flip a coin until you get tails.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the current Pokemon TCG Pocket meta continues to shake out, players are quickly figuring out which decks, cards, and strategies are powerful, which are safe, and which are...wildly inconsistent. And there's one card that everyone seems to agree they hate, whether they're using it or facing an opponent with it: Misty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Misty is a Supporter card, essentially a type of card that can be played once per turn to give yourself an advantageous effect. Misty is explicitly designed for use in decks featuring water-type Pokemon, and comes with the following effect: "Choose one of your water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until you get tails.

        <p>Our review will splash down next week</p>

            <p>We'll have a review of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> soon, but I keep making Brendy do other tasks so he's not had enough time yet to ride the rails. That means it falls to me to at least let you know that Frontier's theme park builder is out now.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The sequel's big new feature is the ability to fill your theme park with water, crafting pools and slides alongside your more traditional rides, or combining the two Splash Mountain-style.
</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 was announced back in July and Brendy had a chance to play it at preview in September, where he found it mostly offered the same creative charms as the first in the series:
</p>
<blockquote>Much of what made up the first game returns. The focus is still on creating your own rides and attractions from scratch, rather than relying on pre-made roller coasters and water flumes (though those will still exist for those who prefer to pre-plop). That encouragement to piece things together even goes for the snack kiosks and changing rooms, which can be embedded in the shells of other buildings, like clicking together modular toy models.</blockquote>
<p>The original Planet Coaster led creative and patient souls to craft some truly wild rides, but its reputation as a management game was less positive. I'm curious if Planet Coaster 2 can make the game more appealing to me, someone who can't be bothered to craft an original and physically feasible rollercoaster from scratch, but who does enjoy designing a capitalist hellscape which siphons the money-marrow from customer's wallets. Hopefully Brendy will answer that question next week.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Steam user reviews <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/">aren't looking too hot</a>, but you can pick up the game for £40/€50/$50 if you're already convinced.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-tactics-the-surprising-genre-twist-of-the-classic-run-and-gunner-is-out-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>I would never have predicted there'd be an isometric tactics game based on run-and-gun series Metal Slug, yet here <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a> is, and I am here for it. We've been following its development for a while but it's out now on Steam, and seemingly as strong as its demo suggested.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Metal Slug Tactics is a tactical RPG, to be specific, as well as a roguelite. You fight your way through squads of enemies to unlock weapons and perks for your own soldiers, with those upgrades persisting across the campaign even if you fail and must repeat specific missions.
</p>
<p>Nic mostly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-tactics-demo-is-pure-nostalgia-for-better-and-worse">praised the demo during June's Steam Next Fest</a>, finding it had more tactical depth than the nostalgic copy-paste he was expecting:
</p>
<blockquote>Every turn each character gets one move and one action, but if you take the action first, you also lose your move. This feels on the more restrictive end as far as action economies go, but you can use "synchronisation" attacks to stretch that economy out, further than a pack of Subway meat over a thousand anemic dirt-loafs. These are special tag-team actions you trigger for free by setting up orthogonal flanking postions. For now, though, it’s just Marco. I can pick between a pistol and a machine gun, but the latter has limited ammo. It’s here I notice some nice quality-of-life bits. You can undo moves and fast forward enemy turns, though there is a restriction on the undo-ing, which I’ll unfurl below like a yellowing lettuce leaf on a stale roll that costs eighteen pounds, or sixteen pounds with ten years' worth of Subway loyalty points.</blockquote>
<p>Nic also took a lot of shots at Subway sandwiches in that article, for he does not acknowledge the glory of the Italian BMT.
</p>
<p>Metal Slug Tactics' demo no longer seems to be available - boo - but the game itself is currently £18.89/$22.49/€22.49 with a 10% launch discount <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590760/Metal_Slug_Tactics/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The question is: Are you one of those potential people who will care about what the PS5 Pro offers? Let’s find out! I’m going to ask some questions, and we’ll figure out if you should buy a PS5 Pro. I’m here to help, so answer truthfully, and we’ll get through this together.</p><h2 id="h25337"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you have a 120hz 4K TV?</strong></h2><p>The PS5 technically supports 120 FPS video games, but in practice, most games can only manage 60 FPS on the base console. If that annoys you and you wish for more opportunities to play 120 FPS games, then the PS5 Pro will provide that. But you’ll need a 120hz TV to actually play games at 120 FPS. Likewise, the PS5 Pro—thanks to its AI upscaling tech known as PSSR—can run many games at 4K, leading to a sharper and cleaner image. But, again, if your TV is only 1080p, you won’t really get to enjoy that fancy upscaled 4K image.</p><p>I have a big, 4K 120hz TV with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), which ensures gameplay is often smooth because my TV adjusts to the game’s frame rate, and all the bells and whistles. I bought it a few years ago during a really good Black Friday sale. So I’m able to fully enjoy all the PS5 Pro’s features and improvements. If you don’t have a television like that, or if you aren’t even sure if it supports 4K or 120hz, then you probably don’t need a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h25338"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you care about ray tracing?</strong></h2><p>One of the big selling points of the PS5 Pro is the ability to play games at higher frame rates while not sacrificing all the visual features you get from 30 FPS fidelity modes. For many games, this means being able to play at 60 FPS while still having ray-traced reflections or lighting. This can make a game look more realistic and is better than screen space reflections, which tend to look messy and ugly, especially when viewed too closely. </p><p><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morale</em>s, for example, looks incredible at 60 FPS on PS5 Pro, with high-resolution reflections on skyscrapers helping it look almost photorealistic. <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s reflections also look amazing on Pro, though the game is capped at 30 FPS. If you don’t care about enhanced reflections and shiny surfaces looking more accurate, then a lot of the PS5 Pro’s more subtle improvements, like increased draw distances in some games, will likely not matter to you either. So you probably don’t need to go buy a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h25339"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you prefer fidelity modes over performance modes?</strong></h2><p>The moment I start a new game, the first thing I do is hop into the settings to see what I can tweak. Can I increase a game’s frame rate? Are there options to turn motion blur on or off? Is there a way to make it look nicer or run better? So, for me, a person obsessed with visuals and performance, the PS5 Pro has been a lot of fun. Most Pro-enhanced games offer multiple graphics options and performance tweaks, letting me enjoy games the way I want. </p><p>If you are someone who boots up a game and never checks the settings unless something breaks or annoys you, then the PS5 Pro might not be for you. The PS5 Pro is a console built for people who tinker with HDR settings, care about FOV, and flip between different performance options to see which they prefer. If that sounds annoying or tiring, then you likely aren’t the kind of person who would be happy spending $700+ on a PS5 Pro.</p><h2 id="h25340"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you already own a PS5?</strong></h2><p>If you already own a PS5 or bought one recently, then an upgrade is likely not your priority. However, if you don’t already own a PS5 and are looking to hop into this current generation of games, you might wonder if the PS5 Pro is the best option. You might think it being the most powerful console on the market and the best version of the PS5 makes it the default device to buy. But, as I’ve laid out above, the PS5 Pro isn’t for everyone. </p><p>If you just want to enjoy PS5 exclusive games like <em>Spider-Man 2, Horizon: Forbidden West, Silent Hill 2, </em>and a litany of other titles (and don’t own a PC that can run those games), a standard PlayStation 5 will get the job done. Games still look great on the console, and most offer solid performance modes, too. The only reason you should even think about buying a PS5 Pro as your first PS5 console is if you own a high-end TV already and care about things like VRR, 4K output, and 120 FPS options. Otherwise, just buy a base PS5 this holiday season and enjoy it.</p><h2 id="h25341"><a id=""></a><strong>So, who is the PS5 Pro for?</strong></h2><p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is for a rather meticulous gamer. This gamer is someone who already owns a high-quality 4K/120hz TV or plans to buy one. They’re someone who has already invested heavily in the PlayStation ecosystem and has a collection of PS5 games they can enjoy on the PS5 Pro. They’re the type of person who cares about in-game settings and visual options, and who gets excited over the various graphical settings each game offers. You need to be the kind of person who can spot the difference between a game running at 30 FPS versus 60 or 120. You also need to care about higher resolutions and image quality. You should not only know what ray tracing is but be excited to enable it when you can. </p><p>In other words, you need to be something of an A/V enthusiast to truly enjoy the PS5 Pro.</p><p>I’ve enjoyed playing around with the one Sony sent me over the last week, as I’m the kind of person this $700 super-console was designed for. But I’m not convinced most people should buy a PS5 Pro. That’s not to say the Pro is worthless or a bad idea. </p><p>While some online have scoffed at the idea of a more powerful PS5, I think Sony’s plan makes sense. As confirmed by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/X24BzyzQQ-8?t=174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/X24BzyzQQ-8?t=174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s own data</a></span>, players generally prefer performance modes over fidelity modes in most games. So building a console focused on letting players enjoy smooth frame rates without sacrificing fancy visuals or high resolutions is a sensible strategy.</p><p>The challenge Sony faces is that many people are satisfied with their base PS5 and the options it provides. And after spending a week with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/8x418kpa17lhq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/8x418kpa17lhq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5 Pro</a></span>, I’m confident in saying it’s really for the detail-obsessed gamers willing to spend $700 to make already great-looking games look even better on their big 120hz TVs. That might not be you, and that’s okay because you aren’t missing out on anything you care about anyway.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-get-clay-in-stardew-valley/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Clay is an essential resource in Stardew Valley. While it isn’t used in the Community Center bundles or as gifts to the villagers, it is still used in construction and crafting. It is one of the most overlooked resources, as it isn’t prevalent like stone, wood, and fiber. Let us show you how to obtain clay quickly in your Stardew Valley playthrough!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-clay-in-stardew-valley">How to Get Clay in Stardew Valley</h2>



<p>Clay can be obtained in multiple ways. The tricky-to-find resource can be found by:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tilling dirt (on your farm, throughout Pelican Town, and within the mines)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tilling sand on the beach</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tilling Artifact spots</strong></li>



<li><strong>When opening Geodes at Clint’s shop</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mining clay nodes at the Ginger Island Dig Site</strong></li>



<li><strong>As a gift from Jas, Vincent, or Leo during the Feast of the Winter Star</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vincent sells clay at the Desert Festival shop for a single Calico Egg</strong></li>



<li><strong>Your pet dog may gift you clay once it reaches maximum friendship</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While some of these methods are purely chance, like characters or pets gifting the resource to you, others take more work. For example, tilling dirt, sand, and artifact spots will take you time, and it’s not guaranteed you’ll find clay with every use of your hoe. Of course, tilling the land for clay becomes easier as you upgrade your hoe to higher qualities and can till multiple spaces simultaneously. Out of all the places to dig and till for clay, it is recommended to do so in the mines, as tilling the dirt there can also yield cave carrots, and bombs can be placed to help unearth things faster in the mines.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-you-need-clay-in-stardew-valley">Why You Need Clay in Stardew Valley</h2>



<p>As mentioned, clay isn’t used in any Community Center bundles and isn’t a liked gift. So why bother with it? Well, it’s vital for crafting and construction, of course! To build a silo, an essential building on your farm, if you intend to keep animals, you’ll need ten clay, 100 stone, five copper bars, and 100 gold.</p>



<p>In addition to the construction of a silo, clay is also needed to craft: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quality Retaining Soil</strong></li>



<li><strong>Garden Pots</strong></li>

            <p>
Well, here's another mystery to cross off the 'unresolved' list; 20 years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>'s release, Konami has finally confirmed fan suspicions that Russian spy Eva was voiced by the same actor who player Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid.
</p>
<p>
The identity of Eva's voice performer has long puzzled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3 fans, given the person listed in the game's credit - one Suzetta Miñet - didn't appear to be a real person at all. And while vocal similarities had led some community members to believe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/5ee3b2/jodi_benson_voice_of_ariel_from_disneys_the/">Miñet was actually a pseudonym for Ariel voice actor Jodi Benson</a> (although she was far from the only suspect), it's never been officially confirmed... until now.
</p>
<p>
In the newly released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDIWFh7nYa4">third instalment of Konami's Metal Gear Solid Legacy Series documentary</a>, charting the history of the franchise, Benson finally confirmed her Snake Eater involvement and shared a little more about how Suzetta Miñet came to be. "When we recorded... in 2003," she explained, "just the various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family based, children-based, things like that. So it was actually [our director] Kris Zimmerman Salter; she kind of sat down with me and she's like, maybe we need to change your name."
</p>

<p>
"So she asked me, 'What was your dog's name growing up?'," Benson continued, "and I said, 'Suzette Monet'. So she's like, 'You know what, let's build on that. How about Suzetta? How about instead of Monet, the artist, we'll do Miñet?', and I was like, 'Sounds like a deal!"
</p><p>
However, Benson - whose other roles include Barbie in the Toy Story series and Thumbelina - admits some fans still managed to suss her out, even with the pseudonym. "Seven years ago, at various conventions when we meet and greet with wonderful fans," she went on, "somebody slipped one of these wonderful games to my table, and I said, 'Why are you bringing that?', and he said, 'Because you're in it.' And I said, 'Do you <em>know</em>? Do you know my deep dark secret?'. And he said, 'Yes! I do know', and I said, 'Shh, keep it quiet!'"
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of Benson's role in Snake Eater comes as Konami continues its efforts to revitalise the Metal Gear Solid series following creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-left-konami-earlier-this-month-report">acrimonious departure</a> from the publisher back in 2015. Last year saw the launch of Konami's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-mgs-master-collection-is-anything-but-masterful">less-then-stellar Metal Gear Solid Master Collection: Volume 1</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-will-include-mgs4">Volume 2 still to come</a>. First, however, it'll be releasing  its Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-despite-its-2024-window">still doesn't have a release date</a> despite its 2024 launch window.

Though I said it is impossible to summarize <em>Fourteen</em>, I will try to mention things that happen in it. It is the 23rd century. Animals do not exist in their natural form any more, and zoos are filled with horrifying chimeras. Meat is grown in vats, and out of one of those vats emerges a sentient chicken breast that grows into a body, a chicken-man. This chicken man becomes a doctor, and goes by the name Doctor Chicken George.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This image is burned in me (Read it right to left). Credit: Kazuo Umezu</figcaption></figure><p>Doctor Chicken George becomes a Doctor Moreau-like figure, an avenging angel who describes himself as a representative of the animal kingdom. Meanwhile, children are being born with green hair and bodies, including the child of the president of the USA, who names his child America. At one point a briefcase is opened and a Tyrannosaurus Rex jumps out of it. All the trees die and the government gets the grandson of the writer of <em>Die Hard </em>to distract people with TV while they replant Central Park with plastic replicas. The mummy of Jesus Christ is discovered, but turns out to be a demon. All the air in Nepal disappears. I am skipping past a lot of things, and this barely covers the first half of the manga.</p><figure><figcaption>What a zoo looks like. Credit: Kazuo Umezu</figcaption></figure><p>In a career of recreating pubescent nightmares, <em>Fourteen </em>stands singularly as perhaps one of Umezu’s weirdest and most political. It jumps wildly from plot point to plot point, but the tone is intentionally humorous. It is a work that is deeply critical of mankind’s hatred and indifference to nature broadly and America’s role in the wholesale destruction of the planet specifically. It is a fever dream, and while you can debate that it is not coherent, its moral compass points clearly.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Kazuo Umezu</figcaption></figure><p>I would love to say that I bought <em>Fourteen</em> legally, but that’s not possible. It has never been translated and released legally, but it should be, because it’s one of the damnedest things I have ever read. A single panel stays more vividly than other works of art, the piercing gaze of Doctor Chicken George staring at the reader, having gained sentience after being told that his purpose is to be eaten. “I was born for no one.”</p><p>RIP to one of the best that ever lived. I hope one day this work gets its due.</p><figure><figcaption>RIP. Credit: Kazuo Umezu</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-is-the-first-ps5-pro-game-to-combine-pssr-with-amd-fsr-frame-generation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-descendant-is-the-first-ps5-pro-game-to-combine-pssr-with-amd-fsr-frame-generation.1029141/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-is-the-first-ps5-pro-game-to-combine-pssr-with-amd-fsr-frame-generation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nexon has consistently kept The First Descendant at the forefront of graphics and display technologies. The free-to-play third-person looter shooter game looked great from the first time we saw it, but it was initially developed with Unreal Engine 4. However, the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-qa-on-the-game-ue5-implementation-and-future-dlss-3-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> to Unreal Engine 5 as soon as they could to take advantage of Nanite and Lumen, as they believed the latter in particular to be 'essential' for next-generation projects.</p>
<p>In the first interview published on Wccftech two years ago, the developers confirmed support for various ray traced effects, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, and Intel XeSS. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of its support for Samsung's HDR10+ displays, and a few months ago, The First Descendant was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to integrate NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, also known as Ray Reconstruction, which enhances ray tracing effects on GeForce RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>Nexon didn't just work hard on the PC version, anyway. The PlayStation 5 version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-descendant-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> Unreal Engine 5's high-resolution Virtual Shadow map technique, as well as ray tracing and even AMD FSR Frame Generation, the latter of which is only available in two or three PS5 games so far.</p>
<p>It's not that surprising, then, that The First Descendant will also be the first PS5 Pro game to support the new PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution in combination with AMD FSR Frame Generation. Here's what Engine Programmer Junhwan Kim told Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our PS5 Pro-focused Q&amp;A</a>:</p>
<p><em>The most impressive aspect during the PS5 Pro adaptation process was the AI-driven upscaling technology known as PSSR. On the existing PS5 base model, the FSR Image Upscaling feature is typically used, which has some drawbacks, such as pixel ghosting and pixel jittering during the pixel reconstruction process. The PS5 Pro's Image Upscaling based on PSSR minimizes these weaknesses and delivers highly impressive results.</em></p>
<p><em>The original PS5 base model offered FSR upscaling and FSR frame generation features. On the PS5 Pro, we provide an option that combines PSSR with FSR frame generation, allowing for a higher-resolution, high-frame-rate experience compared to before.</em></p>
<p>The First Descendant on PS5 Pro will also feature improved ray tracing effects: ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced Lumen diffuse, ray-traced opaque, and translucency surface reflection.</p>
<p>But it's the implementation of both PSSR and AMD FSR Frame Generation that could really pave the way for optimal visual quality and performance on Sony's latest console, which is due to launch tomorrow at $699/£699/€799. We'll see whether more developers follow Nexon's example in this regard.</p>

			<p>The Stranger Things VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-things-vr-winter-2023/">made by Tender Claws</a> will be released for PlayStation VR2 and Steam VR. If you want to get your hands on this game based in the Stranger Things universe, you'll be able to pre-order it now for $24.99 via the PlayStation Store. For those who are PlayStation Plus members, you'll be eligible for a 20% discount. This title was originally released on Quest 2 and Quest 3 on February 22. However, it is now making its way onto more VR consoles and platforms to make the game more accessible. The art style is really cartoonist and stylized, making it perfect for those who want that indie feel to a game and to see the characters designed in a slightly different way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stranger Things VR - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r6rEJ5AqzJM?start=28&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This announcement comes just shortly before the announcement made by Netflix teasing the Stranger Things 5 title. This series is set to take place in the Fall of 1987 and is the "one last adventure," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-2LIjOt0rA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to release in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>In Stranger Things VR, you get to experience the world of Stranger Things from a never-seen-before perspective of Vecna. You get to explore unknown realities and work towards forming the hive mind. In this game, you're the villain in its entirety. You get to work to create your revenge plan and how you'll wreak havoc in the lives of Eleven and Hawkins.</p>
<p>While you get to play as Henry Creel, you'll get information that shows how he transforms into Vecna, as you can also invade the dreams and memories of some of the favorite characters in the show, such as Billy Hargrove and Will Byers. Additionally, you get to use the telekinetic powers that Vecna has in the show to possess the minds of others, as well as utilize them in combat against creatures.</p>
<p>The telekinetic powers allow you to grab, crush, and throw your opponents, which can make for some great chaos. As you slowly transform into Vecna, you get to relive Henry's memories from when he was in the Hawkins Lab with Dr. Brenner, allowing you to explore an interconnected hive mind with otherworldly properties.</p>
<p>One of the actions you can use can have severe consequences, but it's up to you whether you use it. You will be able to open and close portals between worlds and realities, but it is at your peril. Whether anything good will come of it remains to be seen in how you play the game.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Stranger Things VR?</p>

The Switch 2 being able to play Switch 1 games was rumored, but Furukawa made it official during the earnings briefing.</p><p>The Switch was not compatible with Wii U games, but a number of Wii U games were ported to the Switch. For this next transition, however--from Switch to Switch 2--existing software will be supported.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4395620-screenshot2024-11-06at1.54.06pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4395620" data-ratio="0.55316285329744" data-width="743" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4395620-screenshot2024-11-06at1.54.06pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4395620"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 is backwards compatible with Switch 1</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4395620-screenshot2024-11-06at1.54.06pm.png"></figure><h2 id="Unknowns"><strong>Unknowns</strong></h2><p>Nintendo's announcement of backward compatibility support for Switch 2 was light on details. It is presently unknown how it'll all work. Below are some key unanswered questions.</p><h3 id="Do_physical_Switch_game_cards_work_with_Switch_2_">Do physical Switch game cards work with Switch 2?</h3><p>One of the unknowns is whether or not backwards compatibility is limited to digital games or if the Switch 2 will also support physical Switch cartridges. Since the Switch 2 hasn't even been announced yet, we don't know what format the system might have for physical media, or if it supports it at all.</p><h3 id="Are_all_Switch_games_backwards_compatible_">Are all Switch games backwards compatible?</h3><p>We also don't know if the backwards compatibility will be comprehensive or limited, but this should become clear in time. For now, Furukawa said Nintendo will share more information "at a later date." For what it's worth, even within the Switch 1 ecosystem, not all games were universally supported. As an example, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-games-that-dont-work-on-switch-lite/1100-6495185/" data-ref-id="1100-6495185">Switch Lite didn't support certain Switch games.</a></p><h3 id="Does_Switch_2_improve_Switch_games_">Does Switch 2 improve Switch games?</h3><p>The Switch 2 is expected to be a more powerful machine than the existing Switch, which launched in 2017 and has sold more than 146 million units to date. But whether or not the Switch 2 will improve original Switch games played on it is unknown. When a system offers backward compatibility, like with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, it is often the case that games for the older system look and perform better on the newer one with better resolutions and/or frame rates. That's at least something that Nintendo fans would probably hope for with the Switch 2. Games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and Echoes of Wisdom were highly regarded games, but also had notoriously bad performance in certain spots, and the Switch 2 offering improvements would be very welcome.</p><p><span>We will update this post as more information comes to light.</span></p><h2 id="Stock_price_jump">Stock price jump</h2><p>The Switch 2, or whatever it's going to be called, hasn't even been announced yet, but Nintendo's stock price jumped after Nintendo announced the backwards compatibility news.</p><p>Analyst Dr. Serkan Toto said investors might have taken the announcement of backwards compatibility to mean the Switch 2 is more of a "continuation" rather than a "risky experiment," and that could have helped the share price grow. The thinking here is that the Switch 2 being backwards-compatible could help encourage people to buy it because they know their games will move with them and they won't have to start over.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1854050495566061608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Nintendo stock just closed up +5.80% (3:30pm Japan time on Wed) because of the confirmed backwards compatibility of the next console with the current Switch.<br>Investors think this is a sign Nintendo's next device will not be a risky experiment but rather a continuation. <a href="https://t.co/hB2PUkg9AF" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/hB2PUkg9AF</a></p>  — Dr. Serkan Toto (@serkantoto) <a href="https://twitter.com/serkantoto/status/1854050495566061608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 id="Switch_2_game_store_and_Nintendo_Switch_Online"><strong>Switch 2 game store and Nintendo Switch Online</strong></h2><p>Nintendo also stated that people who buy a Switch 2 "will be able to choose their next purchase from a broad selection of titles released for Nintendo Switch." This seems to suggest that the Switch 2's games store will also include original Switch games.</p><p>Beyond all of this, Nintendo said the Switch 2 will support Nintendo Switch Online and your existing Nintendo Account. "We believe that it is important for Nintendo's future to make use of Nintendo Account and carry over the good relationship that we have built with the over 100 million annual playing users on Nintendo Switch to its successor," Furukawa said.</p><h2 id="Becoming_the_norm"><strong>Becoming the norm</strong></h2><p>There was a time in the video game industry when new console generations represented something of a clean slate, and consumers had to start over and purchase new games for the new device. But those days are becoming a relic of the past, for Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony.</p><p>The Xbox Series X|S supports Xbox One games (and some Xbox 360 and original Xbox games), while the PS5 supports PS4 titles, along with PS3 and PS2 games by way of streaming, and only for a certain selection of titles. It's not backwards-compatibility in the traditional sense of popping your old Xbox or PlayStation disc into the new machine. Instead, this was made possible through the video game industry's push towards digital. Many digital games purchased for one platform carry forward to the next, and now Nintendo--which has also seen dramatic increases in digital game sales--is joining the fold with Switch 2.</p><p>That's all we know for now, but with the Switch 2 set to be announced by the end of March 2025, more details should come to light in due course.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289634/nyt-tech-guild-connections-strike-edition-custom-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Striking <em>New York Times</em> tech workers have created a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@nytguildtech/post/DCCV4LruxBh">custom <em>Connections</em> puzzle</a> so fans can get their daily fix without crossing the digital picket line.</p><p>The <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/game/-OB15lz2phb8ai9RwufV">“Strike Edition” puzzle</a> was made on a website that lets people create their own <em>Connections. </em>The workers, part of the New York Times Tech Guild, specifically asked <em>NYT</em> readers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/474209/new-york-times-strike-wordle-connections">not to play <em>NYT</em> games</a> when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287600/new-york-times-tech-guild-strike-before-presidential-election">strike began on Monday</a>, so the custom puzzle<em> </em>offers a way to play while still respecting the Guild’s wishes.</p><p>“We have seen a groundswell of support from subscribers who have been proudly tweeting about purposely breaking their game streaks to support our strikers,” says Jen Sheehan, spokesperson for the NewsGuild&nbsp;of New York.</p><p>The Guild didn’t make the website themselves; the site was made by Anthony Salazar, a freelance web developer who operates a creative studio named <a href="https://swellgarfo.com/">Swellgarfo</a>. Salazar tells <em>The Verge </em>that he made the app after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/crosswords/new-game-connections.html"><em>Connections</em> launched</a> last summer. “My friends couldn’t get enough and began making their own grids, jankly texting group chats with 4x4 word squares,” he says. Programming the site took about two hours. He didn’t expect anyone besides his friends to use it, but the creator tool has now been used 7 million times.</p><p>“I wasn’t aware that the Tech Guild was using my app, but I’m honored,” Salazar says.</p><p>There are aspects of the website that it’s easy to imagine <em>The New York Times </em>could take issue with, though. In addition to custom puzzles, the site also has a recreation of the <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/archive"><em>NYT Connections</em> archive</a> that’s available to play for free — offering a way to get around <em>NYT’s</em> own <em>Connections</em> archive that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24260742/now-you-can-suffer-through-old-connections-puzzles">just launched</a> as a feature for paid subscribers.</p><p><em>The New York Times </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094234/ny-times-wordle-clones-files-dmca-copyright-takedowns-knockoffs">targeted <em>Wordle</em> clones by filing copyright takedown notices</a> earlier this year, including against at least one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240306172335/https://github.com/cwackerfuss/reactle">shared on GitHub</a> that was strikingly similar to the <em>NYT’s</em> version of the game.

<p>How often do you make an uninformed purchasing decision regarding video games? Many people wait for reviews—critic and user reviews—before buying a full-price game. Some people refuse to pay the full price. They’ll want for a sale in six to twelve months. But sometimes, you can’t help but play on day one. So, let’s explore a few notable Planet Coaster 2 reviews, many of which offer varying opinions on the theme park management game from Frontier Developments!</p>



<h2 id="h-planet-coaster-2-reviews-paint-a-vivid-picture">Planet Coaster 2 Reviews Paint a Vivid Picture</h2>



<p>If you look on the Planet Coaster 2 Metacritic, you’ll find the park management game currently sits at a ‘Generally Favorable’ score of 82, following 14 critic reviews since its launch on November 6 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. There are notable game reviews from IGN, PC Gamer, TheGamer, and plenty of other outlets that spent a bit of time with the title pre-launch. Here’s a rundown to help you decide whether it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/planet-coaster-2-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worth paying full price</a>!</p>







<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Despite how much I enjoy the act of building my ideal park, the original Planet Coaster was neither challenging nor interesting as a management tycoon game, and that has unfortunately not changed. Even after messing with the difficulty settings, of which there are several, I found it almost mindlessly simple to generate infinite money with a small number of flat rides and a high entry fee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/planet-coaster-2-review-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overall, Planet Coaster 2 feels like a natural evolution of the first game. Lessons have been learned, features added, mechanics improved, and the customisation of difficulty across the board – career mode has flexible difficulty levels which can be set on a per-scenario basis – really helps tailor the game to your level of experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Structurally, Planet Coaster 2 differs little from the first. You can fix and fiddle with partially built parks in career mode, or construct your own from scratch in variations upon the sandbox. These include unrestrained creativity where money and space are no object, and the more moderated Challenge mode where at least some management skills are required.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 is an ambitious sequel that expands sideways upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. The graphics are stunning, the water slide additions are fun, and the creative potential is immense, but it comes at a cost. The complexity of infrastructure systems interrupts the creative flow, making the impressively customizable experience feel unnecessarily convoluted at times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/142057/planet-coaster-2-review-score" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShackNews</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>While I was playing Planet Coaster 2 for this review, I kept thinking about RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. Frontier Developments’ initial crack at theme park building and management simulation shares many ideas with their latest attempt. Tinkering with rollercoasters and waterparks in 2024 conjured a sort of nostalgia for this kind of game I didn’t think I’d have. And so, with a heavy heart, I tell you that they got me again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameGrin</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em>&nbsp;is one of the pinnacles of the theme park simulator genre and while it doesn’t have a smooth learning curve for newcomers, it’s safe to say that those who have already mastered its systems will enjoy it immensely, with the ability to create anything you want the way you like it.</p>

<p>If you’re already paying for Xbox Game Pass monthly, doesn’t it make sense to check out every new release to see if it’s available? Why would you spend extra to check out a new game? Unfortunately, it feels like it’s becoming rare for day-one releases on Game Pass. For example, will we see Planet Coaster 2 on Game Pass? It’s likely, but not yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-planet-coaster-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Planet Coaster 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As of this writing, <strong>Planet Coaster 2 is not yet available on Xbox Game Pass</strong>. Could it happen? Sure! Developer Frontier launched the original Planet Coaster on day one on Game Pass, but they only announced its inclusion 24 hours before launch day. We didn’t get the same notification for its sequel, though. A quick look through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-titles-november-2024-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current Game Pass catalog reveals</a> that, unfortunately, the theme park management sim isn’t available to download for subscribers.</p>



<p>Sadly, the original Planet Coaster is no longer available on Xbox Game Pass. To enjoy Frontier’s unique and colorful management franchise, you must buy a copy. After spending an hour with it after lunch on launch day, I can tell you the sequel is much-improved and genuinely entertaining!</p>

<p>If you can’t wait to get your hands on Planet Coaster 2—I can’t blame you—then you can buy a copy on:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a></li>



<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP2377-PPSA19633_00-PLANETCOASTER200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Store</a></li>
</ul>



<p>There is currently no word on whether the theme park construction and management game will release on Xbox Game Pass, and it appears rather unlikely for now, but at $49.99 for the standard edition, it’s worth the asking price. Most people who fall in love with these types of games tend to enjoy them for hundreds of hours over the years, especially once DLC and mod support really kicks off!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-planet-coaster-2-worth-the-money">Is Planet Coaster 2 Worth the Money?</h2>



<p>I won’t go into a full-length review of Planet Coaster 2 here, but after spending a little time with it, I can offer first impressions. As someone who spent hundreds of hours playing the original Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo from developer Frontier, I think the sequel to the theme park game is a vastly improved and fun experience overall. </p>



<p>For the most part, the building felt far more intuitive and freeform, allowing me to move and resize entire setpieces to my liking and tweak minute details easily. So, if you lean heavily into freeform and creative construction, you’ll love Planet Coaster 2.</p>



<p>Just be wary of the copious amounts of DLC likely on its way for the game!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-dev-diary-provides-info-on-fashion-in-vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2.1029060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-dev-diary-provides-info-on-fashion-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're going to be a blood-sucker, you at least want to be fashionable when you do it. In a new dev diary released by The Chinese Room and Paradox Interactive, they've teamed up to discuss how fashion plays a part in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. Each clan has its own set of styles that make it easily identifiable when speaking to them or exploring the streets of Seattle.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">four base clans</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 each have their own unique style to represent personality, history, and subcultures through their fashion. When creating the fashion in the game, they wanted to make sure that they were offering players "a variety of styles to suit their tastes."&nbsp; Not only did they make sure that there were different outfits for the Protagonist, but they also made sure that the Foley was fairly attributed to the outfit, with the sounds of shoes or the rustling of clothes. For example, "creating a more stealth-like feeling or the aggressive presence that one might expect between Banu Haqim vs Brujah," says Lead Audio Designer Tessa Verplancke.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Additionally, making sure that outfits matter in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, characters are also able to judge their outfits, such as interactions you have with Tolly. This is shown in a brief clip on the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-fashion-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradox Interactive website</a>.</p>
<p>As the protagonist in this game, clothing matters because of the sound it can make. For example, if you want to feed on the right Blood Resonance, you need to make sure that you're wearing clothes that fit the mood of the person you're approaching.</p>
<p>"Just knowing that the angry sex worker nearby is full of choleric blood and ready for a fight is just step one. Step two is making sure that you're wearing something that will push them over the edge and really make that blood boil. Dressing and acting like a wealthy John could get them talking, but if you approach looking like someone who likes it rough? That might scare them right out of their angry mood, and then all that delicious choleric potential goes away," says Senior Narrative Designer Arone LeBray.</p>
<p>This dev diary is now the 21st diary released by Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room, providing a wealth of information about the importance of character customization and making sure you know how to dress appropriately for the occasion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289674/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-backward-compatibility<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nintendo’s next console is going to have a kickass library of games to start. Last night, when there was absolutely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289558/in-case-you-missed-it">nothing else of note happening in the world</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">Nintendo announced that its still-unannounced Switch successor would be backward-compatible with existing Switch games</a>. The announcement is an early sign that Nintendo might be able to avoid the painful transition between consoles and better unify its growing ambitions.</p></div><p>Backward compatibility is not a guarantee of success. The Wii U could play most Wii games, and it still ended up being a failure. But it’s a feature that benefits both consumers and the industry at large. In Nintendo’s case, its inclusion was never a sure thing. While bestselling hardware like the Wii and DS were able to play games from their predecessors, Nintendo often started over from scratch with a new console generation — which meant that players did, too.</p><p>The library of games you had built up over the lifespan of the Nintendo 64 or SNES stayed with that console. This is what has allowed Nintendo to resell <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> across countless devices; if you want to play the classics on the newest console, you usually have no choice but to buy it again. Otherwise, you’re forced to keep a Wii U around in order to enjoy that copy of <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD</em>. It sucks for consumers and it sucks for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23850347/video-game-preservation">video game preservation</a>, given how quickly older titles can become inaccessible.</p><p>Backward compatibility for the Switch is especially notable given what an incredible library it has accumulated. In fact, while the Switch is Nintendo’s second-bestselling piece of hardware, it has sold more games than any other Nintendo platform. During <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">an investor presentation</a>, the company said that the Switch’s “cumulative software sales have reached 1.3061 billion units, setting a new record for a Nintendo gaming platform. More software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>That’s not a surprise when you think about the games that have come out since 2017: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, and a whole lot of <em>Pokémon</em>. Ironically, the Switch was helped in a way by its lack of backward compatibility; Nintendo was able to keep up a steady stream of releases by putting out a number of Wii U ports. The Switch’s bestselling game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">an enhanced version of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a>.</p></div><p>The decision to support backward compatibility means that all of those games will immediately be available to anyone who picks up the next console. For existing Switch owners, it imbues their collection with more value; for newcomers, it means they have a huge library to dive into from the jump.</p><div><p>The decision also helps explain why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185022/nintendo-switch-2024-game-lineup-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Nintendo has barely slowed down with releases, even as the Switch approaches the end of its life</a>. The first-party games that came out in 2024 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24287092/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> — will likely have a lifespan well beyond the final years of the Switch. That’s also why there are still more big Switch games in the works, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a>. Nintendo is even making services that exist beyond a single console, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">the just-launched Nintendo Music streaming app</a>.</p></div><p>Signs have been pointing to this kind of more unified Nintendo for some time. The company’s account system links together various services and games, and more than a decade ago, Nintendo merged its console and portable game development divisions so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">that everyone was focused on the Switch</a>. It has created more cohesiveness across the company’s offerings, which has become increasingly important <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">as Nintendo branches out in new directions</a>. This has led to at least one sensible decision that sets up the Switch’s successor for a strong start — now we wait to see what oddball decision will make the new console distinctly “Nintendo.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
