            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/dawnfolk-review-city-building-game-steam-indie-1851770670<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are so many degrees of scope when it comes to the city building format. The genre, that first flourished in the early ‘90s with <em>SimCity 2000</em> has consistently delivered intricate excellence, with series like <em>Tropico</em>, <em>Frostpunk</em> and <em>Anno</em>, building to the triumph of 2015's <em>Cities: Skylines</em>. But it’s also offered more esoteric takes, with the brilliant <em>Surviving Mars</em>, <em>Before We Leave</em>, and <em>Dorfromantik</em>. But you know what they all lack? A magic light being with a story to tell. So welcome <em>Dawnfolk</em>, a glorious distilling of the genre that  streamlines and simplifies, while weaving its own spellbinding narrative.</p><p><em>Dawnfolk</em> is a wonderfully fresh approach to town-building antics, with small, goal-orientated tiled worlds on which you must create miniature, rural communities, with successful farms, mines, and increasingly more complicated buildings, alongside trade agreements or conflicts with local orcs and elves, all while battling against the forces of darkness. And it’s all with a refreshing, deeply engaging simplicity. And no, that’s not a contradiction, because <em>Dawnfolk</em>‘s genius is to make a huge array of systems extraordinarily approachable, and then doubly-fun by having battles, hunting, fishing and various other aspects play out as the teeniest minigames, taking place literally within the tile.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196086,195301" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>These are very simple, but it adds a surprising amount. You might have a tiny game of catching falling fruit when picking berries, or need to spin a sword in the middle of the tile to fend off invading pixels. There’s a teeny hunting minigame of firing arrows to hit passing deer, or perhaps to save your folk from invading wolves. And no, they don’t grow frustrating, as at a certain point into any level you can put resources into a building that will play them for you.</p><div><h4>  <strong>Buried Treasure Indie Game Reviews</strong></h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

These will dimly reveal what’s on orthogonal tiles that are yet to be lit, giving you an idea of in which direction you might want to expand. There might be a plain field on which you can build tents, the crudest form of home for your people. Or there could be some wild sheep (incredibly irrelevant tangent: did you know that there <em>are</em> wild sheep, called mouflon, and as the dog is the domesticated wolf, the sheep is the domesticated mouflon! Cows, since you ask, come from aurochs), which you could then kill for food, or farm for supplies. Build a farm, then some crops nearby, and perhaps set up a mine on a mountain tile. All through this, it’s about balance. You need homes to have people, but homes need supplies and people need food, and you need people to get supplies and food. Which is standard city-building stuff, other than the threat of the darkness.</p><figure id="" data-id="093a6ac4ec4781b55536d99bf7b40b8e" data-recommend-id="image://093a6ac4ec4781b55536d99bf7b40b8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A huge spread of tiles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A huge spread of tiles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Astra Logical / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="093a6ac4ec4781b55536d99bf7b40b8e" data-recommend-id="image://093a6ac4ec4781b55536d99bf7b40b8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A huge spread of tiles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dawnfolk</em> has a narrative running through the thematic levels of its story mode. You are guided in your game by a little flame character called Lueur, who has no memory of who he is at the start of the game. His antithesis is a similarly-shaped creature of darkness called Nuit, who will occasionally invade your little town with dark storms. You know one’s coming when it starts to rain, at which point you’re going to want to conserve as much light as you can to battle against them. These storms spread onto tiles you’ve explored, and need to be combated with light through more of those little arcade minigames, until eventually the storms weaken enough for you to destroy their cores. Each level has this happen a number of times, another thing to keep in balance.</p><p>Then, beyond this series of scenarios, the game also offers puzzle levels (including daily puzzles), an endless mode (and indeed you can continue playing any scenario for as long as you want after the goals are achieved), a sandbox mode, another series of levels called Curious Expeditions where unique changes are made to how the game plays. Then there are various difficulty levels, easter egg modes, and all of these elements are unlocked by spending a currency accrued by finishing levels and achieving a billion little goals. Oh, and <em>this is the work of one guy</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="a80e54adaf42c5a8f5f3278ad4d7caf2" data-recommend-id="image://a80e54adaf42c5a8f5f3278ad4d7caf2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A town built on a small island, surrounded by sea and desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A town built on a small island, surrounded by sea and desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Astra Logical / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a80e54adaf42c5a8f5f3278ad4d7caf2" data-recommend-id="image://a80e54adaf42c5a8f5f3278ad4d7caf2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A town built on a small island, surrounded by sea and desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is just fabulous. I cannot tell you how much fun I’m having, each level taking just fifteen minutes or half an hour, and each uniquely rewarding as it ups the ante, introduces new elements and new dangers, has me battling ogres or befriending dragons, all while ensuring that core mechanic of balancing light, people, resources and food is maintained. This is properly delightful, with so much to do, and all so satisfying to complete. Also, given it’s best played with a gamepad, this is a perfect Steam Deck game too.</p><p>If you’re not into city builders, play this. It’s nothing like them. If you <em>do</em> love city builders, then you should play this too, because it distils the most pure concepts into a gorgeous, chunky, meaningful game. Which is to say, if you currently exist, I really do recommend playing <em>Dawnfolk</em>.</p><p><em>Dawnfolk</em> is out now. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://darenn.itch.io/dawnfolk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://darenn.itch.io/dawnfolk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The best place to buy it is on Itch</a></span>, where most of your money will directly reach developer Darenn Keller.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/saros-housemarque-budget-alan-wake-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Housemarque's next game, Saros, would never have been possible if the studio remained independent, according to its CEO.</p>
<p>Speaking with Finnish publication <a href="https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000011045895.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helsingin Sanomat</a>, Housemarque CEO Ilari Kuittinen commented on the acquisition of the studio by Sony, saying that it brought some cultural changes to the studio, such as having to conform to Sony's HR practices, but also more financial resources that have allowed the developer to move to new offices, and effectively make Saros possible, as Housemarque would have never been able as an independent studio to invest as much as was needed for the development of the game, which entered full production in 2022. While the game's budget hasn't been revealed, it is, according to Helsegin Sanomat, close to Alan Wake 2's budget of 70 million euros.</p>
<p>Saros was officially revealed during February's PlayStation State of Play with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">cinematic trailer</a> that provided some hints about the game's setting and story. While very little is currently known about the gameplay mechanics, the information provided so far suggests Saros will be built upon the mechanics that power <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">Returnal</a>, featuring a world that is constantly reshaped upon each death but also permanent progression systems that will help players overcome the many challenges ahead of them.</p>
<p>Saros is now in development for PlayStation 5. The game will launch sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>Like General Khazan and the power of the Blade Phantom, you are likely to form a strong connection to The First Berserker Khazan Trophy List. It features a tough and unenviable test of Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> has the makings of a great action game. Khazan’s assortment of reality-defying powers mesh well with the environments and their rich color palette. The action looks intense, and some might say contains a lot of <em>soul</em>. If you’re keen on The First Berserker Khazan, you might want to consider acquiring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>—although you might need to know its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-pc-system-requirements-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC requirements</a> first.</p>



<p>Once you’ve confirmed your ticket for the carnage of Khazan, you should check out the complete Trophy List.</p>



<p><strong>*This is an early spoiler warning as we have two separate lists here: One for the Trophies revealed from the start, and a separate list of hidden Achievements. So take care if you want to keep some of these a surprise.* </strong></p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s upcoming competitor is none other than its decades-old rival, Digimon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, a new post on the digimon_tcg account on <a href="https://x.com/digimon_tcg/status/1901112392492478758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> teased an upcoming digital card game for the franchise. The post includes a short 10-second teaser, where we see Renamon hovering over a smartphone before the Digimon is suddenly sucked into the phone. That’s all that was revealed. However, more information about the game will be shown during Digimon Con on March 20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon and Digimon have been rivals for decades, with the former eventually taking the lead. However, seeing how Pokemon TCG Pocket has amassed so much success within such a short time, earning over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a> within the first seventeen days and crossing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads</a> within the first nine, Digimon seems to want a cut of that success too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like the Pokemon Trading Card Game, Digimon has also had a card game since 2020, so they already have an established base for the digital version. However, the title’s success ultimately depends on the audience’s reception of another digital trading card game based on a different franchise. However, fans in the r/digimon subreddit seem ecstatic about the new digital trading card game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Niantic, Pokemon Go’s developer, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by Scopely</a> for $3.5 billion. Also, here’s everything we know about Pokemon Champions, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its release window, platforms</a> and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on Digimon planning to compete with Pokemon TCG Pocket?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content.

You've heard it in your dreams - the soundtrack to Tetris is now available on the Switch Online subscription's Nintendo Music app.
</p>
<p>
Almost 30 music tracks from the Game Boy and NES versions of Tetris are now available to stream, if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber.

<p>
This week's bumper Nintendo Music update also brings a third set of songs to the service, from Dr Mario on the NES - which has its own another catchy melody.
</p>
<p>
But nothing beats that classic Tetris track, remixed and resampled countless times over the years in other Tetris sequels, such as the Switch's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-1999">Tetris 99</a> and the brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a> Connected.
</p>
<p>
Remember that, if you're a Switch Online subscriber, you can download the Nintendo Music app on your iPhone or Android device at no extra charge.

            <p>Amazon's God of War series already has a second season ordered, even though the first hasn't even aired. In fact, the last I checked, the first season doesn't even have a release date yet.</p>
<p>Confirmation that we'll get at least two God of War seasons comes from showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Moore appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y">The Sackhoff Show</a> with Battlestar Galactica's Katee Sackhoff, and this is when the topic of God of War's TV adaptation came up.</p>
<p>"Right now I'm working on an adaptation of this video game called God of War - it's a big title in the gaming world - that Amazon has ordered two seasons of and they asked me to come in," Moore said. "I'm literally in the writers room and working on that. That's my new thing." </p>
<p>Moore admitted he isn't a "a gamer", and hadn't done something like this before - but had at least tried to play the God of War games, albeit rather unsuccessfully. </p>
<p>"I took a stab at it," Moore continued, before joking he "grew up in the arcade era" of gaming.  "I can do that... Astroids? Bring it on baby," he quipped.</p>
<p>"The controllers now..." Moore continued with a laugh. "Press R1, which one's R1, oh I'm dead! I can't quite get a hold of that." It sounds like Moore's family have a better handle on modern gaming, though, as the showrunner noted his wife was a fan of Skyrim. </p>

<p>Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, the likes of Cory Barlog from God of War studio Sony Santa Monica remain an executive producer on the upcoming TV series, as does PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst and Vertigo's Roy Lee.</p>
<p>Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>

<p>Along with God of War, Amazon also has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">second season of its acclaimed Fallout adaptation</a> in the pipeline. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Filming for the second season began last year</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">production was halted in January</a> due to the disastrous fires which burned across multiple districts of Los Angeles.</p>

		<p>Krafton have announced their plans for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg/">PUBG</a> which is still going strong after eight years. The big news is at the end of 2025 the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions will launch “bringing significant improvements to performance, FPS, map loading speeds, and overall graphical quality.”</p>
<p>“This transition will optimize PUBG for modern hardware, addressing long-standing limitations and enhancing the overall experience for console players,” say Krafton, which does seem to suggest that the Xbox One and PS4 versions of the game may be closed down. The game will also move on to Unreal Engine 5 so should look rather nice.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG | 2025 Roadmap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_snNMMlEk-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a lot more to come, here are a few highlights:</p>
<p><em>Gunplay remains a top priority, with regular balance updates planned throughout the year. Every two months, balance patches will address key adjustments to the weapon meta, ensuring a dynamic and evolving combat experience. Additionally, an annual large-scale rebalancing will be introduced to shake up weapon usage and encourage diverse playstyles. Alongside these changes, underutilized weapons such as SRs, LMGs, and Handguns will receive improvements to increase their viability. New weapons and attachments are also currently in development, further expanding the arsenal available to players.</em></p>

<p><em>PUBG’s AI system is undergoing a fundamental transformation, making bots behave in a more realistic and strategic manner. AI opponents will react to the shrinking Blue Zone, take cover more effectively, and even deploy smoke grenades to obscure visibility in combat situations. These enhancements aim to make AI encounters feel more natural while ensuring a fair and engaging experience for all players.</em></p>
<p><em>A major world update is planned for the end of the year, transforming existing maps to create new gameplay experiences while maintaining the essence of what players love. Rather than introducing an entirely new map, KRAFTON is reimagining old favorites to offer fresh challenges and strategic opportunities. Additionally, the&nbsp;Destructible Terrain&nbsp;feature is being introduced in Taego, Miramar, and Erangel, further deepening player-world interactions.</em></p>
<p>Along with all of that there will be new guns, new vehicles,&nbsp; and an expansion in Arcade modes and collaborative content.</p>

		<p>Developer Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury have announced The Séance of Blake Manor, a detective game that puts you in a spooky missing person case. Set in Ireland in the year 1897, players take on the role of Detective Declan Ward who has been summoned to solve the case of the disappearance of Evelyn Deane. The case is going to be tough especially when it is Halloween, you are surrounded by mystics gathered for a séance, and the unexplainable situations that plague the investigation.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/09m6cxehfFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a post, developer Spooky Doorway said, <em>“Inspired by Irish Mythology and the spiritualist movements of the Victorian era, The Séance of Blake Manor is depicted by a beautiful comic-book art style and comes to you from the creators of The Darkside Detective. We’ve been working on this for a long time and are delighted to finally share some new updates. You’ll be hearing a lot more about Blake Manor in the weeks and months ahead…”</em></p>
<p>As a detective players will need to question those gathered at Blake Manor, make observations about each individual, search for clues, and uncover the past stories of the manor to really understand what is going on. As clues are gathered, you will need to make logical deductions even with illogical situations popping up to figure out what happened to Evelyn Deane. Time is not on your side either as the minutes will tick by, and the other people will be going about their day. You may miss vital clues if you are not in the right place when a significant event happens.</p>

<p>A release date has not yet been set for The Séance of Blake Manor, and it appears PC is the only platform confirmed.</p>

<p>Palworld devs recently spoke about how Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit “came as a shock” for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-came-as-a-shock-to-pocketpair-because-patent-infringement-was-something-that-no-one-even-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Pocketpair’s communications director and publishing manager, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, addressed Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld during a panel at GDC 2025. Bucky first spoke about the “little thing that happened in September”, where a company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to come for them</a>. Bucky explained that he doesn’t want to talk about it too much as it is “an active lawsuit”, and he doesn’t want to get “wrapped up” in the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bucky added that Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit “came as a shock” to them, considering they had received a green signal for all the legal checks in Japan before the game was released. The lawsuit was a shock for many people, as it was something the devs had never “considered” and is something they are “still hashing out basically.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bucky elaborated that the lawsuit didn’t “feel good” considering they had been “pretty vocal” about Palworld before the game was released. However, after contacting lawyers and courts, they realised that the lawsuit was for patents. When the information was released to the public, it was a “pretty depressing day” for the devs as “pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan”. At the same time, they were gearing up for the PlayStation release and a showcase at the Tokyo Game Show, which had to be scaled back due to legal problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired a new patent</a> that helps their lawsuit against Palworld. Also, Pocketpair publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has warned gamers</a> not to expect “more Palworld”. What are your thoughts on Palworld devs being shocked about Nintendo’s lawsuit?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>
Remember <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>? Announced back at The Game Awards 2020 with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-revealed-with-preposterous-van-diesel-starring-trailer">preposterous CGI trailer starring Vin Diesel</a>, the dino-riding sequel has been rarely seen since.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, there's a big expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> - one that's designed to connect the series to it still missing-in-action sequel, whenever it arrives.
</p>
<p>
Ark developer Studio Wildcard announced the expansion, dubbed Ark: Lost Colony, last night with an animtated trailer that features the character played by Michelle Yeoh from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-the-animated-series-surprise-releases-in-us-and-canada-ahead-of-april-debut-elsewhere">the Ark animated series</a>.

<p>
Studio Wildcard said the expansion will follow Yeoh's character, alongside others from the animated series, in a story that "directly connects the storylines of Ark's Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2".
</p>
<p>
Ark: Lost Colony expansion will arrive in June for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S priced $30 (UK price TBA). As for when Ark 2 will turn up? Who knows.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-survival-evolved-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-with-vin-diesel-coming-2023">Studio Wildcard said Ark 2 would launch the following year</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">a delay in 2023 until "the end of 2024"</a> - which evidently did not happen.
</p>
<p>
Back in January, Studio Wildcard shared a content roadmap for Ark: Survival Evolved with updates scheduled up to and beyond December 2026 - with no mention of Ark 2 in sight, leading some fans to wonder whether it had been cancelled. The announcement of Ark: Lost Colony suggests this is not the case.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pubg-provides-update-on-ue5-upgrade-and-destructible-terrain-pubg-ugc-also-on-the-way/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Krafton unveiled the 2025 roadmap for PUBG: Battlegrounds. A year after the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-battlegrounds-is-upgrading-to-unreal-engine-5-and-getting-destructible-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game's transition from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, it finally provided an update on the task.</p>
<p>This is meant to establish a new long-term foundation for the game while retaining the same feeling that fans have appreciated. The UE5 upgrade, though, still needs time in the oven, as it was described as being in the pre-production phase. On the tech front, Krafton is also busy making the long-requested current-generation version of PUBG. This is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X in late 2025, delivering visual improvements as well as a more optimized experience for frame rate and map loading speed.</p>
<p>The developers are also preparing to launch the PUBG UGC (User Generated Content) project. This will allow players to create and share their own custom experiences, starting with a new TDM-style mode in Custom Matches. This initiative is designed to give players greater creative freedom and expand the ways in which they interact with the game.</p>
<p>A more unified experience across Normal Matches, Ranked, and Esports is coming, too, thanks to the integration of key elements from Normal Matches into Ranked, reducing the gameplay gap between the two modes. To further enhance progression, a tier overhaul is planned for June, making rank progression feel more rewarding and meaningful.</p>
<p>Balance patches will be released every two months in 2025 to address key adjustments to the weapon meta, ensuring a dynamic and evolving combat experience. In addition, a major annual rebalancing will be introduced to shake up weapon usage and encourage different play styles. Alongside these changes, under-utilized weapons such as SRs, LMGs, and SMGs will receive improvements to increase their viability. New weapons and attachments are also in development to further expand the arsenal available to players.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence will also be majorly overhauled, making PUBG bots behave more realistically and strategically. AI enemies will react to the shrinking blue zone, take cover more effectively, and even use smoke grenades to obscure visibility in combat situations. These improvements are designed to make AI encounters feel more natural while ensuring a fair and engaging experience for all players.</p>

<p>While a new map won't be coming to the game this year, the developers are preparing a big world update due in late 2025. This update will transform existing maps to create new gameplay experiences while retaining the essence of what players love. Moreover, the Destructible Terrain feature is being introduced in the Taego, Miramar, and Erangel maps.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Krafton continues the fight against cheaters. New detection technologies are being developed to counter increasingly sophisticated fraud tactics. The team is also exploring ways to leverage Windows OS protections to provide an additional layer of security against exploitative software.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are being actively used to detect and counter unauthorized software use in real time, improving PUBG's ability to identify and ban cheaters more effectively. Additional security measures are also in development to better protect player accounts and reduce the risk of account hijacking and unfair play.</p>

<p>Amazon has greenlit the God of War series for two seasons, reveals showrunner, as he speaks about how he had to stop playing the games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/god-of-war-tv-show-writer-reveals-amazon-has-already-ordered-two-seasons-and-that-he-cant-play-the-video-games-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, God of War series showrunner&nbsp; Ronald D. Moore recently appeared on Katee Sackhoff’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y&amp;list=PLiHvVvKZ9lt6_mIcI0YwKPY1CgSYUvORQ&amp;index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sackhoff Show</a>, where he revealed more details about the upcoming adaptation. Moore first revealed that “Amazon has ordered two seasons” of the God of War series. Moore said it is a more challenging project as he is “not a gamer”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore revealed that he “tried” to play the God of War games but is not a gamer. He grew up in the “arcade era,” and he would always be up to playing a game like Defender or Asteroid. However, Moore hasn’t overcome one obstacle with recent games: the modern controller. Moore elaborates that he has trouble with the button layout and cannot find the right buttons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, Moore’s family is filled with avid gamers. His children play constantly, and his wife has played Skyrim for “probably 15 years.”&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moore is the new showrunner for Amazon’s God of War series after the previous executive producers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-series-redone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exited the show</a> late last year. Moore is best known for his work on projects like Star Trek and the Battlestar Galactica series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the next God of War game is reportedly centred around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two PlayStation live service titles</a> were recently cancelled, one of which was a God of War game.

            <p>The CEO of Saber Interactive has some pretty damning words to say about 2022's poorly-received Saints Row reboot, and its developer Volition.</p>
<p>As part of an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-embracer-savvy-games-space-marine-russia">Game File</a> (paywalled), Saber's Matt Karch spoke about studio closures and layoffs. Volition, you may recall, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, Karch - who worked under the Embracer umbrella for a period of time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">before the sale of Saber assets</a> - stated while "it would be nice in an ideal world for everyone to have a job", the Saints Row team "were so expensive for what they were" and, therefore are "gone".</p>

<p>"They didn't know what they were building. They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>He added: "The days of throwing money at games other than maybe the GTAs of the world [are] over... It's over." Karch stated "this business needs to mature", and if it doesn't it's "in trouble".</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, that means layoffs," the Saber exec continued. "If I were running a team in California, my goal would be: 'Okay. Who are the absolutely must-haves in this group? And they exist. We have American talent [at Saber.] And who could do this for, you know, a quarter of the price in Poland?'"</p>

<p>2022's Volition-developed Saints Row reboot was met with disappointing critical and commercial reception.Following its release, Embracer admitted the game "did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarised" in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2022-net-sales-increased-by-190-to-sek-9569-million-35-organic-growth/">financial update</a> shared in the November of that year.</p>
<p>We called Saints Row a "snappy but slightly uneven reboot" on its release. "Volition's Saints Row reboot won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">Eurogamer's Saints Row review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Soon after The Last of Us' first season aired the showrunners said when the time came for series two, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">there would be "a lot more infected"</a>. And, well, they appear to be making good on their word. </p>
<p>Along with those infected hordes advancing upon Ellie and co in the trailers - not to mention <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-hbo-the-last-of-us-part-2s-trailer-is-here-and-april-cant-come-quickly-enough">Tommy using a flamethrower to toast a Bloater</a> - The Last Of Us' Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have confirmed Stalkers will be featured in season two.</p>

<p>"All I'll say is that for the people who want to see more of the infected... Buckle up!" Mazin teased in conversation with <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-bigger-far-more-ambitious-pedro-pascal-exclusive/">Empire</a>.</p>
<p>"You get to see a different evolution of this infection," added Druckmann. "It's kept certain parts of their brain alive, so they are smarter. They coordinate and hide and do things that we've never seen any other infected do on this show."</p>

<p>And, it is not  just Stalkers that will bring a change when the second season of The Last of Us airs next month. The showrunners have confirmed spores are also making a return.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' spores are depicted as particle mists, but while a key feature in both games, the showrunners refrained from adding them to the first season of the show. Back in January 2023, it was revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-will-have-tendrils-instead-of-spores-spreading-infection">Cordyceps infection would instead be spread by "tendrils"</a> in series one.</p>
<p>In season two, however, there will be "an escalation of numbers and types of infected", as well as "an escalation of the vector of how this thing spreads" Druckmann said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vjLYIVh6Dwc?si=wl_qxgq7Zv7ZdL1P">SXSW 2025</a>.</p>
<p>"The reason [we're doing spores now], I mean, we really wanted to figure it out, and again, everything has to be drama. There had to be a dramatic reason of introducing it now," Druckmann said, teasing:</p>
<p>"And there is."</p>

<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">set to kick off in the US on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, but the showrunners have already confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">will not cover the entirety of Part 2's narrative</a>.</p>
<p>Returning cast members include Pedro Pascal as Joel, Bella Ramsey as Ellie, Gabriel Luna as Tommy and Rutina Wesley as Maria. New faces for season two, meanwhile, include Kaitlyn Dever as Abby and Joe Pantoliano as Eugene, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">a role that has been expanded upon from the game</a> in the style of the first season's award winning Bill and Frank episode.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> turned fifteen this month, <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/3/16/metro-15th-anniversary-update">prompting a blog from 4A Games</a> celebrating the FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> series' past while looking forward to the next entry. The unnamed Metro 4 surfaced again last January as part of a reveal for VR title <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-awakening">Metro Awakening</a>, following a <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/studio-update-exodus-sdk">2023 blog</a> detailing the studio's experience under the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>"We do want to reassure you that work is continuing on both of our projects despite missile strikes, air-raid sirens, and terror still raining down on Ukraine," reads the new blog. "These circumstances are incredibly challenging, the situation remains dangerous and not within our control, but we are currently as safe as possible, and we want to manage your expectations around the reveal of the next Metro title, it will be ready when it is ready, and we can’t wait for you to see it".</p>

<p>The 2022 invasion of Ukraine "changed how we wanted to tell the story of the next Metro game," 4A continue. "As art became life for many of our developers in Ukraine, we drew from that lived experience to create an even darker story, those themes already present in Metro becoming ever-more apparent and important. As conflict, the struggle for power, the horrors of tyranny, and the price of freedom have become part of our lives over the past 3+ years, we are still living and working during this wartime, and that inevitably shapes the games we make."</p>
<p>The series - set in Moscow's metro tunnels and following the survivors of global nuclear  war - began life as a novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky, first published online when the author was just eighteen, then in print in 2005. Glukhovsky, originally from Moscow, is currently abroad after a court ordered his arrest in absentia following <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/06/07/russia-court-orders-arrest-of-critical-sci-fi-writer-a77926">public criticism of Russia's invasion</a>.</p>
<p>"Metro has always had a hard-hitting, political, anti-war and often emotional story," write 4A Games. "You can be sure these themes will continue thanks to our ongoing collaboration with franchise creator, author, and activist Dmitry Glukhovsky".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To avoid harassment, staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> studio Ubisoft Quebec have been "advised" not to celebrate or otherwise post on social media about the game's launch this week, as reported by French outlet <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/assassin-s-creed-shadows-pour-ubisoft-il-s-agit-de-sortir-de-l-ombre-ou-d-y-plonger-un-peu-plus_AV-202503170023.html">BFM TV</a> and spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">Kotaku</a>.</p>
<p>This follows months of online anger directed at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>, much of it from charming sods with handles like 'Da Phrenology Gamer' doing everything they can to avoid actually playing videogames, presumably before logging off for dinner and complaining that they don't want to eat any more woke broccoli, mum. Can't-hang-viceroy Elon Musk even got involved at one point, commenting "DEI kills art" on a tweet about the game (as opposed to, you know, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/doge-education-department-cuts-trump">cutting education funding</a>).</p>

<p>While much of this ire was targeted at the inclusion of black samurai protagonist Yasuke, it's worth noting that Ubisoft themselves <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116">released a statement last July</a> apologising for promotional materials "that have caused concern within the Japanese community", while emphasising that Shadows aims to be an "immersive and respectful" work of historical fiction rather than "factual representation".</p>
<p>They don't specify which materials, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-statement-yasuke-1851602337">Kotaku note that Ubisoft apologised separately</a> for the use of a flag belonging to military reenactment group Sekigahara Teppo-tai. Collectibles company <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/figurine">PureArts also pulled a figurine</a> depicting the game's protagonists in front of a one-legged torii gate, which some felt disrepectfully evoked the damage caused to Nagasaki's Sannō Shrine in the 1945 bombing.</p>
<p>This has all contributed towards an online atmosphere of hostility towards the game, which BFM TV report has culminated in an internal anti-online harassment plan at Ubisoft. "It's an initiative from Canada. There's a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack," an employee told the outlet, via Google Translate. "Unlike what we've had before, this is serious".</p>
<p>Activity on X, Reddit, and Youtube will be "closely monitored by a dedicated unit", write BFM TV, "in order to respond quickly to the slightest problem". Lawyers are prepared to "file complaints in the event of proven harassment."</p>
<p>“Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own," a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/ubisoft-anti-harassment-plan">Ubisoft spokesperson told PCGN</a>. "Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.”</p>
<p>Ubisoft aren't the only publisher to take similar steps in recent months. In January, Square Enix announced a new policy vowing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-square-enix-policy-will-clamp-down-on-harassers-bigots-and-unreasonable-compensation-requests">clamp down on harassment, bigotry and, uh, fallacious compensation requests</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals devs recently spoke about drawing inspiration from Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two when they had performance issues with Dr Strange’s portals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Strange’s portals in Marvel Rivals are one of the strongest abilities for strategic gameplay. The character can create a portal between any two points on the map, providing a direct line between those two points. However, while developing this ability for the character, Marvel Rivals developers were worried about the performance issues it might cause in the game, and to bypass this issue, they took inspiration from It Takes Two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-surprising-game-helped-improve-doctor-strange-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Marvel Rivals senior graphic designer Tieyi Zhang recently spoke about drawing inspiration from It Takes Two at a panel at GDC 2025. Zhang talked about how the Unreal Engine game (It Takes Two) “simultaneously renders two views without catastrophic overhead”, which made him wonder whether this game uses “some magic” he doesn’t know about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals’ breakthrough came after “discovering the local function, creating a local player.” Zhang realised that adding a local player “automatically enables split-screen rendering via distant cameras.” The report reveals that Marvel Rivals devs didn’t go through It Takes Two’s source code. The problems were solved by researching how Hazelight addressed its performance issues and using a similar strategy for Marvel Rivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has released a new teaser featuring gameplay for upcoming Daima DLC characters, including Son Goku (mini) and Vegeta (mini).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Spakring Zero’s Daima DLC trailer kicks off featuring combat sequences for Vegeta (mini), showcasing his moves in his base transformation and Super Saiyan form. Next up is Glorio, who uses his Ki-based whip to whack his opponents. Last up was Son Goku (mini); the character was already playable in the original Sparking Zero roster. However, the new trailer reveals the Super Saiyan transformation for the character.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Daima DLC will be split into two parts, as revealed through a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-daima-dlc-part-1-is-arriving-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam listing</a> earlier this month. According to the new <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1901488566708130120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official post</a>, the first set of DLC characters is scheduled to be introduced in April 2025. The next part of the Daima DLC is expected to arrive between July and September 2025, and that’s when players might receive the more hyped characters, such as Goku SSJ4 and Vegeta Super Saiyan 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No concrete release date was provided, and only three characters were revealed for Sparking Zero’s Daima Part 1 DLC. Many players wonder whether that’s all they get for the first part or more content will be announced next month.</p>
