              <p>Steam is currently running its “Steam Scream IV” sale and while it’s a little light on big AAA headliners (don’t expect any <i>Resident Evil</i>s on sale, or the recent <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent Hill f</i></a>), there’s a solid chunk of older titles you might’ve missed, as well as dozens of cool indie games available for pocket change (actual pocket change, mind you).</p> <p>The criteria for the “Scream” sale is also quite wide, so not all of these are horror games strictly speaking, but hey, a discount’s a discount.</p> <h2>Some recent spooky(ish) games you probably forgot about</h2> <p>Okay, maybe you didn’t forget about these, but then why aren’t they in your library?

<section><p>Rapha and Marach’s story goes against the grain by portraying SWANA characters as virtuous, imperfect people--an opportunity not awarded to many SWANA characters.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Final Fantasy Tactics has returned after 28 years to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review-a-polished-historical-gem/1900-6418413/">phenomenal critical acclaim</a> in The Ivalice Chronicles, with fans both old and new reveling in the improved gameplay and actor performances that weren’t possible in 1997. As Yasumi Matsuno, the creator of the original game, wrote in a moving <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1930391930317484080" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a>, Tactics comes to players in a time much like when the original was released--a time fraught with “inequality and division” that may leave many feeling “robbed of hope.” While Tactics is a fantasy story set in a fictional setting, developers did take a page or two out of real historical events, such as England’s War of the Roses in the mid to late 1400s. It’s bittersweet that history repeats itself now, but it does emphasize how relevant the evergreen themes of Tactics are, and how important Rapha and Marach Galthena’s involvement in the story is.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Israel and Palestine were also making headlines in 1997, the recent dramatic escalation of the situation has become a prominent global conversation today. With this escalation comes an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/11/anti-muslim-hate-hits-new-high-in-us-advocacy-group" rel="nofollow ">uptick in anti-Arab sentiment</a>, making Rapha and Marach’s involvement in The Ivalice Chronicles that much more special to South West Asian and North African (SWANA) gamers like me. It’s also very refreshing to hear actors Elham Ehsas and Lara Sawalha bringing these characters to life so authentically because it’s no secret that SWANA coded characters have, historically, not been depicted in the most flattering or nuanced light--especially in video games. From Metal Slug to Counter Strike, SWANA coded characters have been one of three things: belly dancers, camel-riding snake charmers, or just flat out evil terrorists. Rapha and Marach tell a very different story--one that allows room for nuance and mirrors many of the issues that our community faces internationally, which was saying a lot back in 1997 and says even more in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Rapha and Marach are orphans who were swiftly brought under the wing of Duke Barrington, a powerful man who intended to use the siblings for their rare mantra abilities. Duke Barrington not only recruited Rapha and Marach as child soldiers for his war efforts, but he also indoctrinated and trained countless other children too, by opening orphanages filled with “a pool of willing young minds.” This allowed him to select the very best to "mold and train,” as Ramza puts it. It may sound cartoonishly evil, but this is actually eerily similar to how <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/20/our-opportunity-end-talibans-use-child-soldiers" rel="nofollow ">the Taliban recruits today</a>. It is commendable that instead of framing Marach and Rapha as roadblocks designed to be cut down on Ramza’s journey, they are given a humanizing backstory that explains why they end up on a megalomaniac’s side of the war instead of Ramza’s. Rapha especially plays a crucial role in highlighting just how misled she and her brother have been, and tries her best to make him see that, in spite of his initial obstinance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4591506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4591506"></a><figcaption>Rapha confronts Marach about his belief in Duke Barrington.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, despite how much care is taken in handling the Galthenas’ story, there is room for critique as well. It's worth noting that the siblings are the only characters in the game with mantra abilities; this feeds into an Orientalist trope, essentially exoticizing the only SWANA coded characters in the game. Additionally, the fact that Rapha and Marach are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1nz6zt1/rapha_and_marach_are_terrible_characters_with/" rel="nofollow ">not well-optimized</a> at all makes them much less popular with Tactics fans. While this is relatively easy to fix with some respeccing, it still isn’t immediately obvious how to best utilize both characters in combat, and that could ultimately dissuade players from including Rapha and Marach in their parties, which is unfortunate and reflects some carelessness on the part of Square.</p><p dir="ltr">The other major critique I have is one narrative moment that paints an unflattering picture of Marach, specifically. When Rapha and Marach are first introduced in The Ivalice Chronicles, they are mid-argument. Marach is angry with Rapha for saying disparaging things about the man who he thinks saved them as children. When Rapha tells him she knows Barrington is the one who made them orphans in the first place, Marach slaps her across the face and says he “will not abide [her] ill-mannered tongue”. This seems to suggest that Marach is a fervent supporter of Duke Barrington and is enraged that anyone, let alone his own sister, would say a negative word about him. What this moment also does, is play into a negative stereotype about SWANA men being <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10857900/#:~:text=Arab%20Stereotypes&amp;text=Similar%20to%20Black%20people%2C%20Arab,i.e.%2C%20a%20physical%20threat%29." rel="nofollow ">‘inherently more violent’</a>, especially toward women. This scene makes even less sense when it is revealed that Marach actually wants to be free of Barrington, and is not intent on staying in service to him.</p><p dir="ltr">With all the changes and improvements that this version of Tactics went through, including a gorgeous script overhaul, I think there was room to remove the slap from Marach and Rapha’s argument to avoid unintentionally reinforcing a negative stereotype. It wouldn’t be the first time a character was re-examined in the Final Fantasy franchise. Cid in Final Fantasy 7 was originally implied to be <a href="https://youtu.be/KYWGfBjo0Ew?si=Fz8iAtOwEf9nkLbw" rel="nofollow ">abusive</a> in the 1997 version of the game, and has since been reworked to be an endearing, upbeat southern gentleman in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p><p dir="ltr">While the original FF7 Cid was a pretty dour character overall, Marach, on the other hand, is a flawed character, but not a bad one. He genuinely cares for his sister, and even takes a bullet for her once he finally hears Duke Barrington admit to being the villain he has always been. After Rapha brings Marach back to life with the Scorpio Stone, the siblings both join Ramza’s party. For the first time in their lives, they actively choose what to fight for and who to fight alongside. It’s also revealed in optional dialogue when battling Hashmal/Folmarv that Rapha and Marach want that encounter to be the very last time they have to kill anyone ever again, which was unheard of for SWANA coded characters in the 90s and is still fairly uncommon now.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Rapha and Marach’s story is a bit of a short one in Tactics’ overall narrative, it is still impactful and continues to go against the grain by portraying SWANA characters as virtuous, imperfect people, like many other characters get to be. Would it be nice if their stats were better optimized? Sure. But in the grand scheme of things, the Galthena siblings are still great examples of how SWANA coded characters can be, and what I hope to see more of in future games.</p>

                <p>It's been a very good year for indie titles on Steam, even in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">blockbuster success</a>. Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a> somehow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-briefly-outgunned-battlefield-6-on-steam-this-week/1100-6535685/" data-ref-id="1100-6535685">briefly outgunned Battlefield 6</a>. Now, another indie game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rv-there-yet/" data-ref-id="5000-697807">RV There Yet</a>, has raced past 1.3 million sales in a single week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7mXFwVNX6Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H7mXFwVNX6Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>RV There Yet is the debut game of Nuggets Entertainment, and up to four players can join this co-op experience as they get behind the wheel of an RV home while attempting a very perilous side route through Mabutts Valley. The goal of the game is to get the RV past obstacles that it would ordinarily be unable to traverse. To pull that off, players will have to leave the RV and creatively use a winch and other tools to get by. As seen in the trailer above, some of those attempts can end very badly. This band of bros also has to deal with wildlife and snakes, which is why an EpiPen is one of their primary tools.</p><p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3949040/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, RV There Yet had over 100,000 concurrent players in its first week. Nuggets Entertainment community manager Jace Varlet subsequently posted the following video, in which he thanks players on behalf of the team. He also explains why the game wasn't marked as "early access."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CaS-_47zI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P2CaS-_47zI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In short, Nuggets Entertainment didn't expect this game to take off the way it did, and the studio just wanted to finish the title by its internally agreed-upon release date. There weren't originally any plans to add more content to RV There Yet, but that may soon change. Meanwhile, Varlet acknowledged that there are some bugs in the game and he pledged that they will be fixed.</p><p>There aren't any current plans for RV There Yet to make the leap to consoles, but it's currently on sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949040/RV_There_Yet/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> for $7.19 before reverting to its regular price of $8 on October 28. Nuggets has also been concurrently developing another title called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/among-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-631981">Among the Wild</a>, but it just isn't ready for release yet.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Minutes Of Halo Campaign Evolved Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Many wondered if Halo Studios employed some kind of artificial intelligence tool to help with this, but Microsoft has not confirmed one way or another, stating only that there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-wasnt-forced-to-use-generative-ai/1100-6535730/" data-ref-id="1100-6535730">no mandate that the studio <em>needed </em>to use AI</a>. In any event, executive producer Damon Conn said, "We've done everything we can to make sure that we preserve the heart of Halo as we rebuild and retouch everything."</p><p>The developers working on the remake said they were able to achieve this while keeping the "tone, the atmosphere, and the emotional impact" of the original game "preserved" for Campaign Evolved.</p><p>The remake makes some controversial changes, too, including the addition of sprint and some vehicle updates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">one of the game's original designers is not too happy about.</a> Another developer who worked on the original Halo weighed in on the remake with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">different, more enthusiastic and hopeful take. </a></p><p>Campaign Evolved launches in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S and PC, as well as PlayStation 5. The franchise is synonymous with Xbox and has never appeared on PlayStation until this remake. It may not be the last Halo game on PS5, either, as Halo Studios has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">"Halo is on PlayStation" going forward.</a></p><p>There is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-halo-1-remake-has-no-multiplayer/1100-6535707/" data-ref-id="1100-6535707">no head-to-head multiplayer support</a>, but campaign co-op will be available. Check out the video above to get a closer look at the remake compared against the original. Pricing for Halo: Campaign Evolved has not been announced, but it has been confirmed that the game will launch at the same time on all platforms, as opposed to coming to Xbox and PC before PS5.</p><p>Microsoft has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">multiple new Halo games in the works</a>, and another one might be a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/"> live-service Halo game</a> that could also release in 2026 for Halo's 25th anniversary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> marked the official confirmation of something that felt like it would never happen just a short few years ago, with Halo officially coming to PlayStation. Following that announcement, GameStop, the retailer that was initially known for selling physical video games that's now more known for turning into a glorified Pop Funko and merch store called the 'Console Wars' over. Of all entities, the White House, which would normally have more important things to post about, responded with an AI-generated image of President Trump in Spartan armor with the caption "<em>Power to the players</em>."</p>



<p>GameStop's original post comes with a long and drawn-out declaration about the console wars being over, calling them <em>"petty</em>," which they definitely are, and also claiming that they originated with the release of the original Xbox and Halo: Combat Evolved with it. </p>



<p>A bit of a history lesson here for GameStop: console wars or, more accurately, players needlessly siding with one console manufacturer over another based on things like exclusive games you might prefer over the other and real-life factors like most parents being unwilling and/or unable to afford buying their kids consoles from every manufacturer, began long before the days of Xbox vs. PlayStation with Nintendo vs. SEGA.</p>



<p>Sure, Console Wars have always been more than a bit idiotic, but at least get the details of it right if you're going to go through the effort of making a big song-and-dance over it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking of getting the details right, unspurisingly, the AI that someone at the White House used to generate the image of Trump in Master Chief's armor holding an energy sword and saluting the American Flag on the White House lawn, did not get the details right. Specifically the key detail of the fact that the American flag should have 50 stars on it, one for each state. Instead, the AI-generated image only has 40 stars on the flag. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>By now, we're used to AI-generated images getting details wrong, and we've also become used to The White House using AI-generated images to display the President in all manner of ways, including ones that have caught a fair deal of flak, like the image that showed Trump as the Pope following the death of Pope Francis.</p>



<p>But it feels telling that important details like getting the right number of stars on the American flag in a post coming from the official White House account are overlooked in an attempt to garner some kind of cultural clout. Like how the caption "<em>Power to the Players</em>" overlooks the fact that tariffs instituted by the current administration have been a direct factor in the cost of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">gaming hardware going up in the United States and worldwide</a>. </p>



<p>Or how, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-suggests-video-games-blame-mass-shootings-n1039411">in 2019, Trump pointed to video games as "<em>the glorification of violence in our society</em>,"</a> and pointed to violence in games as a reason for America's mass shooting problems. Never mind the fact that several studies have never been able to prove any links between mass shootings and violence in video games, or the fact that games like Halo and Call of Duty are available everywhere in the world, and only in the United States do these mass shooting issues persist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5Rj8M6FRYU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Shacknews</a> alongside a few other colleagues to discuss the making of Borderlands 4, the studio's latest game, which was released on September 12.</p>



<p>The video runs for 73 minutes, and right toward the end, Pitchford goes into exactly what is needed to create such a big videogame like Borderlands 4. Interestingly, he then adds that the gaming industry as a whole is just getting started and 'figuring out' videogames, which haven't yet received their 'Citizen Kane' moment yet.</p>



<p><em>To make a game like Borderlands 4 takes a big investment. It's a massive, massive game. Hundreds and hundreds of people for years. And that's very expensive. The budgets of our big video games now are larger than the budgets of blockbuster movies. You can't easily make that decision to commit those kinds of resources towards a thing, whether you're the person who has the cash or you're any individual on that team, to decide to commit that portion of your life to that endeavor. </em></p>



<p><em>It can only happen if everybody in that loop believes that what is being imagined has more value to exist in the world than what it takes to create it, which means you both need the idea of what it takes to create it, the belief in what it takes to create it, and a sense of what it might be worth if it was created. And everybody has to have that understanding, or it just doesn't work. And I love that I'm in it and I love that we're just getting started. When I say we, I'm talking about the entire industry. Like, we haven't even had our Citizen Kane yet, let alone, you know, Jurassic Park or Star Wars. We're just figuring this out. But it's fun.</em></p>



<p>Cinephiles already know that Pitchford is referencing the film directed by Orson Welles. Released in 1941, it is considered the first true masterpiece in cinema, not to mention one of the best movies ever made to this day. </p>



<p>While Pitchford may have a point in that gaming is not yet as developed as other entertainment media, it has been 54 years since the release of the first commercial game (Computer Space), and many gamers would agree that the medium has already provided multiple 'Citizen Kanes' to date. Its evolution is arguably even faster than cinema's, and nowadays, movie and TV companies are fighting to get the rights to adapt gaming franchises way more than vice versa. </p>



<p>It may not be as controversial a statement as <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some Borderlands 4 claims made by the Gearbox founder</a>, but it's still bound to get gamers talking.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/painkiller-review-atrophied-angel</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-review-atrophied-angel.1336177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My time machine to return to 2012 must have worked. A co-op centric shooter reboot of <em>Painkiller</em>, a 2004 title that originally didn’t feature co-op centric gameplay, looking to emulate the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/10-years-of-left-4-dead-hunters-and-boomers-and-smokers-oh-my" rel="nofollow"><em>Left 4 Dead</em></a>? There’s still work to be done. I need to hoard some <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive" rel="nofollow"><em>Counter-Strike</em></a> skins and make sure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/why-microsoft-looking-sonys-dinner-sales-floor" rel="nofollow">Xbox doesn’t shoot itself in the foot</a> to create a substantially healthier console war atmosphere.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from Polish developers Anshar Studios, a studio typically involved in providing assistance, most notably for teams like Bloober (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/silent-hill-2-remake-revives-classic" rel="nofollow">Silent Hill 2</a>, Layers of Fear), and Larian (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow">Baldur’s Gate III</a>). Other than that, they’ve also dabbled in the likes of CRPGs with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gamedec" rel="nofollow">Gamedec</a>, and experimented with VR in the form of Detached and Telefrag. It’s clear they’ve got charisma and the variance to match it.</p>

<p>You play as one of four individuals, tasked by Metatron, the Voice of God, to prevent Azazel’s invasion of Earth by way of an endless demon horde. These characters are composed of Ink, a no-nonsense female mercenary type, Roch, a brutish individual displaying Dwarfish personality traits, Void, a strangely geeky individual who seems to play the straight man, and Sol, a devilish minx type who cosplays as a nun.</p>



<p>Judging from the eye test, <em>Painkiller </em>doesn’t <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/painkiller-preview-classic-fps-back-from-purgatory" rel="nofollow">leave a lot to hope for</a>. Similar to the gothic environments on display, this cold, almost cynical portrayal of Hell and how you interact with it immediately leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. With that said, it’s not like <em>Painkiller</em>’s name is being inexplicably ripped away from its legacy, a la the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prey-review-dont-fear-reaper" rel="nofollow"><em>Prey</em> </a>reboot, and indeed, an outcome similar to <em>Prey WAS </em>possible.</p>

<p>For example, the weapons that made the original game famous have returned and are modernized, like the titular “Painkiller” and electro-shuriken shooter, and for the most part, the weapons feel great. Standard additions such as the shotgun and rocket launcher have the feedback to provide catharsis, although the aforementioned electro-shuriken shooter fails to have the same oomph as times past. This may be due to the enemy variety also, as all of them are squishy vessels for ultra-gibbing and shiny red gore, pressed under the modern demand for video games, so the lack of a visible body count hurts proceedings.</p>

<p>Also, no skeleton warriors. Boo!</p>



<p>All 4 characters have a preset perk, their only defining factor of difference in gameplay styles, and all of them are a borderline for co-op synergy. With that said, synergy is saved for the returning tarot card system, which is executed wonderfully in the core gameplay loop. There are 1 or 2 outliers that are able to single-handedly win you a run, with bots or otherwise, but the ones that offer baseline buffs tend to be felt in actual gameplay.</p>

<p>There’s also a scoring system attached to general proceedings, one which is largely negligible in terms of what it rewards, that being simple kills. Sure, there are minuscule bonuses attached when you kill an enemy with a certain element, but the rewards for it are, frankly, invisible. You never really feel like you get more gold or XP after a match, whether you score 3 million points or 30 million, which is disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Levels themselves are largely linear, sprinkled with gold, small amounts of team banter, and arena standoffs. With the latter, you’ll either have to transport a barrel-shaped object from one area to the next, or survive against 3 enemy waves – and it’ll always be 3 enemy waves. Respectively, they’re a test of brain and brawn, and for Painkiller itself, a showcase of how not to transplant this type of gameplay into a co-op core.</p>



<p>The problem here is pace. <em>Painkiller </em>wants to host&nbsp;a lot of free-running flow in its mechanics and level design, with slides, dashes, and grappling available, in very strict, suffocating doses. In reality, the rugged and otherwise decrepit portrayal of the visual design and arenas leads to an attainable flow not being possible. You’ll more than likely slide for a second before a bump or outcropping of rocks stops you dead.</p>

<p>Due to a completely arbitrary stamina system attached to the movement mechanics, and the generally low base speed of your characters, teamwork is more forced than generated naturally. It’s really easy to get swarmed, and the character perks and systems aren’t there to substantiate a system that doesn't just result in corner camping. You’ll almost always be a squishy, quippy – unbearingly quippy – hunk of meat with bullets coming out of it.</p>

<p>The writing is also another bag of worms. Before you’ve even faced your first demon, characters will be drenching every line with such sour, grotesque flavors of ironic detestability, as if Purgatory is only showing Joss Whedon films. There’s no variety in the dialogue either, so each of the 9 levels present in the base game will present you with the exact same exposition, and the exact same call-outs, and the exact same insufferable jokes.</p>



<p>There is absolutely no reason for this. No one was asking Daniel Garner in the original <em>Painkiller </em>to punctuate his later adventures with references to <em>Deuce Bigalow</em>, and what exactly do these one-note personalities add to proceedings? Why does Void “act” like a charming robot, despite being some nebulous, unknown vessel? If it’s due to the lack of modern context, why does everyone have a modern lexicon?</p>

<p>It sounds nitpicky, but when you have to hear the same thing every single run, with no variance in the arenas, their spawns, their dialogue, or otherwise, it grows into this incessant banter-y beast. It’s not funny hearing Sol’s dominatrix quips for the 100th time; it’s not funny hearing Azazel act like Barney from <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>. There is no character growth here, just pointless jokes while history and context are all buried behind a completely codex of flavorless history, which feels antithetical to what characters and their personalities generate.</p>

<p>As harsh as it is to say, this co-op function is the worst part of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, which is why you should focus on yourself. Play with bots, create your own rampage, and find yourself in a much better position than worrying about your teammates. The bot AI is an over-performer in terms of the issues it faces, and it seems Anshar is aware of any potential issues, which is why it'll teleport to any location almost on demand.</p>



<h2><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>When it comes down to it, Painkiller is a shooter set in Hell, stylistically and substantially so. But when compared to the competition, games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-2016" rel="nofollow"><em>DOOM</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/first-person-spotlight-quake" rel="nofollow"><em>Quake</em></a>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bpm-bullets-per-minute-review" rel="nofollow">BPM: Bullets Per Minute</a></em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dread-templar" rel="nofollow">Dread Templar</a></em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metal-hellsinger" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal: Hellsinger</em></a>, <em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ultrakill" rel="nofollow"><em>Ultrakill</em></a>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warstride-challenges" rel="nofollow">Warstride Challenges</a></em>, <em>Killing Floor</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prodeus" rel="nofollow"><em>Prodeus</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dusk" rel="nofollow"><em>Dusk</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/devil-daggers-review-giving-devil-its-due" rel="nofollow"><em>Devil Daggers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/first-person-saturday-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Blood</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/coverage-club-nightmare-reaper-is-brutal-callback-to-fps-golden-age" rel="nofollow"><em>Nightmare Reaper</em></a>, and even&nbsp;<em>Clive Barker's Jericho</em>?

  <div>
      <div><p>The Combined Army, under the command of the alien AI, the Evolved Intelligence, has recruited the hero Achilles from humanity's AI, Aleph, to lead a combined force of aliens and enhanced humans under the banner of the Next Wave. But Achilles hasn't abandoned humanity, but has changed sides to save it. In this article, we check out the first release for <em>Infinity's</em> newest sectorial, the Next Wave Action Pack.</p>

<p><em>Infinity N5 </em>launched last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Operation Sandtrap</a> box, and those who've been reading my articles for a while will know that I started my own <em>Infinity</em> journey with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power" rel="nofollow">JSA launch box</a> back in 2018 when the JSA broke away from Yu Jing and became a non-aligned army, before finally becoming their own standalone faction in the current edition of&nbsp;<em>Infinity, N5</em>.</p>




<h2>Humanity Evolved</h2>

<p>The Evolved Intelligence is an alien AI that has destroyed and assimilated multiple worlds and races to its cause. Its forces are known as the Combined Army, specially selected races and units that serve in specific roles. We've previously looked at the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-morat-aggression-forces-guide" rel="nofollow">Morat Aggression Forces</a>, the mailed fist of the Combined Army. Now, the EI has unleashed its newest force, the Next Wave, a combined force of alien races and humans that have defected from the control of ALEPH, humanity's AI.</p>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Action Pack contains 10 miniatures that are exclusive to the Next Wave sectorial, so don't feature in the wider Combined Army faction. The action pack contains:</p>

<ul><li>3 Harbingers (2x Combi Rifle, 1x Hacker) - These are the Next Wave line infantry and can be upgraded to Paramedic, Lieutenant, or Comlink Specialist with the Combi-Rifle profile. They come with Dodge +3 as standard and Combat Instinct, which makes them difficult to catch off guard. The extra skills throughout the Next Wave profiles are what set them apart from the human line infantry in other forces.</li>
	<li>1 Contrabandolero (Boarding Shotgun) - This unit is designed to sneak with&nbsp;Hidden deployment, Infiltration with a bonus to the check, Stealth, Surprise Attack, Dodge +3, and Mimetism -3, and if that wasn't enough, can specialize&nbsp;as&nbsp;a Hacker, Minelaye,&nbsp;or Forward Observer.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1 Cliff-Jumper (Boarding Shotgun) - This unit, as the name would suggest, is a specialist parachutist who also comes with +1Burst to make their ranged weapons more effective.</li>
	<li>1 Ironside (HMG) - This heavy infantry unit&nbsp;is made up of humans&nbsp;melded with a technorganic device attached to their spine. Their&nbsp;Albedo equipment means that units targeting them with specialist abilities and equipment take a negative modifier, and their BS-3 skill means that they're more likely to win opposed shooting rolls.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>2x Raindancer (1x Red Fury, 1x Contender) - These are close combat specialists with Dodge +3 and +2 inches, Mimetism -6, and Stealth to help them close up. Despite being close combat focused, both of these profiles have soldi ranged weapons to use as they move up the field.</li>
	<li>1 Tekdraken Steeljaw (Boarding Pistol) - The Tekdrakens have 2 different types in Next Wave. The Steeljaw versions are the close combat specialists. They are fast with&nbsp;a 6-4 move, as you might expect from a cybernetically boosted dinosaur. You can also pay an extra point to give them a combi-rifle turret (and you should, because it looks awesome).</li>
	<li>Pandora (Viral Pistol) - This special character is a pitcher deployer, meaning she&nbsp;can fire a repeater token to extend her hacking area. She's also key here because she is a Fireteam Master, so she can join a Fireteam with the Tekdrakens to keep them in line.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=NGZopXU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=hCNzjr-I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Tekdraken is a literal TechRaptor!</figcaption></figure><p>From what we can tell, Next Wave is going to have a lot of focus on multiple small fire teams, with some solid infantry, lizard/dinosaur heavy-hitting units, and the special characters that made the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-operation-blackwind-guide" rel="nofollow">Steel Phalanx</a> awesome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=ENrm9v3g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=sLrvfZLP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you order within the pre-order window, you can grab the&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Action Pack bundle and preorder exclusive Glyph Warcor.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's Next For The Next Wave?</h2>

<p>Releasing alongside the Next Wave Action Pack as part of the pre-order, is the Juggernaut, who, rather than standard TAG which are piloted armoured suits, is a technorganic giant cat with a rider. The juggernaut comes with an 8-2 move and a multi-HMG with -1 to the opponent's saving throw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The special pre-order bonus for Next Wave is the Glyph Warcor, an alien journalist with the standard Dodge +3 that the Next Wave infantry has. They can have either sixth sense, which lets them respond to attacks outside of their normal arc, or the 360-degree visor, which lets them shoot outside of their normal arc.</p>

<p>After that, we expect the rest of the faction to fill out with a release a month, along the same lines as previous factions, with their named characters, and more awesome alien fusion (and the other flavor of TechRaptor, I mean Tekdraken).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=GKFfQbAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=flnSQGda 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Juggernaut miniature is a break from standard TAGs, and features a mounted rider.</figcaption></figure><h2>Infinity Next Wave Action Pack Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>The Next Wave looks awesome. The layered plates and reptilian texture on their armor make them look like the fusion of human and alien that they are. The fact that they have a literal TechRaptor is a bonus. They also stand out, and the wealth of abilities on top of their stats makes them seem like humanity evolved. Outside of the Action Pack, the Juggernaunt miniature is incredible, and I love that rather than go the standard TAG route, we've got a full mounted cavalry unit. I can't wait to see the named characters as they get introduced to the faction, and what other alien fusions come along.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Throughout </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, the citizens of Lumiose City worry about the potential consequences of having wild monsters living alongside humans, with the monsters in designated Wild Zones. What if a powerful Pokémon escapes these fenced-in areas and wreaks havoc on the populace? That’s a perfectly valid fear, actually, because fans have become so scared of one of these zones that they’re warning other players not to go in there without a powerful water Pokémon on their team. I’m talking about Wild Zone 17, and its literal lion’s den full of Pyroars.</span></p> <p><span>This small area was once a simple park, and now that Lumiose City has made it a Wild Zone, untamed Pokémon roam it. The local Diggersby is making tunnels in its earth. Skarmory flies over the area. When you go there after the sun goes down, you might find a Lampent’s flame lighting up the night. Those are pretty manageable, however. What’s got players spooked is that an entire pride of Pyroar hangs out in the upper area. As best as I can tell after repeated trips to Wild Zone 17, the spawn is fixed to have one Alpha-sized male Pyroar and several regular-sized female ones. If even one of these fire-breathing lions sees you, the entire pack is going to pounce on you before you can even throw a Poké Ball.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-crimson-desert-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-crimson-desert-this-fantasy-steampunk-open-world-isn%E2%80%99t-as-strange-as-you-may-think.1336135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been almost six years since Crimson Desert was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crimson-desert-official-reveal-trailer">first revealed to the world</a>. Across that period, developer Pearl Abyss has shown off a huge array of ideas, mechanics, and boss battles. It’s frequently been cited as something of an “everything game” – an open world adventure with sky islands, mechanical dragons, wrestling moves, interdimensional gateways, interacting elemental effects, and even a Spider-Man web swing. But the more that’s been revealed, the more there’s been the sense that Crimson Desert may be a lot of pieces in need of a whole. Finding that whole was my main objective when I visited Pearl Abyss’ studio in Seoul for this month’s IGN First. And while I can’t say I’ve found it yet, multiple hours of hands-on playtime has revealed a game that’s maybe not as strange as you’d expect. In fact, Crimson Desert feels pretty straightforward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss has crafted a reasonably traditional open world adventure, made up of multiple regions peppered with towns, outposts, and castles. There’s the usual collection of main and optional quests, plus classic distractions like fishing. You’d be forgiven for not realising this, though – Pearl Abyss has put almost all its promotional efforts into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-three-new-bosses-gameplay">showcasing boss fights</a>. Not only that, but Crimson Desert’s blend of traditional medieval fantasy with sci-fi and steampunk elements does make it seem like it’s being pulled in several directions at once. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you’re on the ground and seeing how all these elements interact, though, it doesn’t feel quite so alien. The continent of Pywel is perhaps less like a typical Tolkien-esque fantasy world and more akin to Dungeons &amp; Dragons – a setting that, in recent years, was host to <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dungeons-dragons-baldurs-gate-descent-into-avernus-review-8-1200x900.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Mad Max-like vehicular chase through Hell</a>. Pearl Abyss’ design team explained that they wanted Pywel to reflect the variety of our reality, in which some countries feel much more futuristic than others, and note that some of the Pywel’s leaders may be more resistant to the advancement of technology than others – a conflict that’ll be explored through various faction quests. All this means the variety doesn’t feel artificial or there simply for the sake of being wild, even when you’re at the controls of a flying battle robot (which was, of course, designed by dwarven engineers.) </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The inclusion of these mechanised and steampunk elements grant Pearl Abyss the creative license to build quests that are a significant departure from anything we’d see in something like Skyrim. A major part of my hands-on time involved completing a quest for Marni, a scientific genius who cloned his own consciousness to create the AI-like entity, H.A.L.L. Naturally the results of such an experiment have gone very wrong, and Marni’s evil digital-magic twin has taken command of a flying fortress that’s terrorizing Pywel’s skies. Defeating H.A.L.L requires the use of a power core, which Marni reveals is hidden inside a “weapon” called Golden Star. And by “weapon”, he means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-golden-star-quest-gameplay">a giant mechanical dragon</a>. While they presumably have ballistic missiles in Pywel, what with the advanced engineering and all, <em>of course</em> the fantasy version of a nuke is flying Mechagodzilla. All that stands between me and this winged menace is… a fortress filled with angry battle robots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears that fortress assaults will be a significant recurring objective in Crimson Desert, considering that my hands-on time involved no fewer than three of them. I can see why Pearl Abyss was keen to show them off, as they are a showcase for some of the project’s strongest achievements. There’s a great sense of atmosphere, with a legion of men from either side battering the living hell out of each other, and you’re caught in the middle of it all. Fun mechanical wrinkles add texture; during one attack I was able to fire signalling arrows that were quickly followed by a bombardment of artillery, decimating enemy soldiers and reducing buildings to splinters. In another, I was able to circumnavigate the brutal melee entirely, sneaking into the castle through a crumbling wall and using the prison as a shortcut to the boss. And in my fight through the robot fortress, a backpack-mounted EMP device allowed me to fry the circuits of both the lumbering ground threats and the airborne bug-bots in one giant blast. There’s always something new to try, something to experiment with.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The variety of ideas doesn’t feel artificial or there simply for the sake of being wild, even when you’re at the controls of a flying battle robot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But as much as these fortress assaults are a demonstration of Crimson Desert’s highs, they simultaneously reveal what could turn out to be some of its biggest blemishes. Battling masses of enemies is surprisingly tedious, feeling messy and repetitive rather than an engaging chain of frontline fights. An awkward lock-on feature pushed me away from one-on-one duels and into a more freeform playstyle, but that came with the baggage of imprecise strikes and occasionally kicking the air instead of faces. Absolutely none of these issues hamper the boss battles, which was my only experience of Crimson Desert prior to this demonstration, and I was quite surprised at how different combat can feel in alternative scenarios, even when using the same moveset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s in these smaller, less refined details where Crimson Desert threatens to lose itself. There are occasions where you need to pick up and manipulate objects, such as planting a banner to inspire your allies. Doing so requires standing still, turning to face the object, activating a focus mode, rapidly tapping a button to lift your target, and then finally manually carry it. All of this is a slightly baffling annoyance when erecting flags, but it turns into a genuine frustration in the middle of a boss battle, when you’re desperately trying to swing a fallen masonry column during the precious few seconds in which the boss is stunned.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, no such awkward Ultrahand juggling is required to extract the power core from Golden Star. As we explored earlier this month in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-how-the-golden-star-dragon-boss-was-created">our making-of feature</a>, this is a boss battle with a unique mechanic that must be discovered in the (quite literal) heat of battle. The dragon’s flaming breath activates an array of pylons dotted around the fortress’ battle arena, which then dispense EMP bombs that you can fire from an arm-mounted cannon. The system creates a repeating phase loop; Golden Star circles above, belching the flames that produce the EMP bombs that will eventually bring him crashing to the ground, where you can unleash a barrage of strikes until he reboots and begins the cycle anew. Pearl Abyss are keen to point out you don’t <em>have </em>to do this – you could, for instance, use lightning-wreathed arrows to apply a stun, or simply chip away at his health bar with ranged attacks – but I feel that the real enjoyment in all of Crimson Desert’s boss fights has been finding the unique mechanic built into the arena or even the enemy itself.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the power core obtained, I take to the skies on the back of my own (completely organic) dragon to attack H.A.L.L’s flying fortress. The initial assault is pretty simple – I have my mount spit fireballs at a number of weak spots in the structure’s shields to break down the defences and allow me to land. But getting inside the fortress itself is more complicated; a navigation puzzle that’s just the right side of obtuse. My journey takes me up elevator shafts and along a precarious route perched on the fortress’ exterior. At one point I have to activate a machine by rotating a wooden pillar that has no crank, achieved by using the thrust attack to bury my blade in the timber to create my own handle. There’s no prompt for this, and I appreciate that the solution is to think about your ability set in a non-conventional manner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such an approach continues inside, where defeating H.A.L.L is more of a puzzle than a traditional challenge of brawn. I like that Crimson Desert’s AI spirit character doesn’t just become another boss brawl – another indicator that the world’s weird steampunk and sci-fi elements actually make some kind of in-universe sense. This time, though, the solution really is obtuse, and someone from Pearl Abyss had to spell it out to me. Hopefully the hours prior to this quest will have equipped you with the knowledge of how to approach this particular foe. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I am a little apprehensive that at least some of Crimson Desert’s offerings will be “stuff to do” rather than meaningful, interlinked opportunities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">H.A.L.L’s flying fortress isn’t the only airborne destination I visited. Suspended high above Pywel are a scattering of Abyss Islands, accessed through portals that are unlocked with mysterious Abyss Artefacts. These islands appear to come in multiple guises; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-echoes-zelda-and-assassins-creed-with-its-action-packed-open-world">last year</a> we saw that one of them is home to an alchemist called Alustin and his Library of Providence, and my hands-on session included one that was more akin to Zelda’s puzzle shrines. Its checkerboard floor was essentially a room-size circuit board in need of a total rewiring, and finding the correct path through the grid of rotating flagstones unlocks the island’s treasure trove. This is, of course, the sort of puzzle you’ve solved in everything from Watch Dogs to BioShock, but I enjoyed how your equipment is integral to completing it – your lantern illuminates the correct pathway, and your grapple hook is used to spin each tile. So while this challenge is not particularly taxing, I hope its solid foundations are the basis for more interesting puzzles that await among the clouds.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you’ve uncovered an Abyss Island’s secrets, you can leap off the side and float down to earth, where plenty more traditional open-world fare awaits. There are towns to visit, in which you’ll find shop keepers to trade with and bounties to take on. Out in the wilderness there are camps to clear out and roaming barbarians to slaughter. And then there’s the factions. From what I glimpsed in the menus, there are dozens and <em>dozens </em>of them, although some will be more important than others, I’m told. A few have their own questline, such as House Wells, a family of nobles led by a Duke who’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-gameplay-ign-first">lost his castle to rebel forces</a> – a situation that’s the catalyst for one of those aforementioned fortress assaults. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert IGN First - Combat and Mounts Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss was quick to clarify that these groups are not like Fallout’s factions, and allegiances with them won’t change the course of the story or impact Crimson Desert’s ending (which is set in stone.) And so I’m left wondering what are the faction quests in aid of? When asked, Pearl Abyss’ design team explained that they were there to ensure the factions felt like significant actors in the plot, and that they offered more content for players to complete. That considered, I am a little apprehensive that at least some of Crimson Desert’s offerings will be “stuff to do” rather than meaningful, interlinked opportunities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to my very first question. What is Crimson Desert as a whole? I know it’s a vast open world with deep, fighting-game inspired combat that works better against bosses than it does against fodder. It’s got spectacle-laden quests that take you from in-the-mud castle assaults all the way up to aerial strikes on a steampunk Death Star. And it’s littered with good time distractions, from fishing to taming bears and buckling up in a battle mech. But I’m still waiting to discover the glue between all this that elevates an open world to new heights. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadow of Mordor has the Nemesis system, which chains its enemies together into a foe-conquering big picture. Red Dead Redemption 2’s systems are united by a pursuit of realism and authenticity that makes its campaign feel like a life lived rather than a game played. And this year’s Ghost of Yotei links every activity on its map to a new unlock on your skill tree, ensuring even little diversions are a growth opportunity. That’s the stuff that’s so far been missing from Crimson Desert’s demonstrations, and the thing I hope will eventually be revealed when I get to play multiple consecutive hours, rather than a collection of isolated quests and bosses. Without it, I still think Crimson Desert stands a solid chance of being an overall good time. But with it, it could become something much more special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-crimson-desert-hands-on-preview]]></content:encoded>

<p>After the stellar launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> earlier this year, the next Level-5 project we have to look forward to is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, which <em>should</em> finally arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on 14th November. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> and DECAPOLICE have been delayed to 2026, so we'll have to wait a little longer to get our hands on either of them.</p>
<p>After that, we've got the remade <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/inazuma_eleven_re">Inazuma Eleven RE</a> and whatever Holy Horror Mansion turns out to be. In short, it looks like Level-5 is sticking around for the foreseeable future. Let's just hope that the quality can stick around with it.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Dean Hall, the creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> and more recently Icarus, has called out Valve regarding the use of gambling-related monetisation methods in its games.</p>
<p>In an interview with Eurogamer, Hall said, "It's something I think Valve does not get anywhere near enough criticism about. I'm honestly disgusted with gambling mechanics in video games at all - they have absolutely no place.</p>
<p>"My challenge to game developers," he added, "is that if they think these things are not a problem, they make the data available to universities who are crying out to study this stuff."</p>
<p>Hall's remarks refer to loot boxes in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which offer weapon and armour skins that can be traded with other players and so fuel a multi-billion dollar marketplace surrounding the game - a marketplace that includes significant betting activity.</p><p>Loot boxes have generally been moved away from after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-university-reports-loot-boxes-cause-financial-and-emotional-harm-to-children">multiple countries commissioned investigations into their use</a> and the effect they were having on younger minds. But Valve sidestepped the resulting regulations by changing the loot box system so you pay for the contents inside the box rather than the box itself.</p>
<p>Hall's comments came while speaking to me about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dayz-creators-survival-game-icarus-is-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-soon-but-it-wont-have-cross-play">survival game Icarus</a>, which was originally going to be free-to-play before it switched to the expensive DLC model it has now - the Paradox model, as Hall calls it. It's a divisive model but RocketWerkz - Hall's studio - needed to use it in order to survive, he told me.</p>
<p>Players aren't the only ones who are unhappy with it. "I'm not happy either," Hall said. "I agree with a lot of the people who get mad about the DLC approach. I don't really like the Icarus approach. We needed it to survive.</p>
<p>"I actually think a lot of gamers don't realise that 99 percent of devs out there are sitting there going, I don't like this. So who's winning? Because it's sure not us. There's a lot of game studios like mine that are just holding on and trying to keep making the games we want to make, but not necessarily happy with how they monetise."</p>

<p>Hall's answer to this problem may come in Kitten Space Agency, the unashamed and somewhat blatant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> follow-up that RocketWerkz is working on now. The idea is to make it free - free with the option of a contribution if you want to pay.</p><p>"I want to find a different way," he said. "We've got to do something. We've got to try something. And if there's ever a game that deserves trying that, it's a KSP-style game. That's one game I think maybe we can try and do something different with. We say games can inspire, and inspiration should be free, which is kind of a tagline with KSA. I think the game deserves better, I really do - I think the game deserves to be free."</p>
<p>Kitten Space Agency doesn't have a release date yet but testing is starting to open out, albeit to select guests at the moment. Whether or not an optional fee will work for Kitten Space Agency, and whether the income it generates will be enough for RocketWerkz to survive on, remains to be seen. Life has been tough for the New Zealand studio; the launch of Icarus four years ago nearly dragged it under. But as I discussed in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dayz-creator-dean-hall-is-a-changed-man-after-years-of-living-the-high-life-hes-focused-on-saving-a-studio-that-flew-too-close-to-the-sun">a candid interview with Dean Hall</a>, things are starting to turn around.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> is just about to launch on the Switch 2, and to celebrate, Sega has announced another new DLC expansion scheduled to launch this winter.</p>
<p>Dubbed 'Zooseum', it's essentially, well... a zoo. It's a brand new location that will no doubt introduce a smorgasbord of interesting creatures to care for as you look to expand your blossoming museum even further.</p>
<p>Details are rather scarce at the moment, so we don't have a firm release date for the expansion just yet, but it's nice to know that it's coming, at least.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this wild new DLC, a brand new museum location dedicated entirely to the wonders of wildlife will open its doors. Wildlife Experts will be called upon to rescue, heal, raise, and re-wild an incredible variety of creatures, while expanding your museum in exciting and unexpected ways."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our recent review for Two Point Museum, we said that it's probably the best entry in the series yet, but lamented the lack of mouse controls and some apparent performance issues on the Switch 2. Be sure to read our full verdict if you're currently on the fence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Anchor is a new underwater survival game from developer Fearem, which essentially mashes the kind of harsher survival crafting that players love in Rust with the underwater setting of Subnautica to create a new experience.</p>



<p>Set in a dystopian world where a nuclear apocalypse has sent humanity into the ocean to try and find a new way to survive, you'll be able to join up with other players in the 150-player servers or lone shark your underwater journey as you try to survive on your own.</p>



<p>It'll also feature PvE modes for those who don't want to deal with the threat of other players on top of all the other dangers that come with living underwater, which include, but are not limited to, always needing to keep yourself breathing, keeping your shelter intact, and ensuring you don't become shark food.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/subnautica-abyss-gazes-back/">Subnautica</a> offered players something entirely new with its alien aquatic setting, Anchor keeps its setting grounded (and wet) with its own version of Earth's oceans. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of marine life, beyond predators like sharks, play a role in Anchor when it does arrive at some point in the future.</p>



<p>For now, the game is set to arrive on PC, with no word of a potential console release in the future. Though that can always change. Hopefully, we'll hear more about when Anchor is due to arrive soon, or at least get a chance to play it at an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest</a> event or something similar.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-unleashed-dev-boss-fight-shut-down-by-netflix.1336069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has closed down&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>developer Boss Fight Entertainment, just three years or so after acquiring the developer.</p>

<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-shutters-squid-game-unleashed-developer-boss-fight-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, as well as Boss Fight CEO David Rippy, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-rippy-1b16871_hi-everyone-well-word-has-gotten-around-activity-7387225251513827328-E979/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the studio's closure via his LinkedIn account over the weekend, describing news of the developer's shutdown as "rough".</p>

<p>Netflix's decision to shut down Boss Fight might seem a little strange given that it's only been three years <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-acquires-boss-fight-entertainment" rel="nofollow">since the studio was acquired</a>. Not only that, but, as Rippy says in his post, the studio had a bona fide hit on its hands with&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, which "hit #1 in 26 countries".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment.jpg?itok=M-oDFlDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment.jpg?itok=DtZJaOmR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>developer Boss Fight Entertainment has been shut down.</figcaption></figure><p>Neither Netflix nor Boss Fight gave an official reason for the studio's closure, but Game Developer "understands" that it's all down to new Netflix games president Alain Tascan, who took over from Mike Verdu <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">back in November last year</a>.</p>

<p>Per Game Developer, Tascan's goal with Netflix's gaming division is to focus things more on "party games, children's titles, and narrative experiences" (that's Game Developer's wording, not Tascan's), and Boss Fight's shutdown is a direct result of that paradigm shift.</p>

<p>Despite Boss Fight's shutdown,&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>will apparently still receive support from Netflix, so if you're a fan of the game, you don't need to worry about it going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is the second studio Netlfix has (apparently) closed down in the last twelve months or so; last October, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">was reported</a> that the streaming giant had shuttered its all-star Team Blue development outfit, which counted&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>alumni among its number.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rippy and his fellow Boss Fight alumni do after the shutdown of the studio, but we may not hear from them for a while, if Rippy's words are to be believed; he says he and his co-executives will "take a little breather" before moving on.</p>
