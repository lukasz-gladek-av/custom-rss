Hanging out near a green ocean. Fighting green skeletons. Most curiously, it features an armoured knight convulsing on a bed as if being shocked, from the inside, by some sort of magical electricity disease. Did this knight eat an entire pack of bad batteries? Do batteries even exist in this world, described as "a realm in ruins…beneath a twilight sky". It's a damn hell ass bum mystery, and mystery is exactly what I want from a game that lists both Morrowind and King's Field as influences.</p>

<p>"As a spellsword gunslinger," - truly, the millionaire astronaut cowboy DJ of RPG classes  - "you'll explore ethereal landscapes shrouded in twilight, battle fearsome creatures, and uncover ancient secrets. Explore the dying Kingdom of Mortis and its different realms in first person action combat, in a world mixed with retro and vaporwave aesthetics".</p>
<p>Despite the FromSoft influence, Dreamspring is aiming to be "a less punishing type of Souls/Scrolls-like game," which I reckon is something that gets more important the bigger your world is. Otherwise, it looks to have most of the stuff you'd expect - branching dialogue, branching storyline, branching trees with branches branching toward an uncaring skyline, all the classics. It's in early access at the moment, with the "core loop" apparently done, and the main quest and world still being worked on.</p>
<p>There's no demo, although developer Billyfighter's previous game Necroslayer is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2563960/Necroslayer">roughly the price of Greggs' bake at the moment</a>. Will you feel good after playing it? I can't say. But you will likely feel better than after eating a Greggs' bake.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment.1195950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Embracer Group announced a rebranding to Fellowship Entertainment.&nbsp;<span>This is a clear nod to The Lord of the Rings IP, whose rights Embracer&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rights-embracer-low-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchased</a> around two years ago&nbsp;</span>for a relatively low sum ($395 million). Following the acquisition, COO Matthew Karch <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-needs-to-be-turned-into-one-of-gamings-biggest-franchises-says-embracer-coo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that the group's priority should be turning The Lord of the Rings into one of gaming's biggest franchises. Karch is no longer with Embracer (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split with Saber Interactive a while ago</a>), but the sentiment appears to have remained the same, given the brand name's choice.</p>
<p>Of course, Tolkien's beloved fantasy universe is just one of many big franchises owned by Fellowship Entertainment, such as Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Killing Floor, Darksiders, Remnant, and Tomb Raider. The new company will house over 6K employees spread across 50 companies or so.</p>
<p>The other big news announced today is that Coffee Stain Group (Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Deep Rock Galactic) is being spun off into a separately listed company. Lars Wingefors, co-founder and Group CEO of Embracer, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Coffee Stain Group has incredible talent, IPs and communities. To date, it has been a true recipe for success. I am confident in Anton's strategy and leadership and see a clear long-term opportunity in attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents.</em></p>
<p>Anton Westbergh, co-founder and Group CEO of Coffee Stain, added:</p>
<p><em>We’re really proud of everything we’ve built as part of Embracer, and grateful for the support and trust we’ve received over the years. Now, as we take the step to become a separately listed company, it feels both exciting and, honestly, a little bit scary—but in a good way.</em></p>
<p><em>The games industry is more competitive than ever, but also more rewarding if you do things right, and we believe this move gives us the clarity and control to navigate the landscape better on our own terms. We can now focus even more on what we do best—supporting our developers, staying close to our communities, and building an even brighter future for Coffee Stain.</em></p>
<p>The Embracer name will live on, albeit stained after countless <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-interactive-suffers-embracers-restructuring-codemasters-also-hit-by-layoffs-at-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closures</a>, only as the privately held holding company of Fellowship Entertainment, Coffee Stain Group, and Asmodee Group (which had been spun off earlier this year). Lars Wingefors, as the main shareholder, will remain in control.</p>
<p>The company also provided an overview of its announced release schedule. In fiscal year 2025/2026, the following titles will be launched:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Eden</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gothic 1 Remake</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REANIMAL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fellowship</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wreckreation</a></li>
<li>The next SpongeBob SquarePants game</li>
<li>NORSE: Oath of Blood</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core-is-a-roguelite-spin-off-of-the-popular-co-op-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killing Floor 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-and-skydance-games-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Embracer said a triple-A game previously scheduled for 2025/2026 is likely to be moved to 2026/2027. The company expects <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar sales to Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> for this title. They may be referring to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-metro-game-will-be-much-darker-due-to-the-war-says-4a-games-will-be-ready-when-its-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next Metro game</a>, though there's no way to know for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/blades-of-fire-5-things-to-know-to-enjoy-the-game-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although Blades of Fire is not that different from other action-adventure games like the modern God of War games and challenging action role-playing games in the vein of FromSoftware's Souls series, playing the game developed by MercurySteam the same way as these games will result in a frustrating experience. As such, learning some of the gameplay systems' intricacies will go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>As you are starting out your quest to kill the Queen, however, you won't get many opportunities to delve deeper into some of the game's unique mechanics. Still, there are a few things to know right at the start of the adventure that can make Blades of Fire way more enjoyable.</p>
<h2>Manage your Weapons wisely</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.54.15.59-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the game, your weapon selection will be limited, and you may end up relying on a single weapon that seems to be doing well. What you should be doing, however, is start getting used to the game's weapon mechanics, as you will soon encounter an enemy that your favorite weapon may not be able to damage. As such, you should have on hand multiple weapons that allow you to deal blunt, slashing, and piercing damage. While penetration values may not be too important at the start, you should always make sure they are as high as possible, so bringing multiple weapons that deal the same type of damage may be beneficial in the end, as it will make sure the penetration value of any specific weapon doesn't get too low to the point that you will need to sharpen your weapon, reducing durability.</p>
<h2>Make Use of Your Broken Weapons</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.55.19.67-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter how good you are at weapon management in Blades of Fire, there will come a time when a weapon breaks and cannot be repaired. In the first few hours of the game, your only option will be to recycle the weapon to get back some of the materials you used to forge it, but as soon as you meet Glinda, you will have another option to use your broken weapons to get items. After meeting the character, you will unlock the Reputation system, which makes weapons become more valuable the more enemies they kill. Weapons with high enough reputation can be offered to Glinda to obtain a lot of units of any material at once, which is a big help later in the game when the rarest Steel requires a lot of materials. As such, if you need a lot of a specific material, the better option is to offer a broken weapon to Glinda. Otherwise, recycling could be the way to go if you need multiple materials.</p>
<h2>Always finish your enemies with Heavy Attacks</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.45.56.14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides unleashing light attacks, Aran can perform powerful heavier attacks by holding down any of the four attack buttons. While these attacks are slower than the regular light attacks, they are considerably more powerful and can dismember enemies if they deplete their HP bar. This is extremely important to keep in mind against bosses with multiple health bars, as it is possible to temporarily disable some of their abilities by using heavy attacks when they are stunned, but it's something to keep in mind for regular enemies as well. Finishing enemies with a heavy attack makes the weapon earn increased Reputation, which is something you should always do to obtain large quantities of materials as outlined above. Durability heavily decreases with these attacks, however, so you should always strive to hit a balance to avoid finding yourself without any usable weapon at hand.</p>
<h2>Learn the Forging Mechanics</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.52.31.28-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The weapon forging mechanics in Blades of Fire are extremely important, and fully understanding them can really make a difference, no matter where you are in the game. While picking the right Steel or Wood is a straightforward process, as the game highlights how much the weapon changes depending on your selection, the actual forging of the weapons is not as simple. As a general rule, you want to be able to repair your weapons as much as possible, so you should be striving for the highest possible quality at all times. Resources are limited, and can take a while to farm, so you want a weapon forged with the best possible Steel to last you as long as possible.</p>
<h2>Don't be Afraid to Lower the Difficulty</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.55.34.80-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As I highlighted in my review, Blades of Fire's level design gets complex very easily, and with so many multiple paths and shortcuts, it is very easy to get lost. There's a way, however, to highlight where to go for the next story objective in the main options menu, but only if you are playing the game at the Iron or Bronze difficulties. Still, you can use this waypoint system even in Steel difficulty by lowering the difficulty, selecting the Show Objective option, and increasing it again. You will not earn a specific achievement by doing this, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff for a first playthrough, in my opinion, as exploration can really get frustrating without proper guidance, especially at the start of the adventure.</p>

Fight your way through the masses of demons!</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>It is the year 20XX. A giant rift appears in the border that separates the “mortal world” (Utsushi-yo) from the “everlasting world” (Toko-yo).</p><p>As the balance between the two worlds crumble, the inhabitants of Toko-yo overflow into the Utsushi-yo, our mortal world. Ghosts, spirits, demons, even incarnations of gods and Buddha enter the Utsushi-yo, causing chaos.</p><p>With intention of suppressing the situation, the government attempts to fight these malignant spirits using military force, but their efforts are in vain; normal methods of warfare are not effective against the entities of Toko-yo, known as “Bakara,” who exist under different set of logic altogether.</p><p>Setsuna, a swordsman who wields the “demon slayer sword” which has been passed down for generations, may be mankind’s last hope to save the world. He makes his way to the rift, now named the “Oomikado”…</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_966318"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Battle With Baccarat!</strong> – The battle system is based on the casino game Baccarat. If you have the better hand, you get to attack! If your hand is weaker, the enemy gets to attack. But even if your cards don’t look good, don’t give up! Make use of your skills and items to reinvent your hand and strengthen your attack and defense stats!</li><li><strong>Deckbuilding</strong> – Find Talismans (Skill cards) on your journey to strengthen your deck! Discover combinations you can use to pave your way to victory!</li><li><strong>Items to Collect!</strong> – There are Amulets (Relics) that can give you passive skills and Scrolls (Potions) that can fortify you temporarily. Use these items in tandem with your Talismans for powerful effects!</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Roguelike [329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">Roguelike</a></strong> – Every time you start a game, the map changes. You’ll never travel the same map twice. (Although, it is possible to recreate the map through SEED value.) Apart from fighting enemies in the map, you’ll bump into events that require you to make decisions, and you may also find a merchant that will sell you items. Prepare yourself for what’s to come!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Yet as you're about to see, with the 2025 show now up and running, many of them are so good that you will <em>want </em>them to exist.</p><p>The exhibition, called Famicase, has been running for <em>ages</em>; <a href="https://aftermath.site/famicase-meteor-art-famicom-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the 19th successive year I've covered it</a>, and it never fails to disappoint. Some of the games look neat, others look terrifying, others still (often my faves) are simply shining examples of video game typography.</p><p>There are actual cartridges hanging on Meteor's walls if you're lucky enough to be able to visit in person, but since most of us can't, the best we can do is<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://famicase.com/25/index.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;admire them from afar courtesy of Meteor's online showcase.

What has happened? Once radiant, the glow has now dimmed. Once mighty, but now diminished. Will you awaken from this slumber of the soul? You are needed. You are missed. Please return to us, Special Spirit."</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>By Jeff Wiggins | RE-FORM: "Forma Series 03 ̶ RE-FORM.

Following last week's PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for May, Sony has announced its next batch of departures, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> and more all leaving the service in June.
</p>
<p>
In total, PlayStation Plus' newly updated Last Chance to Play section confirms six titles are currently scheduled to be removed from the service next month, meaning the clock is ticking if you were hoping to see any of the following games' credits roll:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Monster Hunter Rise</li>
<li>Rogue Legacy 2</li>
<li>Inscryption</li>
<li>After Us</li>
<li>Kayak VR: Mirage</li>
<li>Avicii Invector</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Rogue Legacy 2 v1.0 Launch Trailer" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VFRTUxPIwA?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
The good news is it's a considerably smaller list compared to last month, when Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-20-games-leaving-ps-plus-extra-premium-next-month">jettisoned over 22 titles</a> - including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>, and Journey to the Savage Planet. But that's not to say none of June's removals will be missed; Monster Hunter Rise is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-rise-review-the-switchs-best-game-since-breath-of-the-wild">stellar entry in Capcom's long-running series</a>, while Rogue Legacy 2 - with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rogue-legacy-2-review-more-of-the-brilliant-same-in-this-impressive-sequel">jauntily compelling</a> permadeath platform exploration - and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inscryption-review-a-wonderful-nightmare-and-a-vividly-memorable-game-of-cards">wonderfully sinister Inscryption</a> both come highly recommended.
</p>
<p>
And if you've managed to miss the news of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-ps-plus-catalogue-additions-for-may">PlayStation Plus' latest additions</a> so far this month, these include Battlefield 5, Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy, Humankind, and Sandland for Premium and Extra subscribers. Ark: Survival Ascended, Balatro, and Warhammer 40K: Boltgun, meanwhile, can be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-may">picked up across all three membership tiers</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/fortnite-is-back-on-the-ios-app-store-in-the-us-and-it-seems-quite-popular/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After almost half a decade of legal wrangling, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is back on iPhone and iPad via the iOS App Store in the US, and has also been restored to the Epic Games Store and AltStore in Europe. Not only that, but it’s now right at the top of the App Store’s Free Games category as gamers rush to download it to their phones.</p>
<p>It’s been a dramatic couple of weeks in the land of Apple, as Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers found that the company was not abiding by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/10/epic-vs-apple-ruling-app-store-anti-steering-rules-must-change-but-dont-expect-fortnite-back-on-iphone/">her 2021 ruling on anti-steering restrictions</a> in the App Store – these prevent developers from linking out to websites and third party payment systems, which Apple was technically allowing, but with prohibitive fees still associated, and with Apple enforcing scare sheets on outward links. In breach of this court ruling, Judge Gonzalez-Rogers determined that Apple now cannot put any fees in place for external payments, which immediately saw the likes of Amazon Kindle and Spotify add links out to their websites.</p>


<p>Fortnite was a different matter, though. Apple dragged their feet, saying that they are appealing this latest ruling and didn’t want to let Fortnite on the App Store in the meantime. Epic, meanwhile, submitted the app through their Swedish developer account and when this, as a single global app package, was rejected, complained to the judge. Judge Gonzalez-Rogers laid down an ultimatum and Apple has now relented.</p>
<p>Fortnite is back on iPhone and iPad, but only in the US App Store where this ruling applies, and through the third party Epic Games Store and AltStore app stores which are available in Europe thanks to the Digital Markets App.</p>
<p>In the US App Store, Fortnite now has purchase options both through Epic, where they entice players to use their purchase system by offering 20% bonus rewards, and with Apple’s standard in-app purchase system.</p>

<p>This all started when Epic sneakily added third party payments to Fortnite in the App Store, breaching the terms of service and getting kicked out because of this, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/25/fortnite-app-store-ruling-apple-unreal-engine-injunction/">giving them an excuse to sue</a>. For a long time, it looked like this had completely backfired, the company losing almost all counts that they were suing on. However, Apple overplayed their hand on the one count that they lost on, demanding a 27% fee from any linked-to payments, when compared to the 30% standard cut they take on the App Store. Epic called them out on this to the courts, and after some stark revelations from discovery about internal meetings and decision making, Epic got their biggest win yet, potentially releasing Apple’s stranglehold on their platform.</p>
<p>But it’s not quite over yet. Apple is appealing the ruling every which way that they can, and has asked for a stay that would let them revert to blocking external payments while the appeal plays out. In either situation, if Apple gets their way, then external payments will likely change or go away very quickly, and Epic will have to make a choice over if they would comply.</p>

And while it might not be a new phenomenon, it’s still enjoyable to watch these fan creations as they show us just how far Rockstar’s tech has come over the decades. So I knew that after Rockstar published <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329"><em>GTA 6</em>'s second trailer earlier this month</a></span>, following the news that the open-world sequel was being delayed until May 2026, someone would set out to recreate the new video in a previous<em> GTA </em>game. And here we are. <br></p><p>Foosmoke made the video using mostly&nbsp;<em>GTA San Andreas</em> to recreate nearly every moment from the new <em>GTA 6</em> trailer. Sometimes the creator adds extra details using video editing tricks or bits from <em>Vice City,</em> but this is still more or less the <em>GTA 6</em> trailer recreated in <em>San Andreas</em>, and it’s a blast to watch. </p><p>Previously, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/_V1HzqpoAgU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/_V1HzqpoAgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foosmoke recreated the first <em>GTA 6</em> trailer</a></span> as if it were a PS2-era game. That video is also great. Of course, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-remakes-remix-lego-vice-city-san-andreas-1851157083&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-remakes-remix-lego-vice-city-san-andreas-1851157083">Foosmoke wasn’t alone in recreating that first trailer</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last week, the Esports World Cup – <a href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-saudi-money-overwatch-soft-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a known vehicle for Saudi government sportswashing</a> – announced that popular location guessing game <em>GeoGuessr </em>will be <a href="https://esportsworldcup.com/en/news/geoguessr-joins-the-esports-wold-cup-festival-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">participating</a> in its upcoming Esports World Cup Festival tournament program, putting the game’s community in an uncomfortable position not unlike the pretzel fighting game players found themselves contorted into <a href="https://aftermath.site/saudi-arabia-scopely-pokemon-go-street-fighter-esports-human-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a couple months ago</a>. Difference is, <em>GeoGuessr </em>might constitute one of the most geopolitically aware gaming communities on the planet as a result of what it’s, you know, about. Outcry was immediate, and now <em>GeoGuessr </em>map makers have taken their protest to the next level.</p><p>Today a conglomerate of map makers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geoguessr/comments/1ks0f6e/geoguessr_map_blackout_statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a statement</a> on the game’s official subreddit announcing a full-on blackout of many popular maps.</p><p>"We, the creators of a considerable share of <em>GeoGuessr</em>’s most popular maps, have decided to make our maps unplayable in protest of<em> </em>GeoGuessr AB’s decision to host a World Championship wildcard tourney at the Esports World Cup (EWC) in Riyadh,” reads the note, attributed to the <em>GeoGuessr </em>mapping community. “The <em>GeoGuessr </em>community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia. In solidarity with those currently residing in Saudi Arabia while being subject to oppression, as well as members of the community who would feel and be unsafe attending the tournament in Riyadh, we have decided to black out our maps by replacing all their previous locations with random garbage locations, rendering them unplayable.”&nbsp;</p><p>The map makers went on to say that the blackout will continue until <em>GeoGuessr</em>’s developers take action: “Specifically, we demand that <em>GeoGuessr </em>cancels its wildcard event in Saudi Arabia and commits to not hosting any events there as long as it continues its oppressive regime.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I'm both a woman and queer, so I asked myself: If I was a competitor, would I feel comfortable going? And even if I was, would I feel alright knowing that I would be facing much less strict rules than locals?</p></blockquote></figure><p><em>GeoGuessr </em>relies on Google Maps for data, but community members build custom tools and organize locations into “maps” so you’re not just staring at random, indecipherable stretches of land all day long. Official game features, like its competitive duels mode, rely on community maps – or they did until today. As of this publishing, duels mode maps had been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tendog.bsky.social/post/3lpozr5ikbc2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced</a> by generic “world” maps to account for the blackout.</p><p>Zemmip, the <em>GeoGuessr </em>map maker who posted the blackout notice to Reddit, told Aftermath that “basically all the big community maps got taken down.” These maps, they said, have been played over 25 million times in total.&nbsp;</p><p>Emilyapocalypse, a map maker who helped create tools for <em>GeoGuessr</em>'s largest community mapping project, "A Community World," told Aftermath that joining the blackout was a no-brainer.</p><p>"I'm both a woman and queer, so I asked myself: If I was a competitor, would I feel comfortable going?" she said. "And even if I was, would I feel alright knowing that I would be facing much less strict rules than locals? Would I be comfortable with my other queer friends going? The answer to these question is generally a 'no.' Besides that, I am also unhappy with Saudi Arabia's treatment of their migrant workers, and their actions in Yemen. The biggest kicker, however, is that the EWC is directly organized by the government that is responsible for all of this – it's not just an unfortunate tournament location; it's the government's own sportswashing attempt."</p><p>She also explained that <em>GeoGuessr</em>'s community is unique in the sheer amount of sway it holds over the game, and with great power comes great responsibility.</p><p>"What makes protesting especially crucial," she said, "is the special position that the community is in: Since the game is so reliant on the community's map makers and developers, we hold quite a bit more power than other games' communities, and there are also much fewer – if any – contractual obligations to not speak out."</p><p>Other games' communities have gone gentler into that good night where the Esports World Cup is concerned, but Emilyapocalypse views this as an instance where, again, those players don't necessarily have the power to slam the emergency brake.</p><p>"It's clear that there are many people involved in other esports who are also not happy with the EWC," she said. "For instance, even though I'm only a very casual <em>Valorant </em>viewer, I've still seen casters like Sideshow openly speaking up against the event, and ex-pros like Tarik and Tenz both openly stating that they rejected large sums of money to be involved in the EWC. That said, the <em>GeoGuessr </em>community's response still absolutely exceeded my expectations, and I am extremely thankful for this. I do, however, also understand that we are in a unique spot." </p><figure><blockquote><p>Since the game is so reliant on the community's map makers and developers, we hold quite a bit more power than other games' communities, and there are also much fewer – if any – contractual obligations to not speak out.</p></blockquote></figure><p>ReAnna, a <em>GeoGuessr </em>player who's competed at the pro level, echoed other community members' sentiment.</p><p>"I object in particular to showing up at an event that is hosted by a government that is directly responsible for the oppression that my queer siblings face in Saudi Arabia," she told Aftermath. "There is no separation between the people organizing this event and the people jailing activists. Fans that object to boycotting this event ask where the line is, because many other governments – such as the USA – also commit human rights abuses. I'm not sure where I draw the line, but I know that a government-funded event in one of the world's infamous dictatorships is well past it."</p><p>Tensions have been rising between <em>GeoGuessr</em>’s developers and community ever since the Esports World Cup announcement, which was met with a torrent of skull, vomit, and thumbs-down emojis in the game’s Discord. A couple days later, the developers posted a response to the blowback, which Zemmip called “AI generated.”</p><p>“We always review each event opportunity to ensure that it's open to players of all backgrounds, genders and views,” read <em>GeoGuessr</em>’s Discord statement. “We have been assured by the Esports World Cup that all players are welcome and would not attend the event if this was not the case.”</p><p>The developers went on to clarify their financial stake in the event: “We are not receiving funding from the local government or affiliated organizations. The Esports World Cup is organizing and covering the event logistics, while we are funding the entire prize pool ourselves. There is no financial upside for us in attending this event and our motivation for attendance is to bring our message of exploration and understanding to our <em>GeoGuessr </em>community in the Middle East.”</p><p>This statement, too, was met with widespread derision. Today, the Discord is full of messages in support of the blackout, with some posting pictures of themselves canceling their subscriptions to the game. As of this publishing, it appears that moderators have disabled new sign ups.</p><p>You don’t have to be making money hand over fist to advance a government’s sportswashing agenda. These events trade in credibility, and <em>GeoGuessr </em>is an otherwise squeaky clean brand with global appeal, one that laypeople know due to its association with widely admired influencers like Trevor “Rainbolt” Rainbolt. In other words, it’s the exact kind of property a government with <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a history</a> of hostility against women and LGBTQIA+ people – as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">war crimes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Jamal_Khashoggi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journalist assassinations</a>, and death sentences “<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following grossly unfair trials</a>” – would want to be associated with. It screams “Don’t worry, we’re chill now.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I fear that&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>sees it as a step towards 'legitimacy' as an esport. I don't think that going to an event that is largely astroturfed is a good way to obtain legitimacy.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Aftermath reached out to <em>GeoGuessr</em>’s developers for a response to the blackout, but as of this publishing, they did not reply.&nbsp;</p><p>ReAnna described <em>GeoGuessr</em>'s pro scene as "on the edge" in that it's theoretically possible to earn decent money if you win every major event, but added that most who make a living off the game are "content creators with large YouTube or TikTok followings." That in mind, she's concerned that <em>GeoGuessr </em>climbed into bed with the Esports World Cup not for money, but to boost its competitive scene's profile.</p><p>"I'm honestly more concerned about what <em>GeoGuessr </em>sees in the EWC," she said. "It's not an event that attracts high viewership compared to other much cheaper events, and it would be surprising if new players discover <em>GeoGuessr </em>through its participation in the EWC. I fear that <em>GeoGuessr </em>sees it as a step towards 'legitimacy' as an esport.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/sony-is-shutting-down-its-playstation-stars-loyalty-program/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that the PlayStation Stars reward program is coming to an end, shutting off access to new users today, and with a rolling shutdown that will see it fully closed by November 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/14/sony-announced-playstation-stars-loyalty-scheme-with-digital-rewards-not-nft/">Launched in 2022</a>, the two main hooks for PlayStation Stars were the ability to earn digital collectables themed around popular PlayStation properties and franchises, as well as the typical loyalty scheme fare of PlayStation store top ups and vouchers.</p>


<p>It seems that this really didn’t strike a cord with enough people, as the company is now shutting the program down. Personally, I never really “got” what PlayStation Stars was meant to be about. The push for digital collectibles doesn’t speak to me, and the main allure of loyalty programmes like this and Microsoft Rewards is more to do with getting shop vouchers… but that felt like a secondary</p>
<p>“Since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to,” wrote Grace Chen, &nbsp;as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this program, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings.”</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for PlayStation Stars users? Well, the program will still continue to work for the time being, but new members cannot sign up for it. Sony is also no longer going to produce new rewards for it, and everything will kind of be in stasis after July. The program will fully end in November 2026, but PlayStation Stars members can still access their Digital Collectibles after this point… somehow.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting today, PlayStation Stars will no longer accept new members for this version of the program.</li>
<li>If members choose to cancel their PlayStation Stars membership starting today, it will not be possible to rejoin this version of the program, and members will lose all earned Points.</li>
<li>Current PlayStation Stars members can still earn Digital Collectibles, Points and level up their status until July 23, 2025 at 7:59AM PDT | 3:59PM BST | 11:59PM JST. After this date, there will be no new PlayStation Stars Campaigns available, or any additional rewards or status benefits to earn.</li>
<li>This version of the PlayStation Stars program will fully end on November 2, 2026 and current PlayStation Stars members can continue to redeem Points as long as their Points don’t expire before then.</li>
<li>PlayStation Stars members can still access their Digital Collectibles, even after these changes take place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully the next attempt goes better and is more actively rewarding.</p>

			<p>Former Bungie developers are speaking out about the problems Bungie is facing internally, and all signs point to leadership and structural issues following Sony's acquisition of Bungie, and a human resources department, or at least, a single member of that department, covering up internal issues of harassment for personal gain on their exit from the studio.</p>
<p>Internal issues at Bungie, unfortunately, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/">aren't anything new</a>, but this latest slew of details comes from Destin Legarie, who published a video on his YouTube channel after speaking to former Bungie developers. Many of the comments are quite damning, and paint the picture of a Bungie that is not the same studio it once was when every first-person shooter fan on the planet couldn't wait to see what they would do next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Inside Bungie’s Decline: Former Devs Speak Out" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No direct names were mentioned in the video as to who the former Bungie employees were calling out, everything was kept in more general terms with just the word 'leadership' being used to represent Bungie's top brass.</p>
<p>All of this came about after Bungie was caught using artwork and/or art assets from another artist without their permission or crediting them for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">the fourth time in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed</em>," a former Bungie developer told Legarie. Another quote went further, saying "<em>Bungie's problem stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture.</em>"</p>
<p>Another quote reads "<em>Internal language shifted from 'studio,' 'games,' and 'players,' to 'company,' 'product,' and 'customers,' during the Sony acquisition,</em>" highlighting how the studio has seemingly shifted its viewpoint that making good games for players to enjoy is no longer the ultimate goal, and is instead making games that make <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/21/more-bungie-reveals-from-destiny-2-subscriptions-to-eververse-demands/">as much money as possible</a>.</p>
<p>There have been negative stories about internal problems at the Destiny 2 developer for the past couple of years, and morale certainly can't be helped by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">layoffs the studio has suffered</a>. All of leadership might be part of the problem, which is what seems to be the speculation in this video, but as Legarie points out, the buck has to stop somewhere, and in the case of Bungie, that's with chief executive officer Pete Parsons.</p>
<p>It's extremely unfortunate that the studio behind Halo and Destiny, two of the biggest shooter franchises in video game history, is facing all of this, and could see its end due to its allegedly greedy and inconsiderate leaders who have lost the plot, and the fact that if not for the studio making games that people wanted to play in the first place, none of them would be where they are.</p>

Reminiscent of the Nintendo Switch Online classic games library, the collection includes <em>Pitfall</em>, <em>Grand Prix</em>, and more than 50 other Activision titles from the 1980s and 1990s. It’s not as many titles as the 1,300 retro games that Antstream, Microsoft’s partner in the offering, has available on its streaming service, but it won’t cost Game Pass subscribers any extra.</p><p>Retro Classics, which Microsoft writes is part of its “commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility,” is available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via Xbox cloud gaming on compatible devices like some LG and Samsung smart TVs and the Meta Quest headset. Other games included in the collection include <em>Cosmic Ark</em>, <em>MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat</em>, and <em>Atlantis.</em></p><p>Based on screenshots, it looks like the collection will include titles from the original PlayStation, the SNES, MS-DOS, and more. Players will be able to collect achievements and participate in events like tournaments and community challenges as well.</p><p>Microsoft says this is only the start; the collection will expand to include more than 100 games from Activision and Blizzard eventually. Like Nintendo’s retro collection, you’re out of luck if you don’t have Microsoft’s gaming subscription, as the titles in the collection aren’t available for sale separately.</p><p>Antstream Arcade <a href="https://www.antstream.com/post/xbox-launches-retro-classics-for-game-pass-powered-by-antstream">separately announced</a> a temporary deal for Game Pass subscribers.

Once you learn that gimmick, and get into some of the deep skills in his tree, though, Verso can become the linchpin of your team. We’ll show you how. </p><h2 id="h2550771"><a id="1"></a>Basic kit</h2><figure id="" data-id="80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-recommend-id="image://80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-recommend-id="image://80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, one of the things right upfront that eases the Gustave-to-Verso transition is the fact that <strong>he immediately inherits all of the weapons you collected as Gustave</strong>. Remember back in the day when a party member left, and they’d take all the good armor and weapons with them? God, we lived as savages in the 90s. </p><p>Anyway, that means you’ve got a nice deep armory of sword options to start with. That said, sticking with Verso’s basic loadout for a bit is the best way to go, given that <strong>he’s the only character who can wield Light magic right out of the gate</strong> without having to prime the skill (i.e. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">Lune’s Mayhem</a></span>). </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>This is handy as all the enemies in the first major area you get to after Verso joins up are weak to Light. You’ll get plenty of practice if you just stay the course of the main story. In addition, it’s not quite his default loadout per se, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dualliste-phase-2-verso-1851781495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dualliste-phase-2-verso-1851781495">the Dualliste boss</a></span> at the end of that area drops the Dualliso sword. This allows Verso a second turn after a basic attack To get such a weapon so early after obtaining him makes it worth mentioning as a crucial part of his kit, especially because of his... </p><h2 id="h2550772"><a id="2"></a>Special mechanic: Perfection</h2><figure id="" data-id="4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-recommend-id="image://4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-recommend-id="image://4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Devil May Cry</em> fans will be right at home with this mechanic. Verso basically just has that game’s ranking system as a gimmick. Very simply, you start at grade D, and landing attacks, dodging, and parrying all add a certain amount of Perfection Points that raise the grade from D, C, B, A, all the way up to S, with points taken away if you take a hit.</p><p>The twist, however, is that while all of Verso’s skills get a damage boost depending on his rank, many of them also have a specific rank where they are enhanced even further. Using an ability tied to a specific letter rank that Verso has achieved enables a secondary effect. This can be anything from earning more Perfection if the attack hits, to dealing more damage, or it can even make expensive skills cheaper. </p><p>An excellent example here is Verso’s Perfect Break Skill. By itself, it’s a pretty powerful Light attack. However, if you hit it while you’re exactly at Rank B, it only costs five AP to cast (down from seven). So, while getting to rank S does have its benefits, building your offense around specific ranks—especially in the early goings of Act II—is where the real fun lies. It’s not always about racing to get an S lined up for him.</p><h2 id="h2550773"><a id="3"></a>Recommended builds and synergies</h2><figure id="" data-id="4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-recommend-id="image://4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-recommend-id="image://4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s another running aspect of Verso’s skill tree that, while not necessarily a core gimmick, does deserve shouting out. That’s the fact that there are quite a few skills predicated on sacrificing either health, status, or rank to either benefit the party, or dealing absurd amounts of damage. That’s actually a really well-implemented way to tie combat in with his place in the narrative, but it also means that on top of being able to build a character based around skills hovering around a certain rank, <strong>if you’re willing to take a risk, you can build Verso into a devastating glass cannon.</strong></p><p>Even if you don’t go fully down that road,<strong> Berserk Slash should be a permanent skill for any Verso player.</strong> It allows him to deal more damage the less health he has left. If you feel like getting extra nuts, pair that up with Overload (gives nine AP, immediately jumps Verso to Rank S, but drops his health to one point), and watch Berserk Slash send your enemies screaming into the goddamn Shadow Realm. </p><p>This is a safer strategy once you get ahold of the Cheater Picto from beating Sprong (the massive Nevron hanging out in the ocean)—and it’s one of those combos that can utterly break the game once you get the Painted Power Picto that removes the 9,999 damage cap. There’s glory waiting for those who can walk the edge of life and death with Verso. </p><p>But hey, if you’d like to keep your boy safe and still do a number on enemies, there’s plenty of options for that too. As mentioned, the Dualliso blade you get from the Dualliste grants a second turn after a basic attack, Pair that up with Energizing Shots (20-percent of Free Aim shots go back to you in AP) and Blitz (grants another turn), and you can absolutely monopolize an enemy if you get lucky enough. Pair Strike Storm up with any Pictos that enhance critical hits, and you’re almost always guaranteed to hit Rank S in no time. Once you get into the latter portions of Act II, you can basically just spam that and Perfect Stars—his most powerful Light attack—and you’ll put a whole lotta Nevros in the dirt. </p><p>In the early going, though, your options will be a bit more limited. Depending how not-adept you are at dodges and parries, it’s perfectly viable to build Verso’s whole loadout around staying at C rank. Berserk Slash and Strike Storm both benefit at that rank, which helps the case, but you can also build Verso as a support character using Leadership and Paradigm Shift (both granting AP to the rest of the team). In which case, you’ll want to pick up the Lanceram sword at some point in your journey, since it guarantees you’ll never drop lower than C. </p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ara: History Untold's upcoming DLC, Untold Scenarios, will arrive on PC this coming June 18, 2025, developer Oxide Games has announced.</p>
<p>The expansion will be available for $9.99 USD, and will include several scenarios that blend historical events with alternative history to create 'what-if' scenarios for "<em>more event-driven strategic challenges</em>," according to a press release for the upcoming expansion.</p>
<p>While Ara: History Untold is playable through Xbox Game Pass PC, that's only for the base game. If you want to play any of these new scenarios, you'll need to grab the DLC on its own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ara: History Untold | Dev Q&amp;A | Ep. 9" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCsXUG3ZsyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ara: History Untold arrived on PC and through Game Pass PC last September, and overall arrived as "<em>a mixed bag,"&nbsp;</em>according to our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/">reviewer, Chris Wray</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Ara: History Untold is the perfect example of a mixed bag. Some genuinely great ideas, but some negatives are trying to counterbalance them. Focusing on supply chains and adding real to is an excellent idea, but the implementation has left the game with significant micromanagement, which could put people off. The region and city development systems are on a whole new level and could be how 4X games go in the future, but the AI manages to mess it</em> up," he wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Ara: History Untold is a highly ambitious 4X game that looks to branch out and add even more depth to an already detailed genre. In many ways, it succeeds, bringing in a map and city-building system that far surpasses others in the genre and successfully interlinking practically every area. However, with some successes come issues, with the added depth in the supply chain making it a bit of a micromanagement nightmare; it tries to alleviate some of these issues with a user-friendly UI, but it could be a sticking point for some.</em>"</p>

The debut releases are interactive film puzzler <em>Immortality</em>, the folk horror point-and-click adventure <em>The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow</em>, and the absurdist comedy <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here! </em>though in addition to these, <em>Lost In Cult </em>promises it already has lots of games in the pipeline, with new collections to be announced on an almost monthly basis. </p><p>“People might think that we’ve selected our best games to start with,” marketing director Ryan Brown told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We actually haven’t. We’ve pretty much just released them in the order that we’ve signed them, because one thing we wanted to do right is not just in optically, in front of people, but also behind the scenes with our developer partners, like we want to make sure that they’re treated right, that they don’t get contracted and have to wait many years for the games to be released.”</p><figure id="" data-id="6ab91e8d52c0bac7dffa80b95c3090a8" data-recommend-id="image://6ab91e8d52c0bac7dffa80b95c3090a8" data-format="png" data-width="955" data-height="537" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost In Cult / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ab91e8d52c0bac7dffa80b95c3090a8" data-recommend-id="image://6ab91e8d52c0bac7dffa80b95c3090a8" data-format="png" data-width="955" data-height="537" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each collection runs roughly $80 and includes colorful boxed sleeves, posters, art cards, slip cases, and booklets featuring critical essays and developer interviews. Also a copy of the game with curator group Does It Play’s seal of approval certifying that everything is playable to completion right out of the box. Brown said they’re even working with some developers to time upcoming releases to when big new patches are ready so the physical version feels definitive. The platforms currently supported are PlayStation 5 and Switch, with Switch 2 following later in the year. Xbox remains MIA, though it’s not off the table for future releases.</p><p>In just 24 hours since the announcement, the company has already sold through almost half of its limited-run collections of around 1,500 units each. But anyone who wants just a physical copy of one of the games being sold will still be able to secure retail versions for just $40 each. Those won’t come with original art or the rest of the materials that make Lost In Cult’s collections stand out, but they will be restocked on an ongoing basis. </p><p>“I don’t think you can say that you’re all about preservation if you make a game and then it’s limited to 2,000 copies and it’s gone forever and costs 300 pounds on eBay,” Brown said. “For us, in promising preservation and availability, we don’t want to lock these games away. There’s going to be so many people that just want the game in a box and that’s fine. They can go do that.”</p><p>The Criterion Collection, A24, and special-edition book publisher The Folio Society are cited as inspirations for Lost in Cult’s Editions publishing label, both in how games are presented and how they’re selected in the first place. “It’s really hard to pin down what that curation process looks like without sounding too overly artsy fartsy, but it is a little bit artsy fartsy, and that, you know, we kind of just know what a Lost in Cult-type game is when we see it. And that’s really hard to define, but it is a game that is usually very artful, whether that’s through its design, through its visuals, through its story. Again, that is in some way pushing the medium of video games as a serious form of art forward.”</p><p>The physical medium of gaming also faces certain limitations that movies and books do not. For one, platform holders like PlayStation and Nintendo have strict rules about the certification process for physical games, down to where company logos and legal language appear on the boxes. You also can’t include developer commentary or other extras directly on a disc the way you might with an Ultra HD 4K Blu-ray re-release. When it comes to the rest of the packaging and physical inserts, however, publishers can let their imaginations run wild. </p><figure id="" data-id="bda6b5734e9b5e72b2a01881fc40cef0" data-recommend-id="image://bda6b5734e9b5e72b2a01881fc40cef0" data-format="png" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost In Cult / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bda6b5734e9b5e72b2a01881fc40cef0" data-recommend-id="image://bda6b5734e9b5e72b2a01881fc40cef0" data-format="png" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A devotion to physical media in the increasingly digi-fied gaming space adds Lost in Cult to a growing landscape of boutique curators who scavenge for smaller indie titles that wouldn’t otherwise have the scale or notoriety to play in a market still mostly structured around big retail stores. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">Fellow travelers include Limited Run, iam8bit, and Super Rare</a></span>, where Brown worked previously. These companies serve collectors and fans who still cherish not just how a game plays but what it looks like when it’s displayed on a shelf, and knowing the magical experience that resides inside isn’t reliant on servers a thousand miles a way to bring it to life.</p><p>“The way that we see games is just very different from how most do, like I personally care, slash we care, [that] if I pull a game off of my shelf in 40 years time I [can] go, ‘I remember that game, I want to play that.” You can pull it off your shelf, you can play it, and it’ll work. Most companies, unfortunately, aren’t really thinking about that.”</p><p>While big publishers frequently invest in Deluxe Editions and Collector’s Editions, they more often prioritize digital rewards and branded merch over the games themselves and highlighting their artistry. The result is big boxes on store shelves with toys, hats, and statues instead of developer booklets, original art, or physical soundtracks.

But at the moment it is increasingly on boutique companies to solve this physical problem. And it seems a bit far-fetched for me to sit here and say I wish it wasn’t, because I have one, but I do wish it wasn’t.  I do wish that this was taken seriously, and the sort of presentational aspects and ownership aspects were taken seriously across the board. I would love it if some other companies copied us.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-ubisoft-is-giving-rayman-an-aaa-revival-after-last-years-exploration-phase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Remember Ubisoft's announcement last October it was currently in the "exploration phase" of a new Rayman project? Well, it seems full development has now been given the go ahead, with a recent job listing indicating the publisher is currently staffing up on a "AAA" Rayman game.
</p>
<p>
To rewind a bit, all this came about following reports last year that Ubisoft had assembled a small group of developers - including around a dozen members of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">now-disbanded Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team</a> - to work on a remake of Rayman. Somewhat unusually, Ubisoft didn't immediately reach for the 'does not comment on rumours or speculation' button, instead confirming that, yes actually, it was sort of true. "We are pleased to confirm Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan have recently started an exploration phase on the Rayman brand," it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-new-rayman-project-currently-in-the-exploration-phase-following-reports-of-a-remake">said at the time</a>. "The project is still in its early stages, and we will share more details later."
</p>
<p>
There was a sense, then, that nothing might come of the project if that "exploration phase" didn't bring encouraging results. But it now appears those initial experiments showed sufficient promise, because Ubisoft Milan is currently <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000060046042-3d-gameplay-animator-rayman-brand">seeking a 3D gameplay animator</a> to work on a "prestigious AAA title for the Rayman brand." There's also a second, slightly less specific job listing <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000058351278-senior-game-designer-rayman-brand">searching for a senior game designer</a> to "work on the Rayman brand", but it seems likely both positions are related to the same project.

<p>
So that's some encouraging news for Rayman fans, particularly given Ubisoft Montpellier and Milan's historically stellar output. Between them, the studios have released the acclaimed likes of Mario + Rabbids, the beautiful Valiant Hearts series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rayman-origins">Rayman Origins</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rayman-legends">Rayman Legends</a> - two absolutely gold-standard 2D platformers.
</p>
<p>
The only troubling element of Rayman's revival is last year's controversial admission by Ubisoft that original Rayman creator Michel Ancel had been drafted in as a consultant. Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-quits-video-games-industry-to-work-on-wildlife-sanctuary">departed the publisher in 2020</a>, allegedly following an investigation into employee complaints accusing him of toxic leadership, and his involvement with the new Rayman project was reported to have "raised some concerns among team members". It is, however, unclear if Ancel is still serving as a consultant now Ubisoft's initial "exploration phase" appears to be complete.
</p>
<p>
Signs that Rayman may be making a "AAA" return come at a challenging time for Ubisoft. The publisher has  faced a tumultuous few years amid tumbling share prices and a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">high-profile flops</a>, resulting in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">string of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">studio closures</a>. As part of its attempts to right the ship, Ubisoft announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary dedicated to its big three IPs</a> - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry - earlier this year. With those game under a new banner, Ubisoft itself will concentrate on a number of key areas, including "nurturing the development of iconic franchises" - which is presumably where Rayman comes in.
