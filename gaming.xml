			<p>When Rockstar surprise-dropped a new trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, along with a bunch of information about the game's story and its characters, many were quick to say that it looked great, but wondered what it would actually look like outside of a trailer that players assumed wasn't actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Well, turns out it was actual gameplay, and it was all captured on a PlayStation 5 console. Not a PlayStation 5 Pro, a PlayStation 5. Presumably, if it was captured on a PS5 Pro, Rockstar would have made the distinction. Rockstar confirmed in a post on <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1920181314092765494">X</a> that the trailer was a mix of in-game cutscenes and gameplay, all drawn from a PS5.</p>
<p>"<em>Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5</em>," the post reads, "<em>comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes</em>."</p>
<p>It is incredible to know that everything we saw earlier this week came from a PS5, and a credit to the work Rockstar has put in to up the ante for the game players have been waiting over a decade for. Players who didn't fork over hundreds to upgrade to a PS5 Pro (like me) are rejoicing right now, knowing that we're all in for an incredible-looking journey come May 26, 2026.</p>
<p>And if you already bought a PS5 Pro, now you can salivate thinking about how it'll look this good and potentially run at a smoother, higher framerate than what's possible on PS5 and Xbox Series X. Anyone who was on the fence about buying one can now do so with full confidence that they'll be in for an absolutely stunning experience when GTA VI launches.</p>
<p>If you want to continue salivating over how good Grand Theft Auto VI looks, there are already numerous <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">videos analyzing everything about the trailer</a>, showcasing just how much Rockstar has improved the look of everything in GTA VI compared to GTA V.</p>
<p>Shortly after Rockstar posted this confirmation to quell everyone's doubts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk&amp;t=35s">Digital Foundry</a> published its analysis video about the trailer. They spotted a few bits of aliasing and how certain details don't look as good as they could, like hair effects, for example. But overall, the DF experts are just as happy as everyone else to see how amazing it looks, even with all the caveats they present and the fact that analyzing a trailer is still no replacement for the analysis they can do when they have the game in hand.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2 Tech Breakdown - Incredible Realism, Impressive RT, Astonishing Detail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zVIy_La7nk?start=35&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They do, however, stipulate that it will likely only have a 30fps mode on launch. It's possible that PS5 Pro users get a 60fps mode, but it's more reasonable to expect a 30fps mode. Not just because of all the tech Rockstar is using to make GTA VI look this good means that a 60fps framerate just isn't possible on consoles, but because Rockstar has a history of releasing its major games with no 60fps mode at launch.</p>
<p>And on the topic of what's not possible with GTA VI, they also speculate that this game is far too big for the Nintendo Switch 2, and that it won't be able to run on handheld PCs, at least in any state that you'd want to play it in.</p>
<p>But who knows, maybe Rockstar is taking the time afforded by the delay to optimize GTA VI as much as possible, and get a Nintendo Switch 2 version, and/or a 60fps mode ready, if not for launch, for sometime in 2026.</p>

It explains, for instance, that the reason behind Mobius's implementation of a staggered release of minor patches across platforms is because of the resources its next project requires. As the patch notes state, "This is no shade to our QA testers, we’re just trying to be extra risk averse and conservative with the resources we put toward Outer Wilds since our new game is our priority!"</p>

<p>Mobius also reminded fans that no more significant changes are coming for its past title. "As mentioned before, there are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game," the studio wrote. "There may be smaller updates like this from time to time, but no guarantees."</p><p>There's no hint of when we might actually learn what this secretive new project, but that won't stop fans from speculating about what type of game Mobius might attempt next. Outer Wilds was critically acclaimed when it came out back in 2019--and its mix of cartoony space-western aesthetics, complex puzzles, and catchy space banjo were particularly notable. Will we see the return of an interplanetary bluegrass band? Will Mobius stick with the space theme or use a different setting?</p><p>Mobius Digital is most well-known for Outer Wilds, but it actually worked on a couple of other projects in the past. As it lists on its <a href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>, Mobius created two smaller-scale mobile titles, Terra Chroma and Beacon 38. If you squint hard enough at screenshots and descriptions of Beacon 38, you might be able to see some common aesthetic or thematic threads that ended up in Outer Wilds. Mobius worked on these titles long enough ago that it's not trivial to play them now; for example, fans have had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds/comments/donchi/looking_for_beacon_38_the_other_mobius_digital/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to collaborate on finding a playable version of Beacon 38</a>.</p><p>What do you hope to see from a follow-up to Outer Wilds?

It’s been a specific highlight for those discussing Sandfall’s debut title on social media, and now, that praise is being reflected across Billboard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head to the Billboard website and you’ll find that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 currently sits atop both the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/classical-albums/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Classical Albums</u></a> and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/classical-crossover-albums/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Classical Crossover Albums</u></a> charts. Sandfall <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920089990157021371" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also revealed</a> that the soundtrack has managed to make a mark at 13 on the Official Soundtrack Album chart and 31 on the Official Album Download chart. It means players are gravitating to more than just the experience’s story and gameplay as its dreamlike tunes back the entire adventure.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack is comprised of more than 150 individual tracks, with many boasting hundreds of thousands of streams on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5epJvt9jHbYI1j6WqCppGc?si=oUsD0DkOQNqJi-ERKLpR0Q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spotify</u></a>. It’s the epic Lumière that has established itself as the most popular track, though, as it has nearly 1.9 million views on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqizXvvWnmM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a> and a little more than 1.9 million streams on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1A1XuDIYZxSKrQ6mzkWwAT?si=46069054d3674ac7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spotify</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A video game resonating with music fans in such a way is no doubt a feat to be proud of, but it’s especially impressive considering the soundtrack was handled by composer Lorien Testard, who, as Sandfall stated in an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078j5gd71ro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview with BBC</u></a>, was discovered on SoundCloud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S (as well as Game Pass) April 24, 2025, less than two weeks ago.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-warzone-cheating-complaints-ramp-up-following-the-return-of-verdansk-activision-insists-its-caused-chaos-in-the-cheat-marketplace-by-disrupting-over-150-cheat-resellers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere">the euphoric reception to the return of Verdansk to Call of Duty battle royale Warzone</a>, familiar complaints have begun to resurface, chief among them cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has a reputation for cheating (it comes with the territory of being such a hugely popular shooter and having a free-to-download battle royale). Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says"><u>if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</u></a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings to turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation. With the launch of Season 3, Activision even added new console-only crossplay options for regular multiplayer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer">although PC players who do not cheat said they were being unfairly punished</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision, as IGN has reported, has spent millions of dollars in the battle against Call of Duty cheat makers, cheat sellers, and cheat users, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>. In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-call-of-duty-cheat-developer-insists-its-shutting-down-but-players-are-skeptical"><u>Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down</u></a>, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider could fall by the wayside. Also in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-call-of-duty-cheat-providers-shut-down-in-apparent-sweep-and-clear-operation-ahead-of-verdansks-return-to-warzone"><u>IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut down</u></a> ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-release-date-for-return-of-original-verdansk-map-to-call-of-duty-warzone"><u>hotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It had been hoped that Warzone's cheating problem would improve following Verdansk’s release, but the honeymoon period has well and truly come to an end, with players reporting that cheaters are back in force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Geegees Cheaters...it is your game now. Enjoy,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1kf0qok/geegees_cheatersit_is_your_game_now_enjoy/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared redditor Patient-Author-2960</a>. “Big congrats to all the cheaters for finally conquering the game again and donkey punching Verdansk. You guys really stuck with it, grinding those walls and aimbots to perfection. It must feel amazing to dominate lobbies without any actual skill. Welcome back.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid this fresh wave of negativity, Activision has published an anti-cheat update from its Ricochet team, recapping what’s gone on with Season 3. Activision failed to address this apparent rise in Warzone cheating, but did outline the work it has been doing to address the problem of cheating generally across Warzone and Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our commitment is to keep cheaters out of the game and, for those who make it past our initial systems, identify and remove them as quickly as possible,” Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ricochet Anti-Cheat team is hard at work taking on would-be cheaters throughout the game, including those looking to steal leaderboard glory.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it had shut down five more cheat makers since its last progress report (this is on top of the 20+ it’s shut down since Black Ops 6 came out last year), and had “disrupted” over 150 cheat sellers in the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It said it had protected over 10,000 accounts that had a potential suspicious account link in Season 03 (Activision recently forced players to verify they are in control of an account if someone attempts to link a new PC account to an Activision ID). It’s also added Replay Tech Preview, a new tech that helps examine replays for faster investigation, and added new elements to the Death Widget, making KillCams clearer for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Season 03 update has made a strong impact against cheat makers and resellers,” Activision insisted. “For example, as we announced recently, Ricochet Anti-Cheat quickly detected a cheat provider that came back online after weeks of downtime, resulting in a large-scale ban wave against its customer base, forcing it offline once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve continued to cause chaos in the cheat marketplace and have hit a milestone of disrupting over 150 cheat resellers – shutting them down or rendering their software ineffective. And we’re not slowing down.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🛡️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Warzone</a></p><p>A message from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamRICOCHET?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TeamRICOCHET</a>:</p><p>Earlier this week, we detected a cheat vendor that was offline was attempting to return. Today, we shut them down (again) by issuing a large-scale ban wave against their customers. </p><p>We've shut down over 20 cheat makers…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1915574628187292097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Activision highlighted new account creation, which is a tactic cheaters use when they get booted from Warzone. This, Activision said, is “a reality” for all free-to-play games like Warzone, but it’s targeting new accounts and is now seeing “strong” results. On average from the period between Season 02 through Season 03, new accounts are banned within four matches when they cheat, Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New anti-cheat systems and upgrades are coming throughout Season 03 Reloaded – specifically with Ranked Play online in Call of Duty: Warzone – as well as upcoming seasons, Activision continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our team’s commitment remains the same. While threats continue to exist, we’re focused on strengthening the barriers to make cheating in Call of Duty a fool’s errand, eliminating as many cheaters as possible before they can impact a match, and hunting down and removing any cheating account that makes its way into the game as quickly as possible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Activision said it has issued cease and desist demands to several companies that create and sell third-party hardware used to cheat in Call of Duty games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have already seen compliance from some of the companies we’ve contacted; however, we will continue to pursue other device makers in the market, globally, as well as people that create scripts to manipulate Call of Duty game code,” Activision warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These devices and scripts used to cheat in our games are not welcome. Call of Duty does not endorse the use of these products. Any account that utilizes these devices on PC or console for the purpose of cheating will be permanently banned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No anti-cheat system can eliminate all threats, but we continue to deliver updates to take the legs out from under cheat makers by banning their users, forcing them offline, and reducing the time to detection for accounts that make it into the game,” Activision concluded. “Today and into the future, the Ricochet Anti-Cheat roadmap continues, with new updates being developed and deployed on a regular basis.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Although Microsoft's blockbuster deal to buy Activision Blizzard was approved in October 2023, the United States government's Federal Trade Commission appealed the decision. Now, a US appeals court has affirmed the deal, bringing about an apparent end to the FTC's attempts to block the buyout.</p><p><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/us-appeals-court-affirms-microsoft-activision-merger" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As reported by Bloomberg</a>, the 9th Circuit US Court of Appeals <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/05/07/23-15992.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">declared on Wednesday</a> that the trial judge in the case, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, was correct in denying the FTC's attempt to prevent the $75.4 billion deal from going through.</p><p>A chief concern from the FTC pertained to cloud gaming. To satisfy the FTC, Microsoft carved out deals to bring Xbox games to non-Xbox streaming platforms, but the FTC appealed. Now, that appeal has been denied.</p><p>"The panel held that the district court applied the correct legal standards and did not abuse its discretion, or rely on clearly erroneous findings, in holding that the FTC failed to make a sufficient evidentiary showing to establish the requisite likelihood of success on the merits of its claim," the appeals court said. "Thus, the FTC had not raised serious questions regarding whether the proposed merger was likely to substantially lessen competition in the relevant markets."</p><p>Additionally, the appeals panel upheld the district court's decision that the FTC failed to sufficiently show that Microsoft would make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox or release an "inferior" version on PlayStation. The appeals court also concluded that Activision games launching on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>--an Xbox-exclusive subscription service--would not "substantially lessen competition."</p><p>As part of Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard, the company said it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-signs-10-year-deal-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms/1100-6511660/" data-ref-id="1100-6511660">keep releasing Call of Duty games on rival platforms for at least 10 years</a>. Microsoft's releases on PS5 so far have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">proven to be quite successful. </a></p><p>The FTC's case against Microsoft was driven in part by FTC head Lina Khan. When President Trump took office in January 2025, he installed Andrew N. Ferguson as the new FTC chair.</p><p>With Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard already approved, it's unclear how the two companies could have been untangled had the appeal been successful. </p><p>Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion was Microsoft's biggest-ever acquisition by purchase price, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">biggest gaming buyout of all time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/13-years-later-the-louvre-museums-3ds-audio-guide-service-is-coming-to-an-end<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
13 years after the Louvre announced it was teaming up with Nintendo to create an audio tour of the world-renowned Parisian art museum guests could enjoy using 3DS handhelds, it's been revealed the service is coming to an end this September.
</p>
<p>
The Louvre <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louvre-replaces-audio-guides-with-5000-3ds">unveiled the partnership in December 2011</a>, explaining it would be introducing 5,000 3DS machines equipped with custom software designed by Nintendo to replace the museum's stock of traditional audio guides.
</p>
<p>
Starting in 2012, visitors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shigeru-miyamoto-demos-3ds-louvre-tour-guide">could roam the museum's halls with a 3DS in hand</a>, listening to audio commentary detailing the artwork they encountered along the way. A more elaborate version, known as Nintendo 3DS Guide: Louvre, was commissioned and introduced the following year, providing an expanded 30 hours of audio, plus new visual material including 3D views and photographs of the museum and its exhibits.

<p>
GPS transmitters installed within the museum enabled guests who'd rented 3DS machines equipped with the software to learn more about nearby artwork based on their current location. Nintendo also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-3ds-louvre-guide-released-on-eshop">released this version on the 3DS eShop</a>, providing purchasers with a way to explore the Louvre from the comfort of their own home. The company even went as far as to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Nintendo-3DS-Guide-Louvre/Nintendo-3DS-Guide-Louvre/1-One-day-the-Louvre/1-One-day-the-Louvre-836504.html">release an Iwata Asks Q&amp;A</a> and air a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavLP_3ew-A">special Nintendo Direct</a> featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and  Satoru Iwata touring the Louvre and showing the 3DS guide software in action.
</p>
<p>
But now, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-3ds-officially-discontinued">3DS discontinued</a> and Nintendo's focus having long shifted to Switch and its imminent successor, the Louvre has announced the service's impending demise. "The New Nintendo 3DS console audio guides will go out of operation in September 2025," it revealed in a <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/visitor-amenities">message on its website</a>, "to be replaced by a new system." It's unclear if the museum's partnership with Nintendo will continue in a different form - perhaps with Switch or the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> - or if it plans to introduce something completely different.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">arrives in less than a month</a> on 5th June. And if you're wondering, it'll be approximately 16 times lighter than the Mona Lisa.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/the-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-blocked-puzzle-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> remastered the original 2014 puzzle classic and its Road to Gehenna expansion with an Unreal Engine 5 upgrade, but it also went further than that. It included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning, which adds another 18 puzzles to solve on the original game and its first DLC release.</p>
<p>Narratively, In the Beginning is a prequel to the events of the first game, but what makes it special is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 out of the 18 puzzles</a> were made in collaboration with members of the community who had been making their own puzzles for the last 11 years.</p>
<p>The result is an expansion that is so tough, the puzzles included with In the Beginning are earning the reputation as being some of the most challenging to solve in the entire series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the Blocker puzzle in the expansion. If you just want a hint, then all I'll say is to leave the jammer alone. It's already doing everything you need it to do. Keep reading if you want the full solution.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Blocker Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Get the second connector</h3>
<p>When you enter the puzzle area and look around, it won't take you long to deduce that you need a second connector to deactivate the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. It's easy to assume that the jammer you see on the right side of the area deactivating a shield between the two spaces is part of the solve. As I said in the hint, you don't need it at all, and you can leave it where it is, keeping the shield in the wall between the two sides of the puzzle area down.</p>
<p>Instead, what you need to do first, is get the hexahedron.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk forward when entering the puzzle area and grab the connector (C1). Connect it to the red laser generator and the red node that sits just behind a fan that will launch you to a platform in the top-right corner of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When the laser has activated the fan, launch yourself onto the elevated platform and grab the hexahedron. Jump back down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron in front of the fan. Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the node behind the fan, the blue laser generator, and the blue node on the other side of the puzzle area, behind a wall.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place C1 down on top of the hexahedron. Your laser pattern should look like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Step in front of the blue laser generator so that the red laser can connect to the node that will activate the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When it launches into the air, the blue lasers will connect instead of the red, activating the blue node on the far left side of the puzzle area. That node simultaneously turns off the shield blocking the second connector (C2) and turns on a fan that will push it out onto the ground, letting you pick it up.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fair warning, the hexahedron won't fly for very long with C1 on top of it, so you might have to try this twice, as it's possible for the C2 to get stuck before making it onto the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Solve the puzzle</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Gather C1, C2 and the hexahedron together.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node behind the fan and the red node on the opposite side of the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and use the fan to launch yourself, with C2 in hand, to the elevated platform. Connect C2 to the blue laser generator and the blue node to fully deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground, walk over to the tetromino and claim your prize.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-won-the-ftc-appeal-that-still-challenged-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's taken nearly two years, but the FTC appeal against Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the Northern District of California's decision to block the Activision Blizzard deal with a preliminary injunction is concluded, and Microsoft has won once again.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsoft-wins-ftc-appeal-challenging-69-bln-activision-blizzard-deal-2025-05-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the three-judge panel of San Francisco's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/movayzarnva/FTC%20v%20Microsoft%20-%20CA9%20-%2020250507.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a> in favor of Microsoft. More specifically, they decreed that the district court had applied the correct legal standards when <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-beats-ftcs-request-for-preliminary-injunction-to-block-activision-blizzard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it ruled in July 2023</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>First, pertaining to the console market, the panel agreed with the district court that the FTC failed to sufficiently show that Microsoft would foreclose or partially foreclose rivals after the merger either by making the popular game Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox console or by releasing only an inferior version of the game for Sony’s rival PlayStation. </em></li>
<li><em>The panel next found that as to the library subscription services market, the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding that the FTC had not made an adequate showing that the merger would substantially lessen competition. Because Activision Blizzard had long opposed putting its content on library subscription services, the merger’s effect of making such content available for the first time in the subscription market, even if exclusive to Microsoft, would not substantially lessen competition. </em></li>
<li><em>Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in similarly finding an insufficient likelihood of </em><em>success on the FTC’s claim that the merger would substantially lessen competition in the cloud-streaming market, given that the FTC failed to show that Activision Blizzard content would be available to this market in the absence of the merger.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>That ruling was the definitive step towards Microsoft's finalization of the $68.7 billion acquisition. The whole deal could have fallen apart if the judge ruled in favor of the US Federal Trade Commission. Microsoft would formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the acquisition's closing on October 13, 2023.</p>
<p>The FTC's fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty exclusive to the Xbox platform turned out to be completely unfounded. In fact, the Xbox and Windows company shifted its strategy toward the opposite side of the spectrum, opting to bring all of its games even to rival consoles such as those made by PlayStation and Nintendo. Just two days ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Gears of War: Reloaded will bring the original trilogy of the sci-fi third-person shooter to PlayStation 5 this Summer.</p>
<p>Between that and the fact that all of Microsoft-owned games are now available on cloud services such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW and Boosteroid, there's no doubt that a wider audience is able to play those games following the acquisition.</p>

            <p>This is just a quick write-up, because it's outside office hours, but... Mobius Digital, creators of wondrous virtual orrery and gravitational stageplay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, are making a new game.</p><!--more-->
<p>The "announcement" takes the form of a throwaway line in an otherwise unremarkable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/753640/view/521964845255360514?l=english">Outer Wilds update changelog</a>. Here it be:</p>
<blockquote><p>This minor patch is now out on Steam only, but will be brought to all other platforms except Nintendo Switch in late May. If you’re not on Steam, don’t worry, you’re not missing out! This is a minor patch mainly for adding a couple folks to the credits and fixing two PC-only bugs: clicking out of the game disabling certain inputs (such as the key for the ship’s lock on), which affected streamers in particular, and diagonal movement being faster than normal with mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>Why stagger the releases like this? It’s to increase the chance that, if any bad bugs on Steam slipped through testing, they’ll get caught and fixed before the release of the other platforms. This is no shade to our QA testers, we’re just trying to be extra risk averse and conservative with the resources we put toward Outer Wilds since our new game is our priority!</p></blockquote>
<p>After the usual bullet-point round-up of additions and fixes, the changelog post adds that "there are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game."</p>
<p>So then. Well now. What could they be up to? Another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a>? Further attempts at simulating quantum mechanics and other elements of "post-classical" physics? I am all agog. Thanks to reader Faxmachinen  for spotting it and passing it on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>PUBG Productions announced that it has launched a new closed beta for its upcoming single-player survival roguelike,<a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/"> Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. This is the fifth playtesting event that PUBG Productions has hosted since the game's reveal in December 2024, with the game due out in early access sometime in summer 2025.</p>
<p>The closed beta will run from today, May 7, to May 14, and is available on Steam and the Epic Games Store. To participate, you need to sign up through the studio's official <a href="https://discord.gg/P3PUCmUV">Discord</a> to receive a code for either storefront. Signing up gets you a code, you don't have to wait to see if you've been accepted into the closed beta. Though, PUBG Productions does stipulate that codes are being given out on a "<em>first-come first-servered basis</em>," so better to be quick if you want to try out Prologue: Go Wayback!.</p>

<p>Even if you do miss this playtest, though, in the PUBG Productions Discord, the team has already confirmed there will be another playtest next month, beginning June 2, 2025. So you'll have another chance, and maybe even another after that, if it ends up releasing in August 2025.</p>
<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/">spoke to PUBG creator Brendan Greene</a> about Prologue: Go Wayback!, Greene outlined his goals for the game as part of a three-game project.</p>
<p>"<em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. it's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a test bed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-class-hands-on-impressions-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the great things about Elden Ring has always been the diversity of playstyles it enables, and one of my favorite playstyles is loading up on Strength, grabbing the largest weapon I can find, and crushing foes with posture-breaking jumping attacks and charged-up heavy strikes. If that’s you too, then allow me to introduce you to the Raider in Nightreign (see the video below).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Guardian — the other big burly class with lots of health and an affinity for big weapons — is more focused on defense with a shield as a starter weapon and an ultimate ability that can mitigate damage for the entire party for an extended period of time, the Raider is designed as an absolute offensive powerhouse. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important ability of the Raider is Retaliate, which initially may not seem like a very strong skill on its own — it’s just two stomps that deal a bit of physical and poise damage. But the real magic is that thanks to the Raider’s passive, he cannot be knocked down while doing Retaliate. This means that the Raider basically has a free damage-soaking technique that will let you totally armor through pretty much any enemy or boss attack, with the added bonus of that weak second stomp getting replaced by an extremely powerful punch that will stagger even the largest enemies, if you manage to absorb an attack that would’ve done a substantial amount of damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there is the Raider’s ultimate, Totem Stela, which has him slamming the ground and causing a large totem to erupt, dealing big damage to anything around it. Like all of the other Ultimates in Nightreign, this is an incredibly powerful technique that can alter the tide of a fight. Not only does it deal big damage, but the totem is climbable, giving both you and your teammates either a safe place to lay low, or a vantage point to hit. In addition to that, it <em>also </em>gives everyone a damage buff as well, meaning it's one of the first ults you’ll want to coordinate using so that the rest of the team can benefit from it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Of all the classes I've played in Nightreign, the raider was the one I had the most fun with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Raider starts with the Raider’s Greavtaxe, which is a pretty solid starting weapon that deals some fire damage and has the “Endure” skill affixed to it, which basically gives you another way to absorb and power through enemy attacks in case Retaliate is on cooldown. Still, you’ll definitely want to find a better weapon as the nights get closer, and large strength-scaling weapons are definitely the Raider’s go-to style of weapon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the classes I’ve played in Nightreign, the Raider is definitely the one that I’ve had the most fun with. It’s the one that is most well-suited for one-on-one battles, which is appropriate because its Remembrances (we’ll talk about those later on in the month) have you fighting in one-on-one boss fights in a sort of gladiatorial arena, which is a nice change of pace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's all for our hands-on impressions of Nightreign's classes, but stay tuned all throughout the month in depth looks at the mechanics of Nightreign, along with interviews with the developers, and more as IGN First continues on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

Through its ever-evolving combat and the introduction of beloved character bonding mechanics, the series has ascended to the upper echelon of tactical RPGs, culminating in two excellent mainline entries on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we near the end of the original Switch era, we’ve compiled a list of every Fire Emblem game available on the console as well as what's coming to the Switch 2. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Fire Emblem Games Are on Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>There are five Fire Emblem games on Switch: </strong>two mainline games and three spinoffs.

The mashup incorporates the best elements of each series, blending Fire Emblem’s team-based strategy with Dynasty Warriors’ button-mashing, hack-and-slash action. It’s a worthwhile spinoff for action fans, though the light story makes it inessential to those concerned with Fire Emblem lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game was developed by Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force in collaboration with the action gurus at Team Ninja (Ninja Gaiden, Nioh).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem: Three Houses (2019)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-three-houses-1745882956790.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/25/fire-emblem-three-houses-review"><u>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</u></a> was a milestone release for the series. It was the first Fire Emblem game released on a home console in 12 years, the first mainline entry released on Switch, and a critical and commercial success that carried forward the momentum of Awakening seven years before it.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Houses is a massive tactical RPG that balances the grand with the intimate. Large-scale battles progress an overarching story of politics and religion within a continental war, while quieter moments between battles are spent in the monastery training, teaching, exploring, and bonding with other characters through well-written and -acted conversations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Houses is Fire Emblem at its best, and what we'd recommend as a starting point if you’re looking to jump into the series on Switch.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore (2020)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/tokyo-mirage-1745882991839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2020, Nintendo released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review"><u>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE</u></a> Encore, an expanded port of the original Wii U release. Encore added new story content, characters, and music to the Nintendo-Atlus crossover game, which blends Fire Emblem’s “weapon triangle” combat mechanic — swords have an advantage over axes, axes over lances, lances over swords — with the flashy style, dungeon-crawling, and moment-to-moment combat of Atlus’s Shin Megami Tensei and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is a comical, often over-the-top send-up of Japanese pop-culture that, as in Warriors before it, takes a backseat to the action.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes (2023)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-warriors-three-hopes-1745883001863.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo re-teamed with Omega Force for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review"><u>Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</u></a>, the companies’ second Fire Emblem-Dynasty Warriors crossover following Fire Emblem Warriors. Three Hopes is a retelling of Three Houses set in an alternate timeline where Three Houses’ protagonist Byleth serves as the main villain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Hopes is a more robust blend of the two franchises than its predecessor, integrating more of Fire Emblem’s social and tactical mechanics with Dynasty Warriors’ fast-paced action.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem Engage (2023)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-engage-1745883011216.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-review"><u>Fire Emblem Engage</u></a> is the series’ latest game and its second mainline entry on Switch.

Engage’s original story connects to the series past through these 12 rings, each of which houses the spirit of a past Fire Emblem protagonist, allowing you to summon past heroes such as Marth, Ike, Celica, and Byleth.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fire Emblem Games Available With Nintendo Switch Online</h2><div catalogid="f103691f-4710-4305-8c12-09ba36a36696" id="187637"><div id="187637" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack: 12-Month Individual Membership</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are currently two Fire Emblem games available with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a> outside of Japan: the 2003 Game Boy Advance game Fire Emblem, aka Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, and the 2004 follow-up Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A third game, 2005's Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, will be added to the catalog when GameCube games are integrated into the service alongside the launch of Switch 2 on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the complete list of Fire Emblem games currently available with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/06/fire-emblem-2"><u>Fire Emblem</u></a> (GBA, 2003)</li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/24/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones"><u>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</u></a> (GBA, 2004)</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Upcoming Fire Emblem Games on Switch and Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no official word on new Fire Emblem games in development, but it's pretty likely we'll see something new (or remade) in the series on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide">upcoming Switch 2</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's fight against cheaters continues, and Activision has released a new blog to recap the effectiveness of the game's anti-cheat since Season 3's launch. Here are the anti-cheat results Activision provided, plus the new Ricochet improvements announced for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision has been shutting down cheat makers since Black Ops 6's launch. Now, five more cheat makers have been put out of business since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-call-of-duty-is-stepping-up-efforts-to-fight-cheaters/1100-6530471/">anti-cheat report provided in March</a>. Cheat makers aren't the only ones in trouble. Activision is also targeting third-party hardware with scripts used to cheat, delivering cease and desist demands to several companies that create and sell these products.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"We have already seen compliance from some of the companies we've contacted," Activision says. "However, we will continue to pursue other device makers in the market, globally, as well as people that create scripts to manipulate Call of Duty game code." It also reminds players that any account using these devices on PC or console for the purpose of cheating will be permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">Another part of Call of Duty's protection plan included the recent Account Linking policy change, which requires players to verify they are in control of an account when attempting to link a new PC account to an Activision ID. The publisher says this has already protected over 10,000 accounts that had a "potential suspicious account link" but were blocked by the new verification requirement.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-adds-4-20-events-and-major-updates-to-verdansk/2900-6513/">Season 3 Reloaded update</a> included even more improvements from Call of Duty's anti-cheat team. This added an expanded version of the Death Widget UI, which now provides players with even more detailed information about how they were eliminated, including if they were pinged by a heartbeat sensor, a Most Wanted contract, a proximity alarm, a Resurgence mark, or even by a teammate being used as a body shield. The Death Widget was recently added to Call of Duty in an attempt to cut down on false reports of cheaters.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Ricochet team also made updates to its advanced video replay technology to help better weed out wallhackers. Activision says this method uses clips captured by Call of Duty's Replay Investigation Tool, which is an internal tool that watches completed matches to determine the probability of suspicious gameplay using machine learning. If a clip gets marked by the tool as being suspect, it will then be reviewed by a human.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher says the Replay Investigation Tool captures tons of clips across Black Ops 6 and Warzone, but the tool is most focused on Ranked Play modes. "It's unbelievably frustrating to be bumped off a leaderboard by a cheater, but RIT and its advancements are zeroed in on the Ranked Play experience," Activision says.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says new Ricochet anti-cheat updates are being developed and deployed on a regular basis, and more information will be provided in future blogs.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to fighting cheaters, Call of Duty is embracing stoner culture with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-seth-rogen-and-all-high-art-event-rewards/2900-6521/">a 4/20 event themed around Seth Rogen</a>, bundles for Jay and Silent Bob, and plenty of weed-related cosmetics to earn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/1000x-resist-anniversary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m a big proponent of discovering a video game at the right moment for me, rather than through incessant ad campaigns. As indie developer sunset visitor 斜陽過客s speculative sci-fi adventure game <a href="https://www.sunsetvisitor.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>1000xResist</em></a> approaches its first anniversary, I wanted to take a moment — not to dive into the specifics of the game itself, since it’s one best left unspoken to preserve the experience for others curious to give it a whirl — but to reflect on how it impacted my life.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/nier-automatas-sequel-1000xresist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>1000xResist</em></a> joined a pantheon of games that found me at a crossroads and became a guide, a lifeline, and a quiet companion, helping me navigate hard times. I first experienced this phenomenon when I let <a href="https://wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYWPN20171113-01.1.9&amp;srpos=30&amp;e=-------en-20-WYWPN-21-byDA-img-txIN%7ctxCO%7ctxTA-isaiah+colbert+----2017---0------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em></a>’s final battle sit <a href="https://youtu.be/s0kV00e2_H8?t=4472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unfinished for two years</a>, only to return to it as a more seasoned adult to experience its message far better than a college sophomore attempting to complete it in an evening. Back in 2017, I was already weighed down by the suffocating reality of feeling <a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/lccc-student-alleges-mishandling-of-racial-harassment-on-campus/article_acb898e8-bdf9-11e7-b9c9-4b2ea3345d59.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even more like a minority</a> as a Black journalist in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in the wake of Colin Kaepernick taking a knee and Trumpism sharpening the feeling that championing my existence was like talking to a brick wall.&nbsp;</p><p>After I wrote an op-ed <a href="https://wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYWPN20171016-01.1.5&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20-WYWPN-1--img-txIN%7ctxCO%7ctxTA-+colin+Kaepernick-------0------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in support of Kaepernick’s protest</a>, I received hate mail from a group claiming to be the Ku Klux Klan, which I later learned was a hoax. I put on a brave face, downplaying how fucked up and unsettling the whole situation was, trying to push through and move forward like <a href="https://wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYWPN20171113-01&amp;e=-------en-20-WYWPN-21-byDA-img-txIN%7ctxCO%7ctxTA-isaiah+colbert+----2017---0------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senua had in her odyssey</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ninja Theory</span></figcaption></figure><p>But that moment set the first domino falling, nudging me toward quitting journalism before I had barely begun. Carrying all that on top of not wanting to have a virtual misstep leading to a permadeath of Senua’s perilous journey wasn’t something I wanted on my conscience, even if, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/hellblade-permadeath-fake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in retrospect</a>, that was a silly reason to put the game down. When I finally hit credits on it years later, I was in the comfort of my hometown of Chicago and giving journalism a go once more.</p><p>It happened again in 2021 when <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> transcended its shelf life as a <a href="https://columbiachronicle.com/arts-culture/animal-crossing-is-the-new-socialization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic-era socialization solution</a>, becoming something more personal for me when I <a href="https://kotaku.com/deleting-my-exs-animal-crossing-save-data-1848041262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleted my ex’s save file</a> from my Nintendo Switch. Wandering through my neglected island, the last lingering villagers drifted toward me like ghosts to ask about my former partner, unaware of the shift that had already occurred. It was rough, especially given I’d only come back to dust things off ahead of the game’s final updates. And there was the bell-grubbing landlord Tom Nook, a character I’d openly trash-talk whenever I booted up the game, sitting me down for a virtual therapy session as he walked me through the deletion process. As <em>Black Mirror</em> as it was, Tom Nook’s flavor text softened the act and gave weight to the finality, as my rudimentary gamer decision helped reclaim a space I’d once shared with someone else.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Nintendo</span></figcaption></figure><p>The jester who scribes my life would perform a gaming hat-trick last year with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-yakuza-layoff-game-industry-too-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a><em> </em>unexpectedly helping me process <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my layoff from <em>Kotaku</em></a>. Before it happened, I always felt destined to review a <em>Yakuza </em>game, being one of the three writers at the time who were absolute freaks for the series. So when I finally got the chance to <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/game/multi-platform/like-a-dragon/infinite-wealth/.206773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do so elsewhere</a> months after my layoff, I wasn’t prepared for the gutpunch of its opening hours. What was supposed to be packing my bags for an island getaway instead had me unpack the trauma I’d shoved aside because Ichiban got laid off from his job at Hello Work.</p><p>Sure, the circumstances were as over-the-top as any Ryu Ga Gotoku storyline, but that didn’t make the moment less stark for me. I wasn’t as blindsided as Ichiban, who strolled into work like any other day — I woke up to Slack messages knowing something bad was bound to happen to me because it was happening to others. For reasons I still don’t fully understand, I chose to go into the office to receive the news in person, which led to me crying on the CTA, gathering up what little figures I’d had at my desk, and retreating to the safety of my mom’s apartment just in time for a brief, impersonal call from the adults in the room giving me a hi-bye weeks before my birthday.</p><p>Like Ichiban, I threw myself headfirst into the next thing, blinking away tears to fire off emails and call colleagues, scrambling to set up anything that could be a next step minutes after the call ended. Thankfully, after some heart-to-heart fireside chats and video game reassurance drawn from party members championing <a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryu’s farewell tour in Kamurocho</a>, I came to terms with letting my raw anger and sadness simply exist. More importantly, I learned to give myself space to revisit old haunts — not just to reminisce but to finally indulge in hobbies I spared from being commodified by the relentless churn of SEO-driven blogs.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ryu Ga Gotoku</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, reality had little patience for sentimentality. Bills still needed to be paid, so I dove headlong into the fucked up world of permalancing as if nothing had ever changed.</p><p>After getting a brief gasp of air, I wrote blogs and articles just as I always had, only this time without the safety net of insurance or a fixed salary to fall back on. Until recently, I was constantly grinding to stay ready so I wouldn’t have to get ready, jumping on any prospect that arose as I crunched numbers in Google Sheets to calculate how much I’d have to do weekly to make ends meet. I was chasing gigs at outlets that paid <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$30 per article</a>, angling for better rates on reviews, tightening my belt when invoice cycles annoyingly paid out 45 days after the fact, as if landlords accepted "rent on layaway" as a reasonable explanation for overdue bills.&nbsp;</p><p>I wasn’t a person. I was a function: Writer. A reality made more painfully clear after too many late-night egosearches, watching my title morph erratically with each passing article I’d forgotten as quickly as I submitted them: <em>Kotaku </em>writer, contributor, freelance journalist, writer, journalist. A value marker dictated not by who I was but by how Google labeled me based on my output.&nbsp;</p><p>At this stage, I had abandoned game reviews — a choice born from impostor syndrome and the lingering void that followed each published critique I’d crunched weekends to write to allot time to continue permalancing. No review ever felt complete. Once they were live, they became a permanent mark, a legacy that would outlast me, yet there was always something I could refine. A sharper turn of phrase, a more evocative metaphor — I could mold my words endlessly and still feel they fell short. No matter how often I filled my phone’s notes app with carefully crafted similes and phrases I spontaneously encountered daily, attempting to push my writing to a level even when I was asked to churn out nothing blogs to meet a quota,&nbsp; writing stopped being fulfilling.&nbsp;</p><p>I met with the harsh reality that outlets weren’t looking for niche game critiques. Budgets were tight; publications wanted SEO-driven trend pieces, retrospective anniversaries of blockbuster games I never had the financial privilege to play growing up, or mind-numbing busy work I no longer had the energy to force myself through. So, the choice to step away became less about preference and more about inevitability. I felt a husk of my former self, lacking words with merit to contribute to the space meaningfully aside from feeding the machine with work that didn’t move me.&nbsp;</p><p>Then <em>1000xResist was </em>released.&nbsp;</p><p><em>1000xResist</em> caught my attention not because it was a piece of speculative fiction that could draw aesthetic comparisons to <em>Nier: Automata</em>. There was an innocuous post about where it had drawn its inspirations from, citing Isaiah-bait media like <a href="https://twitter.com/1000xResist/status/1787939091515899966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wong Kar-wai’s <em>In the Mood for Love</em> and Satoshi Kon’s <em>Millennium Actress</em></a><em> </em>— films I’d recently found comfort in during the lag time of my unemployment. One thing led to another, and I played the game and found myself carnally empathizing with its protagonist.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure><figcaption><span>sunset visitor 斜陽過客</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>sunset visitor 斜陽過客</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>sunset visitor 斜陽過客</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>sunset visitor 斜陽過客</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>sunset visitor 斜陽過客</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>sunset visitor 斜陽過客</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>Watcher was one of six clones with utilitarian names like Principle, Knower, Fixer, Healer, and Bang Bang Fire. Watcher’s duty was to observe and interpret the fractured memories of their deity, ALLMOTHER, the entity heralded for guiding humanity through a catastrophe reminiscent of the pandemic. The deeper Watcher instigated, the clearer it became that this supposed truth was anything but. The parallels between&nbsp; ALLMOTHER’s influence and the ruthless cycle of C-suite executives, ready to laud praises at a writer’s talent being integral to their organization only to discard them in the name of cost-cutting efforts, were impossible for me to ignore. So watching Watcher lash out at ALLMOTHER, plunging a blade into her back in a defiant, in medias res opening cutscene, shot exquisite and vengeful schadenfreude I can still see behind closed eyelids.&nbsp;</p><p><em>1000xResist</em>’s setting, a supposed Garden of Eden, also eerily mirrored the crumbling state of games journalism, or at least my feelings toward it — a landscape far from a paradise where eager newcomers jockey for entry. The games journalism industry was a collapsed terrarium, where its denizens clung to the hope of reviving traditions that no longer had an infrastructure to sustain them. Despite this decline, replacement clones in <em>1000xResist</em>, known as Shells, traipsed through their apocalypse, eager to take over a function even if it came at the demise of a sister who came before them — a feeling I’d wrestled with when job postings would rear their head from the latest string of unnecessary layoffs.</p><figure><figcaption><span>sunset visitor 斜陽過客</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from prescient parallels to the dystopia of my own life, what struck me most about <em>1000xResist</em> was how its post-apocalyptic setting fostered an intellectual playground where its cast dissected language, stripping words down to their functions like new-age Plato and Socrates. While some of the game’s early interpretations and misinterpretations of language are akin to the "Is this a pigeon?" meme, <em>1000xResist</em>’s caption-worthy back-and-forths scratched the same itch I’d resigned myself to abandon eagerly as a writer: mulling over the inherent meaning of words, and how the gravity of their colloquialisms and double entendre folded within its usage. For example, the intrinsic value of a combination lock as a tool for safeguarding possessions can just as easily carry an extrinsic value, manifesting distrust in others. And so the game continued, prodding at meaning, layering interpretation upon interpretation, offering tongue-in-cheek winks when its characters caught on to something profound and exasperated sighs when their would-be Ozymandias observations weren’t that deep.</p><p>For me, playing <em>1000xResis</em>t wasn’t exclusively an existential exercise in dissecting faith, purpose, and identity — it became a conversation with myself. Was my writing still worth pursuing? Did my words carry any weight? Like Watcher, I arrived at a truth, one counter to the resignation of her sisters:</p><p>There are feelings worth getting incarcerated over.</p><p>Not in the literal sense, of course, but in the poetic. I finished the game not only wanting to write about it, but realizing writing — the thing that had once defined, shaped, and sustained me — was still worth doing.&nbsp;</p><p>A year ago, <em>1000xResist</em> rekindled my love for gaming at a time when I thought that passion was in the rearview. While I’m still working through untangling my relationship with games and writing, the game was a reminder that there are still gaming experiences out there capable of pulling me out of my shell of self-doubt, sparking excitement to write about games that mesmerized me or left me unfulfilled. Not because it’s my function, but because it's my passion.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-max-traffic-speed-tom-walker-finished"><h3>He Did It</h3></a><p>Far and away the biggest Grand Theft Auto-related news of the day</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-soundtrack-interview"><h3>How Clair Obscur’s Composer Created An Incredible Soundtrack</h3></a><p>Lorien Testard dropped eight hours of straight heat for those who come after</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Of course, this isn't such a significant update to convince players to return to Starfield. Still, fans of the game are hoping Bethesda can continue improving the sci-fi roleplaying game beyond the Shattered Space expansion that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was released last year</a>. That's what the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> a couple of months ago through social media channels, hinting that 'exciting things' would be added to the game later in 2025. The announcement might come during the Xbox Games Showcase, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set for June 8</a>.</p>

Both the type of material you receive from the Appraisal and its traits are completely random. The only thing that’s different across the Tempered Monsters is that tougher foes will grant higher rarity materials, similar to Hunter Symbols. <strong>My recommendation is to either hunt the strongest Tempered Monsters for rarer materials or take on quests that involve two of them so that you leave with double the amount of rewards.</strong></p><p>Hunting strong enemies isn’t the only option to attain these rare items. <strong>Another way to get Artian Materials is to visit the Melding Pot in Suja to turn unwanted Artian Materials into randomized new ones.</strong> This works just like Smelting in the Oilwell Basin, with each material you use filling up a point gauge. The option is labeled as Meld Relics and will first unlock after completing the Chapter Five Storm-Cold Vortex quest. Once you reach hunter rank 100, you’ll also unlock the option to directly craft a high-rarity material of your choice.</p><h2 id="h3382"><a id="forge"></a>How to Forge Artian Weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="0e1d09243d21977ac802ecc0128b791d" data-recommend-id="image://0e1d09243d21977ac802ecc0128b791d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge Artian Weapon screen, with two parts selected for making an Artian Lance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Forge Artian Weapon screen, with two parts selected for making an Artian Lance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e1d09243d21977ac802ecc0128b791d" data-recommend-id="image://0e1d09243d21977ac802ecc0128b791d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge Artian Weapon screen, with two parts selected for making an Artian Lance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of the above leads to finally forging one of these special weapons. You can do so by using the “Forge Artian Weapons” option in Gemma’s Smithy menu and offering up three Artian Materials. Not only does each weapon type use a different mix of materials, but they all need to be the same rarity to be forged together as well. Don’t be surprised if you need to hunt quite a few Tempered Monsters before it’s possible to create exactly what you want.</p><p>Selecting two materials with the same element type will grant that element to your weapon. If the third material also shares the element type, it will add an element stat bonus. Although this won’t apply when forging an Artian <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364">Heavy or Light Bowgun</a></span>, it will enable the use of the corresponding ammo type.</p><h2 id="h3383"><a id="reinforce"></a>How to reinforce Artian Weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="0cfc0873a31b590d280c3e50cac412cf" data-recommend-id="image://0cfc0873a31b590d280c3e50cac412cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapon screen, with enough materials set to max out the Artian Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapon screen, with enough materials set to max out the Artian Lance I." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0cfc0873a31b590d280c3e50cac412cf" data-recommend-id="image://0cfc0873a31b590d280c3e50cac412cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapon screen, with enough materials set to max out the Artian Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We can still take it one more step after Forging. Choosing the <em>Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapons</em> option in the Smithy menu can increase the power of these new weapons with up to five Reinforcement Bonuses. This process requires materials you gain from Festival Shares or through smelting ore. The only wrinkle is that what you receive is randomly distributed among the following bonuses:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Affinity Boost</li><li>Attack Boost</li><li>Element Boost</li><li>Sharpness Boost</li><li>Ammo Capacity (only for the Bowguns)</li></ul><p>Technically, you can re-roll Reinforcement Bonuses until you have what you need for your dream weapon. There appears to be an internal seed list for these enhancements that are assigned to an Artian Weapon once they’re initially forged. That means you’ll need to forge and reinforce multiple trash weapons, preferably without saving, until you find the best set of bonuses.</p><p>Let’s say you want to make the dream <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapon-the-charge-blade-guide-1851769340">Charge Blade</a></span>, because who wouldn’t? You’ll have to keep maxing out these Artian Weapons until you discover that the sixth weapon will have the stats you want. Now you’ll need to exit without saving and reload your previous save. Forge five of those trash Artian Charge Blades again, and then finally forge your ideal Charge Blade that will pair seamlessly with the perfect Reinforcement Bonuses.</p><p>It’s a tedious process that can require a lot of money and a lot of materials. I would only recommend doing this if you’re super serious about min-maxing your stats. Unless the RNG completely screws you over with the bonuses, most of the time these Artian Weapons will be a beneficial option.</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, every time a new story comes out about how studio in-fighting and corporate favoritism affected the project, it feels like more of a miracle that the fantasy RPG got out the door looking like a classic BioWare game. Mark Darrah, the former executive producer of the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, has released a new YouTube video in which he discusses how a few events in 2017 fundamentally changed the trajectory of the RPG studio and how, according to him, <em>Dragon Age</em> was thrown under the bus in more ways than one during this time.</p><p>Darrah’s 16-minute video runs down how things shifted at BioWare in the months leading up to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-the-kotaku-review-1793496930&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-the-kotaku-review-1793496930"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s</a></span> launch in 2017, a period of change that he calls “the most impactful 12 months” in the studio’s history. In late 2016 Darrah, who had been working on <em>Dragon Age</em>, began instead leading the team that would oversee the closing months of the sci-fi RPG’s development cycle. He explains that his transfer felt like a blow to the <em>Dragon Age </em>team, which was then working on one of the early iterations of the fantasy series’ fourth entry, as Darrah had been a key member of its leadership. However, Darrah thought that by helping ship <em>Andromeda</em>, he could then see the resources dedicated to the game reallocated to help the <em>Dragon Age </em>team develop the fantasy RPG. But unfortunately, that’s not what happened.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Darrah says the short time he spent working on <em>Andromeda</em> didn’t ultimately have much of an impact on <em>Dragon Age</em>’s development, but it did set a precedent establishing that leadership could be moved around within the company, even if they were in the middle of directing something else. This move contributed to a perception that <em>Dragon Age </em>wasn’t a priority within the company.</p><p>Darrah goes on to explain how the relationship between BioWare and EA changed at this time, as the studio started reporting to a different arm of the publisher. Prior to this, BioWare was “strangely” reporting to higher-ups in the company’s sports section, a group which Darrah described as “benignly disinterested,” allowing the studio to work more autonomously. Then, when things shifted in 2017, BioWare started reporting to a branch of EA that was “hyper interested” in the decision-making process. According to Darrah, this change in leadership was likely part of why the studio moved on from <em>Andromeda </em>so quickly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bioware-confirms-no-dlc-for-mass-effect-andromeda-1798069090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-confirms-no-dlc-for-mass-effect-andromeda-1798069090">canceling the game’s planned DLC</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-montreal-downsized-mass-effect-put-on-1795100285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-montreal-downsized-mass-effect-put-on-1795100285">putting the sci-fi series on ice</a></span>.</p><p>“The group that we reported into had very little stake in either the success or the failure of [<em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>], and they had a lot more incentive for BioWare to move on to the next thing that they could tie themselves to and show themselves as having influence on the development of,” Darrah said.</p><p>As BioWare geared up for the next game, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">much-maligned looter shooter <em>Anthem</em></a></span>, Darrah says he received “assurances” from EA and BioWare leadership that <em>Dragon Age</em> was important to the company, but not the kinds of developers and resources that would back those statements up. And it was all made a lot more complicated by the return of ex-<em>Mass Effect </em>director Casey Hudson, who rejoined the company as its general manager in 2017. Darrah says he learned about Hudson’s return at the same time as the rest of the company, despite being a senior member of BioWare’s leadership team. He says he considered the decision to bring Hudson back without consulting him a sign of “an immense amount of disrespect,” and he sent emails shortly after the announcement that said he expected Hudson would make a call to “starve” <em>Dragon Age</em> of resources as the studio went all-hands-on-deck on <em>Anthem</em>. Darrah was once again reassured by leadership that <em>Dragon Age</em> was important to the company and that they were committed to him leading the project.</p><p>“As we all know, that’s not what happened at all,” Darrah says. “In very short order, in basically exactly the way that I predicted, <em>Anthem</em> was seen as needing greater leadership support, and myself and some other very senior people, and a large percentage of the <em>Dragon Age</em> team, was moved onto <em>Anthem</em>.”</p><p>This was followed by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-montreal-downsized-mass-effect-put-on-1795100285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-montreal-downsized-mass-effect-put-on-1795100285">scaling down of BioWare’s Montreal studio</a></span>, which saw many staff members moved to other teams across the EA umbrella. Darrah says that the Montreal team had “basically been lied to” and were told that the <em>Dragon Age</em> team “didn’t want” them. He also claims that he was trying to get the next <em>Dragon Age</em> past a certain development threshold which he hoped might allow him to retain those developers, but EA higher-ups who were local in Montreal wanted those people, and “proximity is a powerful tool.”</p><p>“If you are someone who’s been mad at me since 2017 because you feel like I abandoned you in Montreal, know that that’s not what happened,” Darrah says. “Know that I fought with every tool that I knew how to wield to try and keep you, but the organization had no interest in that occurring.”</p><p>Whatever the circumstances, Darrah says EA wasn’t interested in helping the <em>Dragon Age</em> team grow; it wanted <em>Anthem</em> to get off the ground and be a huge live-service hit for the company. Darrah hypothesizes that, at this point, management pivoted the <em>Dragon Age </em>project <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351">into the now-scrapped live-service game</a></span> as a “rationalization” for removing many members of the team and putting them to work on <em>Anthem</em>. Now that the next <em>Dragon Age </em>was going back to the drawing board, it could be argued that the project didn’t need that big of a team in its early production stages. The move also resulted in a longer “leadership discontinuity,” as Darrah worked on <em>Anthem </em>until the game shipped in 2019.</p><p>“I talked a fairly long time ago about how EA buys studios and then consumes them and they start to lose their culture into the overall EA culture,” Darrah said. “To me, it feels like 2017 is when EA finished digesting BioWare, which they had bought nine years earlier in 2008.”</p><p>Darrah acknowledges that much of his story might sound like a series of events that affected him personally rather than the studio at large, but a handful of ex-BioWare employees have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lojswdjt2k2l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lojswdjt2k2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared the video on social media</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/joberry.bsky.social/post/3lojt2sh3rs2m&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/joberry.bsky.social/post/3lojt2sh3rs2m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corroborated</a></span> the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lokc3rbmrc25&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lokc3rbmrc25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events described</a></span>.
