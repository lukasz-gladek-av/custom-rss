            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-mod-adds-real-elevators-with-no-loading-screen/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Starfield mod succeeds where the base game couldn't, adding real elevators with no loading screen to Bethesda's sci-fi roleplaying game. Modder EdgiestSwing23 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10904?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> it this week on Nexus Mods, though it should be clarified that the mod only covers some of the elevators found in Starfield.</p>
<p><em>Replaced a total of 18 elevators at 15 locations, making them truly movable elevators without the need for loading. </em><em>The elevator is induction type, which means that when you approach the elevator door, the elevator will automatically come to your floor and open the door without you having to press a button. </em><em>However, the elevator buttons are still retained to prevent accidents. </em><em>The locations of these elevators are:</em></p>
<p><em>Starlight Lounge</em><br>
<em>Two elevators outside Neon City</em><br>
<em>Two elevators at Star Key Station</em><br>
<em>New Home Tower Elevator</em><br>
<em>Rl039world (unknown location, untested)</em><br>
<em>Upper and Lower Elevators in the New Asia Business District</em><br>
<em>Jieneng Dai Group</em><br>
<em>Embassy of New Yawalu</em><br>
<em>UCVigilance</em><br>
<em>Main elevator of Earth colonization spacecraft</em><br>
<em>Earth Colony Spaceship Security Room Elevator</em><br>
<em>Earth Colony Spaceship Classroom - Cafeteria Elevator</em><br>
<em>DR011world (unknown location, untested)</em><br>
<em>RL036world (unknown location, untested)</em><br>
<em>RL010World (unknown location, untested)</em></p>
<p>The author shared his method of creating fully working elevators. As such, others might add more of them to this Starfield mod, which could eventually lead to covering the entire game.</p>
<p>The Starfield modding scene continues to flourish following the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> of mod tools in early June. The game itself is also about to be improved with the addition of land vehicles (a leaked video <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-land-vehicles-shown-in-leaked-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared</a> recently on Twitter) and the upcoming Shattered Space story expansion. Moreover, Bethesda recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> a 'Starborn' trademark. This could hint at the title of a second expansion, given that Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> a while ago of annual expansions coming to the RPG for a while, in what would be the strongest post-launch support for a Bethesda single player game yet.</p>

            <p>It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ep9bq9/let_the_bots_advance_let_the_super_earth_burn">Multiplayer</a> shooty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.</p>
<p>“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns," reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ep9bq9/let_the_bots_advance_let_the_super_earth_burn">post titled</a> “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/frustrated-with-the-nerfs-helldivers-2-grunts-are-protesting-by-letting-the-bots-take-super-earth-and-theyre-dangerously-close-to-succeeding/">via Gamesradar</a>.</p>
<p>Whether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.</p>

<p>“In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update. Some things we just didn’t get right - and other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction,” <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game">reads the post</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/08/arrowhead-unveils-60-day-plan-to-placate-rebellious-helldivers-2-fans">PushSquare</a>. “ All of that is on us and we are going to own that.  As many of you have pointed out, and we agree, what matters most now is action. Not talk.”</p>
<p>Said action, promises Arrowhead, will take the form of the following bullet-pointed agenda. Is there a gag about the bullets not even being able to make points any more due to nerfs? Probably. That’d be stupid though, so I’m just going to lampshade that I think it’s stupid while still basically making the very same gag. In the biz, this is known as "having your cake and gagging on it". Here’s Arrowhead’s plan over the next 60 days:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Continue to re-examine our approach to balance. Our intention is that balance should be fun, not “balanced” for the sake of balance.</li>
<li>Update how the fire damage mechanic works to tweak how the flamethrower serves as a close range support weapon. (A quick straight revert won’t work, as it would break other things)</li>
<li>Rework gameplay to prevent excessive ragdolling</li>
<li>Re-think our design approach to primary weapons and create a plan for making combat more engaging</li>
<li>Re-prioritize bug fixes so that the more immediate  gameplay-impacting bugs are prioritized.</li>
<li>Improve game performance (frame rate is a focus)</li>
<li>Rework Chargers</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, from a bigger picture perspective we will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring creation of an opt-in beta-test environment to improve our testing processes and we consider this a high-priority.</li>
<li>Post regular player surveys to gather more insights and feedback from the community.</li>
<li>Improve our process for patch/release notes - providing more context and reasoning behind changes.</li>
<li>More blog posts and streams where we expand on these topics for those interested.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The flamethrower item seems to be the sticking point for the community here - it’s where a lot of the hubbub is centred, particularly since it’s now far less effective against Chargers. I can see the issue here. Chargers are rapidly able to throw a game into chaos if not dealt with quickly, especially in big numbers on higher difficulty levels. It’s also understandable that both the community and Arrowhead themselves would be feeling a bit of fatigue over balancing woes. Back in May, former CEO-turned-creative-director Johan Pilestedt said he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-balancing-has-been-removing-the-fun-arrowhead-ceo-frets-just-tweaking-damage-numbers-is-a-blunt-tool">thought Arrowhead has “gone too far” in some areas</a>. "Will talk to the team about the approach to balance. It feels like every time someone finds something fun, the fun is removed." Helldivers 2 can be a glorious time, so I do hope it manages to reach an equilibrium everyone’s happy with.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Finding and sharing Free Stuff is one of the time-honoured duties of the video game journalist or SEO-monger. Back when I was OXM's online editor, "free Xbox games" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being "Minecraft Xbox 360 update" and "Skyrim something something". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lovely-free-lovecraftian-first-person-parkourer-grimhook-to-become-a-complete-game">Grimhook</a>.</p>
<p>Do not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3139620/Frontline_Crisis/">a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis</a>. Hah, that'll keep the awareness of steady livelihood erosion at bay.</p><!--more-->
<p>The addition of the tab follows <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191">a series of changes</a> to how demos work on Steam in July. You might have noticed that you can now add them to your library without immediately installing them, and that you can install them even if you own the full game ("primarily, this will make it easier for developers to test demos," say Valve). </p>
<p>Developers can now give demos their own store pages, though adding a demo button to the full game's store page is still an option. This means that players can leave user reviews for them, as with full free or free-to-play games. Valve have also made changes to the Steam homepage so that demos appear in the New &amp; Trending and New on Steam charts, together with tag and category pages. Going by forum chatter, this latter move has created a logjam of demos and free-to-play games in amongst the full-priced releases, which may be why popular free games now have their own tab.</p>
<p>Given that these are free games, of course, it's likely the tab will have a quality control problem, with grifty experiences such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game">that Banana game </a>hogging the feed. Still, it's a convenient addition for people who have not yet learned the <a href="https://steamdb.info/tag/21491/?min_reviews=500">mighty ways of SteamDB</a>. Or bookmarked our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/free-games">free games page</a>.</p>
<p>In more businessy news, Valve have also announced that they're <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836">cracking down on links to other websites on Steam store pages</a>. As Brendy observed when he handed me this particular news gobbet, Valve seem irked that lots of game pages basically exist to redirect to and promote other games by the same developer or publisher. With one hand they giveth, etc.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-airdrops-bosses/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has added another cryptic image to social media showcasing the next Tarkov pre-wipe event. It’s another typical showing, revealing that airdrops will become much more common while the game’s bosses are being pulled together onto the same map. </p>



<p>This is nothing we’ve not seen before, which is another stab of disappointment for fans holding out for something unique. We’ve already seen the Flea Market locked down, high-value loot spawns increased, skill levelling boosted, and Hideout upgrades accelerated, but nothing ‘fresh’ has appeared as we approach the 0.15 patch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dive-in">Dive In</h2>



<p>These are events that have surfaced in Escape from Tarkov before.</p>



<p>First, airdrops will become so common that they’ll seem non-stop, with planes flying over every map and dropping stacks of high-end loot for players to fight over. Then, all bosses will appear on the same map at the same time. This is something we’ve seen before in Tarkov, and the last time it happened, the bosses all loaded in on Customs at the same time.</p>



<p>It creates a nightmare scenario for players wanting to take it a little easier, but it’s pre-wipe, so they’ll just need to deal with it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s worth stressing that these events don’t apply to PvE-exclusive players. As PvE doesn’t follow a traditional ‘wipe’ pattern, it isn’t susceptible to these events. Therefore, it’s business as usual for anyone <strong>not </strong>playing PvP or ‘typical’ Tarkov.</p>



<p>Presently, we’re not sure which map the bosses are spawning on – we’re working to confirm that now.</p>



<p>Are you enjoying the pre-wipe schedule leading up to patch 0.15 being deployed?</p>

<p>Riot Games has just revealed a new cosmetics pack coming to Valorant called the Wonderstallion bundle, and fans have been quick to point out that it’s something ripped clean from Fortnite. It’s a gaudy, unicorn-themed set bursting at the seams with bright colours and rainbow effects, and it’s splitting the community down the centre.</p>



<p>Many are impressed with how cute and attractive the Wonderstallion skins are, while others are ranting that it’s an aesthetic best left to the likes of Fortnite. It’s deeply reminiscent of Fortnite’s iconic Llama in some respects.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-valorant-wonderstallion-bundle-coming-out">When Is The Valorant Wonderstallion Bundle Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Riot Games showcased the new Wonderstallion bundle on social media but neglected to provide a release date. However, the expectation is that the bundle will arrive with the 9.03 update that’s being rolled out <strong>now</strong>. If not, it’ll likely be released within the next week or two.</p>



<p>For now, Riot Games has simply labelled it as ‘available soon’.</p>



<p>Here’s a clip of the Wonderstallion bundle in action:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the image, it looks like we’ll be getting a Wonderstallion skin for the Vandal, Guardian, Spectre, Frenzy, and of course, a Melee variant. It looks like it’ll also come with a Buddy as part of the bundle.</p>



<p>It has been estimated that the bundle will cost around 3,400 Valorant Points, but each weapon should be made available individually for around 850 Points. </p>



<p>Are you going to invest in the Wonderstallion bundle in Valorant?</p>

<p>It has been claimed that Valorant is getting a sorely needed update in the anti-toxicity stakes. For the longest time, Valorant has been a minefield for gamers worldwide, and the in-match communications systems are typically flooded with insults, derogatory comments, and abuse.</p>



<p>Now, in the latest bid to tackle that toxicity, Riot Games is reportedly preparing to roll out a ‘Black List’ feature in the game. This claim comes mere months after Riot Games overhauled Valorant’s guidelines in an effort to push more toxic players off of the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-black-list-in-valorant">What Is The ‘Black List’ in Valorant?</h2>



<p>Per the claims on social media from <a href="https://x.com/ValorantUpdated/status/1823462571078230241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Valorant Updates</a>, the team at Riot is preparing to roll out the ‘Black List’ feature, which is a fancy name for a blocking mechanic. It seems bizarre that this doesn’t already exist, but we’ll chalk it up to it having been an oversight by Riot Games for the last four years.</p>



<p>It has been suggested that the Black List in Valorant would allow players to block and restrict other users, preventing them from messaging them, speaking to them in any way, or from sending them friend requests through the platform.</p>



<p>It’s good, but many players were quick to point out that a better feature would be an ‘Avoid Player’ mechanic. When you add a player to that list, you’ll never be matched with them again, essentially. </p>



<p>That’s a much more effective way to avoid malicious players, but perhaps that’s the next step for Riot Games.</p>



<p>Have you ever come up against toxic players in Valorant? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/replaced-pushed-back-to-2025-to-%E2%80%98meet-high-standards%E2%80%99.952620/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has just been revealed that REPLACED, the upcoming ‘retro-futuristic cinematic platformer’, has been delayed and pushed back to 2025. The last we saw of REPLACED was at Summer Games Fest, and despite the lengthy delay, the team at Sad Cat Studios has confirmed that it’ll still be playable at Gamescom.</p>



<p>This Xbox- and PC-exclusive 2.5D platformer looks solid on the surface, offering up a unique story that’s somewhat similar to Cyberpunk 2077 at first blush. It’s far from being the first time the game has been delayed, though. The announce trailer stated it would be released in 2022, but that was then updated to 2023, then 2024, and now, it has been pushed into 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cyberpunk-but-sideways">Cyberpunk But Sideways</h2>



<p>In the announcement trailer that was dropped more than three years ago, players are introduced to the world of REPLACED. It offers up a slick and high-intensity take on the 2.5D platformer paradigm, boasting immense lighting, fantastic depth-of-field mechanics, and smooth, fluid animations.</p>



<p>The core story of REPLACED unfolds in a dystopian, almost post-apocalyptic setting, with players assuming control of an AI trapped in the body of a human against its will. That’s where the Cyberpunk 2077 vibe starts to surface. The story unravels in ‘Phoenix City’, which has been twisted and torn by an ever-degrading societal standard.</p>



<p>Here’s the first trailer for REPLACED:</p>

<p>It looks really good, even if it’s not the type of game I’d typically play. I’ll pick it up for the aesthetic and the fluidity of the thing. It’s just a shame that it has now been delayed <strong>again</strong>. In <a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103">a st</a><a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a</a><a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103">tement</a>, the team said, ‘We need more time to meet the high standards we’ve set for ourselves and to meet the expectations of our fans.’</p>



<p>Are you excited about REPLACED eventually being released?</p>

<p>XDefiant continues to develop since being released by Ubisoft on May 21. Today, the 1.4 patch rolls out, with the notes recognising that it’s mostly targeting a few bug fixes and tweaking out some glitches. Ubisoft is also adding some new cosmetics bundles and implementing a minor range of quality-of-life improvements, so it’s not all that key an update.</p>



<p>As these patches are deployed, it’s no big secret that with each passing one, the XDefiant player count is dwindling. On social and streaming platforms, the sentiment around the first-person shooter is growing stale and people are simply losing interest in the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-xdefiant-s-1-4-patch">What’s In XDefiant’s 1.4 Patch?</h2>



<p>It’s a simple assortment of things in the latest patch to hit the XDefiant platform.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has addressed a series of bugs impacting challenge progress, in-game stats, and a certain glitch in Zone Control that would almost automatically award the attacking team the win in a few seconds. In the patch notes, the team addressed this particular bug as ‘weird’.</p>



<p>The bulkiest part of <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/xdefiant/news/5rzufG2wP1rEr3jriHRkrb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the patch notes</a> is around weapons, with Ubisoft having tweaked the M44, the TAC-50, and the L115, increasing their overall spread and making the game’s assortment of sniper rifles less overpowered. To put it simply, it now means that players will need to be ‘fully scoped in’ to reliably land kills with a sniper rifle. </p>



<p>The team also addressed issues with ‘magnet’ sticky grenades and tweaked some issues with the in-game reporting system.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but with the player count dropping with each passing day, fewer people are around to soak up the benefits of these changes. When it was released, XDefiant soared, but the buzz quickly dropped off, and within a matter of weeks, the free-to-play first-person shooter had all but passed out of relevance.</p>



<p>If we use the <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/780302568">numbers from Twitch</a> as a representative example, we can see that the all-time high peak viewer count of 203,000 has dwindled this month to just 8,000 – and it continues to decrease. </p>



<p>It’s part and parcel of a new release and we can expect that, but this game will only survive with a healthy player base, and that presents a huge concern.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, that’s not a typo. </p>



<p>I’ve recently jumped into the alpha for Delta Force: Hawk Ops, and to give the game credit, I’ve been having a <strong>blast</strong>. For an alpha, it’s remarkably well-built, and the team at TiMi Studio has gone so far as to introduce some live service elements even though this is just a testing period.</p>



<p>However, I can’t get away from the fact that it feels like I’m playing Battlefield 2042. From the maps and modes to UI and the ‘specialist’ characters, and from the land, sea, and air combat model to the core mechanics, <strong>everything</strong> feels like a Battlefield game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-unique-enough">Not Unique Enough</h2>



<p>I’ll be frank – Delta Force: Hawk Ops has <strong>serious </strong>potential. I’ve had more fun playing this than most other shooters that have emerged in the last few years. It looks fantastic, it runs well, and everything from the weapons to the characters feels solid and well thought out. It would be great if it didn’t look like a re-skinned Battlefield 2042, though.</p>



<p>Those familiar with EA’s most recent Battlefield game will look at some of these screenshots and believe it’s 2042’s menu:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It gets a little bizarre – even the choice of font, the colour palette, and the iconography look like Battlefield 2042’s aesthetic. One of the main game modes sees attacking teams attempt to capture objectives while defending teams try to hold them back, which is a mirror copy of Battlefield’s fan-favourite ‘Breakthrough’ mode.</p>



<p>TiMi Studio has tried to implement some innovative and unique features in Delta Force: Hawk Ops and there’s a campaign section on the way that’ll allow players to walk through the events of ‘Black Hawk Down’, so it’s not a like-for-like replication – but it’s damn close.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-worth-playing">Is Delta Force Worth Playing?</h2>



<p>Like I said, I’m having a great time playing Delta Force: Hawk Ops, and I’m particularly enjoying the extraction shooter mode that feels like a trip down memory lane into DMZ, Call of Duty’s failed extraction shooter mode. It’s essentially the same thing, introducing an ‘easier’ and more ‘arcade’ extraction shooter experience that’ll sit well with more casual gamers.</p>



<p>In Delta Force, the gunplay feels satisfying, weapon customisation is slick, and the line-up of specialists is diverse enough that they each stand apart from one another. I’m a particular fan of Luna, an agile character who wields a bow capable of firing ‘recon arrows’ or electrified shots. </p>



<p>It feels good, it looks good, and it’s free to play. It’ll inevitably be bolstered by a slew of microtransactions, season passes, and cosmetics bundles, but that’s the way of the world. In the absence of a new Battlefield game and the death of Call of Duty’s DMZ, Delta Force: Hawk Ops could be just what the gaming world needs, even if it is a mirror image of those very games. </p>

                <p>The massive world of Warhammer 40,000 has seen a whole lot of adaptations into video games, covering genres from third- and first-person shooters to turn-based strategy.

It took a decade for that dream to evolve into the company's own internally developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> gaming handheld, but the original dream isn't dead. </p><p>The company's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#">long said</a> it plans to let other companies use SteamOS, too — and that means explicitly supporting the rival Asus ROG Ally gaming handheld, Valve designer Lawrence Yang now confirms to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>A few days ago, some spotted an intriguing line <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018">in Valve's latest SteamOS release notes</a>: “Added support for extra ROG Ally keys.” We didn't know Valve was supporting any ROG Ally keys at all, let alone extras! </p><p>Maybe Valve was just supporting those keys in the Steam desktop client on a Windows, where it offers a Steam Deck-like Big Picture Mode interface for any PC, and the line mistakenly made it into these patch notes? I asked to be safe.</p><p>But no: this is indeed about Valve eventually supporting the ROG Ally and other rival handhelds! </p><p>"The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS," Yang tells me. </p><p>That doesn't mean Asus will officially bless Valve's installer or sell the Ally with SteamOS, of course. (Asus has told me there are many reasons why it ships with Windows; a big one is that Microsoft has dedicated validation teams that ensure its operating system works across many different hardware configurations and chips.) </p><p>And it's not like Valve is suggesting it'll offer SteamOS for rival handhelds anytime soon, either. Valve is “making steady progress,” Yang tells me, but it “isn’t ready to run out of the box yet.”</p><p>We already knew Valve plans a general release of SteamOS 3 that you can theoretically install on non-handheld PCs as well; Yang says it's similarly making progress there but it's not ready quite yet. </p><p>So that's the update on turning Windows handhelds into Steam Machines; what about Valve's promise to let you turn Steam Decks into dual-booting Windows machines too, letting you swap between the two OS at will? Here's Yang on that:</p><div><blockquote><p>As for Windows, we’re preparing to make the remaining Windows drivers for Steam Deck OLED available (you might have seen that we are prepping firmware for the Bluetooth driver). There’s no update on the timing for dual boot support—it’s still a priority, but we haven’t been able to get to it just yet. </p></blockquote></div><p>Valve isn't the only one adapting its compelling combination of Linux and controller-friendly Steam UI to Windows handhelds. Universal Blue touted that its Bazzite operating system had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/bazzite-linux-36-out-now-bringing-full-asus-rog-ally-x-support/">already achieved support for the Asus ROG Ally X</a> before it even came out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The discount will then automatically apply during checkout.</p><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine takes the basic conceit of the Space Marine video games--a lone Space Marine facing down overwhelming hordes of Tyranid aliens--and turns it into a two-player board game with rules based on the original 40K tabletop wargame. One player controls the Space Marine Lieutenant Titus of the Ultramarines Chapter, and the other commands an army of Tyranids in asymmetric matches that last around 30 minutes. The box includes a grid-based playmat, rulebook, dice, ruler, one Lieutenant Titus miniature, and 22 Tyranids. Each miniature comes unassembled and unpainted just like in standard Warhammer 40,000 tabletop sets, giving new players a taste of what it's like to build and customize their own army. The minis are also compatible with the standard Warhammer 40K tabletop game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349720" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349720"></a><figcaption>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine: The Board Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349720-spacemarinehero.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349721,1300-4349722,1300-4349723,1300-4349724" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349721-sm1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349722-sm2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349723-sm3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4349724-sm2b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While this deal is an excellent chance to grab Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine and dip into the world of Warhammer tabletop, several other board games are also eligible for the 20% Target Circle discount, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fstar-wars-villainous-board-game%2F-%2FA-85017096&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars Villainous</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-villainous-introduction-to-evil-board-game-disney-100-edition%2F-%2FA-87884715&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Villainous</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Favalon-hill-betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-3rd-edition-game%2F-%2FA-85008832&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-space-marine-board-game-is-only-32-ahead-of-space-marine-2s-launch%2F1100-6525773%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Betrayal At House On The Hill</a>, and more.

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> came out over a decade ago, exploring underground was already spooky, but it was pretty monotonous; lava and the rare diamond block were the most exciting things to see. Nowadays, though, heading underground is a much more exciting experience. Caves are far more varied and interesting, and there are even deep-buried Ancient Cities to loot--if you can avoid the Warden.</p><p dir="ltr">There are dozens of biome types and subtypes aboveground, but below ground you'll find fewer biomes and more danger.</p><p><strong>Note: This guide focuses on the Bedrock version of Minecraft, available on Windows 10, Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and mobile.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Dripstone Caves</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349781" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349781"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349781-minecraft-1-18-dripstone-caves.jpg"></figure><p>Dripstone caves are, as the name suggests, full of dripstone stalactites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmites crawling up from the floor. Dripstone is useful for a variety of applications, like a self-replicating lava farm, and can be used as spikes to damage players and mobs. Copper spawns in comparatively large amounts in dripstone caves.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lush Caves</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349780"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349780-minecraft-1-18-lush-caves.jpg"></figure><p>Lush caves are a stunning addition to Minecraft's subterranean world. For a long time, Minecraft caves all kind of looked the same--stone for ages, with little patches of desirable blocks like iron ore and diamonds scattered about. Lush caves, however, are packed with plant life. They're covered by moss blocks, moss carpet, azalea bushes, grass, and flowers on the ground. From above, you can find glowberries--both a fruit <em>and</em> a source of light--along with vines and spore blossoms. Shallow ponds generate with dripleaf plants and, sometimes, axlotls.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Deep Dark</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png" data-ref-id="1300-4349782" data-ratio="0.52552083333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png" data-ref-id="1300-4349782"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4349782-minecraft-1-19-ancient-city-full.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deep Dark caves are where things get scary. These dark caves generate mostly in the layers where stone turns to deepslate. You'll find sculk sensors and shriekers, which can summon wardens. The Deep Dark is also where Ancient Cities spawn, and are a source of enchanted golden apples and a rare music disc, among other treasures. No mobs aside from wardens spawn here, but wardens can kill you nearly instantly even when you're fully armored in Netherite, so take care when exploring this biome.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> has acknowledged <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>'s recent Escalation of Freedom update "didn't hit [its] target" following significant criticism from the community, and it's detailed the steps its taking to address core areas of complaint over the next 60 days.
</p>
<p>
Helldivers 2's latest round of community unrest followed the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-announced-with-higher-difficulty-new-bugs-and-more">last week's major Escalation of Freedom update</a>, which featured headline additions including new mission objectives and enemies. However, it's some under-the-hood balance tinkering that's proven particularly controversial, with nerfs to the popular FLAM-40 flamethrower - which has significantly reduced its effectiveness against Chargers - drawing considerable ire.
</p>
<p>
Various senior team members have already acknowledged player feedback - Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani drew parallels with a similarly unpopular balance update released in April (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-we-need-to-do-better-after-incendiary-response-to-flamethrower-nerfs-in-helldivers-2-me-just-talking-about-it-isn-t-enough-actions-matter/">PC Gamer</a>), confirming the studio was already discussing "what we can do to avoid this situation again" - but now the developer is ready to offer a more formalised plan of attack.

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/">post shared on Reddit</a>, Helldivers 2 game director Mikael Eriksson wrote, "We've spent the last week listening to feedback, reflecting about the path ahead for Helldivers 2 and how we want to continue developing the game. In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update." Eriksson added the studio sees two sorts of issues it wants to address: "some things we just didn't get right" and "other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction."
</p>
<p>
"All of that is on us and we are going to own that," he continued. "As many of you have pointed out, and we agree, what matters most now is action. Not talk."
</p>
<p>
To that end, Eriksson shared the studio's plan for the next 60 days, which will begin with an examination of its approach to balance. "Our intention is that balance should be fun," he explained, "not 'balanced' for the sake of balance." Arrowhead will also update the flamethrower's "fire damage mechanic" to tweak how it works as a close-range support weapon, but Eriksson stressed, "A quick straight revert won't work, as it would break other things".
</p>
<p>
Then, moving onto other complaints stemming from last week's Escalation of Freedom update, Arrowhead will rework gameplay to prevent excessive rag dolling, rethink its approach to primary weapons and "create a plan for making combat more engaging", reprioritise bug fixes so those impacting gameplay are addressed first, improve game performance, and rework Chargers.
</p>
<p>
The studio is also looking to establish an opt-in beta test environment as a "high priority" to improve its testing processes, and it'll be posting regular player surveys to gather more insight and feedback. Additionally, it wants to improve communication with players - providing more context for changes in its patch notes, and sharing more blog posts and streams to expand on those topics. "We also want to thank you for your patience," Eriksson added. "We're grateful that so many of you provided constructive feedback and suggestions on the latest update.
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead's decision to rethink its approach to balancing follows comments made by Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt back in May. "I think we've gone too far in some areas," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">told players</a>. "It feels like every time someone finds something fun, the fun is removed." Hopefully, the studio's new commitment to balancing will help it avoid falling into a similarly unpopular trap a third time around.

Or was I waiting for<em> Don’t Breathe</em> to come out, and I was playing the game. That’s why, at the time, I was like, ‘Fuck, if I could do anything, I would love to do <em>Alien </em>and scare the audience again with that creature and those environments.’ I was playing, and realizing how terrifying <em>Alien </em>could be if you take it back to that tone.”</p><h2 id="h102555"><a id=""></a>Save Stations from <em>Alien: Isolation</em> appear regularly in <em>Romulus</em></h2><p>However, <em>Isolation </em>didn’t just inspire Alvarez to make a new, scary <em>Alien </em>movie. The survival horror game is also directly referenced in the film in a neat detail involving <em>Isolation’s </em>save stations, which appear as emergency phones dotted around the game. Players have to stop what they are doing, walk up to one, and activate it to save their game. As such, these are important devices that tend to appear in areas where you might get attacked or killed. And Alvarez did something similar in the movie. </p><p> “The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see [an emergency] phone,” the <em>Romulus </em>director and co-writer explained. </p><p>“In the game, every time you knew there’s a phone you’d go, ‘Fuck, I’m about to go into some bad set-piece.’ It’s the same thing here. You’ll see they’re planted strategically throughout the film. When you see the phone, it’s like: Brace for impact.” </p><p><em>Alien: Romulus</em> arrives in theaters on August 16. I’ll be watching out for emergency phones and preparing to scream. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/maschinen-mensch-reveals-multiplayer-platformer-mother-machine/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maschinen-mensch-reveals-multiplayer-platformer-mother-machine.952428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/maschinen-mensch-reveals-multiplayer-platformer-mother-machine/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Maschinen-Mensch, an indie developer studio behind Curious Expedition and Curious Expedition 2, has unveiled its latest project. The game is titled<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1555980/Mother_Machine/"> Mother Machine</a> and is shaping up to be a chaotic, multiplayer action-platformer roguelike with RPG elements sprinkled in.</p>
<p>The game features vibrant backgrounds and creatures, with chaotic goblins that you get to play as and a wild, defective robot mother of the gremlins, and it all comes together in procedurally generated co-op action.</p>
<p>Mother Machine has been built in <a href="https://wccftech.com/halloween-getting-unreal-engine-5-game-john-carpenter-involved/">Unreal Engine 5</a>&nbsp;and aims to push the limits of procedurally generated content in gaming. This game is a one-to-four-player co-op action-platformer that features many RPG elements in the cave networks of a derelict space colony.</p>
<p>The players can play the game by taking control of the "chaos gremlins," who are continuously sent to their deaths only to be revived repeatedly by their malfunctioning robot mother. The aim is to scour for resources and new technology and find the answers to the darkest mysteries of the planet they reside on.</p>
<p>To add extra depth to the game play of the gremlins, players can mutate their gremlin, giving them access to a wide range of abilities to help them survive longer in the cave system. These mutations can also help change the game's difficulty, allowing players to choose their play style.</p>
<p>The game will feature easy drop-in features so that players can join others at any given time, regardless of what they are doing in-game. Joining the game adds to the chaos and competition between players.</p>
<p>Mother Machine is designed to be highly replayable, with players able to experience heartfelt moments with satisfying progression.</p>
<p>In response to the announcement, Maschinen-Mensch CEO Riad Djmelli said, "At Maschinen-Mensch, crafting games with innovative procedural gameplay is in our DNA. Following the success of Curious Expedition 1 and 2, our team has grown to over 20 very talented individuals. Now, we're excited to bring our approach to the action-RPG genre with our new IP, Mother Machine. We can't wait to share this new adventure with our community."</p>
<p><iframe title="Mother Machine Announcement Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPUI2ihP6pE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Maschinen-Mensch is highly successful, selling over 500,000 copies of Curious Expedition across all platforms. Johannes Kristmann and Riad Djmelli founded this studio in 2014, and their shared studio space is in Berlin.</p>
<p>At the moment, Mother Machine doesn't have a release date, but as the Steam store page states, it will tentatively release in Q1 2025.</p>

<p>After a 14-year journey of various states of availability and usefulness amid the shifting policies of Apple's App Store approval process, MS-DOS game emulator iDOS is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/idos-3/id1580768213">back</a> on the iPhone and iPad. It's hopefully here to stay this time.</p>
<p>iDOS allows you to run applications made for MS-DOS via DOSBox, with a nice retro-styled interface. Its main use case is definitely playing DOS games, but it has seen a rocky road to get to this point. Initially released over a decade ago, it existed quietly for its niche audience, though it saw some changes that made it more or less useful in the developer's quest to avoid removal from the App Store after it violated Apple's rules. That culminated in it being removed altogether in 2021 after some tweets and articles brought attention to it.</p>
<p>But earlier this year, Apple made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/">big changes</a> to its App Store rules, officially allowing "retro game emulators" for the first time. That cleared the way for a wave of working console game emulators like Delta and RetroArch, which mostly work as you might expect them to on any other platform now. But when iDOS developer Chaoji Li and other purveyors of classic PC emulator software attempted to do the same for old PC games for MS-DOS and other non-console computing platforms, they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/apple-rejects-pc-emulators-on-the-ios-app-store/">were stymied</a>. Apple told them that it didn't consider their apps to be retro game console emulators and that they violated rules intended to prevent people from circumventing the App Store by running applications from other sources.
</p><p>PC emulator UTM released a version of its software that worked around Apple's rules, but it was a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/apples-restrictions-hold-back-the-first-pc-emulator-on-the-ios-app-store/">subpar experience</a>. But on August 2, Apple amended its App Store rules to explicitly allow emulators of classic PC games. That opened the door for iDOS, which has made its triumphant return and works quite well.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Developer Chaoji Li's <a href="https://litchie.com/2024/08/idos3-approved">announcement</a> of iDOS 3's availability didn't have a tone of triumph to it, though—more like exhaustion, given the app's struggles over the years:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been a long wait for common sense to prevail within Apple. As much as I want to celebrate, I still can't help being a little bit cautious about the future. Are we good from now on?</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/idos-3/id1580768213">Get iDOS3 on AppStore</a></p>
<p>I hope iDOS can now enjoy its turn to stay and grow.</p>
<p>P.S. Even though words feel inadequate at times, I would like to say thank you to the supporters of iDOS. In many ways, you keep iDOS alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Apple's policy changes were driven by regulatory concerns, it seems likely it'll stick this time, but after everything that's happened, you can't blame Li for putting a question mark on this.</p>
<p>In any case, if you're among the dozens (or maybe several hundred) of people looking to play <em>Commander Keen</em>,&nbsp;<em>Might and Magic: The World of Xeen</em>, <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, or <em>Jill of the Jungle</em> on your iPhone, today is your day.</p>

<p>One of the most electrifying fixtures at IEM Cologne has just wrapped up, with FaZe Clan pulling out one of the most dizzying reverse sweeps against Team Liquid that we’ve seen in years. It looked awry for FaZe Clan on Mirage, with Team Liquid securing a massive 11 – 1 lead, but as the match pushed on, FaZe Clan exploded.</p>



<p>Just like that, the team was able to pull off a full reverse sweep, with Team Liquid managing to secure just one more round before the game entered Overtime at 12 – 12. FaZe Clan refused to relent, netting a further four rounds to win the map and push Team Liquid out of IEM Cologne.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stunning-performance">Stunning Performance</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan went on one hell of a run to secure qualification into the playoffs. From the upper bracket, FaZe Clan beat Team Liquid once but was sent packing into the lower run by Vitality, who would later qualify for the playoffs. </p>



<p>In the lower bracket, FaZe Clan forcefully ejected Team Falcons – currently the number-one organisation at the Esports World Cup – before dispatching Team Liquid once again.</p>



<p>The numbers ended up <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/181396/liquid-vs-faze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">looking sharp for FaZe Clan</a>, but most particularly for ropz, who picked up the accolades for the best overall rating, the most kills, and the most damage. </p>



<p>It was tough watching FaZe Clan get rinsed so many times in quick succession, but the team remained resilient and pulled off a beautiful reverse sweep worthy of a tournament champion.</p>



<p>Now, FaZe Clan enters the playoffs along with MOUZ, G2, NAVI, Vitality, and SAW. There’s still the matter of the $1 million prize pool on the line, and the winner of this event will net $400,000 of that <strong>plus </strong>qualification to IEM Katowice 2025 <strong>and </strong>the BLAST Premier World Final.</p>



<p>FaZe has been running a little cold lately, having secured IEM Chengdu in April but nothing else going back to November 2023. Could this be another IEM win for the squad?</p>

It’s a message that sees Arrowhead acknowledging player frustrations, as it promises to focus on “action. Not talk,” when it comes to Helldivers 2’s future.</p><p>“We’ve spent the last week listening to feedback, reflecting about the path ahead for Helldivers 2 and how we want to continue developing the game,” game director Mikael Eriksson said. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update. Some things we just didn’t get right - and other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction. All of that is on us and we are going to own that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-1721742365253.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Arrowhead publishes 60-day plan to get Helldivers 2 back in shape.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Anger from Helldivers 2 fans stems from a number of gameplay tweaks and additions that have arrived since launch in February. Namely, many are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-damage-nerfs-push-helldivers-2-community-to-open-rebellion-again"><u>upset with recent weapon nerfs</u></a>, arguing that Arrowhead’s balance tweaks hamper fun in favor of a more even experience overall. It’s a conversation that has seen the community divided, as there is a fair share of others who prefer the feeling of barely extracting from a mission alive.</p><p>Regardless, Arrowhead feels the need to step in. Within the next 60 days, Eriksson promises to re-examine how the team approaches balance in Helldivers 2. That means alterations to how fire damage works and rag-dolling that isn’t as intrusive to the experience. Arrowhead also wants to prioritize bugs that directly impact gameplay while improving frame rate across Helldivers 2. Another change promised in the first 60 days will see those relentless Chargers reworked, though no details on how they will be changed were revealed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Our intention is that balance should be fun, not ‘balanced’ for the sake of balance.</p></div><p>“Our intention is that balance should be fun, not ‘balanced’ for the sake of balance,” the outline says.</p><p>Arrowhead’s grand outline comes with a few long-term bullet points aimed to ensure Helldivers 2 sticks around for a long time to come. This includes the high-priority goal of erecting an opt-in beta test environment as well as regularly posting player surveys in order to streamline communication from fans to the developers. With this will come even more blog posts and more detailed patch notes.</p><p>“We also want to thank you for your patience," Eriksson continued. "We're grateful that so many of you provided constructive feedback and suggestions on the latest update.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Helldivers 2 launched to unforeseen success earlier this year and even managed to become <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks"><u>PlayStation’s fastest-selling game ever</u></a> with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks on PC and PlayStation 5.

It’s not doing well. On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, it’s currently tangled in the tendrils of a nine-percent score, and its global box office take over the weekend was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/borderlands-grosses-16-million-globally-leaving-it-roughly-60-million-shy-of-breaking-even-and-that-s-before-the-theatres-take-their-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mere $16 million</a> – tens of millions less than its budget.

Why <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-r-rated-pg-13-eli-roth-interview-1851618411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut the cartoony gore</a> the <em>Borderlands </em>series is known for, especially with the R-rated <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> running circles around the rest of this year’s summer movie slate? <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/cate-blanchett-borderlands-covid-madness.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Cate Blanchett OK</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Answering precisely none of those questions – though definitely providing an illuminating point A to explain how we reached the movie’s point Z – is director Eli Roth’s explanation of how he pitched <em>Borderlands </em>to studio execs, which I discovered while going down a rabbit hole last night and which I am now obligated to share with you, to ease the weight of my own burden. It involves literal dogshit. From <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/borderlands-director-reveals-the-first-question-he-asked-the-games-studio-and-how-his-dog-got-him-the-job/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a> Roth did with SFX Magazine:</p><blockquote><p>Whenever I take [my dog] for a walk and she has to go to the bathroom, she won’t let me look at her. I have to look away because she gets really shy. But one day I filmed her. She had that shy look on her face and I was like, 'That’s Claptrap.'</p><p>My first question [to Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford] was, 'You can’t kill Claptrap, but you can shoot him hundreds of times?' He goes, 'Correct. Because there’s a scene where Claptrap gets shot up after being a decoy.' I said, ‘So, what happens to the bullets?’ Randy goes, 'I don’t know.’ I go, ‘Could he shit out the bullets, like we’re in a Mel Brooks movie?’ He goes, ‘Yes, he could.’ And I felt we needed to see that.</p><p>… And that was my pitch to Lionsgate. They were laughing so hard.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This tale fits a little too well with <em>Borderlands</em>’ sometimes-puerile sense of humor, so perhaps it’s just marketing spin. But given where things ended up, I’m choosing to believe it.</p><p>Speaking of where things ended up, Pitchford is – as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/randy-pitchford-tweets-maximum-copium-after-borderlands-bombs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer recently put it</a> – posting through it. Among other things, he recently compared the plainly-bad video game movie <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822369245822374131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to The Beatles</a>, which is certainly a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Owlcat Games, known for making games like Pathfinder: Kingmaker and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-crpg-pathfinder-owlcat-games/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>, has entered the publishing space with two new RPGs. This company will now help independent developers across the globe create their own RPG projects. By helping these independent developers out, they will give them access to funding, expert advice, and any other services they may need in the game creation department.</p>
<p>Owlcat Games reviewed 50 different games and picked two to start with. The two development teams they'll be working with are Emotion Spark Studio, based in Serbia, and Another Angle Games, based in Poland.</p>
<p>Emotion Spark Studio is currently working on an RPG titled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rue Valley</a>. The story revolves around a man who is trapped in a time loop during a psychotherapy session. By uncovering more of his story, he has to delve into his mental challenges and figure out how he got into this situation.</p>
<p>Another Angle Games is working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173980/Shadow_of_the_Road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Road</a>, an isometric RPG set in an alternate history timeline of Feudal Japan. This game combines history, samurai, allegiance, and honor with tactical turn-based combat systems. In addition, it takes place in a world filled with magical Yokai and Steampunk technology.</p>
<p>While both games are still in early development, attendees of Gamescom will get more information on these two RPGs.</p>
<p>With Owlcat Games joining the publishing industry, they gained full control of the publishing label META Games, which assisted in publishing Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and helped bring the game to PC and consoles in 2021. META Games is a very different publisher style from the one that Owlcat Games aims to be, as they focus primarily on gameplay-first titles with co-op multiplayer features.</p>
<p>META Games has published some games, including Biped, Spirit of the Island, Train Valley 1, and Train Valley 2. Its upcoming games include Biped 2 and Nested Lands. Similar to the above RPGs, META Games will be at Gamescom, where it will showcase some of its upcoming titles, including Biped 2 and Nested Lands.</p>
<p>Owlcat Games started as a very small company and has since grown exponentially, with over 450 employees worldwide. Their head office is in Cyprus, but that doesn't stop them from having employees from many different countries. With the news of Owlcat Games stepping into publishing, they are continuing to expand and hire for new roles, something that is seemingly uncommon in today's climate in the gaming industry.</p>

About 30 minutes into playing in the tournament, Osmanova alerted officials that she was feeling sick, complaining of nausea and dizziness. Doctors were called and they deduced that she had likely been poisoned. Officials checked security footage and discovered Abakarova allegedly poisoning Osmanova’s chess board. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.me/bazabazon/30070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.me/bazabazon/30070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In footage released online</a></span>, you can see Abakarova enter an area filled with chess boards and empty chairs. Before the tournament had started, the chess pro walked over to where Osmanova was scheduled to play and then smeared liquid mercury—allegedly from a broken thermometer—onto the table and board. Reportedly, before the incident, she had asked officials if there were security cameras in the area and had been told no.<br></p><p>After police were notified by the tournament’s officials and reviewed the footage, they arrested Abakarova.   </p><p>“I still feel bad. In the first minutes, I felt a lack of air and a taste of iron in my mouth. I had to spend about five hours on this board. I don’t know what would have happened to me if I hadn’t seen it earlier,” Osmanova told<em> Russia Today.</em></p><p>Two other people reportedly suffered similar symptoms from the mercury. </p><p><em>Chess.com</em> reports that Abakarova has confessed that she wanted to “knock her opponent out of the tournament.” The week before the poisoning, Osmanova had won a different chess event, beating Abakarova. Osmanova allegedly didn’t want to harm her rival, but just wanted to scare her, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rtvi.com/news/na-sorevnovaniyah-v-dagestane-shahmatistka-popytalas-otravit-soperniczu-chto-izvestno/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rtvi.com/news/na-sorevnovaniyah-v-dagestane-shahmatistka-popytalas-otravit-soperniczu-chto-izvestno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a police report</a></span>.</p><p>Abakarova is currently being held by police, and faces up to three years of jail time. The Russian Chess Federation has temporarily banned the pro from future chess events as it investigates the situation. It’s reported she could receive a lifetime ban. </p><p>“Like many others, I am perplexed by what happened, and the motives of such an experienced competitor as Amina Abakarova are incomprehensible,” said Dagestan’s Minster of Sports. </p><p>Osmanova recovered after being poisoned and continued to play in the tournament, eventually finishing in second place.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are several fantastic gaming events throughout the year designed to build hype around upcoming titles, like the ever-popular Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 or Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. This year, at Gamescom, we’re set to see a huge selection of popular games, with a few of them already confirmed for the show floor. Here are 10 games we’ll see at Gamescom!</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>This year’s entry in the long-running first-person shooter franchise promises to be one of the most exciting and welcoming to everyone, as it’s one of the first major launches in the series on Xbox Game Pass. <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </strong>returns with improved movement, a cinematic single-player campaign, round-based Zombies, prestige levels, weapon customization, and so much more!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The upcoming installment in the grind-heavy Monster Hunt series, <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>, takes players to an all-new location with unique monsters, weapons, and abilities to help breathe fresh life into the franchise. We’ve previously glimpsed an overhauled weather system and boss encounters, but Gamescom should give us a taste of more gameplay!</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In what may be the biggest blockbuster game of the summer, Star Wars Outlaws is Ubisoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-star-wars-outlaws-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first open-world, single-player</a> Star Wars title to date. It boasts multiple planets to explore, space flight, cover-based combat mechanics, stealth, and choice-based story progression. We’ve already explored quite a bit of the game, but Gamescom is the last real shot the team has at winning over fans before its launch at the end of August!</p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>The upcoming third-person horde shooter, <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong>, from developer Saber Interactive is shaping up to be one of the most exciting titles of the year. Stepping into the ultra-armored boots of an Ultramarine, players once more take on the role of Captain Titus, but this time around, it’s not Orks but Tyranids invading. Using a variety of weapons, up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three players in co-op</a> can push back the unsightly enemy en masse.</p>



<h2 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the immense success of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2, Supermassive Games is back once more with <strong>Little Nightmares 3</strong>. In this entry, players follow Low &amp; Alone, two companions in search of a way out of Nowhere. With two protagonists, players will embark on this unique and frightful adventure in full co-op or with an AI companion. We’ll see more of Little Nightmares 3 at Gamescom this month!</p>



<h2 id="h-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-heart-of-chornobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-stalker-2-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent delay and 35-minute Deep Dive</a>, in which we enjoyed significantly more gameplay and game design elements than ever before, we’re all eagerly awaiting the launch of <strong>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong>. Thankfully, it’s only a few months away, but we’re still hopeful for more. With Gamescom around the corner, developer GSC Game World intends to give us what we want!</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Once more, following in the footsteps of young Henry, <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</strong> drops us into 15th-century Medieval Europe in an epic adventure full of sword fights, horseback chases, and an impressive five hours worth of cinematics to help the story along. At Gamescom, we hope to see additional gameplay from Henry’s perspective as he explores Medieval Europe, along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a release date</a>!</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>From developer Funcom, known for Conan Exiles, <strong>Dune Awakening</strong> follows a similar gameplay style but set in the iconic universe of Frank Hebert’s Dune. It’s touted as an open-world survival MMO with a massive, persistent sandbox world to explore, fight across, and build within. We’re hoping to see gameplay from the project at Gamescom!</p>



<h2 id="h-civilization-vii">Civilization VII</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The long-running turn-based strategy franchise returns with immense excitement on all fronts. <strong>Civilization VII</strong> is coming to Gamescom, and we’re hoping for gameplay, first and foremost, but also more on the title’s mechanics, countries, and multiplayer components. It’ll be there for all to see, so <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-civilization-7-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we just have to wait patiently</a>!</p>



<h2 id="h-indiana-jones-at-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones at the Great Circle</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>From MachineGames and Bethesda Softworks, long-time fans of the Indiana Jones franchise can fulfill their dreams of playing as Indy in the upcoming <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong>. It’s a story-driven single-player adventure spanning multiple continents as Indy and companions fight against sinister forces. At Gamescom, we’re hoping for gameplay, but a cinematic is certainly welcome, too!</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions-at-gamescom">Honorable Mentions at Gamescom</h2>



<p>Of course, it’s Gamescom! The showcase is positively massive, with way more than just ten upcoming titles to show off. Alongside the games we don’t yet know about, there’s also a handful previously confirmed titles we’ll explore in greater detail, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparkling! ZERO</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sonic X Shadow Generations</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crimson Desert</strong></li>



<li><strong>Visions of Mana</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Stay tuned! Gamescom is about to take off, and the hype train is running right alongside it!</p>

            <p>
Cast your mind back to the murky distant past of 24 hours ago and you might remember publisher Boss Team Games teasing two projects based on John Carpenter's Halloween. Well, it turns out one of those is a 16-bit-style platformer from Shantae developer WayForward, and the studio's creating an Ash vs Evil Dead platformer too.
</p>

As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/retro-realms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-games-announced-release-date-price">IGN</a>, Boss Team (which previously published Saber Interactive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-years-multiplayer-evil-dead-game-wont-get-new-content-switch-version-canned">now-defunct</a> Evil Dead: The Game) is releasing both titles as part of its new RetroRealms series. The publisher describes its first two instalments as "gore-filled" and "fast-paced 90's arcade style" platfomers, and you can get a taste of their retro-inspired action in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S-Dt-0_lbY">trailer</a> below.

<p>
RetroRealms: Halloween and RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead are both set to launch for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch on 18th November, and they'll cost $24.99 USD (around £20) each. A $49.99 physical Double Feature bundle is also on the way, with Boss Team noting players owning both games will unlock new features, including the ability for protagonists Michael Myers and Ash Williams to cross over to each others' worlds.

Today's news (which, if nothing else, has reminded me I still haven't watched all of Ash vs Evil Dead) follows Boss Team Games' recent announcement it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-carpenters-halloween-is-getting-two-game-adaptations-from-evil-dead-publisher">two Halloween projects in the works</a>, both enabling players to "relive moments from the film and play as classic characters". One of these is evidentally WayForward's platformer, but the other remains mysterious. It does, however, seem likely this second project will be the one John Carpenter is said to be "intimately involved" with, unless Carpenter had some particularly revolutionary ideas about running left and right and occassionally hitting a jump button.

There's no word of a release date for Halloween game number two, but hopefully the oft-reliable WayForward will deliver the goods when RetroRealms: Halloween and RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead show up on 18th October.
