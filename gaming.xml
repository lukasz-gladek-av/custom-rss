            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Traversing the nightmare realms of the human mind has always been central to horror. The stories we tell ourselves about what’s moving in the darkness, the creation of monsters out of unknown sounds — from this emerges our fascination with terror. In <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, players navigate a cold, dark ninth-century Iceland in the often wet shoes of the Pictish warrior Senua on her second adventure in the third-person action-horror franchise. I was very fond of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">the first <em>Hellblade</em></a>, which saw Senua journey into Hel to save the soul of her lover. But the sequel pulled me in even further, with some of the most unforgettable and unsettling psychological horror I’ve ever experienced.</p><p>Senua, who lives with psychosis that causes her to hear constant voices, is a fierce warrior who has “killed” gods before in her personal quests at redemption. Cast out by her people in the Orkney Islands for being different, or a “witch,” she has taken her battles across the sea to rescue her people from slavers.</p><p>She washes up alone on a cold Viking shore and must find her way through a mysterious land. Her aim, vaguely, has to do with getting her people back, if not stopping the slavers who are taking her people. She soon discovers this is a land of literal giants, who remind me slightly of <em>Attack on Titan</em>: their designs are horrific and genuinely terrifying. The giants have all but destroyed the land, but Senua, being who she is, finds a way to stop them.</p><p>Let me be clear: this is the best-looking game I’ve ever played. Senua’s face is so detailed, I struggled to discern the real-time gameplay from the cutscenes; the environmental details are so intricate, it was like looking at photos. With fantastical lighting, inversions of the world as Senua is sucked into various states of mind, and stunning cinematic direction, there was no moment when I was not ogling my TV.</p><p>Perhaps more important, however, is the sound design and direction. The voices in Senua’s head portray themselves as furies, gods, and spirits, alternating between berating and encouraging. In terms of game design, they help the player navigate the world — telling you to look in this direction, highlighting when an enemy is about to hit, and so on. Add to this beautiful and horrific soundscapes, with chanting voices or drone-like sounds puncturing the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The world is alive with horror, as it was difficult to discern what was “real” and what was Senua’s psychosis. This is illustrated in combat: Senua is an incredible warrior but the game bookmarks combat. What I mean is that, when a battle happens, you are locked on to a single enemy where you must parry, block, and strike. Senua has an ability called “focus” that builds up with successful blocks and strikes, which is effectively bullet time with swords. Combat is exhausting and the one weak spot of the game, as I always felt she was not responsive to my blocks and parries, resulting in constant strikes from enemies. Senua has no health bar and it is rather hard to die, but the combat proved frustrating even if it was incredible to witness: it’s brutal and dynamic, with fights happening around Senua, enemies crashing into her organically, and kills blending smoothly into cutscenes.</p><p>Unlike the first game, Senua has companions whom I genuinely grew to like: a spiritual leader; a reformed slaver; and the daughter of a betrayed chief. Villages are filled with people, with one sequence showing off a small battalion fighting alongside Senua. However, Senua remains inherently alone, and the journey is a lonely one — despite the voices constantly in your head. Senua solves environmental puzzles to navigate the world, which, like the first game, did get a little repetitive. These involve her having to match shapes that unlock doors. However, there was at least more diversity to the puzzles this time to keep things interesting, aside from the boring shape minigame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The game is short, and I finished it in about 10 hours. But it packs a number of gorgeous scenes and scenarios into that brief span, from battling a monster in a volcano pit to the rhythm of metal music to navigating a <em>Silent Hill</em>-esque forest. This was an exhausting, beautiful experience that shattered me often, built me back up, and constantly challenged what it meant to manage one’s darkness. Senua is a broken person, but because of that, she fits into this broken world.</p><p><small>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II <em>is available now on Xbox and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver (version 555.85) today, optimized for the upcoming launch of F1 24. As Codemasters <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Wccftech</a> in our exclusive interview on the racing game, on its launch day (May 28), F1 24 will support DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, Reflex, and ray tracing with the new Ray Traced Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination that will reportedly improve the light response in shaded areas.</p>
<p>The Game Ready driver is also optimized for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a> (out today with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1610520/Serum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Serum</a>, a survival adventure game out in two days on Steam Early Access with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex. According to NVIDIA, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II can have its performance tripled with the combination of DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode and Frame Generation. At 4K and max settings, the RTX 4090 nearly runs at an average of 148 frames per second, while the RTX 4080 SUPER is almost at 120 FPS, and the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER surpasses 103 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As for Serum, the game gets a 2.6x performance bump with DLSS Super Resolution in Performance Mode and Frame Generation enabled, according to NVIDIA tests. The RTX 4090 runs at over 132 frames per second on average.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are just some of the games that recently launched with or will soon add NVIDIA technologies. Others include Star Citizen, which recently added DLSS Super Resolution <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-alpha-3-23-update-is-live-adding-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Alpha 3.23 update</a>; <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuthering-waves-genshin-impacts-next-competitor-launches-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wuthering Waves</a>, the free-to-play Genshin Impact-like game, out tomorrow with DLSS Super Resolution support; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266540/Ships_At_Sea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ships at Sea</a>, a ship simulation game out tomorrow on Steam Early Access with DLSS Super Resolution support; Moreover, the free-to-play competitive shooter Tom Clancy's XDefiant <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-release-date-preseason-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is out today</a> with Reflex support, and NVIDIA promises an up to 58% reduction in system latency.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-acquiring-the-studio-that-ported-hogwarts-legacy-is-super-interesting.877188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161472/nintendo-shiver-acquisition-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="4YYJMG">In a move that has surprised literally everyone, Nintendo has made a studio acquisition. In a rare move, the company bought Shiver Entertainment, a Miami-based port specialist, from embattled Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group.</p>
<p id="hGDqN1">Shiver, notably, is the studio that somehow managed to bring both <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>and <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>to Nintendo Switch in 2023. Given the enormous gulf in power between the Switch and the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, this was no easy task, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23878568/mortal-kombat-1-nintendo-switch-graphics-frame-rate-loading">results left quite a lot to be desired</a>. But merely getting feature-complete and functional versions of these games up and running on Switch could be considered an achievement in itself.</p>
<p id="7u6xDA">At any rate, Shiver’s work seems to have impressed Nintendo enough that it took the unusual step (for Nintendo) of dipping into its vast cash reserves and actually buying something. (Nintendo is actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/nintendo-is-currently-the-richest-company-in-japan">the richest company in Japan</a>, going by money in the bank, perhaps precisely because it never spends on itself. Historically, the company has been quite uninterested in late capitalism’s obsession with growth above all else, preferring good, old-fashioned profit — and Scrooge McDuck-style piles of money.)</p>
<p id="e5aO6e"><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf">Nintendo’s press release</a> makes it clear that Shiver’s port expertise is why it bought the studio. It specifically shouts out Shiver’s work on <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, notes the studio’s “high-level resources for porting and developing software titles,” and says that after acquisition “Shiver’s focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch.”</p>

<p id="QLOnzE">But why would Nintendo be interested in acquiring a third-party, work-for-hire port specialist in the first place? There are many studios that specialize in this sort of thing, but they’re rarely acquired by platform-holders like Nintendo. When this does happen, it’s more likely to be a studio that makes shiny, enhanced remasters of older games — like Bluepoint Games, which was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22702363/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-sie-playstation-studios">acquired by Sony in 2021</a> — than an outfit that specializes in the less glamorous work of wrestling the latest releases onto less powerful hardware.</p>
<p id="FJRRAK">The most obvious conclusion is that, when it comes to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo is getting serious about reducing the gap in software libraries between its hybrid handheld and the current generation of home consoles and PCs. It wants AAA games to launch on its next console, and to that end, it has taken the unprecedented step of bringing porting expertise in-house, so it can offer this service to third-party publishers itself. It will probably find a willing market; Square Enix, for one, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155266/square-enix-multiplatform-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">has recently indicated</a> that it wants to bring its biggest games to as many platforms as it can, including Nintendo’s.</p>
<p id="10mKpl">Shiver is particularly experienced with Unreal Engine titles, and Nintendo has reportedly been demonstrating the Switch 2’s ability to run Unreal Engine 5 to its partners. And while the Switch 2 will certainly be less powerful than PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, reports indicate that it will be able to get quite close to them in terms of its visuals, in part thanks to use of Nvidia’s AI-powered DLSS upscaling technology.</p>
<p id="PKUBVn">There’s one last question. Why does Nintendo mention that, “even after it becomes part of the Nintendo group,” Shiver will continue to work porting games to “multiple platforms”? This is most likely a veiled reference to the Switch 2 — which Nintendo has not named, though recently <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151013/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announcement-teaser">admitted exists</a>. But it may also be that Nintendo is happy to let Shiver continue to work on other systems, partly so it can learn more about them and expand its porting expertise.</p>
<p id="jbr29t">Either way, it’s a fascinating development, and an indication that Nintendo is getting ready to step a little further out of its bubble with the Switch 2, and reintegrate with the rest of the game industry. </p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/job-creation-and-investment/amazon-games-expands-global-footprint-with-new-development-studio-in-romania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new official blog</a>, Amazon Games has announced it is opening a development studio in Bucharest, Romania, which marks its first expansion into Europe. </p>



<p>Previously, Amazon Games already had studios in Montreal, San Diego, Orange County, and Seattle. </p>



<p>VP of Amazon Games Christoph Hartmann said the Bucharest studio was a “natural next step for us as we tackle our broad portfolio.” The new dev studio will support Amazon Games’ portfolio “now and in the future.”</p>



<p>Cristian Pana, known for their prior work as Managing Director at Ubisoft Bucharest, will lead the Amazon Games Bucharest studio. Pana’s experience extends to titles like Far Cry and The Division. Today, Pana said that Amazon Games “is actively building across an exciting roadmap.”</p>



<p>The new studio in Europe follows Amazon Games layoffs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-is-laying-off-more-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in November 2023</a>. New studios are always welcome as the industry faces consistent layoffs. Just yesterday, Larian also announced it is opening a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-opening-new-studio-in-warsaw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new studio in Warsaw</a>.</p>



<p>Amazon Games’ new Bucharest studio will likely support titles such as the anticipated Tomb Raider project and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-announces-lord-of-the-rings-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lord of the Rings MMO</a>. </p>



<p>Last year, Hartmann said that “bringing players a fresh take on The Lord of the Rings has long been an aspiration for our team.” They added that the team plans to “do justice to the expansive Middle-earth universe.”</p>



<p>Today’s blog also mentioned “unannounced projects from our San Diego and Montreal studios.”</p>

Still, that hasn’t stopped developer Weforge Studio from drafting in a malevolent monster from another dimension and inserting it at the very top of the Aussie food chain in Macabre, a co-op ‘stealth extraction horror’ adventure that aims to fuse the bowel-loosening cat and mouse thrills of Alien: Isolation with the gadget-based teamwork of Phasmophobia. After a brief hands-on with a very early build of the game, I can attest to the prowling predator’s stalking prowess since I didn’t actually get a good look at the beast until it was suddenly dragging me through the snow-capped forest setting and knitting a sickening scarf out of my entrails.  </p><p>“To start with you are very helpless, and this thing’s going to terrorise you and tear you apart,” says creative director Jay Topping. “It's not like this dumb meandering thing, the way that it interacts with the player is that at first it's cautious, then it gets closer and [once] you're out on your own it's gonna start [picking you off].”  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The core gameplay loop of Macabre, which in its current pre-Alpha form takes place in and around an alpine lodge setting inspired by Australia’s Snowy Mountains region, sees up to four players investigating a mysterious rift in time and completing objectives provided by an exceedingly Australian guide named Banjo. In order to survive, players must scavenge for materials like batteries, electrical tape and old mobile phones to craft makeshift gadgets that both detect and distract the interdimensional assailant that hunts them from the shadows. </p><p>The map itself is marked with ominous trails of blood and shadows that appear to be either cast by the branches of the surrounding snowgum trees or the spindly limbs of a quadrupedal murder beast depending on how much you trust your fluctuating paranoia levels. Meanwhile, the map layout is randomised each time you enter it, further heightening the sense of panic and disorientation as you try to evade a deadly killer that silently studies and gradually learns to anticipate your behaviour. Yet although it’s effectively four against one, it’s worth highlighting that Macabre is not an asymmetrical horror experience like Dead by Daylight, and its monsters are solely AI-driven.</p><p>“When you play games like [Dead by Daylight], I think you lose a bit of the mystery and magic that comes with an AI-controlled monster,” says Topping. </p><p>“Player-controlled stalkers learn popular strategies from other players that make it repetitive, but they also mess around and do stupid shit, which really ruins the immersion. So the biggest inspiration [for Macabre’s monster] is Alien: Isolation where it's constantly adapting and changing. You can't just hide in the same closets or cabinets, eventually it's going to figure out that you've hidden that same cabinet three times [in a row], and it’s going to come and kill you.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Macabre Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While its core development team is based in Sydney and its initial map is inspired by Australian terrain, Weforge Studio’s plan for Macabre’s roster of deadly destinations is to expand beyond its southern hemisphere starting point. </p><p>“These rifts are kind of like portals, bubbles of time, that have popped up all over the place and they’re interconnected,” says Topping. “So while [Macabre] starts in Australia, it can kind of go anywhere including [destinations] beyond our own dimension.”  </p><p>The key is that each map will have to offer its own gameplay point of difference beyond mere texture swaps in order to consistently evolve the experience. One example given by Topping is the remote Australian outback town of Coober Pedy, an arid, desert area once featured in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome where residents build their homes in caves bored into the sandstone hillsides, which would serve as an ideal subterranean setting for a highly claustrophobic form of terror. Another potential Macabre map would be one located in China’s Kowloon Walled City, a densely populated slum that would bring a greater sense of vertical scale to the stealth horror. </p><p>“Kowloon Walled City would offer a great [visual] contrast of really dark areas and really bright neon-lit areas,” says Topping. “But its twisting corridors would also allow us to have a creature that runs around above you, below you, and in the walls.”</p><p>“It would be terrifying.”</p><p>The monster itself will apparently adjust its form and behaviour to suit each location, meaning that the unnatural enemy you encounter in the Australian Snowy Mountains won’t resemble the beast you encounter in say, a Mayan temple in a South American rainforest. In fact Topping compares it to the alien from John Carpenter’s The Thing or Pennywise from Stephen King’s It in the way it adapts to each environment. According to Topping, its ability set will also randomise along with the map elements each time you start the game, and that will determine which gadgets from your expanding list of blueprints you’ll need to craft.</p><p>“You’re not just dealing with the same thing every time,” explains Topping. “In each map there are different artifacts to find, and the combination of artifacts that are in there unlocks the abilities for that specific monster. You might go in and it will be moving super quietly and it’s invisible for most of the time, then [you’ll] need to [craft] this tool, this tool, and this tool [in order to combat it].”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ultimately, we’re not just trying to create one game; we’re trying to create a universe.</p></div><p>However, the interdimensional apex predator isn’t necessarily the only monster that players will have to contend with, as Weforge Studio is currently brainstorming ways for players to betray other players, potentially by steering them into the claws of the beast and then pilfering the loot off their freshly dispatched corpses.</p><p>“[In a way] that sounds like a good idea, but [the risk] is that you get into a realm where everyone is going to kill each other, and so why would they ever trust each other?” says Topping. “I think the feeling that we want to create is something like [social deception survival game] Dread Hunger where everyone works together, but in the back of their mind they're kind of like… <em>are</em> we working together?”</p><p>“Our end goal is to create the feeling of… you've got the main monster and then you've also maybe got all these other little monsters around you [in the form of your fellow players], and you can’t ever be completely sure if you should trust what everyone else is saying.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Exactly why the rifts have appeared and exactly what sort of dark forces are behind them is a mystery at this point, and at this stage Weforge Studio is keeping mum about the actual ‘extraction’ part of the experience – it’s not clear whether the goal is to gather resources and safely extract yourself from the area, or eventually somehow trap the monster and extract it along with you. However, what is clear is that Topping and his team have no shortage of ambition as far as the Macabre experience goes, and have apparently got a lengthy narrative backbone constructed that extends beyond just one game.  </p><p>“Ultimately, we’re not just trying to create one game; we’re trying to create a universe, like a Tolkien universe,” explains Topping. “Maybe [Macabre] is like The Hobbit and we’ll [eventually] get to The Lord of the Rings, you know? It would be so cool to build out a world around this so that it doesn’t just end at this game. There’s so much more that we want to discover.”</p><p>Weforge Studio has just launched a crowdfunding campaign to support the development of Macabre, which is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weforge/macabre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now live on Kickstarter</a>. But it’s not just financial support that the team is seeking, but the feedback from fans to help shape the scope and design of the Macabre experience. </p><p>“The idea with the Kickstarter is that we want to get community involvement,” says Topping.  “And I think we also want to do that during Early Access as well. Because ultimately, we can make a game for ourselves but [there’s no point] if no one's there to play it.”</p><p>“So we want to hear what people want to see. We've set the parameters, the [template] of these [maps that] you can play in. Where do you want to go?” </p><p>Even in its early state there’s a lot to like about Macabre and it’s strong potential for serious scares, and I’m certainly keen to see how it – like its main monster – continues to shapeshift and surprise as it progresses deeper into development. </p><p><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a senior video editor at IGN AU.

The layoffs impact a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, and Firesprite, but PlayStation's London studio was hit hardest with a notice of closure.</p><p>Now, the official PlayStation London Studio X/Twitter account has issued a statement thanking the players for their support:</p><p>“For over 20 years London Studio has been home to some exceptionally talented and wonderful people in the games industry.

The studio had a number of high-profile games canceled over the years amid shifting demands from parent company Sony, including Eight Days and a sequel to The Getaway. In 2019 it released PSVR exclusive shooter Blood &amp; Truth. Sony has yet to announce the cancelation of London Studio’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-london-studio-is-working-on-a-co-op-action-game-set-in-a-fantasy-uk"><u>co-op PlayStation 5 game set in a modern fantasy London</u></a>, but it seems likely.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We’ve had one wild and wonderful journey!</p></div><p>In a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/difficult-news-about-our-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a> announcing the cuts, then-outgoing Sony Interactive Entertainment boss Jim Ryan issued an update on what he called a “difficult day at our company.”</p><p>“These are incredibly talented people who have been part of our success, and we are very grateful for their contributions,” Ryan said. “However, the industry has changed immensely, and we need to future ready ourselves to set the business up for what lies ahead. We need to deliver on expectations from developers and gamers and continue to propel future technology in gaming, so we took a step back to ensure we are set up to continue bringing the best gaming experiences to the community.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In a separate <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-important-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a>, then Head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, confirmed some games had been canceled as part of a "re-evaluation of how we operate", but failed to name them. "We looked at our studios and our portfolio, evaluating projects in various stages of development, and have decided that some of those projects will not move forward," Hulst said.</p><p>"I want to be clear that the decision to stop work on these projects is not a reflection on the talent or passion of team members. Our philosophy has always been to allow creative experimentation. Sometimes, great ideas don’t become great games. Sometimes, a project is started with the best intentions before shifts within the market or industry result in a change of plan."</p><p>The Sony cuts come during one of the most difficult periods the game industry has ever faced, with mass layoffs throughout 2023 and continuing into 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/do-helldivers-2-players-just-prefer-to-fight-bugs-than-bots-it-certainly-looks-like-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>’s explosive launch on PC and PlayStation 5, players have had two alien factions to battle against: the terrifying robot Automatons and the brutal bug-like Terminids.</p><p>One ongoing theme coursing through the wonderful metanarrative that is Helldivers 2’s Galactic War is that the wider player base enjoys playing against the bugs more than the bots. This debate surfaces whenever a Major Order — Helldivers 2’s time-limited, community-wide missions - revolves around battling on Automaton planets. And almost every time, try as it might, the hardcore Helldivers 2 community that fusses over the success of the Galactic War can’t quite wrestle the majority of players over to the Western Front.</p><p>It’s happening again now, after Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead granted a bonus to planet liberation, but only if training facilities on Automaton planets (Vernen Wells) liberated in the prior Major Order remain under Super Earth control.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/helldivers-2-20240521115123-1716290573988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The problem is, most Helldivers 2 players are perfectly happy playing on bug planets, putting Vernen Wells, and thus the bonus liberation, at risk. Players have a number of theories why this sort of thing happens. The lack of in-game communication is certainly a valid suggestion. Helldivers 2 itself does not flag to players that Vernen Wells is a particularly important planet for players to focus on right now, so most won’t be aware it's in need of attention. Players have called on Arrowhead to add more in-game communication to help drive the wider player-base to Major Order-focused planets, rather than rely on social media posts and the likes of Discord and Reddit.</p><p>But, as many Helldivers 2 players have also suggested, the simple truth is many players prefer fighting against the bugs. The Terminids are, after all, the alien faction that realizes the Starship Troopers fantasy Helldivers 2 so heavily leans upon. And bugs are just a lot more squishy than their metal clad counterparts. On the harder difficulties, all Helldivers 2 missions can be nightmarish. But the Terminids are thought of as being more easy going than the Automatons.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/helldivers-2-20240521115446-1716290745979.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Most active Helldivers 2 players are fighting in Terminid-controlled systems.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Then there’s Automaton fatigue. The bots were the recent focus of a Major Order, so asking players to keep on top of bot planets when they might fancy a change is a tall order. In short, there’s no single reason at play for the Helldivers 2 community’s clear preference for Terminids, but the overriding sense is bugs are just more fun.</p><p>So, what’s to be done? Some Helldivers 2 players are now calling on Arrowhead to make fighting against the bots more rewarding by dishing out bonuses of some kind. There are also suggestions that planet liberation should be tweaked to reflect the number of players fighting in a system at any given moment. Arrowhead, fresh from the all-encompassing PSN debacle it is now trying to move on from, has said it will take its time to focus on game balance, among other things. Perhaps some user interface tweaks are also in order.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/helldivers-2-20240521115458-1716290984428.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Automaton-controlled systems tend to have fewer players, no matter the Major Order.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I think it's time to admit Automatons need a carrot dangled above them for players to touch the Western Front," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cwmaph/i_think_its_time_to_admit_automatons_need_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor CouldBeBetterTBH suggested</a>. "We just got a galaxy-wide buff not even two days ago and we're already going to lose part of it in 13 hours because no one likes the bots. 90k Divers online and 60k are on Terminid worlds.</p><p>"What else can we do at this point besides cheat the game-rules and add some kind of Medal/Sample multiplier effect onto Automaton planets? Nobody wants to play against the Bots, we are always the minority of the playerbase and keep failing all of our Orders and keep losing planets because nobody wants to touch our worlds with a 100-mile long pole.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Nobody wants to play against the Bots...</p></div><p>"Something needs to draw players onto this side of the Galactic Map or else we're never going to make any progress in the West unless Joel keeps tweaking the numbers and throwing pity wins at us every single time the Automatons become a focus or even a part of a Major Order."</p><p>Whatever your preference, Helldivers 2 is a smash hit, becoming Sony’s fastest-ever selling PlayStation game. It shifted an astonishing 12 million copies in just 12 weeks after going on sale, and has continued to push hard with its live service elements.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-pricey-pc-ports-now-available-on-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously made their way</a> to PC via the Epic Games Store, and now it’s Steam’s turn. Square Enix announced plans to dump a bucketload of intertwining lore on Steam, with three separate titles and a comprehensive bundle launching on June 13, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">Titles on the way to Steam include <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em> and <em>Kingdom Hearts III + ReMind </em>DLC. All of those compilations can also be snagged together in the <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece </em>bundle, which comes in way above the legal limit of <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>content.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">If you’re new to <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, or if you understandably just need a refresher on what these individual releases include, here’s a breakdown. Naturally, you’ll want to start at the beginning with:</p> <h2 id="h-kingdom-hearts-hd-1-5-2-5-remix" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">The saga starts here, with four games and two collections of remastered HD cutscenes. The games are <em>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix,</em> and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep FINAL MIX. When you’re ready to sit back with some popcorn and a story-tracking notebook by your side, you can watch more cinematics in <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days </em>and <em>Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded</em>.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">A pair of games and an HD movie bridge the gap between the first collection and <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>. This release packs <em>Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD </em>with <em>Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-</em>, which takes players directly into the third entry. For an even deeper dive into the timeline and more info on the Foretellers, you’ll need to check out the included <em>KINGDOM HEARTS χ Back Cover </em>movie.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Kingdom Hearts III + ReMind</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">The final piece of the puzzle (for now) is contained here. In addition to the main <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> game, this one comes with the <em>ReMind </em>DLC that followed, introducing new features, some challenging boss fights, and more.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="false">Amazingly, the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>series has been kicking around crossovers that previously seemed improbable for over 20 years. In that time it’s established a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/full-kingdom-hearts-timeline-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprawling saga</a> of its own, and more people getting a chance to experience it all is definitely a good thing. Just don’t let any negative word of mouth sour you on Goofy and Donald. They’re your FRIENDS and you need to trust them to make good decisions, okay?</p>

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Once you’ve reached roughly the halfway point of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/">Anima weapon</a> grind in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you’ll find yourself needing stacks of Umbrite and Crystal Sand. These items are necessary to complete “A Dream Fulfilled”, turning your weapon from Hyperconductive to Reconditioned.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">The Umbrite and Crystal Sand will eventually be combined to create 180 Treated Crystal Sand. To make this, you’ll need roughly 60 of each initial item, and for the most part, they’re not easy to get your hands on. However, there are some ways to make this easier on yourself, so let’s look at how to get Umbrite and Crystal Sand.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-umbrite-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get Umbrite in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">There is only one way to get Umbrite in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> – through exchanging Tomestones of Poetics with Hismena in Idyllshire (X:5.7, Y:5.2). Umbrite costs 75 Poetics each, and like I said, you’re going to need 60 of them. With this in mind, and considering the Poetics cap of 2,000 at any time, you’re going to need to farm for Poetics.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-the-best-way-to-get-poetics" data-injectable="false"><strong>The best way to get Poetics</strong></h3> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true">There are a lot of methods for obtaining Poetics in FFXIV, but some are more lucrative than others. If you’re hoping to stock up the full 4,500 you need in order to complete your Umbrite collection, you’re going to need to know which duties are worth running and which aren’t.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="62" data-injectable="false">By far the most lucrative method is by running Duty Roulettes:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">These Poetics are awarded on top of the regular number of Poetics awarded for running whichever duty you receive as part of a roulette. For instance, if you receive The Orbonne Monastery as your Alliance Raid Roullete, you’ll receive 120 for doing it as part of the Roulette and 100 for completing the duty itself.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">Speaking of Alliance Raids, all of them except those added in the current expansion will reward 100 Poetics per clear. As well as this, if you complete any duty synced with another player who is new to it, you’ll get a bonus of 50 Poetics.</p>
 <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">Poetics are also rewarded in various amounts for other things, such as The Hunt, Treasure Hunt, Deep Dungeons, or Field content such as Bozja and Zadnor.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-crystal-sand-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get Crystal Sand in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Crystal Sand is undoubtedly the hardest of these two items to get. In order to build your hoard of Crystal Sand, you’ll need to exchange certain items with Ulan in Idyllshire (X:6.4, Y4.7), but none of these items (or groups of items) is particularly easy to get. At the very least, you’re going to be spending a lot of Gil on the Marketboard to get the items you need.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">In my three successful Anima grinds, I’ve tried multiple different ways to get Crystal Sand. I’ve attempted to use my Crafters’ and Gatherers’ Scrips to get Blue Tokens to hand in, but you’ll need at least 3,750 White Scrips in order to complete this step that way. Which is certainly doable, but it’s not particularly quick.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for a shortcut to this step, and you have the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-gil-without-crafting-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">spare Gil</a> (I’d recommend approximately 100,000 Gil to be safe) and some spare time on your hands, the best way I’ve found to get this step done is through the level 50 Extreme Trial drop items:</p> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Group 1</strong></td><td>1 Inferno Horn, 1 Crag Heart, and 1 Diamond Tear</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Group 2</strong></td><td>1 Vortex Feather, 1 Barb of the Whorl, and 1 Large Levin Orb</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">These can be purchased on the Marketboard for varying prices, but they’re always available, especially if you’re open to world-hopping in order to find a bargain. If you don’t want to purchase them, you can also steamroller the Trials themselves very quickly if you unsync them using a level 90 Job. You’ll need 30 of each item in a group, but at under a minute per clear, you’ll need a maximum of 90 minutes to get everything you need.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false">Just in case you want to mix things up, here’s the full list of things you can trade for Crystal Sand:</p> <figure data-found-rows="12" data-current-count="884" data-injectable="false"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Exchangeable item(s)</strong></td><td><strong>How to get</strong></td></tr><tr><td>5 Blue Crafters’ Scrip Tokens</td><td>25 White Crafters’ Scrips each (125 total)</td></tr><tr><td>5 Blue Gatherers’ Scrip Tokens</td><td>25 White Gatherers’ Scrips each (125 total)</td></tr><tr><td>1 Garlond Steel<br>1 Celestine<br>1 High Allagan Chimera Leather</td><td>– Crafted (Blacksmith, Goldsmith and Leatherworker respectively)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Amber-encased Vilekin</td><td>Heavensward Levequests</td></tr><tr><td>3 Battlecraft Demimateria I<br>2 Battlecraft Demimateria II<br>3 Fieldcraft Demimateria I<br>2 Fieldcraft Demimateria II</td><td>– Desynthesis<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>5 Moonstone</td><td>– Deliverance (Ixali daily quest)<br>– 4,000 GC Seals each (20,000 total)<br>– Timeworn Goatskin Map<br>– Timeworn Leather Map<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Inferno Horn<br>1 Crag Heart<br>1 Diamond Tear</td><td>– Level 50 Extreme Trial drops (Bowl of Embers, Navel, Akh Afah Amphitheatre)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Vortex Feather<br>1 Barb of the Whorl<br>1 Large Levin Orb</td><td>– Level 50 Extreme Trials drops (Howling Eye, Whorleater, Striking Tree)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>5 Superior Enchanted Ink<br>5 Thavnairian Mist</td><td>25 Tomestones of Poetics each (125 total)<br>20 Tomestones of Poetics each (100 total)</td></tr><tr><td>5 Allagan Catalyst</td><td>– The Labyrinth of the Ancients<br>– Syrcus Tower</td></tr><tr><td>1 Unidentifiable Bone<br>1 Unidentifiable Shell<br>1 Unidentifiable Ore<br>1 Unidentifiable Seeds</td><td>Any of the methods used in the “Coming into It’s Own” quest</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

			<p>It’s always sad to see great games receding back into the mists of time, whether they’re all-time greats trapped on defunct consoles and operating systems, or smaller indie titles under the sheer weight of modern game releases. At least some of these games are given the opportunity to leap back to the forefront and relevance, and thankfully it means that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is back to be enjoyed by a brand new generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCV-uTRULn8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Through the Nintendo Switch’s life, Nintendo has been far from consistent in how it’s treated the GameCube. After largely ignoring it for the first few years, there’s then been emulator-based ports, enhanced HD ports, and full remakes. Thankfully, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is getting the full works, a ground-up rebuild of the game in a new engine, making one of, if not the best entry in this beloved series available to play on the latest Nintendo hardware.</p>


<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door typifies the kind of individuality that the earlier games in the series were able to cultivate. Sure, there’ Goombas, Koopas and Toads all over the shop, but they’re joined by new and original characters and creatures throughout. From the small secretive critters known as Punies, to the X-nauts, the Three Shadows and beyond, they stand out when compared to later games –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/15/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review/">The Origami King</a>, for example, felt like it was almost entirely Toads wearing different hats. Having this breadth of characters also helps to feed into a script that’s wonderfully humorous and quirky throughout.</p>


<p>There’s also a darker twist to the world you’re exploring. The Thousand-Year Door opens with Paper Mario summoned to Rogueport, a town which is as rough as you could imagine for a Mario game, from the graffiti and background gang encounters, to the fact that there’s a literal hanging frame right in the middle of the town square! There’s massive shifts in the visual design of the places you visit, when comparing Rogueport to the charming village of Petalburg, and then the utterly distinctive Boggly Woods with its colourful floor pattern contrasting with black tree trunks, white foliage and grey creatures.</p>
<p>The whole game has been remade with a crafted appearance that’s more in keeping with the last few entries in the series. You can see card edges and folds in so many objects and through the scenery, while Mario and other characters have the appearance of thick card stock –&nbsp;Card Mario isn’t quite as catchy, though –&nbsp;and the battle scene in particular now feels like a pop-up diorama, still with the theatre curtains and audience members watching on.</p>

<p>The one jarring element of this makeover for me remains the shiny and reflective floor, which doesn’t feel in keeping with the rest of the art style –&nbsp;it makes sense for a metal floor, sure, but less so for grass or woods. It’s the one effect that I’d like to have been used more sparingly, but it’s a small quibble when we have the loveliness of dynamic lights, or the floor in Boggly Woods going from a static colour gradient to a colour-shifting iridescence.</p>
<p>Another important factor for a Paper Mario game is the combat, and here we get to go back to the good old turn-based with timed actions from the original. This is an RPG of small numbers, with health measured in the tens, damage dealt in the single digits, and with one partner character at a time. It’s a refreshing simplification after the more puzzle-like combat of the most recent game, Paper Mario: The Original King, or the cards system from the 2010s. Thanks to the widescreen view, the UI has been made less cluttered, and all of the attack button timings have refreshed graphical elements.</p>

<p>There’s also a relatively minimalist character progression system. Every 100 Star Points earned in battle lets you level up and increase health points, flower points (for special attacks), or badge points. It’s the latter one that is generally more important to get, as everything beyond your core abilities and items you earn (like better boots for jumping) depends on applying badges.</p>
<p>The more badge points you have, the more badges you can apply, which will either buff you or your allies in combat, add new attacks… or make your attacks sounds different. You’ll want to try and explore every nook and cranny to find Star Pieces, which is one way that you can buy more badges, find chests that can net you extra badges, or just use regular coins at certain shops.</p>

<p>Really the main foible of The Thousand-Year Door was and is the amount of backtracking that can be involved in some areas and chapters. You can feel it seeping into the game fairly early on as you go hither and tither, and it’s maybe made a little more noticeable by how broken up some areas are into separate rooms and through various pipes. This remakes quality of life improvements feel more subtle than certain other remasters, but there are still plenty of good improvements. The Warp Pipe room is overhauled to make switching regions quicker and easier to access, you can nudge Goombella for advice with a single button press, switch partner characters without dipping into menus, and there’s some more helper characters sprinkled through the world for those that need them.</p>

						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>It seemed like we’d never see another game like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>. While there have been plenty of Paper Mario games over the past couple of decades, Nintendo has intentionally steered the series away from the RPG mechanics, original characters, and sharp-edged humor it was initially known for. As a result, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has taken on a certain symbolic importance to some spurned fans even though it wasn’t a particularly big hit in its day. Needless to say, it came as a bit of a shock when Nintendo announced a full remake of the game last year.</p>
<p>Does Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door still stack up in 2024? Or should Nintendo have left this paper filed under “N” for Nostalgia? Time to see if this remake is still a cut above…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As in the original game, the events of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door are set in motion when Princess Peach’s holiday gets sidetracked in the sketchy town of Rogueport. There she’s given a map that points toward The Thousand-Year Door, which is located beneath the town and said to contain some sort of powerful and ominous “treasure.” Peach invites Mario to dig into this mystery, but by the time he arrives in Rogueport, a mysterious group known as the X-Nauts has kidnapped her. From there, the story follows Mario as he collects the Crystal Stars that power the Thousand-Year Door, with occasional check-ins with Bowser as he attempts to head off both Mario and the X-Nauts and Princess Peach as she gets dragged into a, shall we say, <em>unique</em> relationship with the X-Nauts’ HAL-9000-like computer.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While I'll admit don’t have an encyclopedic memory of every line in the original version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, the writing in the remake is largely unchanged, down to NPCs making now-very-dated references to hot new games like Fire Emblem on the GBA. There are a few minor tweaks, such as party member Vivian’s characterization now being truer to the original Japanese version of the game, but that clever snap you remember remains. You could argue the writing doesn’t <em>quite</em> stand out like it once did as the kind of self-deprecating meta humor found in The Thousand-Year Door is now a much more common ingredient in Nintendo games. That said, I still spent a good portion of my time with the new TTYD smiling and chuckling at various fun moments I’d forgotten.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of gameplay, this is Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door as you remember it. If you’re afraid Nintendo may have secretly cut out all the tasty RPG bits, breathe easy. Leveling up by earning Star Points and customizing your play style with badges is still very much a thing. As before, combat combines turn-based decisions with well-timed button presses that either increase your offense or reduce the damage you take from enemies. The UI during battles is significantly cleaner and more readable now, but beyond that, not much has changed.</p>
<p>The game's level design also seems largely identical, perhaps to a fault. While more recent Paper Mario titles arguably backslid in terms of story and combat, they offered undeniable improvements in level design. By contrast, most of the areas in The Thousand-Year Door consist of a series of very straightforward linear paths littered with respawning enemies and the occasional puzzle, with players frequently having to engage in repetitive tasks and backtracking.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, a certain degree of effort has been made to tone down some of the more laborious aspects of The Thousand-Year Door. A better-designed quick-travel warp pipe room that can be accessed directly from the main plaza in Rogueport makes getting around later in the game a bit less of a hassle and some of the more repetitive chapters have had extra warp pipes added that eliminate some, but not all, the shlepping back and forth (I’m only halfway joking when I say the new Chapter 4 pipe shown above added a solid half-point to my score all on its own). That said, while developer Intelligent Systems has sanded down some of TTYD’s rough edges, there’s still a lot of repetitiveness baked into the game’s design. Part of me can’t help but dream of a more ambitious remake of TTYD where, say, the game’s great-in-concept pro-wrestling-themed chapter wasn’t such a deja-vu-inducing grind to get through.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to actual substantive changes, it seems Intelligent Systems mostly focused on The Thousand-Year Door’s visuals. While this may look like a simple remastering at first glance, the game has actually been fully rebuilt from the ground up. In addition to generally looking shaper, the paper theme is pushed harder, with almost everything in the game now looking as if it’s made of cardboard and origami. Improved lighting makes some of the moodier sections of the game, like Twilight Town, really pop, and little touches like reflective cobblestones in Rogueport or the background scenery during battles folding out like a popup book add some extra razzle-dazzle. The game is now capped at 30fps, but it doesn’t matter all that much as this isn’t exactly a hardcore action game and the various quick time button inputs during battles still feel just fine. Unlike some other recent Nintendo titles, that 30fps mostly remains solid, with only very brief hiccups during some of the flashier cutscenes.</p>
<p>Beyond the pretty new visuals, you have to dig into The Thousand-Year Door remake’s UI and menus to find any other new additions. A new quick-select wheel makes switching characters much less irritating and there’s now a “Notes” section where you can keep track of Trouble Center tasks, Star Pieces, Shine Sprites, and fortunes. There are also new Art and Sound Galleries, with the former being unlocked if you collect all the Star Pieces in an area.</p>

<p>While I may have come off somewhat critical of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in this review, there’s still an undeniable richness and depth to its world that no other game in the series has quite managed to achieve. Rogueport, with its varied cast of ne’er-do-wells and weirdos and countless secrets, is still one of my favorite locales I’ve ever visited with Nintendo’s plumber. Even with its minor streamlining, the new TTYD still serves up a solid 25-hour story with plenty of side content to clean up, including perhaps some small new post-game treats. This papery adventure definitely isn’t a lightweight.</p>

<p>While the new Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door preserves the gonzo charm that made the original game a cult classic, not a lot has been done to deal with its padding and other design quirks. If you’re a hardcore Thousand-Year Door fan, worry not, you’re going to love this spiffy new version. If you’re new to the game or weren’t entirely sold the first time around, you’re still likely to find plenty to enjoy here, but you may also notice a few tattered edges.</p>

  <p id="lgjP0h">If you’re looking to add some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/24152211/pokemon-center-bean-bags-shop-order-lechonk-gengar-jigglypuff">big-headed cutie patooties</a> to your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063771/life-size-psyduck-the-pokemon-center-buy-pre-order">Pokémon plushie collection</a>, well, you’re in luck. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon">The Pokémon Company International</a> announced Tuesday that it is bringing the colorful and playful Pokémon Soda Pop Plush collection stateside. Starting now, U.S.-based fans can purchase the toys exclusively via the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/">Pokémon Center</a> website. </p>
<p id="IvUIGw">The Pokémon Soda Pop Plush line is launching with the three Kanto starters: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Each toy costs $19.99, and all three Pokémon are available for purchase starting Tuesday. Those are the only Pokémon for now, but the company said that new additions will be “coming soon” to the Pokémon Center store. </p>
<p id="4zh1C0">It’s the first time The Pokémon Company International will sell this particular line of plushies outside of Japan. Each one was designed with Japanese illustrator and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fkaorism/?hl=en">graphic designer F*Kaori</a>, and each plush reflects the playful and colorful designs of the artist. These starter Pokémon have adorably large eyes to match a disproportionately large head, and lean into a cute pastel color palette. On first glance, they almost kind of look like stuffed versions of Funko Pops of plushies, except these are cuter and they don’t look dead inside. You can view a full photo gallery of the plushies below. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24159333/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="py1weo">There’s an apocryphal folktale that fans of Mario RPGs are fond of sharing. Somewhere along the line, the internet urban legend goes, someone at Nintendo — Miyamoto himself, maybe — had it out for Paper Mario. As a result, everything fans loved about the series — the RPG mechanics, the fun twists on classic Mario characters, the elaborate character-driven stories — became verboten. </p>
<p id="5Fu4mS">Nintendo can be an opaque company; it is very selective in what it shares and quite zealous in its secrecy, so any suggestion of palace intrigue can take on a life of its own in the fandom’s imagination. If there’s any truth to this tale, it’s mostly inferred from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/paper-mario-origami-king/">a 2020 interview with Paper Mario series developer Intelligent Systems</a>, in which two things are noted: (1) that former Paper Mario producer Kensuke Tanabe embraced a philosophy from Miyamoto to “challenge yourself to create new gameplay,” and (2) that “since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/6/3611372/paper-mario-sticker-star-review"><em>Paper Mario: Sticker Star</em></a>, it is no longer possible to modify Mario characters or create original characters that touch on the Mario universe.” These mandates, coincidentally, were opposed to the two things the Paper Mario games seemed best at. </p>
<p id="tTRcFI">The new remake of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em> is bound to reopen this wound. Almost immediately hailed upon its debut as the pinnacle of Mario’s journey into RPGs that began with the Nintendo/Squaresoft collaboration <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23960636/super-mario-rpg-2023-switch-remake-review"><em>Super Mario RPG</em></a>, the 2004 game was beloved for fine-tuning the Mario RPG experience in a colorful world chock full of strange new characters and goofy variations on the usual assortment of Goombas, Bob-ombs, and Koopas, with a witty story to match. </p>

<p id="DU7auo">While nostalgia has papered over (ha) some of <em>The Thousand Year Door</em>’s shaggier aspects — finicky platforming, a pretty slow start, and battles that can drag before you have a suite of fun abilities to deal with them — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134021/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-preview-nintendo-switch-ttyd">the remake makes its considerable bright spots shine brighter</a>. It’s largely a faithful 1:1 reconstruction of the original; most meaningful nonvisual additions are quality-of-life features meant to keep things moving. Multiple new hint systems make the game’s more byzantine puzzles and obscured objectives easier to parse (if desired), switching out party members is snappier, and the script gets some minor touch-ups.</p>
<p id="Uu0Vlc">Mostly, <em>The Thousand Year Door</em> will likely bum you out about modern Mario games, and how they seem like they’ll never again be this strange. While subsequent Paper Mario games (and its now-defunct sister series, Mario &amp; Luigi) would display comparable wit and charm, they would also feel hamstrung in retrospect, in complying with the aforementioned narrative limitations and Nintendo’s stated desire to largely have each new franchise entry be mechanically distinct. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/7/15/21324388/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em></a>, for example, isn’t a <em>bad</em> game; it’s just the clearest example of a Paper Mario that would immediately be improved were it free to more fully remake Mario’s world in its image, much like <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> did. </p>
<p id="K7VljC">Because even with its 20-year-old quirks, <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> dazzles with its large cast of oddballs, from the gossip-hound Goombella to the perpetually nervous Koops and the way-too-horny Madame Flurrie. (And she is <em>far </em>from the only one. <em>Every lady</em> in this game wants to jump Mario’s bones.) It’s got goofy new villains, the X-Nauts, that offend the sensibilities of classic villains (Bowser and his minions). It is a game where you want to talk to everyone to see if they have something funny to say — you could meet the Koopa who’s hooked on Fire Emblem,<em> </em>or learn just how much <em>no one cares </em>what Luigi is up to, even if he’s saving a whole other kingdom. In short, it uses its deviations from Mario canon to make the vanilla Mario cast shine that much brighter. </p>

<p id="C0fmi3">Of course, Mario is not in trouble currently. Far from it — he might be more popular than he’s ever been, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23669990/super-mario-bros-movie-review-references">a top-grossing movie in the books</a>, a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23546586/super-nintendo-world-universal-studios-hollywood">theme park</a>, and a regular cadence of critically acclaimed games across genres. Mario and his world are some of Nintendo’s most elastic creations, somehow making just as much sense behind the wheel of a go-kart or in a board game as they do in a 3D adventure. The embittered tenor of Paper Mario fans gets at something important, though: While there is plenty of fun to be had with Mario in 2024, none of it feels <em>daring</em>. </p>
<p id="2jJp9w"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is one of the last times that Mario didn’t feel like a carefully managed pop star, never allowed to appear even remotely unlikable. In <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em>, however, he can be a little prick, should you so choose, telling people to “beat it, loser!” as if a little paper mustachioed man was capable of intimidating anyone. The fact that this game is returning on its 20th anniversary, hot off the heels of a remake of the similarly idiosyncratic and beloved <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, hearkens back to a time when a big Mario game could be for a specific kind of person, and not necessarily for everyone. </p>

These characters make up a stunning fighting roster all by themselves.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Legends </em>games were an <em>X-Men </em>fan’s dream in the mid-2000s because they captured that special feeling where you and your friends play together as the titular group teaming up to overcome something no one person can defeat on their own. The action RPGs let up to four players play through a high-stakes <em>X-Men</em> story full of twists, turns, and a sizable roster of heroes and villains. The beat-em-up style combat is pretty rote by today’s standards, but each character had their own unique powers, so that playing as Wolverine felt distinct from playing as Magneto. Though the second game ended on a cliffhanger, we unfortunately never got a third game. <em>Legends </em>and <em>Rise of Apocalypse </em>understood that the appeal of a superhero game with as vast and varied a team as the X-Men is always how they differentiate themselves from one another, but still forma cohesive unit. Not many games capture that feeling like <em>Legends</em>.<br></p></div><div><p>The <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine </em>game has no right to be as good as it is. Not only was it a movie tie-in in the midst of the flood of bad licensed games getting churned out to capitalize on popular films, it’s also based on what is arguably the worst film in the <em>X-Men </em>film franchise (and those movies have a few stinkers). The <em>Origins: Wolverine </em>game, though, is a blast. Though it lacks the same depth as other character action games of the era, such as <em>Devil May Cry</em>, Raven Software’s take on Logan’s origin story has over-the-top style, frenetic combat, and a viciousness you don’t often find in Marvel games. There’s even an M-rated “Uncaged Version” that ups the gore to something you’d expect, considering Wolverine can just tear dudes to shreds. It kinda rules.<br></p></div><div><p>Everyone knows the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> franchise, but the <em>Vs.</em> branding began with<em> X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> in 1996. Sure, its roster isn’t as expansive, but it’s still a pretty impressive fighter that acted as launch pad for some of the best games in the genre. The 2D fighter draws from Capcom’s iconic fighting series, but also riffs on <em>Street Fighter</em>’s core concepts like letting you tag in a secondary character. This was the basis for the<em> Vs. </em>games that would follow and were far less restrained by <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em>’s parameters, but even so, it’s still a great fighting game with gorgeous sprite work that holds up to this day.<br></p></div><div><p>When it came to vibrant, appealing arcade beat-em-ups in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, Konami absolutely dominated the scene. While the company’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tmnt-ninja-turtles-best-games-teenage-mutant-mayhem-1850719693&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-ninja-turtles-best-games-teenage-mutant-mayhem-1850719693"><em>TMNT </em>games</a></span> and 1991’s <em>The Simpsons </em>are perhaps the most widely remembered today, for my money, nothing can top the sheer spectacle and excitement of 1992’s <em>X-Men</em>. Sure, the <em>TMNT </em>games and <em>The Simpsons </em>let you and three friends clobber enemies to your heart’s content, but <em>X-Men </em>arcade came in two variations: a standard four-player cabinet, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/sEwDIJQ9Kio?si=F2Y-enOKNCNH_02l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/sEwDIJQ9Kio?si=F2Y-enOKNCNH_02l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a deluxe, widescreen option</a></span> that let all <em>six </em>of its playable characters tackle Magneto’s forces at once. The six-player support allowed for considerably more onscreen mayhem, and boy, did the game’s wonderfully vivid visuals benefit from all the extra real estate the widescreen effect afforded. Even in a busy arcade in 1992 that was packed with games like <em>Mortal Kombat </em>and <em>Street Fighter II Turbo</em>, this bad boy stood out from the crowd.</p><p>By today’s standards, the gameplay may seem a bit on the simple side, but “simple” was not a bad thing when you and some buddies just wanted to hop into a game and enjoy slashing baddies as Wolverine or flinging tornadoes at them as Storm. The colorful, detailed graphics made it all look like a cartoon, and who could ever forget when Magneto, self-proclaimed “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/gjuWKAMAlQU?si=xo6v8uMBkNwYjdH9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/gjuWKAMAlQU?si=xo6v8uMBkNwYjdH9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master of magnet</a></span>,” struck fear into the hearts of players by declaring, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/IdAmkx8eAos?si=o2qAHTPQO9vickui&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/IdAmkx8eAos?si=o2qAHTPQO9vickui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Men, welcome…to DIE</a></span>!”? I kid, but <em>X-Men </em>really was a spectacular beat-em-up that made great use of its source material.</p></div><div><p>It’s wild to think about how <em>Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite </em>tossed the X-Men out the window when looking through Capcom’s Marvel fighting game history. <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom </em>is often forgotten when talking about Marvel and Capcom’s relationship over the years. It’s a shame because before there were any <em>Vs. </em>games, there was this 1994 fighting game. <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em> was the first fighting game Capcom made that featured Marvel characters, and it was loosely tied into the <em>X-Men </em>animated series from the ‘90s that’s getting a second wind with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-creator-beau-demayo-season-2-disney-marvel-1851488316&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-creator-beau-demayo-season-2-disney-marvel-1851488316"><em>X-Men ‘97</em></a></span>.</p><p>Capcom put what it had learned from <em>Street Fighter</em> into a solid X-Men fighting game that still looks slick today. The 2D sprites and animation are on-par with some modern sprite-based fighters, and its roster is so well-realized it’s like they’re coming right off a comic book page. </p></div><div><p><em>X-Men Mutant Apocalyps</em>e is one of the more limited X-Men games in terms of who you can play, but the beat-em-up was a triumph for the series on the SNES. It includes different missions for each of its playable characters, all of whom have different abilities, objectives, and challenges to overcome. Its mix of platforming and tough-as-nails make up for its relatively short runtime, and for the time, it was one of the strongest summations of the X-Men that had been put to a game cartridge.</p><hr><p>Looking back, it’s all-too-apparent Marvel hasn’t given the X-Men a lot of video game love in the past decade. Though they’ve made appearances in games like <em>Midnight Suns</em>, the team is due for a starring role soon. Luckily, at least one of them will get the spotlight when Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine </em>comes to PlayStation 5.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1792722028354818287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, the official Kingdom Hearts feed announced that multiple entries in the hit series are finally coming to Steam on June 13, 2024.</p>



<p>The content will include Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX, HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, and Kingdom Hearts 3 + Re Mind. The first two each include multiple titles, while Kingdom Hearts 3 also comes with the Re Mind DLC.</p>



<p>These titles feature the beloved Dark Seeker Saga, so that newcomers can catch up on Sora’s signature adventure.</p>



<p>According to Square Enix’s <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/kingdom-hearts-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog</a>, players can also purchase the Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece. It’s a bundle of all three experiences, and it also comes with the platform-exclusive Keyblade “Dead of Night.” </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Previously, Kingdom Hearts was only available on PC via the Epic Games Store. Players can also find the games on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and cloud versions on the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Fans are already hoping for a Steam Deck experience, mods, and more with the Steam release. However, Square Enix did not confirm the exact pricing for any of Kingdom Hearts’ Steam versions, or the Integrum Masterpiece bundle.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Kingdom Hearts fans are also waiting for the fourth installment of the hit series. Square Enix has not confirmed very much about the next game, nor a release window. However, rumors from last April suggest Kingdom Hearts 4 could potentially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in 2025</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Senua's Saga: Hellblade II - Official Launch Trailer (ft. 'Animal Soul' by AURORA)</p>
      </div>
<p>Hellblade II is exclusive on console to Xbox Series X|S thanks to Microsoft owning developer Ninja Theory and the game franchise. The game is available now on Game Pass for Xbox and PC, or it can be purchased outright for $50 USD. While Microsoft is bringing some of its first-party games to rival platforms, like PlayStation 5, Hellblade II has not been confirmed for Sony's system.</p><p>You can see a sampling of the review scores for Hellblade II below. For more on the critical reaction to Hellblade II, head to GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Game:</strong> Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</li><li><strong>Platform:</strong> Xbox Series X|S, PC</li><li><strong>Developer:</strong> Ninja Theory</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 21</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $50, also included with Game Pass.</li></ul><h2>GameSpot -- 6/10</h2><p>"While few games can rival Hellblade 2's sound, graphic fidelity, and talent for rendering stunning vistas and characters so expressive you can tell when they're tensing their jaws, I couldn't help thinking how gorgeous the game would be if what was depicted was more varied. There are a few memorable set pieces I won't spoil, but even compared to its predecessor--which led players through tombs, razed towns, haunted woods, chamber halls, and let them face off against giants, a rotting boar, towering stag-headed monsters, and the god of illusions--there is surprisingly little variation in Hellblade 2's settings and monsters." -- <em>Jessica Cogswell </em>[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-hell-and-high-water/1900-6418229/" data-ref-id="1900-6418229">Full review</a>]</p><h2>GamesRadar -- 5/5</h2><p>"Haunting, confrontational, and deeply cathartic all at once, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is a stunning feat of video game art. Ninja Theory doesn't tiptoe around its heavy themes but welcomes them with well-honed empathy, tempered by an even keener creative edge this time around to deliver an unforgettable narrative adventure experience that's hard to watch, yet harder to turn away from." -- <em>Jasmine Gould-Wilson </em>[<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Metro UK -- 5/10</h2><p>"A joyless slog of barely interactive entertainment and a muddled portrayal of mental illness… that just so happens to have the best graphics ever on a video game console." -- <em>no author byline provided </em>[<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-best-console-graphics-ever-20874219/?ico=mosaic_gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Press Start Australia -- 9/10</h2><p>"Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is the only first-party Xbox game this generation that has screamed, with any confidence, 'next-gen' to me. All at once it’s an audiovisual tour de force, a tremendous next chapter in Senua's battle that strikes many disparate moods, and although it doesn't take enormous swings to reinvent itself, its refinements make Saga a worthwhile successor to Senua's Sacrifice." -- <em>Brodie Gibbons </em>[<a href="https://press-start.com.au/reviews/xbox-series-x-reviews/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-a-new-hope/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Game Informer -- 9/10</h2><p>"Senua's Saga: Hellblade II's conclusion ends on another strong note, and despite my initial reservations about continuing Senua's story, I walked away happy to see her conquer new monsters, both literal and metaphorical. I'm pleased Ninja Theory avoided the temptation to blow up this formula into something far bigger than needed--this isn't Xbox's God of War; it's a better Hellblade. The first game is a famous example of not needing to be fun in the traditional sense to be engaging. This sequel sprinkles more broadly appealing thrills while retaining the thoughtful storytelling and artistry few triple-A games possess." -- <em>Marcus Stewart </em>[<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/conquering-old-demons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>IGN -- 8/10</h2><p>"Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is another Viking-worthy feast for the senses that meets the high bar set by its predecessor, even if it never really manages to clear it." -- <em>Tristan Ogilvie </em>[<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">My time as a Nintendo fangirl playing on a GameCube feels like the halcyon days. Between <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-metroid-prime-remastered-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime</a></em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em>, <em>Eternal Darkness</em>, and <em>F-Zero GX</em>, I was always deep into something that would endure as an all-time favorite.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">Then I remember those were also the years I was in high school, which were years of trauma that helped shape me into the mess I am today. That’s maybe why those games shine brightly in my memory; they were backed by total darkness.</p> <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">Speaking of which: <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. A 20-year-old high-water mark that the series may never return to.</p> <figure data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false"><strong><strong><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> (<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a> [reviewed])<br>Developer:</strong> Intelligent Systems<strong><br>Publisher: </strong>Nintendo<strong><br>Released: May 23, 2024<br>MSRP: $59.99</strong></strong></p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is the second in the series, and the follow-up to – bear with me here – 2000’s <em>Paper Mario</em>. The series started off as something of a successor to <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. In fact, the original working title of <em>Paper Mario</em> was <em>Super Mario RPG 2</em>, and that’s how I first saw it in an issue of Nintendo Power.</p>
 <p data-characters="135" data-current-count="135" data-injectable="false">What the series have in common is a simplification of the JRPG format. Aside from that, they’re almost entirely different approaches.</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">However, the story is rather familiar. Mario has to collect seven stars. Stars tend to be the solution to all of Mario’s problems. At this point, the narrative framework has been so well-trodden that it actually points fun at it, by having Luigi embark on an extremely similar MacGuffin gathering quest that he’ll tell you about at the start of each chapter.</p>
 <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="185" data-injectable="false">Luigi’s quest actually sounds a bit more interesting. Not that the one in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is terrible or anything. But everything is better when Luigi is involved.</p> <figure data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCV-uTRULn8?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">The story kicks off (and largely takes place) in Rogueport. The characters describe it as a wretched hive of scum and villainy, which is already kind of a hilarious concept in a Mario game. Sure enough, the infrastructure is crumbling, people who skulk in dark alleys talk about how much they love crime, and gangs talk about holding dominion over a small chunk of the town’s four blocks.</p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">The town sits on top of ancient ruins, and in these ruins is the eponymous spooky door. Allegedly this door holds great treasure, so Princess Peach, like all monarchs, wants this treasure for herself. But also like all monarchs, she doesn’t want to do it herself, so she mails it to Mario while she pursues her passion of getting kidnapped.</p>
 <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">Mario, the ever-obedient working-class hero, sets off and immediately starts solving people’s problems in return for Crystal Stars and things you can just find on the ground. Really, the story doesn’t throw any huge curveballs that you can’t see telegraphed from a mile away. In fact, one of its best pieces of exposition has you guessing the twist in dialogue.</p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="812" data-injectable="true">But it’s the journey, and not the reason for it, that makes <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> so memorable. Each of the game’s chapters could be their own episodic game, as while they’re linked by the central mechanics, they are each largely self-contained and entirely unique. I don’t want to spoil it for anyone who didn’t play the original ‘04 release, but you’ll probably come away with your own rankings of all the chapters.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">The combat uses a unique system where everything is played out in front of a live audience. Your party consists of Mario and his partner, though that partner can be swapped out mid-combat. It brings in the hallmark of all Mario RPG systems, by which I mean “timed hits” or “actions” as they’re simply called. You perform these by either pressing a button at the correct time during an attack, or playing a short mini-game.</p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">There are also stylish moves for appealing to the crowd. Your ultra-special moves require star power to perform, and that means exciting the audience. The more audience members you have, the more star power you get when you rile them up. It’s not as complex as it maybe sounds, but it’s a fun extra layer on the otherwise simple turn-based combat.</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">Outside of combat is similarly simple. Dungeons don’t get too devious, though there are plenty of secrets enticing you to stick your finger into every nook. It makes use of the paper aesthetic to have you peel away scenery or turn into a boat to traverse water hazards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="635" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">What I find interesting is that, while <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> lacks complexity, it’s also not as signposted as modern games. You can get a hint from your partner, but there are times when it will stop you and force you to think about what you’re supposed to be doing. I don’t just mean when solving puzzles, either. It will sometimes ask you to recall where you met a specific character or what happened earlier. You can always ask for a hint from your partner, but sometimes they’ll just tell you to think hard about one particular spot. It struck me that a lot of modern mainstream games won’t ask this of you.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">The dialogue is what makes <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> really excel. Like most RPGs, the world is infested with NPCs, but most of them here are given a loving touch to bring them alive. Each one has its own priorities and fixations, and they’re all just so bitchy.</p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">You generally expect that a <em>Mario </em>game is going to keep on its kid gloves, and to an extent, <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> does. There’s nothing graphic or explicit, but some of it pushes the line. It can often be quite cutting, or just extremely clever. There’s a depth to it that makes even <em>Mario’s</em> bizarre, fungal-centric world seem real. But most of all, you can tell that the writers had a lot of fun with it. It’s awash with personality, something else that tends to be lost in mainstream games of today.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true">For those of us who did play the 2004 original, there’s enough in the Switch version to make it worthwhile. While much of what made the original so special remains unchanged (though, I didn’t see the scene where the robot spies on Peach showering), there are some additions that go beyond just being a simple upscaled port.</p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">The weirdest is actually the graphical upgrades. A lot of small details have been redone, which is nice. But for some reason, part of the overhaul is to make everything slightly reflective. Like, it’s still paper, but it’s glossy or laminated for some reason. To be fair, it looks really good. It was very pleasing to my brain to see these gentle reflections on every surface. However, I think the idea behind the <em>Paper Mario</em> aesthetic is that it’s a collection of hand-crafted dioramas. I don’t know anyone who crafts with glossy paper.</p>
 <p data-characters="675" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">The new soundtrack is extremely helpful, however. There’s a badge you can get early on that allows you to change to the original soundtrack, but I don’t think the nostalgia is worth it. The new compositions generally stick to the tracks from the original, but it’s greatly expanded. This is best demonstrated through the battle theme, which changes depending on the section of the game you’re in. It’s always the same tune, but the instrumentation is different in each area, providing a new twist. Considering <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> can take around 40 hours to complete, not having to listen to the exact same music every time combat starts is welcome.</p>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">Beyond that, there are other tweaks to the gameplay, some of which I can’t really get into. It’s not a complete overhaul, but it is a slightly more comfortable experience.</p> <figure data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is the series’ concept delivered with maximum effectiveness. The games have seen their ups and downs since then, and that’s partially because they had to find a new direction. They could keep revisiting the same formula, but it’s hard to improve on perfection, and even that would get old after a while.</p> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="767" data-injectable="true">But the fact that <em>Paper Mario</em> did diverge after <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> makes this remaster even more effective. It’s been absent for 20 years, and the new territory that has been covered since then hasn’t resulted in the discovery of the same magic. It’s a new opportunity to see the series’ apogee. It’s a reminder that while the JRPG-lite approach has its limitations, with the right voice, it can really sing.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-purchase</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-buys-hogwarts-legacy-and-mortal-kombat-porting-studio-shiver.877092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-purchase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it is to purchase&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>porting studio Shiver Entertainment from former owner Embracer Group.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notice announcing the acquisition</a>, Nintendo says it will acquire "100% of [Shiver's] outstanding shares", making the company a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese gaming giant.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, Shiver is an "experienced and accomplished" porting studio, although given the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-for-switch-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">response</a> to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-mortal-kombat-1-is-an-excellent-console-game-but-switch-simply-isnt-good-enough" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Switch version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, I suspect there are some out there who will disagree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=ABc56L6n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=vQ1y7GdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shiver Entertainment is perhaps best-known for porting&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>to Switch (although the PC version is pictured here).</figcaption></figure><p>The notice goes on to say that Nintendo will utilize Shiver's talents as "high-level resources for porting and developing software titles".</p>

<p>From Shiver's perspective, it doesn't sound like much will change; Nintendo says Shiver's "focus will remain the same" and that the studio will continue to take "commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch".</p>

<p>Nintendo also says that the Shiver acquisition will have "only a minor effect" on its fiscal results for the year, so although the amount for which Shiver was acquired hasn't been disclosed, it's unlikely to be a devastatingly expensive transaction for Nintendo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-switch-nintendo-shiver-entertainment.jpg?itok=2t3UhA6Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-switch-nintendo-shiver-entertainment.jpg?itok=b4RX_QUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Shiver's name from its&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>Switch port.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's purchase of Shiver comes at a time when Embracer Group is undergoing a rather drastic restructuring that will see it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">split into three different companies</a>.</p>

<p>The first, Coffee Stain and Friends, will handle IPs like&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, while Middle-earth and Friends will oversee major IP like&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and more.</p>

<p>Finally, tabletop giant Asmodee will constitute the third company in Embracer's restructuring effort, and the studio has already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group">saddled with almost a billion euros in debt</a> as a result of the restructuring.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Nintendo's purchase of Shiver Entertainment will yield, but you can expect to see the studio's name on more ports in the future, it seems. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<li><strong>Drag Mode:</strong> This mode redefines racing in Need for Speed Unbound with a fresh approach when players need to take a break from the track. It's a deep dive into the essence of street racing, where the thrill comes from manual gear shifts, strategic lane changes to avoid obstacles, and perfectly timed nitrous boosts. With up to four players, it's not just about the fastest car, it's about the sharpest driver. Drag playlists have also been added to PVP and Free Roam.</li>
<li><strong>League Mode:</strong> In Need for Speed Unbound, The League revives the competitive spirit of Need for Speed Underground and offers a richer solo experience in Free Roam. Challenge new rival racers in head-to-head battles throughout the game to win their unique rides. This feature also introduces a community challenge that requires a collective effort to unlock the final boss and claim a new custom. With Rival Racers appearing regularly and new leagues on the way, this is where strategy, skill, and community come together to push players to earn their place among the legends of street racing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Need for Speed Unbound Vol.7 also adds the BMW M3 Competition Touring '23 and the Ford Mustang Dark Horse '24. These cars are fully customizable and include several unlockable body kit options. Players can get them by completing the Speed Pass and Premium Speed Pass, as outlined below.</p>

            <p>
After completing this morning's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wordle">Wordle</a> I found myself drawn to a "New!" link advertising WordleBot, a smart-sounding addition to The New York Times app which promised to analyse my puzzle solution and compare it with others. (I got today's word in six, for which I'm still feeling a little shameful.)
</p>
<p>
Scrolling through its results I was impressed - not only does WordleBot show how other players began today's game and then narrowed down the solution over subsequent guesses, it also shows how WordleBot itself, programmed with a set of rules and likelihoods, fared too. (WordleBot only got today's word after five guesses, which immediately made me feel a little better.)
</p>
<p>
This was my first experience of WordleBot, a program I now understand has existed for some time online, but has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/crosswords/wordlebot-games-app.html">only this week been added to the New York Times puzzle app</a> - where I play a set routine of Wordle, the Mini Crossword and then (if I'm not running too late by this point) Connections as well.

<p>
Writing back in 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/upshot/wordle-wordlebot-new.html?pgtype=Article&amp;action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks">The New York Times</a> described its work-in-progress Wordlebot as "the tool that sometimes uplifts you when you think your Wordle performance has been terrible, and sometimes chides you when you think you've played superbly". And after a pretty poor six-guess run today, I do feel a little better. 
</p>
<p>
To begin with, Wordlebot says my starting guess was strong - but unlucky with today's word. I always pick TEARS, which is a relatively popular choice in the grand scheme of things (a subsequent screen tells me it's 17th out of all possible starting words, though most people pick either ADIEU or AUDIO.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_sX1BT4B.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>A set of Wordlebot results showing partial guesses to today's Wordle. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / The New York Times</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Wordlebot always starts with CRANE, a word The New York Times has chosen specifically and has changed over time (it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/upshot/wordle-wordlebot-starting-word.html">used to be TRACE</a>, and in hard mode is now TROPE). Interestingly, though, Wordlebot's CRANE was an even tougher pick today, requiring 3.6 guesses to solve versus TEARS' 3.3. (So, at least at that point, I should have beaten Wordlebot! Darn.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> From here on out, we show the solution to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-answer-today-21-may-1067-9433">today's Wordle puzzle</a>. Beware!
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-2_uGeyx6F.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>A set of Wordlebot results showing partial guesses to today's Wordle. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / The New York Times</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Delving on through each guess, I came to my fourth attempt - PILON - which I'm pretty sure was me just trying random placements for the vowels at this point and not expecting anything to work. Wordlebot is impressed by my knowledge of the word, though happy to tell me it was probably too obscure to be a likely result. Hard agree! 
</p>
<p>
After an unlucky start and some mid-game stumbles, I'm cheered to see Wordlebot also went for BINGO before the ultimate answer DINGO, which I initially discounted for being too obscure to Americans. Ah, well. But, as mentioned, WordleBot still took only one fewer guess to arrive at the right result. It feels like today was a tricky one in general?
</p>
<p>
All in all, it's fascinating stuff - and something I'm going to use in future as I play.  One downside, though - after your first look, Wordlebot reveals itself to be a paid-for feature, so you'll need to stump up £2.99 a month from here on out for more. But hey, if it helps you feel better about your results - and I think I need do - then maybe give it a try?

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-hearts-steam-releases-confirmed-for-next-month.877077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series is making its way to Steam next month, marking the first time it's been available outside of the Epic Games Store on PC.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the Steam releases, Square Enix announces the games will be available on Steam from June 13th and provides a rundown of the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series as it currently stands (or as close to one as it's possible to provide, anyway).</p>

<p>The three major&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>releases you can currently buy on the Epic Games Store will be available on Steam, but it looks like rhythm-action title&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory">Melody of Memory</a>&nbsp;</em>is missing out on a Steam release, at least for now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-frozen.jpg?itok=9cAWwOG- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-frozen.jpg?itok=1JjcLajH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and its predecessors are coming to Steam soon.</figcaption></figure><p>So, which games in the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series are heading to Steam? You'll have to bear with me, because this can get a little complicated.</p>

<p>First up, there's the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX&nbsp;</em>collection. This includes&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 2</em>, as well as spinoffs <i>Re:Chain of Memories</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Birth by Sleep</em>. It also includes&nbsp;<em>358/2 Days</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Re:Coded&nbsp;</em>in cinematic form.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em>, meanwhile, includes&nbsp;<em>Dream Drop Distance HD</em>, a rework of a game that originally appeared on 3DS in 2012. It also includes an HD movie by the name of&nbsp;<em>Back Cover</em>, as well as a short sequence starring&nbsp;<em>Birth by Sleep</em>'s Aqua.</p>

<p>Lastly, you'll be able to grab&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-hearts-iii-remind-review"><em>Re Mind&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>, which are packaged together in the Steam version.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-birth-by-sleep-cast.jpg?itok=2FJfSwkG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-birth-by-sleep-cast.jpg?itok=sJ0ZKjU4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Birth by Sleep&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>spinoffs you'll need to play to fully understand the series' story.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to purchase all of the aforementioned collections separately, but a bundle containing all of them will also be up for grabs. It's called&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>, because of course it is.</p>

<p>If you buy that bundle, you'll get yourself a bonus Keyblade called the Dead of Night. You'll also get that Keyblade if you pick up&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Re Mind</em>, so presumably, the Keyblade is specifically for use in that game.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>and its many sequels and spinoffs (although not all of them, unfortunately) make their way to Steam on June 13th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p data-characters="306" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you were expecting a new <em>Helldivers 2 </em>patch to drop today, don’t. In fact, developer Arrowhead Game Studios can’t confirm when its next patch will arrive, with community manager Thomas ‘Twinbeard’ Petersson saying the team wants to “take some more time for this one.”</p> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">When asked on Discord (as highlighted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cx45ru/no_patch_today_dont_know_when_next_one_will_be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>) when players can expect the next patch, Twinbeard only answered with “When it’s done,” adding that future patches may potentially come out less frequently. He explained that the team has felt it’s been putting out patches too often, which risks making it difficult to “maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">Twinbeard’s not exactly wrong. <em>Helldivers 2</em> has seen a near-constant stream of patches since its February launch to address bugs and glitches as well as add new content to the game. As an ongoing live-service, this regularity does seem like it can only be a good thing, but some feel that<em> </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-helldivers-2-pushing-forward-far-too-quickly-for-its-own-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> has been growing and updating too quickly</a>, and pushing out so much so often is affecting the quality of the updates.</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Twinbeard also explained how patching a lot can “easily disrupt work flow and takes more resources than you might think.” This is why the studio is opting to slow things down a bit and stretch the next patch out, “hopefully with a good result.”</p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="false">Players would need to adjust not having patches drop at least once a week, but it may be beneficial for <em>Helldivers 2</em> in the long run, and allow for more meaningful updates and content additions. It’s strange, though, that what seems like a pretty significant notice for players has been delegated to the Discord channel. There’s no mention of this on the official Twitter account or Steam page, with it falling to fans to spread the word around.</p>

            <p>PlayStation's London Studio has shared a short goodbye with its community, following the announcement of its closure by Sony.</p>
<p>"For over 20 years London Studio has been home to some exceptionally talented and wonderful people in the games industry," it wrote on social media platform X. "As we close the doors, and all go forward to new adventures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you, to all our past and present, players and colleagues who have supported us over the years.</p>
<p>"We've had one wild and wonderful journey!"</p>
<p>The studio then signed off with a waving emoji, and a single blue heart.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony announced it was laying off 900 people</a>, equating to eight percent of its workforce. At this time, it announced it would close London Studio as part of these layoffs.</p>
<p>Ahead of its closure, London Studio was working on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-ps5-online-game">online game for the PlayStation 5</a>, which was going to be set in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-online-co-op-combat-game-set-in-fantasy-london">fantasy version of the UK's capital</a>.</p>
<p>In 2022, co-studio heads Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders shared more details about this game, calling it the team's "most ambitious project to date".</p>
<p>"With this project, we really wanted to explore some new avenues and set ourselves some new challenges," Whyte said. "We definitely wanted to try something a little bit different, and I think this new project really channels our 'brave' value and allows us to push ourselves on the 'curious' front, too. It's an exciting future, it really is."</p>
<p>The studio's earlier games, meanwhile, include the SingStar and EyeToy series, to name but two.</p> <div>

            <p>
Microsoft has shown off how its Copilot AI feature will soon be able to give players a helping hand in games such as Minecraft by offering up real-time advice. 
</p>
<p>

The company shared two videos to its social media account on X last night, demonstrating this feature. In the first video, a person playing Minecraft needs some assistance crafting a sword. 
</p>
<p>

"To craft a sword, you'll need some materials," Copilot says, prompting the player to open their inventory. The Copilot notices the player does not have all the necessary resources available, so offers a suggestion of what to do next.

<p>

A second video shared, still with Minecraft as an example, shows the player being besieged by a zombie. The Copilot once again offers up some useful advice to the player. "Run! You need to get away from it fast. Either sprint away or quickly build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach."

</p>
<p>
"Real personality. Effortless interactions. The ability to see what we see. I've long argued that AIs with EQ, IQ and AQ are coming. Here's the first real glimpse of what it's gonna feel like," Suleyman wrote. "It's a magical experience: smart, intuitive, natural, and useful."

            <p>
A new report states that 46 percent of players use gaming for self-expression, to ignite their imagination, and for creation.
</p>
<p>
That's according to this year's fifth annual Inside Gaming Report, published by entertainment and gaming wiki Fandom.
</p>
<p>
As well as indicating the prevalence of character creators in games, the results come as little surprise considering the popularity of live-service and sandbox games like Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox in which creativity is paramount.
</p>

<p>

While the top reason why people play games is for stress relief and to unwind at 54 percent, creation and self-expression is the second most likely reason at 46 percent - an increase of 10 percent compared to last year's report. 
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the most popular form of customisation used for self-expression is character personalisation (76 percent), followed by Gamertags and usernames (48 percent) and communication (35 percent).
</p>
<p>
Further, 80 percent of players claim their gaming personality differs from real life, while 64 percent believe it's easier to be themselves online than in person. Of course, games offer a level of fantasy to players, but they're also a powerful way for players to explore an idealised version of themselves.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, 72 percent of respondents surveyed would think more favourably on a brand that allowed a player's online and real-life presence to be aligned, especially players from minority backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
The findings are from a survey of 5000 entertainment and gaming fans, as well as an analysis of first-party data.
</p>
<p>
Key games offering self-expression, according to the report, include the likes of Roblox, Minecraft, Genshin Impact, Grand Theft Auto, Fortnite, The Sims, and Stardew Valley.
</p>
<p>
These rank among the most popular games of the moment, so it's unclear if they are popular due to the inclusion of self-expression, or if self-expression has become more integral for players due to the popularity of these games.
</p>
<p>
Either way, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-might-the-ultimate-character-creator-look-like">character creators are a primary way for players to explore creativity and identity</a>, though diverse representation is required.

</p>
<p>
What's more, these stats play into the popularity of live-service games and developers' concern over their sustainability. 
</p>
<p>
A survey by the Game Developer Collective reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/70-of-developers-concerned-about-sustainability-of-live-service-games-new-study-suggests">70 percent of developers have concerns over the sustainability of live service games</a>, particularly with players losing interest over time as well as competition with other live-service games and rising user acquisition costs.

</p>
<p>
So while players may enjoy these types of games to express themselves, for developers it's a crowded and highly competitive market.

<p data-characters="216" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s latest FPS competitor is finally here, and <em>XDefiant</em> not only brings high-octane action to your PC or console, but 13 Trophies that you can also earn to prove you’re a true fan of the game. </p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">For some, collecting Trophies is not just a side-quest on your gaming experience, but a necessity. Some people are simply completionists, and if a game developer puts a challenge in front of them, they just can’t help but grind the game until they’ve ticked them all off. </p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">Truthfully, I’ve never managed to unlock every Trophy for any game, ever, but with just 13 Trophies total, <em>XDefiant</em> might be the first one I manage to do it on. If you want to see the achievements and how to complete them, we’ve created a list below. </p>

 <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, none of these are too difficult to complete, so getting them all done should be possible, and just requires a little time to get through them. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Does <em>XDefiant</em> have a platinum Trophy?</h2> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">No, <em>XDefiant</em> does not feature a platinum Trophy on PlayStation, and will only feature bronze, silver, and gold achievements. If you’re only interested in playing games that include platinum Trophies, I’d suggest giving this one a miss. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-announce-ai-copilot-for-pc-and-xbox-games-shoving-ai-into-minecraft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has presented their next generation AI enhanced PC’s and Surface tablets, and along with it the reveal that their AI Copilot software will soon be embedded in PC and Xbox games. The first will be Minecraft and you can see it in action in the short video below.</p>
<p>https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1792630909151133768</p>


<p>Microsoft has been aggressively pursuing AI over the past couple of years, investing billions into OpenAI, adding it to their Bing search engine and trying to find ways to apply it to Windows, Office and now Xbox gaming.</p>
<p>As you can see form the Minecraft demo, the player can simply use their own voice to ask for help within the game and Copilot will tell them exactly what they need to do with natural language interactions. In this instance, Copilot can be asked for a crafting recipe and the AI will check you have everything needed in your inventory, guide you through collecting anything else you need, and take you step-by-step through the process of crafting a sword.</p>
<p>it’s a clever demo that will send a shiver down the spine of gaming sites that rely on guides to be profitable, but there’s a lot of question marks for how this will actually work. Microsoft is putting an emphasis on privacy, which will mean that Copilot tools will try to run locally before polling the cloud, and that will require dedicated hardware with new chips featuring an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) – the demos used PCs with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite chips featuring a hefty built-in NPU.</p>

<p>There’s also other things to overcome. For an AI to be useful, it also needs to be all-knowing and always available. While AIs can analyse what they see on screen, that will be a much more intensive process than having APIs and direct hooks into the backend of a game – otherwise they can’t really know what’s in your full inventory, where you are on the world map you are, what the quest steps are or anything else that they need. Game developers and engine developers will probably need to put in the systems for AI to interact with.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, gaming AIs will also need to have all the answers, and who’s going to give these to them? If game guides become unprofitable (which they would do if everyone just asked AI what to do instead of visiting websites) then sites would stop publishing them… but without the game guides, the AI has nothing to reference and could give players the wrong information. And so it’ll then be up to the game developers to provide them, but devs have enough on their plate just making the games. Sony already has a developer-led video hints and tips system built into the PS5 system software for trophies, but they’re far from universal.</p>
<p>Then there’s Microsoft’s rivals. They can put this into all their games and systems, but they’re in third place this generation, and who knows what their future games business is going to look like? If Sony and Nintendo don’t put AI assistants in their future games consoles and chipsets, then third party developers almost certainly won’t bother. It’s not like Sony or Nintendo are going to use MIcrosoft’s AI for that anyway.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like the way things are going, but Microsoft’s vision for what AI assistants will be like when added into video games still has a long way to go.</p>
<p><em>via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-ai-will-be-inside-minecraft-and-other-xbox-pc-games-new-copilot-features-will-search-your-inventories-offer-tips-and-guides">Windows Central</a></em></p>

            <p>The music in haunting 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norco">Norco</a> was so good it’s one of the few soundtracks I’ve actually bought on Steam, so I’m deeply intrigued to learn that developer Geography of Robots are putting music - and dancing - front and center in the new demo for their next project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silenus">Silenus</a>. You can bop your way between screens, reader!</p>

<p>Swapping out Norco’s Southern gothic for techno industrial (also somewhat gothic) vibes, Silenus offers the chance to “uncover the secrets of an oil refinery operated by an obscure organization in this short, atmospheric narrative adventure.” Don’t take my word about Steam’s word about the developer’s word on it, though, that’d be sheer madness. There’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">free demo </a>available. I initially thought the choice to name it the ‘Umbilical Pre-Release Demo’ was just the devs being arty. But it actually refers to the album Umbilical from contributors Thou, who did loads of Norco’s soundtrack. By playing the demo, you’ll be able to unlock the entire album to listen to in-game. Creatives creatively boosting the creative work of other creatives? What is this, some sort of good timeline?</p>
<p>Here are some more Steam deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rubens Link, an enigmatic company with an unclear agenda, has taken control of the Gulf Flow oil refinery. Officially, they're introducing new automation technologies, but the changes they've implemented suggest something more confounding. In this narrative micro-adventure, you play as Titian, Rubens Link's flagship android. Explore the refinery’s machinery, tank farms, and offices, deciphering clues from computer logs, discarded journals, and the remnants of vanished workers. Solve puzzles, absorb the atmospheric soundscapes of FmAura &amp; Gewgawly I, interact with unique characters, and wander deeper down the rabbit hole of Gulf Flow Oil.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was going to do a bit about ‘Reuben’s link’ but I already linked the demo. Not a massive loss for comedy, honestly. For what it’s worth, I loved Norco to haunted little bits. It was a brilliantly written 2D adventure set in  South Louisiana that makes me want to use words like 'hauntological' and such. Silenus is in 3D and takes a completely different visual approach, but as much as I’d have eaten up another offering in Norco’s vein, it’s great to see Geography of Robots not pigeonholing themselves this early. Silenus is currently “very early in development”, which gives you enough room to go play Norco. Twice!</p>
