    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rod Fergusson is "stepping away" from his leadership role at Blizzard.</p>
<p>In a brief statement on social media, Fergussion said "the teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead," adding he was "looking forward to what comes next for Diablo and for me".</p>

<p>Fergusson did not give a specific reason for leaving, and declined to comment further when asked by press. It's also unclear who will head the Diablo team going forward.</p>
<p>"After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it's time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what's next," he wrote.</p>
<p>"The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me."</p> <div>

<p>Blizzard president Johanna Faries <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653">added</a>: "Guiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration.

<p>Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> said Fergusson "brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming's most iconic franchises".</p>
<p>"Playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> with you was a blast – thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community," he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xboxp3.bsky.social/post/3lvvuhk4ags26">added</a>.</p>
<p>Fergusson joined Blizzard as the new head of Diablo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rod-fergusson-exist-gears-developer-to-become-diablo-boss-at-blizzard">back in February 2020</a>. Before that, he worked on the Gears of War franchise for 15 years, save for a stint at Irrational to close out the development of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>. He left Gears developer The Coalition after the launch of mobile spin-off Gears Pop!, mainline game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gears-5">Gears 5</a>, and ahead of the launch of strategy spin-off Gears Tactics.</p>
<p>Fergusson's departure comes just days after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-once-again-accusing-activision-blizzard-of-using-ai-generated-art-in-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-event-marketing-materials">fans accused Blizzard of using AI-generated "slop"</a> in its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> x Hearthstone crossover event.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b44fcfe89baf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's share price is continuing to skyrocket following the early success of the Switch 2.</p>
<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1hvKXq_2OAxXDQUEAHc-KMGgQ3ecFegQINxAT&amp;window=MAX">Google Finance</a>, the company's share price currently sits at a staggering <strong>¥14,355</strong>. For context, this is now double Nintendo's value at the height of the Wii era.</p>
<p>On 31st October 2007, the markets closed with Nintendo sitting at <strong>¥7,170</strong>. Naturally, things took a turn for the worse following this, thanks in part to the 2008 financial crisis and the unfortunate failure of the Wii U in 2012.</p>
<p>But now, with Nintendo recently confirming that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">sold more than 6 million Switch 2 units</a> since its launch on 5th June 2025, things are looking up (and up, and up). In addition, it's made no chances to its forecast for the year ahead, meaning the company expects to sell at least 15 million Switch 2 units before the end of the financial year. Wowie zowie!</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Share Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b821061d0d27/nintendo-share-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1hvKXq_2OAxXDQUEAHc-KMGgQ3ecFegQINxAT&amp;window=MAX">Google Finance</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reception around the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World Direct</a> has been mixed, to say the least, but it's clear that Nintendo has a pretty solid line-up of Switch 2 games in the months ahead. You've got first-party titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, along with big third-party offerings like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a>.</p>
<p>Uncertainty lingers around the price of the Switch 2 – particularly following recent price increases of Switch 1 hardware in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/heres-how-much-nintendo-switch-online-is-going-up-in-canada">Canada</a> – and there remains <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">significant discontent around Game-Key Cards</a> for the Switch 2, but right now, it appears that Nintendo is well and truly on top of the world.</p>
<p>Finally, for comparison, here's how a few other key companies are doing at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capcom - ¥3,959</li>
<li>Square Enix - ¥11,055</li>
<li>Sony - ¥3,995</li>
<li>Konami - ¥24,560</li>
<li>Bandai Namco - ¥5,317</li>
<li>Sega - ¥3,306</li>
</ul>

<p>We had a pretty banging <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World showcase</a>, so that was pretty cool, with lots of really neat announcements and shadow drops.

<p>Nintendo ruffled a few feathers again with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-wont-let-charity-speedrunning-event-use-its-games-without-permission-because-of-course">its stance on a charity event using its games</a>, while our Jim talked at length about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-we-really-dont-need-a-donkey-kong-timeline">Donkey Kong timeline</a> and how we kinda don't really need one.</p>

<p>I'm pretty spoiled for choice this weekend folks, I won't lie. I'm planning on playing a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> after my recent review, but I also want to dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> and see what all the fuss is about. I also downloaded the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> demo, so I'd like to give that a shot, but then I also need to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a> for review.</p>
<p>Man... Too much!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>UFO 50 is staring me right in the face as I mop up 100% completion on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and look ahead to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>. What timing for a game I’ve been really excited to play since SGF last year?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’ll be trying out the Mina the Hollower demo because apparently we’re just going through a bunch of Zelda-esque game demos right now. A short and sweet one from me, folks – have a good one!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>After waiting all this time to dive into Mina the Hollower, I still haven’t found the time to dive into the demo yet — I know! Madness! I’ll be excited to take that for a spins this weekend, before probably booting up one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_ages">Oracle</a> games on NSO to scratch more of the retro Zelda itch.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it’s the Global Jam session for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> and I’m actually… kind of excited to check it out? I wasn’t blown away at the Switch 2 hands-on event earlier in the year, but perhaps playing it with some worldwide competition will help change my mind.</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend I find myself still knee-deep in banana shards and loving every second of it. I'm down to sublayer 1200-summin', and I'd be a damn-sight further if I weren't constantly distracted by some glinting goodie in the distance or a buried banana shadow revealed by a sonar slap.</p>
<p>However, UFO 50 arrived on Thursday to challenge DK to supremacy on my Switch 2, and I'm absolutely itching to get stuck into that, too. Not the best weekend to have relatives arriving for a holiday, to be honest. Bloody family, with their love and support and effort to come visit me in foreign climes. Don't they know I've got bananas to smash!?</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm packing my bags for the annual offline vacations. On those very same bags I take 250 days straight of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_3_your_personal_trainer">Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer</a>. All good things must come to an end, so that’s my season finale on that “game”. It is still very much the “Summer of the Ninja” around here, so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> will carry me on this and the next weekend, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a> and the last third of World Tour mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (hey, Sagat is here! But it takes real money to get him… curse these new ways of the industry).</p>
<p>Did a bit of binge-spending yesterday on the eShop so also on my bag goes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">House of the Dead 2 Remake</a>, the wonderful UFO 50, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> (go watch the movie, seriously!) and M2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gradius_origins">Gradius Origins</a>, which comes with the brand new, 1998 theoretical sequel Salamander III. Since I also failed miserably not to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/earthion">Earthion</a> on STEAM last week it’s going to be one great Summer for shmup action!</p>
<p>This will be my first time taking the Switch 2 on the road and looking back at the last eight Summers where the original Switch model was a constant slice of my cherish memories, can’t help but feel really excited looking at what’s to come, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> being a particularly strong bleep on my radar.</p>

			<p>Mortal Kombat 1 has sold over 6.2 million units since its launch in September 2023, up from the 5 million milestone announced back in January. The news was delivered <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1953934498066051479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a> by Game Director Ed Boon, who also vowed the studio's commitment to making it NetherRealm's most balanced game yet.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 1 was reviewed well among critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mortal-kombat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it got an 8.5/10 here on Wccftech</a>), though it is noticeably slower in sales than its predecessor, Mortal Kombat 11, which reached the remarkable milestone of 15 million units in October 2022, roughly three and a half years after its debut. MK1 still has a year and a half to go, but it seems unlikely it could sell another 8.8 million units, even with deep discounts. </p>

<p>When Capcom released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on the Switch 2 in June, it also launched three new amiibo as well as an amiibo card starter set containing 22 cards.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the second series of cards has appeared online. According to multiple listings, this set will feature new cards for the existing roster of fighters and cards for the "Year 2 and Year 3" DLC characters. Some of the artwork on Amazon shows close-ups of the cards for Elena, A.K.I. and M. Bison.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the 38 new cards, along with a box including 15 boosters. Capcom hasn't officially revealed when the new set of cards will be made available just yet, but when we hear more, we'll let you know.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7ypqrvl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-blocked-cheating-attempts/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-anti-cheat-engine-has-blocked-330-000-cheating-attempts.1266186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has a huge task on its hands when it comes to the longevity and stability of the game. The beta kicked off just a couple of days ago, and the Javelin anti-cheat engine has already contended with more than 330,000 cheating attempts.</p>



<p>Recently, clips started circulating on social media showing malicious operators cheating during the beta (which is weird, stop doing that). The SPEAR team that manages Javelin (see what they did there?) pointed out that all is well, the community is making plenty of reports, and cheaters are being actively banned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-bother">Why Bother?</h2>



<p>It’s bizarre that people are cheating during a <strong>beta </strong>of all things, but I guess these slimy, oddball cheat manufacturers have to perfect their craft somewhere ahead of the game’s release on October 10.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report published</a> on the EA forum by the SPEAR anti-cheat team, the scope of the cheating situation was outlined:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.</p>



<p>You’ve reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today.</p>



<p>We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-hit-by-cheaters-clips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clips of blatant cheaters</a> captured from their perspective were uploaded and circulated on social media, putting a sizeable chink in the armor of an otherwise perfect beta.</p>



<p>It’s unsurprising, though. These days, no multiplayer game is safe from cheaters, and some have it worse than others. For instance, Escape from Tarkov’s developers recently published a file showing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-bans-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3,600 cheaters were banned</a> in three weeks, and that kind of report comes out every few weeks from the firm.</p>



<p>Have you run into a cheater yet in the Battlefield 6 beta? Let me know what you’ve spotted on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Krafton released the life-sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inzoi-early-access-review-pretty-vacant/1900-6418345/" data-ref-id="1900-6418345">InZoi</a> in early access with the promise of free DLC throughout the year. Now, details about the second DLC have been revealed, and it's coming later this month alongside InZoi's debut on Mac.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uoD3q-qOVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uoD3q-qOVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new DLC is called Island Getaway, and it was inspired by the tropical locations in Southeast Asia. It will include a new map called Cahava, which features both a primary island and a separate island dedicated to a vacation resort. Players can give their Zois new outfits and hairstyles to fit their environment, and let them go swimming, boating, and snorkeling.</p><p>This update will also include enhanced character interactions, including random gatherings, thought bubbles, and the ability for players to perform cooperative actions. Other new features being added across all maps include farming, mining, gem crafting, and fishing. Players will also be able to ride motorcycles and electric scooters. Over 90 new music tracks will also be added to the game, alongside other quality of life improvements.</p><p>Island Getaway and inZOI's Mac debut are both set to launch on August 20, through the Mac App Store and Steam. Krafton will show off both the PC and Mac versions of inZOI at Gamescom from August 20 to 24. However, fans who want a sneak peek at the new DLC will be able to catch a livestream on Twitch or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayinZOI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official inZOI YouTube channel</a> on August 14 at 6 PM PT.</p>

                <p>Thirteen years after it first appeared in The Sims 3, singer Katy Perry surprised fans when she reprised her hit song "Last Friday Night" at a concert this week--and sang in Simlish, the nonsense language of Sims characters.</p><p>On X, TheWitnessedBoy shared a clip from a TikTok user of Perry from a recent concert (via<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-simlish-sims-3-concert-last-friday-night-video-2000616677" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kotaku</a>), in which the singer accepted a fan's request to sing Last Friday Night in Simlish. Rather than sing the entire song in Simlish, Perry opted to start with the chorus. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry’s tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night 😭 <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p>  — Fadi ¹⁴³ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Perry was a prominent promotional partner of Electronic Arts in marketing The Sims 3 in 2012, with the game's Showtime expansion pack even having a Katy Perry Collector's Edition.

But don't hold your breath for The Sims 5.

But perhaps one of the most disruptive additions is the Springleg medallion, which brings some wild mobility to Fortnite.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> is secretly the most popular game around. This May, the Roblox game "Grow a Garden" surpassed seven million concurrent users--but Roblox itself has been hugely popular, especially with kids, for years. Case in point: YouTube revealed today that Roblox-related videos have surpassed 1 <em>trillion</em> views. Trillion.</p><p>To celebrate the momentous number, YouTube has launched a Roblox Museum within Roblox, which the company describes as "a virtual space where anyone can go to visit over 100 special relics, each representing a key creator moment from over the years." YouTube and Roblox debuted within a year of each other, YouTube notes, and so Roblox videos have been a part of YouTube for almost its entire lifetime. If you don't play Roblox but want to check out the museum, YouTube released a preview hosted by Roblox content creators Lanaslifeee and MeEnyu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2Kfm-knAc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4q2Kfm-knAc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For those who want to check out the museum for themselves, you can also hop directly to the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/87445296052708/YouTubes-Roblox-Museum" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">museum's landing page</a> on Roblox. The museum also features a scavenger hunt that will reward you with an exclusive in-game item.</p><p>Roblox is the second game to reach the trillion-view milestone. Just short of three years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> reached a trillion views, and released a video to celebrate at the time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISWaWS7mVac" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ISWaWS7mVac" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This comes at an interesting moment for the game. A quick scroll through the comments reveals that players aren't terribly interested in the video itself, and are instead much more focused on the age verification requirements coming to the game, which involve allowing an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-new-age-verification-feature-uses-ai-to-scan-teens-video-selfies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI to scan a video selfie</a> before players will be allowed to fully access Roblox's soon-to-be tiered communication system.</p>

Its main chase card (<a href="https://zdcs.link/985GD8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Umbreon ex-161/131</a>) is commanding over $800, with lower-end SIR cards still pulling well over $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difference between now and a couple of months ago is getting these insanely valuable cards for the right price instead of paying over the odds. Here's a quick look at the <strong>top 10 most valuable cards</strong> to add to your collection, or deck if you've got Pokécoins coming out of your ears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've gone into a bit more detail on every card, a touch more into the article, but the gist is that it's a <strong>good time</strong> to start collecting Prismatic Evolutions chase cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Believe it or not, prices have <em>actually</em> been correcting over the past two months, with some cards holding double their current value just a couple of months ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is very positive, meaning players and collectors can get their chase cards for the right price and watch them climb in value as time goes on. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolution: Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wait! Before we start:</strong> My favorite thing about Prismatic Evolutions is the sheer number of SIRs featuring non-Eeveelution Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They deserve some recognition too, so I’ve put together this <em>extra </em>list to balance out the usual Eevee dominance. Here are my top ten honorable mentions for Prismatic Evolution, with artwork that’s arguably among the best we have ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the fantastical pastel color busts from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aebGZ6?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terapagos ex SIR</a> and the abract highlight work on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgA6m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Hands ex SIR</a> to The stained glass style of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbwYy?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dragapult ex SIR</a> and the charging yet chaotic pose of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg7nv?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ceruledge ex SIR</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're considerably more affordable too, peaking at just under $94. That's where the value in Pokémon TCG is for me, the overlooked cards that are fantastic showpieces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to collect Prismatic Evolutions for cards that will increase in value over time without breaking your credit rating? This is where savvy collectors need to be looking in my opinion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Eevee ex - 167/131 - $112.98</h2><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226491"><div id="226491" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Eevee ex - 167/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a03Ell?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a flexible card with a unique ability that allows it to evolve into any Pokémon ex that evolves from Eevee. Rainbow DNA opens up a wide range of build options and can slot into multiple strategies that rely on type variety or quick evolution plays. It can't evolve on your first turn or the turn it's played which helps keep the ability balanced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its attack, Coruscating Quartz, deals 200 damage for three Energy in Fire, Water, and Lightning. That Energy mix makes it a tough addition to a trainer’s deck, especially in formats where consistency and type synergy are key. Most players will lean on it for evolution plays rather than raw damage output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eevee ex SIR remains a popular pull for collectors looking to complete their Eeveelution lineup. Its price has softened since release, but at $113, it is still one of the more valuable base Eevee cards we have seen in years and a vital piece for collectors aiming to build the full Prismatic Evolutions set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Roaring Moon ex - 162/131 - $143.67</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226490"><div id="226490" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w3gV?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roaring Moon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a high-risk attacker built for aggressive plays. Its first attack, Frenzied Gouging, knocks out your opponent’s Active Pokémon instantly but deals 200 damage to itself in return. It can swing the game fast but leaves you wide open if you don’t have a backup plan. Calamity Storm is a more flexible option, hitting for 100 or 220 if you discard a Stadium in play, which makes it a strong follow-up or setup attack in the right deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The triple Darkness Energy cost means it’s better suited to decks that can ramp quickly or recycle Energy efficiently. It’s a tough addition to a trainer’s deck, but one that rewards calculated aggression and tempo-heavy play. Roaring Moon isn’t for slow setups or cautious turns. It thrives when the goal is to close games quickly and apply pressure early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w3gV?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roaring Moon ex SIR</a> Is also one of the few Paradox Pokémon in this set that commands significant value, and at over $140, it remains one of the most powerful and visually striking cards outside the Eeveelution lineup. The SIR artwork leans into the Paradox Pokémon’s primal energy with a dark, dramatic design that gives it real shelf presence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Flareon ex - 146/131 - $153.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226489"><div id="226489" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Flareon ex - 146/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/92x8Je?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flareon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions brings powerful fire-type pressure with two solid attacks. Burning Charge hits for 130 and accelerates energy by letting you search your deck for two Basic Energy and attach them to one of your Pokémon. It’s a strong early or mid-game setup option, especially in decks that need to build up attackers quickly. Carnelian deals a huge 280 damage, more than enough to take down most threats, though it comes with the drawback of preventing Flareon from attacking the next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That limitation makes careful sequencing important. You’ll want to pair it with switching effects or find ways to reset the attack clause. The energy cost across both attacks is manageable for Fire decks that already use acceleration tools, and Flareon’s 270 HP helps it stay on the board long enough to make an impact. It’s a tough addition to a trainer’s deck and shines brightest when built around a fast, punchy game plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/92x8Je?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flareon ex SIR</a> is now at a reasonable $153.99, and I think it's worth every penny for its design alone. The SIR artwork is warm and energetic, showing Flareon in mid-leap with embers flying around it. It’s one of the more visually dynamic Eeveelution cards in the set, and while the price has dipped, but it's a hot pick for collectors and aggressive Fire-type builds.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Glaceon ex - 150/131 - $179.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226488"><div id="226488" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Glaceon ex - 150/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAy2m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a flexible attacker that can set up pressure early and close out games with precision. Frost Bullet deals 110 damage and chips 30 to a Benched Pokémon, which is useful for spreading damage or finishing off low-HP targets. Euclase is where the real power lies—it lets you instantly Knock Out a Pokémon that has exactly 6 damage counters on it. Timing this move well can swing the game by removing key threats without needing to hit massive numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 270 HP and one retreat cost make Glaceon reasonably durable and mobile on the field. It slots well into decks that aim to spread damage and play a patient control game. The Euclase setup does require planning, but it rewards clever players who can sequence damage properly. It's a tough addition to a trainer’s deck and particularly rewarding for those who enjoy outplaying their opponents with calculated board control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAy2m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> is up for grabs at $179.99 at the moment, making it one of the most valuable cards in this set whilst being much more reasonable than a couple of months back. The artwork captures Glaceon jumping infront of an snowflake-themed stained glass window, glowing with cool tones that perfectly reflect its icy theme. It’s a visually striking SIR and while the price has taken a hit, the card remains a strong pickup for control-focused decks and collectors alike.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Jolteon ex - 153/131 - $179.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226487"><div id="226487" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jolteon ex - 153/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w3ed?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jolteon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions offers a lot of burst damage potential in an aggressive Lightning deck. Flashing Spear starts at 60 damage but can scale up fast by discarding up to two Basic Energy from your Benched Pokémon, adding 90 more damage for each. With a proper setup, that’s an easy 240 damage for just two Energy on a Stage 1, which can take out most threats in one shot. Dravite is a powerful finisher at 280 damage, though the downside is Jolteon can't attack next turn after using it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 260 HP and free retreat, Jolteon is easy to pivot in and out of the Active Spot, making it great in fast-paced, tempo-focused lists. Managing your Energy between the Bench and Jolteon becomes key to maximizing damage output. It’s a tough addition to a trainer’s deck and best suited for players who like high-risk, high-reward plays that can swing a match quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w3ed?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jolteon ex SIR</a> has dropped in value by nearly half since may, but $179.99 value for an SIR card is still a very valuable card. With this price stablizing, the only way for Jolteon ex SIR value is up a year from now. The artwork is packed with energy, showing Jolteon mid-sprint with lightning crackling around it. The bright yellow tones and motion lines give it a real sense of speed and power, making it one of the most kinetic-looking cards in the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Vaporeon ex - 149/131 - $200.98</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226486"><div id="226486" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vaporeon ex - 149/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAy2m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vaporeon ex SIR</a> is one of the more disruptive cards in Prismatic Evolutions thanks to its board-wide pressure. Severe Squall hits every Pokémon ex your opponent controls for 60 damage, ignoring Weakness and Resistance. It’s a great way to chip at multiple threats at once, especially in formats where players rely on multiple evolved ex attackers. Its second move, Aquamarine, deals 280 damage, enough to take out nearly anything in front of it, though it comes with the usual drawback of preventing Vaporeon from attacking next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 280 HP and a Water typing, Vaporeon holds its own against a wide pool of current meta threats, especially when paired with support that can move it in and out of the Active Spot. It’s a tough addition to a trainer’s deck and rewards players who enjoy spread damage and multi-turn strategies that slowly wear down the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAy2m?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vaporeon ex SIR</a> Is rocking up at $200.98, and that's now a stable value on a very expensive card, which no doubt will climb as time goes on. The art here is peaceful but detailed, showing Vaporeon calmly hopping atop of a body of water lit with soft blue tones. It’s less action-packed than some of the other Eeveelutions, but the underwater atmosphere makes it visually striking and a beautiful card for collectors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Leafeon ex - 144/131 - $209.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226484"><div id="226484" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Leafeon ex - 144/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbyOG?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex SIR</a> delivers high reward for players willing to build around its unique pressure and healing kit. Verdant Storm scales off Energy attached to all of your opponent’s Pokémon, dealing 60 damage per attachment, which makes it a strong counter to energy-heavy decks. Moss Agate hits for 230 and heals 100 damage from each of your Benched Pokémon, creating a swing turn that can punish aggressive decks while helping stabilize your board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 270 HP and access to reliable healing, Leafeon ex is hard to remove once established. It fits best in decks that expect long games where sustaining your own board matters just as much as chipping away at your opponent. It’s a tough addition to a trainer’s deck and shines brightest when piloted with patience and timing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a great time to catch Leafeon ex SIR at $209.99, its a highly valued card whilst being at the best price we've seen for it. The artwork features Leafeon resting in a lush, sun-drenched forest, blending soft  natural lighting with delicate linework. It’s tranquil and earthy, offering collectors a scenic moment that stands out in a set full of dramatic poses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Espeon ex - 155/131 - $204.99</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226485"><div id="226485" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Espeon ex - 155/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgZ5M?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a> brings hand disruption and evolution control into one clean package. Psych Out hits for 160 and forces your opponent to discard a random card, which can slow down setup decks or break up combos. Amazez is where the real strategy lies. It devolves every evolved Pokémon your opponent has, shuffling their highest Stage back into their deck. Against evolution-heavy boards, this can completely reset your opponent’s progress and swing the game in your favor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 270 HP and a single retreat cost, Espeon ex is easy to slot into Psychic decks that want control elements. It’s a tough addition to a trainer’s deck that rewards careful timing and matchup knowledge, especially against Stage 2-heavy builds or archetypes that rely on multi-turn setups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgZ5M?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a> is holding its value at just above $200 and is still one of the most premium non-Umbreon options in the set. The art captures a serene moment as Espeon perches in a moonlit field, its gaze piercing through lavender-toned shadows. The subtle lighting and dreamlike backdrop make this one of the more visually contemplative designs in the Prismatic Evolutions set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Sylveon ex - 156/131 - $315</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226483"><div id="226483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sylveon ex - 156/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYo8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a> plays a strong support-control role with disruptive attacks that can shut down your opponent’s strategy fast. Magical Charm hits for 160 and reduces incoming damage from the Defending Pokémon by 100 on your opponent’s next turn. It’s a simple but effective stall tactic that can keep your key Pokémon alive longer. Angelite is the big closer, letting you choose two of your opponent’s Benched Pokémon and shuffle them and all attached cards into their deck. It’s a powerful reset that can dismantle a board in one move, though you can’t use it on back-to-back turns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 270 HP and Psychic typing, Sylveon ex is a strong defensive piece in control-heavy decks or formats where board building is essential. It’s a tough addition to a trainer’s deck that works best when played with patience and a plan to disrupt your opponent’s bench-focused strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYo8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a> is going for $315 right now, which is a reasonable price whilst being the second most valuable Prismatic Evolutions card. The card's art shows Sylveon in a soft, storybook-style meadow filled with blossoms, with warm pink tones and flowing ribbons that capture its fairy-like charm. It’s one of the most elegant designs in the set and continues to attract collectors even at a lower price point.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Umbreon ex - 161/131 - $869</h2></div><div catalogid="57ec10e6-fcfb-4bea-b31a-5a84f0ff2426" id="226482"><div id="226482" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Umbreon ex - 161/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/985GD8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Umbreon ex SIR</a> brings high-impact utility and pressure to Darkness decks with two strong attacks. Moon Mirage deals 160 damage and Confuses the opponent's Active Pokémon, forcing a coin flip before their next attack. That disruption can buy valuable time or force a retreat. Onyx is the showstopper. It discards all Energy from Umbreon ex and lets you take a Prize card outright, no matter the opponent’s board state. It’s a massive swing when used correctly and fits well into decks that want to finish games with surprise plays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 280 HP and with straightforward costs for its attacks, <a href="https://zdcs.link/985GD8?object_uuid=b3c790d9-82b4-4c0e-8c20-46feacaf3931&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Umbreon ex SIR</a> is a flexible threat that earns a spot in slower control strategies or as a closer in prize race decks. It’s a tough addition to a trainer’s deck because of the high discard cost, but when timed right, it can steal games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the crown jewel of the Prismatic Evolutions set. Even after falling from its $1300 high, Umbreon ex SIR still holds an incredible value at $869. Let's not forget that the market for this card is now stable, which means it's only going to climb in value as the months go on and Scarlet and Violet becomes the previous generation to Mega Evolution. The SIR artwork is dark, moody and abstract, showing Umbreon sitting on some kind of plynth with darkness energy bursting out and surrounding a moon. It's dramatic and the crazy kind of artwork that makes collectors look closer. Umbreon ex SIR continues to be the most premium chase cards in the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolutions Price Watch - Sealed Boosters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to pull these cards yourself? Sealed Prismatic Evolutions product pricing is dropping significantly on TCGplayer. You won't find anything for MSRP, but nine times out of 10 it's a cheaper option than big box retailers such as Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that being said, I'd still recommend saving up for single cards whilst they're at their lowest, as Prismatic Evolutions is a very hard set to pull hits from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Popular comedy streaming service and website Dropout, formerly known as College Humor, has become more and more famous online thanks in large part to <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-deja-vu-video-game-dropout-tv-1851449932">its hit show <em>Game Changer</em></a><em>. </em>The series, hosted by Dropout CEO Sam Reich, features comedians playing different, <a href="https://x.com/samreich/status/1953123165384917352">often complex, devious, and hilarious games</a> each episode. It’s a great concept for a show, and I wondered if Dropout would ever make a video game version of its viral sensation. The answer: Yeah, probably!</p> <p>I recently sat down and chatted with Reich as part of a larger interview about <em>Game Change</em>r and how the different games are designed, playtested, and balanced. And during that interview, which will be up at a later date, I had to ask if Reich and others at Dropout had ever contemplated a video game version of any of the streaming service’s shows.</p> <p>“Yeah, for sure,” said Reich during our Zoom interview. He clarified that it would likely be a game based on <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-internet-reacts-to-critical-roles-big-shakeup-2000614488"><em>Dimension 20,</em> the service’s super-popular D&amp;D series</a>, or one based on <em>Game Changer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I think that we would be into that and we’ve talked about it,” explained the Dropout CEO and<em> Game Changer</em> host. “And I think it’s like, at this point, it’s honestly more than anything else, just like a bandwidth issue, which is if we’re going to do it, we want it to feel like us, which means we need to work on it. We’re not going to farm the IP out to some third party. We want it to feel personal. And it needs to be something, therefore, that we’re excited enough about and feels differentiated enough from what’s out there that it feels worth our time.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Game Changer Season 7 Trailer [Dropout Exclusive Series]" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eu0nZh9rfw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>He also admitted that another big barrier to Dropout developing something is just how expensive games are to create and how long it takes to make them.</p> <p>When I asked if Reich had <em>really</em> thought about this much and had some ideas for a <em>Game Changer</em> game, or if it was just a far-off fantasy that might happen, he confirmed that they “definitely have ideas” of what a Dropout game would be, and they are working toward making one.</p> <p>“Part of wanting to develop more of that competency was releasing all of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/dejavu-by-dropout-dot-tv">little web games</a> [featured in <em>Game Changer</em>],” said Reich. “Let’s start dabbling, you know, and like, see if we can speak this language at all.”</p> <p>In our interview, Reich sounded very confident that a <em>Game Changer</em> game is coming…one day, adding: “So I would say we probably will do one. And it’s just a question of what and when.”</p> <p><em>Game Changer’</em>s season 7 finale airs exclusively on Dropout on August 11.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708]]></content:encoded>

Developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA promised the plagiarized art would be removed and replaced, and thanks to an update today, these cards now feature the official artwork.</p><p>When Wisdom of Sea and Sky first launched on July 30, an artist by the name of Lanjiujiu <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-card-art-following-potential-plagiarism-issue/1100-6533542/" data-ref-id="1100-6533542">came forward with a comparison</a> of their own art of Ho-Oh and the version that was seemingly traced over for the expansion's cards.</p><p>The developers immediately released a statement about the incident, claiming that "the card production team provided incorrect reference material as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards."</p><p>Due to these issues, Pokémon TCG Pocket was forced to pull the art from both Ho-Oh EX and Lugia EX, the latter of which featured the plagiarized Ho-Oh artwork. That meant that for the next week players who cracked packs and received these legendary cards were greeted by an admittedly hilarious sight: a completely plain card that simply featured text saying that new artwork would be coming soon.</p><p>Now though, both Pokémon cards boast entirely new art, and players who already pulled them should now have the updated assets. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> spotted that the new replacement designs are credited to the same artist, Sie Nanahara, who also made the now-pulled art that these cards first launched with. In response to Pocket's plagiarized assets, as well as their swift removal, Lanjiujiu shared, "I appreciate the prompt resolution and hope this matter rests here."</p>

              <p>Originally released as part of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</i>, an augmented version of <i>Snake Eater</i> that hit PS2 the following year, <i>Metal Gear Online</i> was a strange beast. The online take on <i>MGS</i>’ stealth gameplay would receive a few other iterations, with one accompanying <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i>, another a part of the PSP titles <i>Portable Ops</i> and <i>Peace Walker</i>, and lastly with <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i>. (Let’s not talk about <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-survive-the-kotaku-review-1823584276"><i>Survive</i></a>. It doesn’t count.) For me, <i>MGO</i> was at its best in the version that accompanied <i>MGS4</i>, but in all the iterations I played, <i>MGO</i> remained something special, a celebration of <i>MGS</i>’ tendency to be a little goofy and, of course, an engaging multiplayer stealth game when it (and the players) wanted it to be.</p> <p><i>MGO</i> arguably ushered in a new perspective for <i>Metal Gear</i> as it forced the series to adopt a now-standard moveable 3D camera that pivots around the character. Prior to its release, <i>MGS</i> used fixed camera angles, usually in a top-down or isometric perspective. That perspective wasn’t ideal for a multiplayer game. At the same time, <i>MGS</i> is far from a fast-paced shooter. It’s slower, encouraging a more methodical approach even if you’re responding to threats with lethal force. And that’s one aspect that made both traditional, single-player <i>MGS</i> and its online offshoots so special. Some modes of <i>MGO</i> encouraged a relatively hectic play style. Others, meanwhile, were almost entirely about stealth. Take “Sneaking MIssion,” in which one player would take on the role of Snake as he stealthfully tried to knock out and steal dog tags from other players. Trying to stay hidden from actual flesh-and-blood players offered a kind of thrill that was quite distinct from what you’d get in the single-player games.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MGO2 PC (2023): SNEAKING MISSION WINS #1" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7f3K0eKi8c"></iframe></p> <p>Naturally, being a <i>Metal Gear </i>game, cardboard boxes, naughty magazines, exaggerated death screams, the ability to play as characters from the series, and more made the game feel like an appropriately absurd celebration of what so many of us love about these games. <i>MGS</i>’ charm was and is never about one singular thing. It’s the sum of all of its wildly eccentric parts. That carried through in the various online modes it received over the years. I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/DRuouKk3TiY">just look at this nonsense</a>. Where else would you see something like this?</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Goodbye Metal Gear Online 2" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRuouKk3TiY"></iframe></p> <p>Modders have recently made incredible strides <a href="https://mgo2pc.com/">in their efforts</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqyQtjok9Qk">resurrect the <i>MGS4</i> iteration of <i>Metal Gear Online </i>on PC</a>, so this experience is not totally lost to time. And technically you can still play <i>MGSV</i>’s online mode, though every time I’ve tried recently, I spend more time waiting for a match than I do playing. I also never cared for its class-based character selection.</p> <p><i>Metal Gear Online</i> is due to return later this year though. “Fox Hunt” is expected to launch in the fall as a part of the upcoming remake of <i>MGS3</i>, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>. Not a whole lot about this mode is known right now, though <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/">the game’s dedicated page promises</a> “hide-and-seek based” gameplay “that utilizes the central elements of the base game–camouflage and survival.”</p> <p><i>MGO</i> was always a niche experience, of interest to only the most passionate of us <i>MGS</i> dorks. Hopefully Fox Hunt will provide new, quirky experiences that’ll satisfy this discerning crowd of stealth fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A software engineer who goes by Desimulate on X recently posted <a href="https://x.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116">a five-second clip of AI-generated pixel art</a> that went viral. Think your favorite Instagram pixel artist recreating <em>Daggerfall</em> with wild parallax scrolling effects. It was such a hit on Elon Musk’s Grok-infested social media platform that Desimulate decided to try and actually make the game the five-second clip would be from. But he’s not using AI to do it. Why? “Well, right now, the tools aren’t really good enough.”</p> <p>That’s what he told Ryan K. Rigney in the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/p/behind-the-three-letter-tweet-that-pissed-off-the-entire-games-industry"><em>Push to Talk</em> newsletter</a>. Desimulate said the viral post was the result of working very closely with Midjourney, using lots of specific reference art to try and hone the outputs while also trying to spur them into generating something new. “I just got obsessed with making something unique, and that post was the epitome of that for me. And it kind of came out of nowhere,” he told Rigney.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">omw <a href="https://t.co/eCiTOrjtzC">pic.twitter.com/eCiTOrjtzC</a></p> <p>— Desimulate (@de5imulate) <a href="https://twitter.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">But while AI can generate a five-second clip</a>, it’s nowhere near being able to generate an actual game based on it, let alone one as ambitious as an open-world fantasy RPG with extremely detailed pixel art. “The meshes are probably good enough to make a basic game,” he explains. “Something small. But this is a game that is kind of demanding, right? It’s going to be a real fantasy RPG. So at the end of the day, it’s going to have to be performant. The 3D generation stuff right now…the meshes are just not up to snuff. They are way too many triangles, polygons, and a lot of them kind of get messed up. And so it actually ends up taking more time to clean them than it would to just, like, start from the beginning. So we just use it as a visual reference.”</p>

 <p>Desimulate is not a game developer. Neither am I. So I can’t tell you whether he’s making any sense. But I can tell you that he’s now trying to hire people who are game developers to turn his viral AI GIF into a game. I’ve encountered many a video game Kickstarter with vertical slices from people who have actually shipped games before that never came close to panning out. If I was a Polymarket guy, which I am definitely not, this is not the horse I’d be picking.</p> <p>But I do think the interview provides a fascinating and useful look into the allure of AI tools like Midjourney and what people think they’re doing when they work with them. It’s clear Desimulate feels like he has ownership over what the machine spit out, even though his contribution to it is a rounding error in the grand scheme of things like training data. Rigney asked why he’s the one to make the game imagined by the people upvoting his post. Here’s what he said:</p> <p>“I’ve got the vision, and everything starts with that vision. I’ve got the passion to make it happen. In two weeks, I’ve interviewed 40-plus people, brought a real team together of real game devs, started building, designing the game, and we’ve made a ton of progress. Obviously everything is in an R&amp;D state. But I am committed to making it happen.”</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Depending on your specific motherboard, the specific steps for turning Secure Boot on can be different, but it involves restarting your computer, accessing a menu before Windows begins to boot up, and making some tweaks. However, messing around with your BIOS can go awry, and indeed, some players have found they now simply boot into a black screen, temporarily preventing them from using their computer entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">A number of accounts like this have been shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1miaynl/comment/n76dv60/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, and anecdotally, GameSpot staff have heard directly from friends encountering just these sort of issues. The ultimate solution can involve having to remove the CMOS battery from the motherboard, flashing it, and relying on the board's integrated HDMI output, rather than a video card, in order to even get back into the BIOS menus.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unlikely EA plans to make changes to the Secure Boot requirement, even if it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-apparently-already-dealing-with-cheaters/1100-6533808/" data-ref-id="1100-6533808">doesn't seem to be entirely keeping cheaters at bay</a>. That could mean an even wider swath of players encounter Secure Boot players as the open beta expands to more players this weekend and the full version of Battlefield 6 launches in October. Activision has also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-has-new-security-measures-adding-secure-boot-requirement/1100-6533739/" data-ref-id="1100-6533739">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will require Secure Boot</a>, and it's unlikely to be the last game to call for it. If you like playing multiplayer games on PC, you may just have to hope Secure Boot is already enabled or that you're among those fortunate enough to not encounter any problems in turning it on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta</a> launched less than 24 hours ago across consoles and PC. And already, there are numerous videos floating around that show players using cheating software that gives them an unfair advantage. This has led to a firestorm online as many PC players are upset about being forced to jump through hoops to use Secure Boot, tech designed to limit malicious activity, yet cheaters are already infesting <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em>‘s beta</a>.</p> <p>On August 6, the highly anticipated <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta went live…if you had an early access code. Yeah, not really an open beta, but whatever. And despite EA devoting a lot of resources to preventing players from cheating, including the required use of Secure Boot, <a href="https://x.com/10IQGaming/status/1953781723592048760">players began sharing videos online</a> of what appear to be people playing the beta while using wallhacks and other cheats that reveal information about enemy players that shouldn’t be available. <a href="https://x.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383">One video</a> I found featured a montage, complete with music, of what appears to be one person killing dozens and dozens of other players across various matches and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All first-person shooters, like Counter-Strike 2, are affected by cheating ⚠️</p> <p>Despite Anti-Cheat announcements, Battlefield 6 has been affected since day one 🚫 <a href="https://t.co/cwxLPanq2N">pic.twitter.com/cwxLPanq2N</a></p> <p>— CS2 Vaccoin (@vaccoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/ItsHapa/status/1953515565084967379">Another video</a> of what appears to be a <em>BF6</em> open beta cheater has racked up nearly seven million views on Twitter. The video’s popularity and the huge response to it were big enough to attract the attention of <em>Battlefield</em> producer Alexia Christofi, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1953572607074202062">who replied and explained</a> that the team was aware of the cheating and that she believed the player in the clip had already been banned.&nbsp; So far, the cheating appears to be only on PC, though because of crossplay, these cheaters can play against Xbox and PS5 users.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA about the cheating seen in the videos and asked for more information on the situation.</p> <p>Of course, there’s no way to completely stop people from cheating in a video game that can be downloaded locally to a PC or console. But what is angering many players online is that <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7">like the upcoming <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em></a>, requires PC users to use Secure Boot. This is a relatively new technology that helps prevent malicious software from booting up on a Windows PC. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">Here’s how Activision describes the tech</a>: “Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts.”</p> <p>The problem is that on some older setups, Secure Boot requires users to screw around with their BIOS, which can cause a lot of damage to a PC if done incorrectly. I mean, look at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">EA’s support page about Secure Boot</a> and the steps needed just to see if the feature is active or not on your computer, and you can see why it’s giving a lot of players trouble. And even if it does work, it’s a lot of hoops to jump through, and the end result is that people are still cheating. <em>BF6</em> isn’t even out yet, just in open beta, and cheaters have, in less than 48 hours, gotten wallhacks working in the game. You can understand why some players are royally upset about the whole situation.</p>

 <p>Vince Zampella, the head of Battlefield Studios, was asked about anti-cheat last week and <a href="https://youtu.be/MAA7X9J-Y8Q?t=831">said that until the “day we die, we will be fighting” cheaters</a>.</p> <p>“It’s a weird one, because you don’t want to talk about what you’re doing,” said Zampella in an interview with Gaming Interviews on YouTube. “It gives people that are trying to cheat a head start against you. It’s a huge thing in the industry, in gaming. It’s a constant arms race that we’re always putting a lot of effort into, know that. It’s something that we would stamp out completely if we could, it’s just an arms race. To the day we die, we will be fighting it.”</p>

 <p><em><strong>Updated: 8/8/2025, 4:40 p.m. ET:</strong> </em><a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">EA has published a forum post</a> detailing its efforts to combat cheating in the <em>BF6</em> open beta. The company explained that Secure Boot isn’t and was never intended to be a “silver bullet” against cheating in the game. It’s just part of a larger effort to combat naughty players. EA also claims to have prevented over 300,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta, and it’s received over 100,000 reports of players who might be cheating. They are now working to remove those players who are actually cheating.</p> <p>“Anti-Cheat isn’t one and done,” explained an EA rep. “It’s an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn’t always work in all of them. I hope this helps, and please keep the reports coming in – we’ll continue cleaning up the cheaters so you can have a fair game.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rod Fergusson, who has served as general manager (GM) of Diablo for the last five years, is leaving Blizzard.</p>



<p>He announced the news via social media on Friday afternoon.</p>



<p><strong>“After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it’s time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what’s next,”</strong> Fergusson <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rodfergusson.bsky.social/post/3lvvud767y223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in his post.</a> <strong>“The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joined Blizzard in 2020 after spending years working on the Gears of War franchise at The Coalition under Xbox and Epic Games previously.</p>



<p>After the move was announced, Blizzard president <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Johanna Faries said</a>, <strong>“Guiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration. Thank you, Rod, for bringing all of those in spades. Sanctuary’s future is brighter because of the impact you’ve had!”</strong></p>



<p>Xbox head Phil Spencer added: <strong>“You brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Playing Diablo IV with you was a blast—thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no replacement has been named nor was a reason given for Fergusson’s departure.</p>

                <p>Back in 2015, Techland partnered with Ampisound--a popular YouTube channel that’s known for its parkour-based content--to create a video promoting Dying Light. The idea was to showcase the real-life POV of a runner trying to escape a mob of zombies across various locations in Cambridge, UK. The video was a huge success. So much so, that after 10 years, Ampisound has released another real-life Dying Light video sponsored by Techland.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVWZxhQIWwU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="22">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SVWZxhQIWwU?start=22" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ampisound’s latest video, named Zombie Escape! Parkour POV Chase, acts as a sequel of sorts, which is fitting considering it's being used to promote the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. As far as we can tell, there isn’t any indication that this is a direct continuation of what came before. That said, it does feature new runners (who all seem more knowledgeable this time around), a worse-off environment, and a larger number of zombies; some time has clearly passed since the last runner’s untimely demise.</p><p>It's safe to say that Techland is taking the Dying Light series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-gave-me-a-car-and-a-gun-but-i-just-couldnt-stop-dropkicking-zombies/1100-6532282/" data-ref-id="1100-6532282">back to its roots</a>. Not only are players getting a more linear experience and the return of Kyle Crane in the upcoming sequel, but there’s also a return to form, marketing wise. Will Techland’s efforts be enough to get fans to check out Dying Light: The Beast come September 19? We have a little over a month to find out.</p>

		<p>The AI apocalypse is upon us. Again. But that’s OK, because it’s giveaway time this weekend! With the beat ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ra-ra-boom">Ra Ra Boom</a> set to launch on 12th August, Gylee Games has kindly shared ten codes for PlayStation with us to dish out to a handful of lucky winners, so you can go and fight back against our would-be robot oppressors!</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKOXf0Ye5Ig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the planet ruined by a rogue AI, there’s just one sanctuary for humanity left, and we’ve spent our time preparing… by training four carefully selected cheerleaders to become ninjas and shoot, smash and through the resurgent AI enemies.</p>
<p>Let’s hand over to our<strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/ra-ra-boom-preview-an-apocalyptic-space-ninja-cheerleader-brawler-with-style/"> Ra Ra Boom preview</a></strong> from last month to meet our brawling foursome: “This is a classic beat ‘em up of the highest order, with four-player co-op giving you control of one of the four unique characters. They’re headed by Aris, a cheerleader who dual-wields Uzi-like machine guns, while my personal favourite Vee is the tank character, brutally pushing enemies back with her massive energy shield and chunky blows. Meanwhile, you’ve got Ren, a super-fast samurai, and last, but not least, Saida, a cyborg with sass. They’re described as ninja space cheerleaders and, broadly speaking, they are. They’re undoubtedly a cool and engaging group that you’ll want to take on an adventure smashing up robots.”</p>
<p>The game is launching for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 12th August, and we’ve got ten copies of Ra Ra Boom to giveaway for PlayStation (UK/EU region)</p>

<p>Studio founder Mike Bithell shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">a message on Bluesky earlier today</a> stating that his studio — which he founded in 2013 following the release and critical success behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thomas_was_alone">Thomas Was Alone</a> — has "been unable to secure a new large scale project" and is "reducing in size" as a result.</p>
<p>With eleven jobs being made redundant, Bithell says that "This constitutes the majority of our full-time staff." But the studio was able to make this difficult process as easy as possible.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mkxrhz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025. We've fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance packages."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Around the time of the studio's most recent release, Tron: Catalyst, Bithell shared an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lrplvwf3g22z">extensive list of people who worked on the game</a>, all of whom are worth celebrating. And Bithell continues his statement with even more praise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's important to state that this was an incredible team of exceptionally talented people. If you're a developer reading this, and you're hiring; anyone among those affected would be a great addition to your studio, please reach out if we can help to put you in touch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bithell Games' existing self-published games will remain available and the existing members of the team will continue to support them, with the founder hoping that "your interest in our work follows individual team members" affected by the news.</p>
<p>"Bithell Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less."</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all of those made redundant at the studio.</p></section>

              <p>I had a <i>good</i> time with <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i></a> this year. Maybe it even peaked at “great” a few times. I can’t say I remember much of the story, which was a major focus of this new <i>Doom</i>, but I did have a solid 20 or so hours blasting demons and cranking up the difficulty as high as it could go. And now a new update has arrived that amps things up even further with <i>The Dark Ages</i>’ take on the Ripatorium.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>The Ripatorium showed up in 2020’s <i>Doom Eternal</i>, though then it was a part of the game’s campaign and you’d have to reload a specific checkpoint if you wanted to grind it for fun or practice. <i>The Dark Ages</i>, however, reintroduces the concept as a test of your wits and fortitude that you can play as many times as you want—there’s even an endless mode if you really just want to dig in and refuse to let go. You can select up to 60 enemies from <i>The Dark Ages</i> to do battle with and it’s a ton of fun—but don’t be surprised if you end up in over your head at first.</p> <p>On my first run through the Ripatorium, I maxed out all 60 enemy slots, half of which were fodder to keep my ammo reserves up. The rest were chosen at random from whatever looked the most intimidating. That was a bad idea, as I’d soon discover, since it turns out my <i>Dark Ages</i> skills are quite rusty. That said, having several of <i>Dark Ages</i>’ biggest baddies all rush you at once is not only hilarious, it’s the kind of challenge that will call me to my ruin before I show them who’s really in charge here (me, the answer is me…eventually).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616695">Look, I’m really out of practice, okay? | © Gif: id Software / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>The Dark Ages</i> offers up a nice set of modular options that let you fine-tune the game’s difficulty, and the update introduces some new ones, such as limits to how many Max Life Sigils you can have at any time, and a slider for Parry &amp; Melee Slow Motion. You can <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-update-2-release-notes">read the full update notes here</a>.</p> <p>The Ripatorium may have shut my cocky ass down at first, but it’s nice to have a reason to jump back into <i>The Dark Ages</i>’ neat guns-and-shield gameplay. And currently it says “Ripatorium 1.0” in the main menu, so hopefully we’ll see some nice additions to this endless mode of carnage in the future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-is-working-%E2%80%98all-by-himself%E2%80%99-on-physint.1265946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima’s ‘spiritual successor’ to Metal Gear Solid (if Death Stranding 2 isn’t already that) has been floating around for a while, but beyond the name, we don’t know anything else about it. It’s named Physint, and it’s an all-new action espionage title, just like Metal Gear Solid was (and remains to be).</p>



<p>It’s set to be another cinematic epic from Kojima, further blurring the lines between cinematic production and traditional video game development. However, in a recent interview, the man himself confirmed he’s working solo at the moment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-alone">All Alone</h2>



<p>Fans of Hideo Kojima’s work are nothing short of excited about the creator’s imminent return to the action espionage space, a decade after he left Konami and turned his back on Metal Gear Solid. It was a few days ago that he was grilled on the MGS series, and when asked if he plans to play the Snake Eater remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he just laughed</a>.</p>



<p>The expectation is that Physint, whatever form it takes, will emerge on whatever comes next for PlayStation, which right now is looking like the PlayStation 6. Did you really expect another naming convention to pop up?</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Indie Wire</a>, Hideo Kojima explained the lay of the land with Physint, mentioning that he’s working on a solo bid at the moment. It wasn’t much, but it was something:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;(I’m) also doing ‘Physint’ all by myself because that’s at the conceptual stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He’s planning Physint alongside the ongoing development of OD and the post-launch support of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which dropped just a few weeks ago and has been turning heads ever since.</p>



<p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and the single step here is good old Hideo, using that raw brain power to create a concept that only he can concoct.</p>



<p>Do you have high hopes for Kojima’s return to action espionage games? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

While Kojima is already working on his next title, fans shouldn't get their hopes up about his new stealth-action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a> arriving anytime soon. According to Kojima himself, most of the work on Physint hasn't exited the earliest stage of development.</p><p>Kojima told <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IndieWire </a>that he is "starting to work with the team on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, because that's a new project." He then added that he is "doing Physint all by myself because that's at the conceptual stage."</p><p>Physint was first announced during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sony-playstation-state-of-play-ps5-games-announcements-recap-january-2024/2900-5063/" data-ref-id="2900-5063">January 2024 State of Play broadcast</a>, and it was described as using "cutting-edge" technology to create a hybrid game and movie experience. Kojima subsequently revealed that the origin of the game came from players' desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">to revisit the stealth-action-espionage genre</a> that he helped create in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. </p><p>According to Kojima, production on both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-od-and-physint-were-impacted-by-strike/1100-6528609/" data-ref-id="1100-6528609">OD and Physint were impacted by the video game actors strike</a> that began in 2024 and ran well into this year. Kojima hasn't set a firm timetable for Physint, but he has previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-stealth-action-game-physint-isnt-coming-any-time-soon/1100-6531630/" data-ref-id="1100-6531630">it may be "five or six years" away</a>.</p><p>Konami is releasing a remake of Kojima's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater later this month. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">when asked if he would ever play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Kojima laughed and confirmed that he will not.</p>

                <p>Rod Fergusson is leaving Blizzard after five years. In his time at the studio, Fergusson has primarily acted as the general manager and face of the Diablo series, overseeing a resurgence of sorts for Blizzard's storied action-RPG franchise.</p><p>Fergusson announced his departure <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1953881496013689332" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Twitter</a>, saying, "After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it's time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what's next. The teams are set up for success, with an exiting slate of releases ahead. I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me."</p><p>Fergusson came to Blizzard in 2020 after a long stint at The Coalition, the Xbox-owned studio that primarily works on Gears of War, a series that he has been working on, sporadically, since close to its inception. Back in the day, Fergusson came onto the original Gears of War and shepherded its final stretch of development. Fergusson would go on to have a hand in most games in the series--and briefly helped Irrational Games on BioShock Infinite--before departing for Blizzard.</p><p>In his role as GM of Diablo, Fergusson oversaw the release of Diablo II Resurrected, a remake of the beloved second game in the franchise, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/" data-ref-id="5000-489022">Diablo Immortal</a>, an entirely new mobile adaptation of the series. His biggest project though was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo IV</a>, which brought the series back to its dark roots back in 2023. The game and its first expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review-piercing-the-veil/1900-6418298/" data-ref-id="1900-6418298">Vessel of Hatred</a>, received positive reviews.</p><p>Fergusson has not disclosed what is next for him.</p>
