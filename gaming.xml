<p>“I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true”</p>

<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ed5c383092fc/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>We were pleased to see Bloober Team pop up at last month's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> with the announcement that its upcoming sci-fi survival horror <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> will also be arriving on Switch 2 on <strong>5th September</strong>. It's nice to see a Nintendo system treated to the same scares as the other big players in the industry and, as it turns out, the developer has big plans to keep the relationship rolling in the future.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">The Game Business</a>, Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno said that he's a huge Nintendo fan, so bringing Cronos to Switch 2 is an attempt to make his "personal dreams come true". Citing the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> ("the most important horrors," according to Babieno), the CEO referred to the GameCube's horror scene as a "gold time for Nintendo fans" — something he's keen to bring back.</p>
<p>"In some ways, we would like to be the one to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now," Babieno said of bringing horror games to Switch 2. "We have some plans," he teased, "We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team".</p>
<p>As the team behind last year's critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, this is an exciting prospect. Throw on top the solid previews so far of Cronos: The New Dawn, and our overall good time going hands-on with the Switch 2 version at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-cronos-the-new-dawn-on-switch-2">Gamescom</a>, and we're even more enthused by the mere prospect of more chills and thrills coming our way from the company.</p>
<p>But that's not to say any future Bloober Team plans would necessarily be 'more of the same'. Babieno hinted to The Game Business that the studio already has its eye on the strange mid-point between horror and cosy gaming that Nintendo has struck gold on in the past, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> being a stand-out example. "What Kono-san did with this title was pretty impressive," Babieno said of the ghost-busting GameCube launch title, "And I believe that there is a huge possibility to repeat such an idea in the future".</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ffefd508e8cef/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Could the future of Switch 2 horror be... this bright? — <em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A Bloober Team survival horror with Luigi's Mansion as a touchstone? Count us in! The CEO even drew a comparison between his studio and the Big N in terms of how the team is structured, particularly when it comes to avoiding layoffs for the greater good of the company's future projects (Bloober Team has been one of the few studios that <em>hasn't</em> seen staff cuts in recent years). “I believe that if we have teams that are making great games and understand our DNA, it's much easier to create new projects," Babieno said in the same interview. "I think that this is another parallel with Nintendo, because [it has] a similar spirit of how we are trying to do things".</p>
<p>We have just one week to go before Cronos: The New Dawn arrives on Switch 2. It's a game full of gruesome darkness, but let's hope that the future is as bright as Babieno imagines.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-team-unionizes-over-ai-remote-work-and-%E2%80%98passion-tax%E2%80%99-of-working-in-games.1283295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The team making <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680"><em>Diablo 4</em> and other entries</a> in Blizzard’s action-RPG franchise is the latest inside of Microsoft to unionize. Workers say the move is to help them negotiate fair terms around issues like like layoffs and remote work. “Passion can’t protect us from job instability,” software engineer Skye Hoefling said in a press release. “Our union allows us to focus on making magical experiences for our players instead of worrying about the unstable job industry.”</p> <p>The <em>Diablo</em> team, known within Blizzard as Team 3, joins the <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922"><em>Overwatch</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em> teams</a> in organizing with the Communications Workers of America (CMA). That national organization signed an agreement with Microsoft during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard that would keep the tech giant neutral on all internal union drives, erasing some of the barriers that usually stop workers from organizing.</p> <p>Microsoft has voluntarily recognized the <em>Diablo</em> developers’ union and they will now get in line to begin bargaining their first contract. Over 300 ZeniMax QA testers at the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">won their first contract earlier this summer</a>.</p>

 <h2>A “passion tax” for working in games</h2> <p>So what made the <em>Diablo</em> team want to jump on the union train within Blizzard? Part of it is the way companies use “getting to make games” as a kind of excuse to <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577">establish worse working conditions</a> than those often experienced by workers in competing roles in tech and entertainment. “My entire career as a developer has seen my peers and I paying the ‘passion tax’ for working in an industry that we love,” software engineer Nav Bhatti said in a press release. “At some point you have to choose between fight or flight, and forming a union is us doing just that — standing our ground in the industry.”</p> <p>Workers also laid out specific concerns around remote work flexibility, budget cuts, and the growing influence of AI in the development process. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">Mass layoffs in early 2024</a> were one of the catalysts. A battle <a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-diablo-iv-world-warcraft-remote-work-delays-1850421033">over remote work</a> that began back in 2023 was another. A mandatory return-to-office policy forced people hired during the pandemic to relocate and limited which talent teams could hire. “There’s no real argument against remote work, except the control part, where now they know where you are and what you’re doing,” Blizzard producer Ryan Claudy <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs">told <em>Aftermath</em></a>.</p>

 <h2>AI creep is here</h2> <p>The sudden rise of AI, which Microsoft is placing $80 billion bets will completely reshape the modern economy, is also on the <em>Diablo</em> team’s mind. “[Generative AI] is starting to creep in a lot,” <em>Diablo 4</em> producer Kelly Yeo told <em>Aftermath</em>. “I can only speak for art, where in the visual development stage, if people don’t feel like they have concept art support, they’ll just toss things into Stable Diffusion or whatever and then do mood boards and stuff and give that to the teams to give them guidance.”</p> <p>She continued, “There is definitely a growing concern across most of the artists like ‘Is this going to replace us?’” Other game teams have already come under fire for AI art that makes it into the finished product. A <em>Call of Duty</em> associate director at Treyarch <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">recently told <em>IGN</em></a> that only work hand-crafted by the team is allowed into the game, but that AI slop sometimes gets through “accidentally.” And some developers at King <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use/">recently told <em>Mobilegamer</em></a> that Microsoft was pressuring them to incorporate AI into all aspects of their workflows.</p> <p>Despite notable unions forming at Sega of America and some overseas European game studios, most of the organizing in the U.S. so far has been confined to Microsoft-owned companies due to the neutrality agreement. Big publishers like <a href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-layoffs-2k-games-delay-2000618914">Take-Two</a>, which have undergone their own ruthless cost-cutting efforts in the past year, have so far remained impervious to workers organizing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">If annual mass layoffs continue</a>, that might change.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-surprise-demo-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-gets-surprise-demo-launches-tomorrow.1283292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lost Soul Aside is getting a surprise demo just in time for launch. The upcoming RPG, set to release tomorrow, is one of PlayStation’s biggest titles of the year. While marketing has been quite silent, it looks like we now have more to go off of than before.</p>



<p>The story of Lost Soul Aside follows Kaser, an orphan who travels to different worlds and dimensions, alongside the mysterious Arena, to save his sister. The action-RPG looks like what you’d see in Final Fantasy, which is what creator Yang Bing was inspired off of. With many excited for the title, fans can get a taste of it come launch day.</p>



<h2 id="h-lost-soul-aside-free-demo-available-tomorrow">Lost Soul Aside Free Demo Available Tomorrow </h2>







<p>Launching alongside the full game of Lost Soul Aside will be <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/lost-soul-aside-demo-launches-august-29">a free demo</a>. In it, players will get to try out the game’s flashy combat. Only two bosses will be available to play (Rose Queen and Holy Knight Commander Victor), so it’s likely not a long demo. Even more so, save data from the demo does not carry over to the full game, so you’ll have to fight the two again. Still, it’s a good way to test the game out before purchasing if you haven’t pre-ordered.</p>



<p>The demo, currently, is only for PlayStation 5, so no word on if PC users will get the demo or not. As of publishing, there’s no mention of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo on Steam</a>. Select regions, such as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/HP9000-PPSA31743_00-0000000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australia</a>, Japan, and New Zealand can download and play the demo right now. For others, the demo rolls out tomorrow, August 29th, though timing will likely vary depending on your region.</p>



<p>Having been in development for more than a decade, Lost Soul Aside has been through quite a lot. Starting as a one-man passion project by Yang Bing, the game was chosen by PlayStation to enter full development. Under the banner of UltiZero Games, the small team changed the Final Fantasy XV-inspired game to a new original IP we now know as Lost Soul Aside.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mega Hawlucha Soars Into Action In Pokémon Legends: Z-A]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-hawlucha-soars-into-action-in-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1283286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has announced the next Pokémon to get a Mega Evolution: Hawlucha. The highly anticipated title, set to release on October 16th, has been revealing more and more up to release. It was teased earlier this week that a new Pokémon would get a Mega Evolution. Finally, we now know which Pokémon it was, and it’s a fan-favorite.</p>



<p>The development of Pokémon Legends Z-A goes back at least a couple of years. It wasn’t until this year that we saw any gameplay, but, now, it won’t be long until we play it. Set in the Kalos region, featured in Pokémon X and Y, gameplay will be more real-time than the traditional turn-based combat. Still, many enjoyed it in Pokémon Legends: Arceus and, according to recent previews, it works quite well.</p>

<iframe title="Pokemon Legends Z-A | Mega Hawlucha Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuKTmyvwYSs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, shown above, we see Hawlucha take on a Machamp in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Towards the end of the trailer, the Hawlucha transforms into Mega Hawlucha and shows off some impressive moves. It’s a great spectacle, made even better by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iZ2dNEVQCw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another CG trailer</a> released alongside it. In that, we get a full-on wrestling match between the two Pokémon, which is fitting for them.</p>



<p>Hawlucha, first shown in 2013’s Pokémon X and Y, is a Fighting and Flying-type Pokémon. Inspired by Latin American wrestlers, it can perform the powerful Flying Press. Hawlucha has appeared in many other Pokémon titles like Sword and Shield, as well as Scarlet and Violet. Seeing the character’s popularity, it’s not surprising that many are delighted to see Mega Hawlucha enter the ring in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>

As it turns out, that was apparently by design, with Battlefield Studios saying the aim of the beta was to test the "fundamentals of gameplay," including movement, gunplay, and destruction. The new maps in upcoming Labs tests include Operation Firestorm--a remake of the popular Battlefield 3 map--and Mirak Valley. These are larger-scale maps featuring more vehicles and aircraft than what players saw in the open beta.</p><p>"We aim to validate gameplay balance on these new locations and compare it against previously tested maps," Battlefield Studios said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4558460-screenshot2025-08-28at1.17.04pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558460" data-ratio="0.56177156177156" data-width="858" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4558460-screenshot2025-08-28at1.17.04pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558460"></a><figcaption>A first look at Battlefield 6's big Mirak Valley map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4558460-screenshot2025-08-28at1.17.04pm.png"></figure><p>If you took part in a Labs test before the open beta, <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/1960037654759985489" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you're automatically in</a> for future tests.

<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b739dee15b50d/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last week or so, we here at Nintendo Life have been having a few spirited debates about when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> might <em>actually</em> launch. By all accounts, it's still scheduled for <strong>2025</strong>, but time's ticking by quickly, and we're still very much in the dark.</p>
<p>Frankly, after literal years of waiting, it feels good to finally talk about Prime 4's release date without feeling the need to plaster our faces with clown makeup (yeah, it's not just you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> fans). But here's the thing: Nintendo's schedule over the next few months is looking reasonably healthy, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</a> launching <em>today</em>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> following on <strong>16th October</strong>, and finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> on <strong>20th November</strong>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is also due in Winter, but this rather broad window means it could potentially come out in January or February 2026.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, assuming Prime 4 doesn't get pushed into 2026 (which, by the way, is definitely possible and shouldn't be ruled out entirely), then logically, we're probably looking at either September or December. There are a couple of us here in 'Camp September' and believe that Nintendo has probably already built up enough hype for the game to pull off a quick and ferocious marketing campaign within just a few weeks.</p>
<p>The rest of us, however, are pretty convinced that we're looking at a potential launch in early December. Rumour has it that we're getting some sort of Nintendo Direct in September, so assuming we finally get a launch date during said presentation, it would afford Nintendo a good two months or so to really drive up interest around the game and launch it without anything else getting in the way.</p>
<p>Of course, it's also not out of the question that the game could launch in either October or November. Audiences for Pokémon and Kirby are quite different to that of Metroid, and while there would certainly be a bit of crossover, we're not sure it would necessarily be enough to negatively impact any of the games in question. Heck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</a> launched just one week after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, after all.</p>
<p>But we want to hear from you, dear readers. When do you think might be the most logical time for Metroid Prime 4 to finally launch? Could Nintendo pull off a release in September, or is December looking more likely? Or... <em>gulp</em>... could it be pushed into 2026?</p>
<p>Let us know your thoughts by voting in the polls below and leaving a comment.</p>

			<p>Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have announced the Year 2 roadmap for Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, which will include the addition of a new playable class, new game modes, new operations, and more.</p>



<p>A trailer debuted today goes over everything to expect for the second year of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 updates, that'll kick off next week on September 4, 2025, which is days ahead of the one-year anniversary of Space Marine 2's launch.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new additions to gameplay, including the new modes, the new playable class, the Techmarine, and the new operations, additional weapons, enemies, and bosses, will all be added as part of free updates that will arrive throughout Saber's Year 2 plans for Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>There will also be a bevy of additional paid cosmetic content that will be delivered through the season pass for year 2, but of course cosmetics are always an optional bonus. You won't be missing out on any additional playable content if you skip out on the season pass. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 Year 2 Roadmap. Image credit: Focus Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>This past June, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment celebrated Space Marine 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/">surpassing 7 million copies sold</a> in the game's first year, and while it's clear from this roadmap that Saber is still hard at work on keeping Space Marine 2 updated, the studio has already confirmed that work has begun on<a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/"> Space Marine 3</a>.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Wccftech reviewed Space Marine 2 last year</a>, we enjoyed it, even if the gameplay fell into a rut after some time with it. "<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a decent game, but one that becomes repetitive quite quickly, though fans of this sort of action combat could find it enjoyable.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>My favorite moment in the nearly 100 hours I’ve spent with <i>Hitman World of Assassination</i> arrived right around the 80-hour mark. I had been on a terrible streak in Freelancer, the game’s roguelike mode. Sloppy in my stealth and assassination skills, I’d taken out my target, but was seen doing it–and I still needed to extract. Freelancer mode sometimes requires messiness, a willingness to just get the job done by any means necessary. That’s hard for someone prone to perfectionism such as myself. And I had been <i>too</i> messy this time. Now the guards are after me, popping off shots as I race down the corridors of a fancy hotel in Thailand. I duck into an empty bedroom to hide. The doors burst open; the guards have followed me. I move around the corner, just out of sight.</p> <p>A lone guard wanders into the room, my gun’s sights following his head as he moves. If he sees me, I’ll need to pull the trigger with haste and precision. There’s obviously no bullet-time mechanic in <i>Hitman</i>, but the rush of adrenaline, of needing to stay alive so as to not ruin my streak of successful kills and keep the excellent equipment I’ve found on this run, make every second feel like an eternity. My gun continues to trace this guard’s head. I realize that if I pull the trigger, I’ll also need to contend with the three guards in the adjacent room. I imagine what that will look like. Several contingency plans run through my head as I consider the myriad ways I can escape this situation, and just how ugly things might get if I need to do so with guns blazing.</p> <p>The guard leaves the room. They didn’t see me. I see the rest of the guards leave my immediate area on the map and breathe a sigh of relief. I have time now to wait for the alarms to go quiet. But my disguise as a hotel worker has been compromised. I sneak into the adjacent room and grab the one guard who has yet to leave, knock him out, and steal his clothes. I tuck his body out of sight and mosey onto the extraction point as I watch folks drag some of the poor bastards who got in my way out in body bags. I extract. There were a million ways this all could’ve gone down, but on this particular run, this was the story that the various elements of the emergent sandbox that is <i>Hitman</i> told. I return to my residence, load up another job and prepare as best I can, though I have no idea how the next one will turn out.</p>

 <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000620993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620993"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620993">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Hitman World of Assassination </i>is an epic package of three single-player campaigns, a variety of challenges both developer- and user-made strewn across several maps in its Contracts mode, and a riveting roguelike experience called Freelancer that aims to simulate the ultimate fantasy of assuming the role of the world’s most deadly assassin, with the worst members of society right in his crosshairs.</p> <p>The <i>WoA</i> update followed the release of 2021’s <i>Hitman 3</i>. The three recent and excellent campaigns from 2016 onwards are well-preserved, improved even, with tweaks made to the gameplay formula over the years. It makes for an excellent source of nearly endless stealth challenges using <i>Hitman</i>’s elegantly violent interplay of sneaking, subterfuge, stalking, stabbing, suffocating, and shooting. The violence sometimes takes on a comical role (one mission had me throwing butcher knives into the skulls of guards while wearing a friggin’ rabbit mask), but aside from some gentle sci-fi elements, the fiction is grounded in a dark reality that mirrors our own. It’s a world of brutal corporate powers, state actors with ill intentions, and secret societies aiming to construct a global order that secures the places of the rich and powerful while leaving the rest of us to be ignored or, in some cases, much worse. Agent 47 finds himself, along with his handler Diana, in a position to deal back some justice. A single assassination won’t itself change the world, but a continued pattern that strikes fear into the hearts of those who otherwise would never know it? Delivering that is your role as this mysterious, red-tye-wearing man with a barcode tattoo on the back of his head.</p>

 <h2>Deadly wetwork</h2> <p><i>Hitman</i>’s stealth is incredibly satisfying, though its mechanics are slightly less sophisticated than what you’d find in something like <i>Splinter Cell</i> or <i>Metal Gear Solid V</i>. Your footsteps, for example, won’t give you away nearly as much as they would for a Sam Fisher. But much as I enjoy the challenge of a more realistic stealth sim, realism is not always a prerequisite for a good time. (<i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, after all, didn’t have enemies hearing your footsteps until <i>Snake Eater.</i>) Besides, <i>Hitman</i> itself isn’t short on the challenge of remaining unseen, or, in Agent 47’s case, only being seen while wearing someone else’s clothes. The game otherwise contains many stealth trappings you’ve seen in other games: lockers and boxes to hide in, tall grass to duck under, the chore of hiding unconscious or dead bodies. In my 100 or so hours with the game, resources like tall grass don’t feel as easy to exploit as they do in, say, an <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> or <i>Horizon</i> game, but there’s still a familiar pattern here with their inclusion.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000620994" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620994"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620994">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I dove into <i>World of Assassination</i> by starting with the campaigns, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-hitman-experiment-has-been-a-success-1786352218"><i>Hitman </i>(2016)</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-2-the-kotaku-review-1830317433"><i>Hitman 2</i></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-3-the-kotaku-review-1846083354"><i>Hitman 3</i></a>.<i> Hitman</i>’s campaigns can make for a solid introduction, but the story-based mission structure can detract from the more-unscripted, stealth sandbox that beats at the heart of this game. On normal difficulties, each mission will prompt you with a suggestion to follow a narrative thread that, while often containing some very well-written and amusing story material, can feel a little on rails. These scenarios, often, rely on you changing outfits to disguise yourself, so you’re not so much sneaking around corners as you are committing a serious case of identity theft. Furthermore, when in an alerted state, Agent 47 can die rather quickly, so straying from that path can feel intimidating. The narrative moments are often well written and amusing, so it’s a good time, just not the kind of shadowy wetwork I tend to gravitate to.</p>

 <p>It can be hard to get out of a bad situation. <i>Hitman</i>’s environments, typically, are well populated, often packed with civilians who are quick to run to a guard if they catch you doing something weird, or even if they spot you walking around with a butcher knife. The places you’re infiltrating are unassuming locations for the most part: a dance club, an upscale hospital, a fashion show. And you always have a target, typically one who has a nefarious agenda. Even the game’s roguelike Freelancer mode, which reuses maps from the story-based campaigns, gives you targets who follow a routine. And the more challenging missions of that mode require you to pick your target out of a group of wandering suspects, looking for tells based on intel you’re given at the start. So your job involves more than just getting into some well-guarded area without drawing attention to yourself; you also need to find the right opportunity to take action after studying the behavior of your targets and determining the most efficient, or most hilarious, means of killing them. You’re going to need to adhere to some kind of structure for yourself, a routine of how you engage with enemies, how you manage your inventory, how you enter and leave rooms, and when you choose to open fire as opposed to running away. Improvisation is often only as good as the discipline you practice leading up to moments of uncertainty.</p> <p>That, to me, is key to what makes <i>Hitman</i> and many other stealth games work: It’s the joy of adhering to form, of approaching situations cautiously, with awareness, so that you’re prepared to respond to anything with a degree of competency and strategy, always aiming to get the situation under your control as opposed to just reacting to incoming action like you typically do in a standard shooter. Sure, <i>Hitman</i>’s gunplay is smooth enough that you can get into some <i>John Wick</i>-esque situations, but you’re bordering on a fail state when you do (though it’s also extremely easy to line up shots if you can force guards into a choke point where they can’t easily flank you).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000620995" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620995"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620995">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Always having that central objective, your target(s), helps direct the stealth gameplay into something meaningful. You’re not just sneaking for the thrill of breaking into some place you’re not supposed to be: You have a purpose, and that purpose isn’t a static thing that will never move. Playing <i>Hitman</i> well is about juggling time management, staying hidden, staying <i>focused</i>, and having a willingness to exploit an opportunity that you may not have expected.</p> <p>And while the main campaigns are satisfying (though I found the nuances of the plot a little hard to follow, especially during <i>Hitman 2</i>), its roguelike mode, Freelancer, is where I’ve spent the majority of my time and will continue to do so. It’s a wildly compulsive forever-game that I still struggle to put down, even after hitting a three-digit hour count.</p>

 <p>That said, there are some pain points worth mentioning. To start, Agent 47 is <i>slow</i>. His “sprint” is a jog at best and it feels a little strange sometimes that you can’t just book it to the exit when you’re under fire. Having a faster sprint might really interrupt the flow of the game, so I get not having it, but it still feels off. There’s also a weird issue where if you grab an enemy while climbing the stairs, even if you’re directly behind them, you’ll almost always get spotted by them and thus ruin a Silent Assassin run. Also, needing to use a thrown object to make noise and distract an enemy feels silly, as if Agent 47 couldn’t whistle or knock on a wall. And lastly, you’ll probably make a ton of use of Agent 47’s see-through-walls “Instinct.” Not only am I <i>not</i> a fan of this feature in modern stealth games as I feel it removes a huge part of the challenge of keeping track of your enemies, but it also coats the screen in a dull gray tone that isn’t pleasant to look at. For a feature that gets used so much, it could’ve used something with a bit of a cooler color. Make it blue and a little shimmery or something, I dunno. Anything but the monotone gray.</p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Hitman World of Assassination           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Because Mario ain't gonna get it done!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>IO Interactive</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person stealth action game.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Endless variety of stealth challenges, engaging risk/reward experience in Freelancer.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Reliance on "Instinct" view mode, sandbox can sometimes be unpredictable.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>January 2023: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs (played)  June 2025: Switch 2  August 2025: iOS (in episodic form)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>100 hours through the three campaigns, Freelancer, and other challenges.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p>To be fair, some of these omissions, such as sprinting fast or wall–knocking, would make for a very different game if they were present. Not being able to knock on walls or whistle, as you can in other stealth games, means you need to interact with the game’s item sandbox more. And not being able to run means there’s no get-out-of-jail-free card if you screw up. It makes sense when you consider these omissions as intentional parts of the game’s design, but when three guards are hot on your heels popping off shots, it’s hard not to think, “Why the hell can’t I run?” Oh, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-old-country-swimming-open-world-baldurs-gate-2000616867">you also can’t swim, but that’s okay</a>.</p>

 <h2>The joys of the Freelance lifestyle</h2> <p>Like most roguelikes, or extraction shooters for that matter, <i>Hitman</i>’s Freelancer mode tasks you with heading into hostile territory to get a job done <i>and</i> come out alive. Fail your mission and you lose all the sweet gear you have on you. And <i>Hitman</i> isn’t short on sweet gear.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000620997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620997"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620997">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The overall flow works like this: You’ll choose from a list of potential crime syndicates to go after. Each has a bit of fictional dressing on the side that isn’t explored much beyond an initial description that you’re going after human traffickers or organ harvesters. There’s an undeniable Batman quality to the work you’re doing, and after some successful missions, your handler will remark that your actions will make others “think twice before turning to a life of crime.”</p>

 <p>But Agent 47 isn’t Batman and isn’t content to just beat up his targets. No, he kills them. And each syndicate has a series of challenges to take on for each kill. These can range from things like only killing targets or only using silenced weapons to earning the Silent Assassin status for never being seen during your run, and more. Some challenges, like using explosives, shotguns, or other loud things, toss stealth out the window in favor of something a bit more daring. I tend not to do these as much since I prefer a stealthier playstyle, but <i>Hitman</i> can be a surprisingly fun run-and-gun game as well, albeit one that usually exists in short bursts as either you or your enemies are likely to go down pretty quickly. You can also stack some prestige challenges on top, which will ask you to use specific weaponry, never change your suit, or kill a target in a specific way.</p> <p>Sometimes these tasks step on each other. For example, asking me to get a melee kill but then also asking that I only get headshots on my enemies doesn’t exactly work. Each challenge grants money you can spend to purchase better gear, so it’s a bummer when you fail one, but sometimes you have to fail it if it means getting out alive and not losing your progress. That risk of losing progress by failing the mission, which will see you lose all the gear you have on you, means that you’ll need to be prepared to abandon a challenge if it’s asking too much. That risk and reward, combined with the scarcity of the weapons makes each gun you earn feel valuable, and it plays a significant role in how you prepare for each mission.</p>

 <p>A silenced sniper rifle, or even a silenced pistol, for example, is an incredibly useful tool. But maybe you know a certain level so well that, when a mission takes you there, you can leave those good weapons at your hideout for when you really need them on a more challenging assignment. Maybe it’s wise to save them for the more intense “showdowns,” where you have to spend more time studying the suspects to determine if they’re the target.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000620998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620998"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620998">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While the behavior of your standard targets in Freelance mode follows the flow of a <i>Hitman</i> level as it typically pans out, “showdown” missions lead up to a–you guessed it–showdown with a syndicate leader, who will be one of a few different suspects. You’ll learn what they’re wearing, what they’re likely to do during their mission, and what tells will give them away, such as whether they’re prone to allergies, like to smoke, or tend to pace nervously. It’s a fun game of cat and mouse in which you have to figure out who amongst the crowd is your mouse.</p>

 <p>Overall, the endless nature of this roguelike mode, packed with its healthy number of maps and a seemingly limitless way they can be used with different targets, weapons, and items, keeps the environments you’ll play over and over again feeling fresh. And the thrill of maintaining momentum on a run, especially as you increase your arsenal, makes for a rewarding game loop that can trap you for hours.</p> <hr> <p>As a veteran of many stealth games, <i>Hitman</i>’s endlessly unpredictable roguelike mode is what appeals to me the most. It’s an experience I can’t easily replicate elsewhere. But there are other challenges that are definitely worth exploring in the <i>World of Assassination</i> package as well, especially as they’ll help you better learn maps and strategies for staying unseen.</p>

 <p>Arcade mode, for example, sees you taking on “Elusive Targets,” who, upon failure, can’t be pursued again for several real-world hours. Many of them are only available during certain times as well. These targets might also have specific ways they’ll need to be killed or their levels may come with unique constraints. Contracts mode features both preset and user-made contracts from any of the game’s many levels, often with optional challenges such as the need to use a sniper rifle or explosive device, or to execute someone while wearing a specific disguise.</p>

 <p>I haven’t spent nearly as much time on these modes, but they can serve as helpful ways to practice very specific ways of playing, which will teach you skills and techniques that’ll come in handy across any of the game’s modes.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000620999" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620999"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620999">© Screenshot: IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Hitman World of Assassination</i> offers up an exquisite buffet-style set of amusing and challenging stealth challenges with such an abundance as to be virtually endless. The moment-to-moment stealth gameplay is as challenging as it is rewarding. Agent 47 may feel a little stiffer and slower than someone like Venom Snake from <i>MGSV</i>, but once you get used to the pacing of <i>Hitman</i>, it reveals itself as an engaging stealth game that invites mastery over its interlocking and sometimes unpredictable systems. Time spent in this game is about getting better at the game itself, not just unlocking and collecting cool suits. Whether emerging victorious or suffering defeat, playing the role of Agent 47 is a thrilling and challenging experience that can last for countless hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another major union is forming in the video game space as over 450 developers of Blizzard’s Diablo franchise have voted to unionize. </p>



<p>The Communication Workers of America (CWA) has announced that the developers will be a member of one of three available unions—CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, Calif.; CWA Local 1118 in Albany, N.Y.; and CWA Local 6215 in Austin, Texas. The employees joining include developers, artists, engineers, designers and support staffs.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/hundreds-diablo-game-developers-join-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to the CWA,</a> the new union is <strong>“one of the largest wall-to-wall unions at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</strong> It also comes just weeks after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-story-and-franchise-developers-vote-to-unionize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development teams</a> voted to unionize.</p>



<p><strong>“I grew up playing Diablo, and I feel lucky that I get to work at Blizzard on a game that’s very special to me and the gaming community,”</strong>&nbsp;Diablo software engineer Skye Hoefling said.&nbsp;<strong>“But passion can’t protect us from job instability. Our union allows us to focus on making magical experiences for our players instead of worrying about the unstable job industry.”</strong></p>



<p>Designer Ryan Littleton added that the last round of Microsoft layoffs had him more determined to make sure employees are taken care of.</p>



<p><strong>“[None] of us should have to live with that constant worry that we might be let go at the drop of a hat,”</strong> he said. <strong>“A union allows us to organize across the industry to make great games and protect the developers who create them from the constant pressures of layoffs, passion tax, and crunch.”</strong></p>



<p>CWA says Microsoft has recognized the union’s formation. Since July 2024, CWA says that over 3,500 Microsoft employees have unionized with the group.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics announced an unknown number of layoffs yesterday, vaguely citing “evolving business decisions,” as the reason.&nbsp;</p><p>The studio shared the news on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">LinkedIn</a>, writing that the decision wasn't made lightly and was made to “ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</p><p>“To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition,” reads Crystal Dynamics’ statement.</p><p>The message ends with confirmation that the future of Tomb Raider, including an <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/04/05/crystal-dynamics-announces-new-tomb-raider-game-will-be-powered-by-unreal-engine-5">upcoming new title</a>, will be unaffected by the layoffs.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider (2013)</p>

</article>
<p>Crystal Dynamics does not elaborate further, but it’s worth noting the studio had been working on the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-lays-off-thousands-of-employees-cancels-perfect-dark-everwild-and-more-xbox">recently canceled reboot of Perfect Dark</a> alongside the game’s primary – and now defunct – developer, The Initiative. It’s hard to imagine this didn't have some factor in yesterday's layoffs.</p><p>The news comes after the studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">laid off 17 employees</a> in March. As of now, Crystal Dynamics, which was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/05/02/square-enix-sells-crystal-dynamics-eidos-montreal-and-more-including-tomb-raider-ip-to">acquired by Embracer Group</a> in 2022, has a new single-player Tomb Raider title in the works. First announced in 2022, the project will be <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/12/15/amazon-games-will-publish-crystal-dynamics-next-tomb-raider-game">published by Amazon Games</a> and built in Unreal Engine 5. We know little about the game beyond this, and a release window is unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>Crystal Dynamics has not shipped a new triple-A title since the polarizing Marvel’s Avengers in 2020, though it collaborated with Aspyr on Tomb Raider I-III/IV-VI Remastered collections, released in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and 2024's Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-lays-off-an-unknown-number-of-staff]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tides of Tomorrow is one of those gaming concepts that is both eye-opening in its breadth and ambitions, and mind boggling with all the possibilities it needs to account for. It’s both a game about time loops, and yet not one where you loop in time; a game where you are beholden to the actions of other players online, and yet one where you are playing solo and can play offline.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Tomorrow - Release Date Trailer [Official]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43RMfZzY-M4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the makers of Road 96, Tides of Tomorrow looks in many ways like it could be a high octane action game, but is much more a narrative adventure with action fed into it. The world of Elynd has been consumed by water and plastic waste, lending it an appearance that’s one part Waterworld and yet a little reminiscent of Splash Damage’s parkour shooter Brink – though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/05/10/review-brink/">looking at screenshots from 2011</a>, I must be misremembering just how bright and colourful that game was!</p>



<p>You start your story first by choosing who to follow, someone whose prior playthrough and choices are used as part of the basis of your own. This can be someone that’s been suggested by the game, from your friends list, or even using a specific game seed that’s shared online. All you’ll really know are some general traits for their playstyle and their completion percentage. You can also play this game without an internet connection, drawing from a pool of developer-created playthroughs baked into the game.</p>

<p>As you’re fished out of the water and resuscitated by Nahe, you have no memory of who you are and how you got there, but are quickly introduced to the ills that plague this world. Plastemia is a thoroughly fictionalised disease caused by microplastic pollution – a fictionalise ailment from a real world problem that we have yet to fully grasp the magnitude of –&nbsp;and in this world’s case, it’s a universal plague that’s lead to people with glowing plastic lesions spreading across their bodies. There’s a possible cure, though, and as a Tidewalker, you’re uniquely capable of bringing hope to this world.</p>

<p>Well, not quite uniquely. You’re not the first Tidewalker that has been dredged up, and you might not be the last –&nbsp;narratively there’s only been one Tidewalker before you, though there could have been millions. You and your people are connected, able to see glimmers of the past and events that went before you. Tides of Tomorrow takes this asynchronous multiplayer idea and wraps narrative, setting and so much more around it in truly fascinating ways. While some parts of the trailers might make it look like a PvPvE heist ’em up, you won’t actually encounter other players, just the consequences of their actions from potentially just a couple hours previously.</p>
<p>This works on both the micro and the macro level. Even in the opening dialogue with Nahe, you can see the dialogue choices made by the player you’re following, choosing whether to take the same path or to diverge to your own morality and feelings. Offered a dose of the Ozen that is able to stave off Plastemia, it’s up to you whether you take it or leave it for the next person. Alternatively, there might not be an Ozen dose for you if the previous player was a little selfish.</p>

<p>Later, coming to an NPC by a broken bridge and talking to them, they might accuse you of having broken it –&nbsp;your Tidewalker garb makes you all look largely the same –&nbsp;and you can switch to the Tides of Time vision to see the echoes of the previous player’s actions, just as you can leave actions behind for the next player to view. Turning that around and using it as a new conversation point, you can defuse the situation and potentially get the bridge repaired, not for yourself, but for the next Tidewalker coming through.</p>
<p>But, these choices can completely change the state of the world as you arrive. If the previous person caused a great big ruckus, the mayor could announce a general clamp down, blocking off the marketplace with barbed wire and guards, forcing you to try and stealth your way through, and hoping that the locals are still on your side. The time of day can change, the tone of the environment completely shift, and depending on how generous the other person was, you could find your own progress hampered by a lack of resources.</p>

<p>Thankfully you are given an off-ramp from that initial choice of followed player. Between missions, you float on the open, trash-filled water and are given a choice of who to follow for the next stage of the story and the next location. Additionally, you might be following a friend who’s only completed the first few missions, and so need to switch to another player as you overhaul their progress.</p>
<p>Tides of Tomorrow is a truly fascinating game, DigixArt blending player choice into the narrative that they’ve constructed, potentially giving dramatically different experiences for every player far beyond gaming’s traditional good and evil playthroughs. I’m truly fascinated to see how it all comes together when Tides of Tomorrow launches in February 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-elden-ring-nightreign-mode-is-about-to-ratchet-the-difficulty-up-to-11.1283217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Revealed weeks ago <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">in a datamine</a>, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> publisher Bandai Namco has officially confirmed a new endgame difficulty mode coming to the multiplayer roguelite next month. Deep of Night features new relics, randomized challenges, and an endless mode for those able to reach it.</p> <p>“‘Deep of Night’ is a high-difficulty challenge mode designed for seasoned players who have navigated through the Night many times,” the publisher writes <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared">in a new blog post</a>. The mode arrives on September 10 during the game’s usual update time and changes up the usual <em>Nightreign</em> run in a few ways. Players won’t be able to select the Nightlord they face or which Shifting Earth event is active, and enemies will all be stronger.</p> <p>The “high-difficulty mode” is separated by various depths. Depth 1 is the easiest. Depths 2 and 3 are harder. Depths 4 and 5, meanwhile, feature an “endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills” so you can just play until you die. A skill-based matchmaking system will rank players and group them accordingly. Plus, new Relics and additional Vessel slots will give players more buildcrafting opportunities.</p>

 <h2>What does <em>Nightreign</em> change in Deep of Night?</h2> <p>The most challenging bit of Deep of Night might not be the boss fights either. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">Players who have already been exploring the mode early</a>, thanks to mods, have found that the Night’s Tide storm, which slowly engulfs the map, does more damage. And that’s even before players suffer from a new debuff exclusive to gear discovered in the Deep of Night mode, which makes players more susceptible to the toxic rainfall. The rarest loot players pick up can come with other drawbacks as well to make surviving that much harder.</p> <p>For now, players have two more weeks to try and beat any Everdark Sovereigns that are still on their to-do list. For many, that’s probably Libra, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-libra-summons-everdark-tips-2000617780">a fight that’s equal parts clever and chaotic</a>. Fans have also already discovered clues for additional upcoming <em>Nightreign</em> content in the form of new subclasses. It’s unclear if those will be part of another free update or paid DLC in the future. There’s still so much of <em>Elden Ring</em> that could be repurposed into new content for the multiplayer spin-off.</p> <p>One thing that I’d love to see FromSoftware do, and which presumably wouldn’t cost any extra money, is just flip a switch to make all of <em>Nightreign</em>‘s random events spawn more frequently. Some players have spent 100 hours in the game and still only encountered them <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wandering-mausoleum-meteor-1851784652">once or twice</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mini-crossword-paywall-free-new-york-times-games-angry-fans-wordle-2000620987</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nyt%E2%80%99s-mini-crossword-no-longer-free-to-play-and-fans-are-pissed.1283214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <em>Mini Crossword</em> is one of the most popular games offered by <a href="https://kotaku.com/nyt-connections-hint-fie-crossword-1850941717"><em>The New York Times.</em></a> And for years, it was free. But that changed recently, and fans aren’t happy about it at all, calling the newspaper company “greedy” for putting the game behind a paywall.</p> <p>In 2014, <em>The New York Times</em> launched a new, mini version of its famous crossword. The Mini Crossword became a popular hit for the newspaper as it only took a few minutes to solve, was updated daily, and was a perfect, tiny experience that became a part of many people’s morning routines. It also helped that the Mini Crossword was completely free to play. That just changed, however, and as you might expect, a lot of word-loving gamers aren’t happy about it.</p> <p>On August 27, <a href="https://parade.com/living/new-york-times-mini-crossword-placed-behind-paywall">with seemingly no warning</a>, thousands of players opened up the Mini Crossword as usual on their browser or phone, only to discover that the fun little word game was no longer free and was now locked behind a paywall. As of Wednesday, only those who have an NYT Games or newspaper subscription can access the Mini Crossword.&nbsp; And while not as popular as the Mini Crossword, two other NYT Games are also now locked behind a subscription: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NYTgames/comments/1n29sn6/mini_tiles_and_letter_boxed_behind_a_paywall/"><em>Tiles</em> and <em>Letter Boxed</em>.</a> But don’t worry, <em>The New York Times</em> has conveniently made sure to offer a discount on subscriptions to its games service right as it made this controversial change.</p>

 <p>Over on Twitter,&nbsp; posts from the NYT Games account often receive no more than seven or eight replies. <a href="https://x.com/NYTGames/status/1957482240948006914">But a recent tweet mentioning the Mini Crossword</a> has received over 60 replies. Most of them are from very angry players who are upset about the sudden change. Here are just some of the replies under that tweet:</p> <ul> <li>“You greedy fucks give me my free Mini Crossword.”</li> <li>“Y’all are evil putting the Mini behind a paywall…”</li> <li>“Ask your bosses how it feels to ruin a small part of thousands of people’s daily routines.”</li> <li>“GIVE US THE MINI CROSSWORD BACK YOU GREEDY SCUMBAGS”</li> </ul> <p>In recent years, <em>The New York Times</em> has become more of a video game company than a newspaper. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">Data shows that more people are paying the newspaper to play its games</a> than to read its news or consume any of its other content. While that has likely helped keep the paper afloat at a time when online and traditional media are struggling, it also means they are now beholden to gamers. So <em>The New York Times</em> should probably get used to having its mentions filled with angry people yelling.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Bandai Namco has announced a new mode called Deep of Night for Elden Ring Nightreign. Set to arrive September 11, it's meant to offer a more challenging experience for veteran players with stronger enemies to face.</p><p dir="ltr">Deep of Night was officially revealed on <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-has-appeared">the Bandai Namco website</a>, after it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-ranked-mode-could-be-coming-according-to-datamine/1100-6533778/">datamined as a possible ranked mode for Elden Ring Nightreign</a> earlier this month. The mode will see wins and losses "affecting the depth" of players in this high-difficulty mode. The post challenges people to beat Depth 3, while specifying that the fourth and fifth levels are actually an "endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills."</p>

			<p>Even though the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over, you can still get the chance to play it again ahead of its launch on October 10, 2025. Alongside a new trailer for the PC version of Battlefield 6 that debuted today, EA and Battlefield Studios also resumed sign-ups for its Battlefield Labs playtesting program, where new maps, gameplay modes, and adjustments from the beta will be tested ahead of launch.</p>



<p>The trailer is a feature highlight reel of the experience PC players will be able to have, so long as they have the hardware for it, of course. With ultrawide monitor support, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/">NVIDIA DLSS multi-frame generation support</a>, along with support for Intel XeSS and AMD FSR, and boasting 600+ customization options for PC. If you played the beta on your PC, then you're probably already aware of this. You're also probably aware of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">secure boot issue</a> that plagued many players just trying to get into Battlefield 6, which, in its own way, gets a mention in the trailer as it highlights the game's Javelin Anti-Cheat protection.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>What's more exciting is the fact that there's still a chance to play more Battlefield 6 before its launch, with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing">Battlefield Labs sign-ups resuming again</a>. If you weren't already in the playtesting program, you're getting another shot, with the collective Battlefield Studios looking to test all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">changes previously discussed based on feedback from the beta</a>, along with new functionality for Battlefield Portal and server browsing.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs playtesters will also get to try out new maps like Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley, and be able to test out Hardcore Mode for the first time.</p>



<p>If you loved the beta and are dying to play more Battlefield 6, then the Labs playtesting program is your best bet to jump in as soon as you can. Beyond that, you'll have to wait until it launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025, to jump back in the fight.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767427/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby%E2%80%99s-new-switch-2-expansion-adds-just-the-right-amount-of-challenge.1283196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>So I heard you want to play <em>Kirby</em> on hard mode: tough bosses, tricky platforming, complicated puzzles, hidden collectibles, and maybe even punishments for failing. The <em>Star-Crossed World</em> expansion in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22991829/nintendo-switch-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review"><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>’s Switch 2 edition certainly</a> introduces new challenges. There’s pressure from time constraints and consecutive platforming sequences, multistep puzzles, and bosses have more health, varied attacks, and phases. In <em>Star-Crossed World</em>, the promise of a more difficult <em>Kirby</em> game reaches its conceptual limits. But how hard can a game built around pressing one button to obliterate the problems in front of you get?</p><p><em>Kirby</em> games are easy and sometimes monotonous because answers almost always precede their questions. To keep things simple, almost every action that Kirby can take requires one button. Vacuum up an enemy or object and shoot it out, or copy its ability and replace your vacuum with whatever new power-up you have. These new verbs are often used to solve puzzles, such as burning a fuse, so they have to be given out to the player ahead of time. <em>Forgotten Land</em> kept things interesting by arranging its questions and answers in a 3D space and blending more clues to hidden collectibles into its various apocalyptic environments to obscure everything <em>just</em> enough.</p><p>In <em>Star-Crossed World</em>, 12 levels have been reshaped by the crystalline powers of a legendary meteorite, introducing alternate routes and areas. Each of these levels is stuffed with little puzzles and platforming challenges like the base game and filled with environmental clues to new hidden collectibles. It keeps you engaged, never giving away its secrets too easily. It’s more <em>Forgotten Land</em>, but <em>Forgotten Land</em> had some good ideas to expand on, like its signature gimmick, Mouthful Mode.</p><p>Mouthful Mode adds a little bit of friction. Instead of powered-up versions of other abilities, it introduces entirely new verbs that are incorporated into puzzles and set piece moments: drift, illuminate, glide… vend? Three new Mouthful Modes are mixed into <em>Star-Crossed World</em>’s levels: slide, gear, and spring.</p><p>Slide is used for bespoke skiing sections that contain collectibles in hard-to-reach places, and you’ll find yourself replaying these sections at least once if you’re concerned with getting everything. Gear lets Kirby climb up walls, introducing entirely vertical platforming sections with a satisfying haptic feeling in the hand. Spring is the most used, and for good reason. It emphasizes jumping and — consequently — falling. Unable to hover, spring plays a bit more like Mario, with moving platforms, timed paths, and the specter of starting a section over if you fall. Over five hours of gameplay, I was entertained by the new ideas and puzzles presented in these levels.</p><p><em>Star-Crossed World</em> also expands on <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>’s optional endgame, the Colosseum boss rush mode. It’s made challenging by endurance — many fights, limited healing. The game’s true final boss is waiting at the very end of the new Ultimate Cup Z EX, and it’s been supplanted again with a new entity to join Kirby’s pantheon of cute, eldritch, and cute eldritch demons that bow to the pink puffball.</p><p>Combat in <em>Forgotten Land</em> is built around another new verb introduced in the base game, dodge, and Colosseum squeezes everything out of Kirby’s few actions. Much like Link in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, closely evading an enemy’s attacks slows time, allowing Kirby to get hits in with vacuumed up stars or whatever copy ability is on hand. <em>Star-Crossed World</em>’s additional bosses add some new mechanics to the base game’s already powered-up variants of its original bosses.</p><p>And it all feels balanced around revisiting my old, near 100 percent save with leveled-up copy abilities that resemble demigod-like powers. Tornado turns from a gust into a hurricane, burn from a flame to purple dragon wings of fire. I mostly used my overpowered sword, which was drawn from the grim reaper that multiplies in size and crashes down with fiery tornadoes. Against even powered-up versions of basic bosses, it takes just two hits to deplete entire health bars.</p><p>Toward the end of the Colosseum, however, bosses get more health bars and more phases. They also deal out enough blows that losing all of Kirby’s health becomes an inevitable threat. Twenty minutes into the final fight, game over means restarting the run entirely.</p><p>That would be punishing if there were not plenty of health items you could buy ahead of time, if scanning Amiibo didn’t drop more healing items, and if copy abilities weren’t so overpowered. But that feeling of being overpowered is, I think, the point. It’s a bathetic balance — the moe kirby versus the end-time demon foretold in legend to reap the planet from beyond this dimension, or fighting a monarchical penguin to orchestral rock with an opera accompaniment. When Kirby decimates a lesser foe with the power of a hurricane, or a split atom, or death itself, I don’t feel like the game is anticlimactic, but has instead ramped up from trivial to lofty.</p><p>But Kirby doesn’t flatter your ego, either. I’m no god; we’re all equal when we hold down B for three charges to get the big hit in with our sword. That makes the potential constraints of any kind of hard mode conceptually antithetical to <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>. Copy abilities are overpowered, always timely, and they create brief spectacles of fun. What thrill you may further seek from the endurance trials of its boss gauntlet is also amplified by this streak of total annihilation coming to a climactic end.</p><p>So even when <em>Star-Crossed World</em> does everything it can to add challenge, it can never get too hard — and that’s enough for Kirby.</p><p><sub>Kirby and the Forgotten Land – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767427/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-switch-2#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njc0OTAz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Autumn Wright</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767427/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A bundle of games aiming to raise money to aid the United Nations' Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in their efforts to help Palestinian refugees is set to go on sale via Itch.io next week. Just over 380 games are part of it, including the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lucifer-within-us">Lucifer Within Us</a>, and a <a href="https://pajamabeevegan.itch.io/cowlifesimrpg">cow life simulator</a> that features an alligator who's really into arson.</p>
<p>Organised by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/junchgaming.bsky.social">Junch</a> and the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seagamesforgood.bsky.social">South East Asian Games for Good initiative</a>, the bundle's dubbed Play for Peace - Games for Palestine. It's taken over 10 months to come together. The result's a 382-game strong bundle that includes a huge variety of creations that contain not a whiff of AI or NFTs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The people of Palestine continue to be subjected to hostility, destruction of homes, critical infrastructure, and devastasting loss of lives," reads the Play for Peace bundle's freshly-published <a href="https://itch.io/b/2979/play-for-peace-games-for-palestine-2025-charity-bundle">Itch listing</a>. "We, as a games community, will bring together our incredible games from across the world, for a charity bundle with proceeds that go directly to Palestine aid and relief.</p>
<p>"We are partnering with UNRWA USA, who will receive the funds and grant them to <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/">UNRWA (UN agency)</a> in support of direct humanitarian aid in Palestine. Together, the game dev community and UNRWA USA will raise awareness on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">the situation in Gaza</a>, spotlight our communities, and the devs participating in this charity drive."</p><p>In addition to the games I mentioned in the intro - the cow life sim's definitely worth checking out - the bundle includes everything from lesbian devil-hunting action, courtesy of fittingly-named boss rusher <a href="https://itsmelilyv.itch.io/bossgame">Bossgame</a>, to tabletop adventures like <a href="https://heycentaur.itch.io/hetthamsya">Stirring the Hornet's Nest at Het Thamsya</a>. A couple of others that've caught me eye are <a href="https://black-heart-games-studio.itch.io/street-cleaning-day">Street Cleaning Day: Rat's Revenge</a>, a wave-shooter about a rodent fending off soapy bubbles, and <a href="https://goosewho.itch.io/i-get-this-call-every-day">I Get This Call Every Day</a>.</p>
<p>The latter's a point-and-click simulation of its creator's experience working in a call centre, featuring "terrible art [which] conveys a terrible work environment" and the choice of whether to "lose politely or lose spectacularly".</p> <div>

<p>If that brutal reality isn't for you, there's also <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/fit-for-a-king">Fit For a King</a>, a Henry VIII simulator that offers the chance to marry everything, execute everything, and/or spend it all. "While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fit-for-a-king">Fit For A King</a> could have been full of lazy, bargain bin Blackadder jokes, it’s got a wonderfully dadaist edge to its humour instead, and an indefinable atmosphere I could only call early 2000s web game energy," former RPSer Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-fit-for-a-king">wrote of that one</a>. Or, there's <a href="https://daffodil.itch.io/virtua-blinds">Virtua Blinds</a>, which looks like it could be the greatest thing I've never played.</p>
<p>As the bundle's curators wrote: "All of it represents the creative expression of artists and developers who want to help raise money through their art for one of the most important causes of our time - freedom and the ending of genocide in Palestine." The Play for Peace - Games for Palestine bundle will be on sale from 5PM BST/12PM ET/9AMPT/6PM CEST on September 2nd, and will cost $8.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-pc-trailer-reveals-most-advanced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-pc-trailer-reveals-%E2%80%98most-advanced-experience-in-franchise-history%E2%80%99.1283181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts has unveiled an all-new trailer for Battlefield 6, this one focused on the game’s PC ecosystem. It was highlighted that the PC version of Battlefield 6 represents the ‘most advanced PC experience in franchise history’, with a list of attributes longer than my arm. </p>



<p>The recent open beta for Battlefield 6 was a monumental success on PC especially, with Steam player counts skyrocketing to monumental levels. The hopes for the full launch on October 10 are still soaring as wishlist counts grow inexorably.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-pc-features-confirmed">All Battlefield 6 PC Features Confirmed</h2>



<p>The kickass new trailer for Battlefield 6 showcases the game’s PC accolades and attributes, including ultrawide support, uncapped frame rates, and 4K visuals. They’re elements that you’d expect from the highly anticipated Battlefield game, but it’s nice to see them rounded up in a specific trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official PC Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMBBXqu0OLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Beyond those elements, Battlefield 6 will also have support for DLSS, Intel XeSS, and AMD FSR’s latest versions.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, as the team at Electronic Arts also stressed that Battlefield 6 on PC will have <strong>over 600 customization options</strong>. I assume that expanse covers everything from keybinds and color palettes to iconography and audio mechanics. Battlefield has always been a highly customizable game, but the team is going above and beyond this time around.</p>



<p>In the most recent Battlefield 6 news, an analyst came out to declare that this year’s<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-already-beaten-battlefield-6-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Call of Duty title has already ‘beaten’</a> the imminent resurgence of Battlefield. Thanks to what he dubbed ‘autopilot purchasing’, there’s no way that Battlefield 6 will overcome Call of Duty this year.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Battlefield 6 on PC? Let me know at what level you’re expecting to run the game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-explains-why-kyle-crane-is-a-thirst-trap-in-dying-light-the-beast.1283178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re mere weeks away from the (delayed) release of Dying Light: The Beast. This long-awaited game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dubbed ‘Dying Light 3’</a> by many, including Techland’s franchise director. It’s an almighty iteration of the ten-year-old zombie apocalypse series that welcomes back Kyle Crane, who hasn’t been seen since the first game debuted in 2015.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland published a blog post diving into the evolution of Kyle Crane between Dying Light (2015) and Dying Light: The Beast. Time hasn’t been kind to Crane, and he’s been brought back to the players in a twisted,<strong> </strong>animalistic state – but he’s also a hunk and a complete thirst trap.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<h2 id="h-crane-is-no-old-man">Crane Is No Old Man</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-they-tried-to-break-him" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post published</a> on the Pilgrim Outpost, Techland explained that they didn’t want Kyle Crane to resemble an old man in Dying Light: The Beast:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We experimented with different approaches, and quickly discovered that details like graying hair or baldness are not an option as they made him feel like someone else or not as heroic as we envisioned him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While that’s a kick in the gut for any graying or balding folks out there, it’s indicative of the desire to keep Kyle Crane young-ish and virile. That’s easily represented in the recent screenshots posted by the team, which could have been pulled straight out of a pin-up calendar featuring our man Kyle Crane:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>According to Techland’s artistic experts, designing the new Kyle Crane was all about reflecting the decade-plus of abuse he’s suffered at the hands of his captors:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>His model went through multiple refreshes, until we reached a look that felt authentic.&nbsp; The goal was to show, in his face and body, what over a decade of imprisonment and torture did to him. His body carries scars and marks left by experiments. We didn’t just design random wounds – we thought carefully about what kinds of experiments he might have been subjected to, and what kind of traces they would leave behind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everything from the hue of Crane’s eyes to the veins on his arms has been painstakingly crafted to reflect the new era of this legendary character, played perfectly in The Beast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Roger Craig Smith</a>. The character model features a ‘duality’ that shows players there’s still something human inside the brute that is Kyle Crane.</p>



<p>Techland revealed that Kyle Crane will evolve as the game unravels, becoming less of a monster as the story unfolds and he finds something of his former self after breaking free from his torturers and exacting revenge.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released worldwide on September 19. Are you picking up a copy? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

That’s a healthy 18% jump, and it tracks with what I’m seeing in collector circles: people are still chasing the big four gold cards, and Giratina seems to be the crown jewel. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqwlvp?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo VSTAR</a> has also caught some upward momentum lately, jumping from around $102 to nearly $127. It’s not just about nostalgia with this one – <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAvMk?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">its twin art featuring the Charizard faceoff</a> is iconic and playable decks still find room for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flipside, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7NAR?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon VSTAR</a> has slipped from its February peak of $49.87 down to about $45.54.

But lately, it’s slipped about 9% in value. I think this one’s a mix of over-saturation and fading competitive relevance. Ivy Star is a solid switch ability, and Leaf Guard can wall a bit of damage, but the format’s gotten faster and more aggressive, and Leafeon just isn’t keeping up. It’s still a nice display piece, but with more copies floating around and other Secret Rares taking the spotlight, it’s drifting down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxm48?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon VSTAR</a> is in a similar boat. It’s down about 10% from its February highs, currently sitting around $43. Crystal Star offers decent protection, and Icicle Shot has some control value, but let’s be honest – no one’s building their deck around this card anymore. Like Leafeon, its value was inflated by early demand from collectors chasing the full Eeveelution spread, but that moment seems to have passed. It’s still a strong artwork, but in today’s market, that’s not enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2DoN?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deoxys VMAX</a> has dropped nearly 20% since February, and I’m not surprised. Protective DNA is a cool ability on paper, reducing damage from opposing VSTARs, but it’s a little too niche in practice. Max Drain heals and hits for 160, which was decent a few metas ago, but now it feels underpowered. Players aren’t reaching for it, and collectors are more focused on the cleaner, flashier Secret Rares.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1y0V?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suicune V</a> has taken a heavier hit, dropping around 24% since May. This one hurts a little because I still think Blizzard Rondo and Fleet-Footed give it solid play value. But it’s been power-crept hard, and its role in decks has diminished. The artwork is still clean, and there’s nostalgia here, but in the context of the Galarian Gallery, it’s getting outshined. With so many cards in the set, not every V is going to hold long-term value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3W5R?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raikou V</a> has followed a similar path, slipping about 22% since March. It’s basically Suicune V’s Lightning-type twin, with the same draw ability and scalable damage based on benched Pokémon. Again, decent in a vacuum, but there are just better, more dynamic options now. This feels like a victim of set fatigue – there are too many similar cards in Crown Zenith, and only the top-tier ones are holding collector or player attention.</p><p id="pokmon-card-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/feature-image-4-1756393853900.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJk3k?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giratina VSTAR (Secret)</a> is having a real moment. It’s jumped nearly 18% in the last month, and honestly, I think it still has more room to grow. Lost Impact and Star Requiem are both game-ending tools in the right deck, and the alt-art gold treatment puts it near the top of many collectors’ wishlists. If you’re looking for a high-end Crown Zenith card to hold, this one feels as stable as it gets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqwlvp?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo VSTAR</a> has quietly surged too, climbing around 24% since June. Star Raid and Psy Purge both offer serious utility, especially in matchups where you want to punish your opponent for loading their board with Vs. But let’s be real – this one’s rising just as much for the art as the gameplay. That Charizard vs. Mewtwo scene is one of the most memorable alt-arts in the set, and people are starting to grab it before prices push any higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgB5n?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arceus VSTAR (Secret)</a> has seen a solid 14% boost, and it’s one of those cards that straddles playability and collectibility perfectly. Starbirth is still one of the strongest consistency abilities in the game, letting you grab any two cards from your deck. Trinity Nova helps ramp energy quickly, which is never out of style. The gold art has a premium feel, and with Arceus being such a central figure in the franchise, it’s an easy card to like long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8g4b?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR (Secret)</a> is up 16% since July, and I think people are finally waking up to just how powerful Star Chronos can be. Taking an extra turn is one of the rarest effects in the game, and when paired with the right energy acceleration, it’s absolutely devastating. Metal Blast scales well too. From a collector standpoint, the gear-and-time themed art is eye-catching, and scarcity is keeping demand high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbbwgx?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Finally, Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR (Secret)</a> has climbed around 13%. Star Portal remains one of the best ways to recycle Water Energy, and Subspace Swell scales nicely with full benches, which are common in current lists. The art has a dynamic, aquatic style that’s really grown on people. It may not be as flashy as Giratina, but it’s a steady riser, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it break the $70 mark soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

There’s plenty to note in here for fans, but highlights include the new Techmarine class, now set for release during the first quarter of 2026, a new Battle Barge expansion during the same period, and a new Siege map coming Q2 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer, below, reveals a first look at some of this new content, including the Chaos Spawn and the Mutalith Vortex Beast, and new weapons the Pyreblaster, Pyrecannon, Power Axe, Combi Melta, and the Xenophase Blade. The latter is a Power Sword-like melee weapon created with alien (we think Necron) tech and used by warriors of the Deathwatch Chapter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Year 2 content:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Four new Operations and a new Siege map</li><li>Two new Eternal War arenas</li><li>New Stratagems (PvE) and Helbrute Onslaught (PvP) game modes</li><li>New playable class: The Techmarine</li><li>New weapons and free unlockable weapon variants for existing weapons</li><li>New enemies and bosses</li><li>New Progression mechanics</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The September 4 Anniversary Update also comes with the release of Space Marine 2’s second Season Pass and its first two DLCs: the Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack, including a new Champion skin for the Bulwark class and Power Sword skin for the former, and over 40 new cosmetics celebrating seven of the Imperial Fists’ Successor Chapters for the latter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Year 2 roadmap image, below, mentions the new Omnissiah Axe coming alongside the Techmarine. This is a potentially different weapon than the Power Axe shown off in the trailer, so the hope is it functions in a fresh way as well as looks unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the year, the Season Pass II will grant players nine new DLCs, with new Champion skins, armour pieces, and heraldry markings. While existing Chapters like the Blood Angels and Salamanders are to receive new cosmetics, fan-favorite Chapters like the Raptors, Iron Hands, and Carcharodons will get their due time in the spotlight.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/unnamed-12-1756393367664.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2 Year 2 DLC roadmap.

                <p>Bella Ramsey, who stars in HBO's The Last of Us as Ellie, has a message for viewers who are upset about the show and the changes from the source material heading into Season 3: "You don't have to watch it."</p><p>Appearing on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6pdBtYGyS44Tvv0Xy46HXn?si=_bMLHvokTTugDZwPztkSUg&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=9ac8872088cd4e28" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Awardist podcast</a> (<a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1960918774498124195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Culture Crave</a>), Ramsey first reacted to the controversial second season, in which Kaitlyn Dever's Abby brutally murders Joel (Pedro Pascal). Ramsey said they tried to "steer clear" as much as possible from the discourse and controversy.</p><p>"There is nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There is nothing that can be changed or altered [for Season 2]. There is not really any point in reading or looking at anything. People are of course entitled to their opinions. It doesn't affect the show, it doesn't affect how the show continues or anything, in any way, so they're very separate things to me. So no, I just don't really engage," Ramsey said.</p><p>In the lead-up to Season 3, Ramsey said people can simply play the game if they want that story.</p><p>"I would say, you don't have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. You don't have to watch [Season 3]. If you do want to watch it, I hope you enjoy it," Ramsey explained.</p><p>The Last of Us TV series takes notable departures from the source material, and that was always the plan. Showrunner Craig Mazin said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-writer-expecting-furor-over-season-2/1100-6515962/" data-ref-id="1100-6515962">expecting "furor" from fans over Season 2</a>, and that is indeed how some fans reacted. Others enjoyed and embraced Season 2. "We don't operate to either make people happy on social media or avoid making them upset," Mazin said.</p><p>The Last of Us series veteran Neil Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-game-co-creator-neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-the-hit-hbo-series/1100-6532923/" data-ref-id="1100-6532923">not involved with Season 3</a>, as he is instead focusing on his efforts at Naughty Dog and directing the upcoming new game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><p>The Last of Us Season 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-tv-boss-reacts-to-neil-druckmann-leaving-and-reveals-season-3-release-window/1100-6533189/" data-ref-id="1100-6533189">will premiere in 2027</a>.
