            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is getting a major patch on 13th March, developers Warhorse have announced. It will enhance the bracingly mucky <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with modding tools and a "trove of updates", including what the devs ambiguously refer to as Barber Mode. Going by <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1897316277355757987">the promotional image</a> they've knocked together, this is just a selection of beards and haircuts for protagonist Henry. But it is not yet 13th March, so let us dare to dream. Let us imagine that the update will let Henry <em>become</em> a barber, cutting a swathe through the innumerable fringes of 15th century Bohemia.</p>
<p>I had not realised till writing this post how much I want to play a game in which you play a travelling barber, perhaps departing each day from my salon to groom the magnates of the realm. A game in which I, Quiff Sideburn, Texturizer At Law, must carefully organise different sizes of scissors in my roll-out velvet barbering kit. A game in which my choice of do has a bearing upon international politics. In which I mull my own beard oil from juniper berries and slaughtered moles. In which I can recruit three side characters and form a barbership quartet, then butcher them all because Quiff Sideburn is secretly Sweeney Todd.</p>
<p>A quick glance at Steam reveals that there is, very tentatively, such a thing as the "barber sim genre". There's the forthcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682260/Barber_Party/">Barber Party</a> from Second Wind, for example, which is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a> except that you're rounding necklines rather than plating the pasta. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206910/Bizarre_Barber/">Bizarre Barber</a> for the VR crowd, in which you are a hairdresser who's gotten their Diet Coke mixed up with the shampoo and is now hallucinating magic fish on a train platform. And there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2809250/The_Midnight_Barber/">The Midnight Barber</a>, a visual novel in which you coiffure werewolves, which is designed for ASMR but is also about a political revolution in Barcelona. The barber sim is a richly confusing genre. But alas, an underpopulated one. Mostly, that search term turns up games featuring BBQs, barbarians or women called Barbara.</p>
<p>Barbering would fit naturally into Deliverance 2. The game already lets you practice a range of medieval trades, from brewing to cooking to tanning and smithing. I'm pretty sure Henry's smithing skills would translate naturally to giving Hans Capon a Pompadour - though this would of course be anachronistic, because that particular style is from 18th century France. See, I'm already an expert on hair. Don't make me have carried out all this research for nothing, Warhorse. Don't let me down on 13th March.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/a-trailer-for-the-canceled-live-action-powerpuff-girls-1851768051<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I memory-holed the fact that CW was making an adult-oriented, live-action <em>Powerpuff Girls </em>show after the series was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tvline.com/news/live-action-powerpuff-girls-pilot-cancelled-the-cw-1234988763/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tvline.com/news/live-action-powerpuff-girls-pilot-cancelled-the-cw-1234988763/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">canceled before it was even released back in 2023</a></span>. I, like plenty of other millennials growing up in the ‘90s, have a lot of good memories of watching the Cartoon Network show following three superpowered sisters, and not only did I think CW’s pitch of a more “mature” version of these characters going through adult problems sounded like the basis of a YouTube parody, but I’d also wasted enough hours of my life watching CW’s DC Comics universe shows to know that this company’s version of melodramatic campy riffs on legacy characters only works half the time. Today, March 6, a trailer for the scrapped show has been published online, and <em>Powerpuff Girls</em> fans are both glad the show never saw the light of day and morbidly curious about what it could have been.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The trailer was posted by Lost Media Busters, a YouTube channel that posts videos from canceled, deleted, or otherwise not publicly available shows, movies, and video games. The one good thing I will say about it before we start dragging the three-and-a-half minute clip is that it sounds like CW got Tom Kenny (who most know as the voice of SpongeBob) to reprise his role as the narrator for the trailer. Either that or they got a really convincing soundalike. And that does it for the positive because, holy shit, this looks <em>terrible</em>.</p><p>It looks like <em>Powerpuff </em>(there’s no <em>Girls</em> in the title because they’re grown women now, of course), would have started the same way the original cartoon did, with <em>Scrubs </em>actor Donald Faison playing Professor Utonium as he accidentally created three superpowered girls who fought crime and were generally considered heroes to the city of Townsville. Their heroism led to a wave of popularity, including merch lines and even a cartoon riff on their exploits (the original show which, in a bit of meta-humor, live-action Buttercup says “completely whitewashed” the trio), and things were going well for the girls. That is, until something happens that turns the public against them. We see protests against the girls, and eventually the three of them do something that gets Townsville mayor Mojo killed, paving the way for his son Jojo to take over. (The pair’s names are clearly an homage to Mojo Jojo, a monkey with human intelligence who was one of the cartoon’s main villains.)</p><p>After this, the girls go their separate ways, and this is where the show goes from what looks like an okay YouTube parody video to a bad <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketch about the girls crashing out in their young adult years. Blossom runs away, Buttercup becomes a firefighter, and Bubbles becomes a burnout who drinks her nights away and tries to cash in on her lost fame. Eventually, the girls regroup in Townsville and Jojo hatches an evil scheme they must band together to stop.</p><p>But, my god, this whole thing is a hard watch. The three minutes of curated footage amounts to a series of unfunny jokes, awkward and stilted action, some of the worst green-screened flying you’ve ever seen, and a signature CW needle drop of the most popular song on the radio at the time, Dua Lipa’s “Levitating.” It oozes focus-tested flavorlessness with a slight pinch of edgy toilet humor so people know this time the Powerpuff Girls are Not For Kids. If you’ve got the stomach for it, check out the full trailer below.</p><p>CW’s campy shlock can sometimes work. <em>Riverdale </em>managed to take its self-seriousness and morph it into something enjoyable over several seasons. The company’s decade of DC Comics extended universe shows produced some real garbage, but <em>Legends of Tomorrow </em>was pretty exceptional before it was unceremoniously canceled in its seventh season. But I see no such spark here. Fans of the original show are mostly celebrating that the show was canceled before it had a chance to sully the <em>Powerpuff</em> name, though some admit they probably would have hate-watched it and others think the adaptation could have had potential.</p><p>Well, I’ll leave you with the one laugh I’ve had through looking at this all day. The top YouTube comment on the trailer right now comes from @SarilingMundo, who posted a slightly altered version of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KrBZrVQ7XU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KrBZrVQ7XU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original show’s episodic sign-off</a></span>: “And once again the day is saved, thanks to whoever decided to cancel this.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ahead of the game’s release on March 20, Ubisoft has released 20 minutes of new Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay.</p>



<p>The new gameplay shows both Naoe and Yasuka “infiltrating Nijo Palace, the castle complex (also known as a tenshu) in Kyoto, a major city in the larger region of Yamashiro.”</p>



<p>“Castles in Assassin’s Creed Shadows are strongholds, filled with hostile guards, valuable resources, and one precious loot chest,”  Ubisoft’s Youssef Garcia-Maguid wrote on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/?sf276574441=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog.</a> “Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.”</p>

<p>Garcia-Maguid added that Castles are “just one of the many activities” in the game that players can complete in order to increase their Knowledge Rank. Increasing your Knowledge Rank will let players learn higher-level abilities.</p>

            <p>If you were one of the many Eurogamer readers who lamented the fact that Sorry We're Closed didn't release on consoles as well as PC, well I'm pleased to say I have good news.</p>
<p>Developer à la mode games' eccentric story-driven survival horror game about demons, angels and what happens when both sides collide is now available across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>You can check out the console launch trailer below.</p>

<p>Along with its console debut, the Sorry We're Closed team has also added some new features to the game, including New Game+ and gyro controls for those playing on Switch or PlayStation.</p>
<p>Here are all the new features coming to Sorry We're Closed, which are available for both PC and consoles today:</p>
<ul>
<li>The demon world is now more accessible than ever with rebalanced combat areas, improved controller sensitivity, aim assist options and new difficulty modes.</li>
<li>Restart the adventure in New Game+ to keep your upgrades and collectables as you explore alternate story paths.</li>
<li>Race against the clock to improve your combat level scores in Time Attack mode.</li>
<li>Motion-controlled aiming, including gyroscope support on Nintendo Switch and motion sensor aiming on PlayStation, for even greater precision.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, that's not all. As well as a console release, the developer has also teamed up with publisher Serenity Forge to reveal a premium physical edition of Sorry We're Closed for both PS5 and Nintendo Switch, which is slated for later this year.</p>
<p>Along with a copy of the game, this edition will also include a holographic sticker sheet (featuring Mimi the rat!), a soundtrack download card of the OST, and a design booklet (including character profiles, art and insight of the game).</p>
<p>The digital game is retailing for $24.99 (I am double checking UK pricing) across platforms. You can find <a href="https://linktr.ee/sorrywe.reclosed">links to purchase Sorry We're Closed here</a>.</p>
<p>That aforementioned physical edition, meanwhile, <a href="https://store.serenityforge.com/products/sorry-we-re-closed-premium-edition">can be preordered here for $44.99</a>.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to be the best-looking console version of the game, as it will come with some exclusive features not available on the base console and on Xbox systems.</p>
<p>As confirmed today on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official PlayStation blog</a>, the next entry in the series by Ubisoft, launching later this month, will offer multiple display modes on both base PS5 and PS5 Pro, which will all target 4K resolution via upscaling. Interestingly enough, all display modes will support ray tracing in some capacity, although Performance Mode on the base console will only offer selective ray tracing, which enables ray-traced global illumination in the Hideout. On PlayStation 5 Pro, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will offer extended ray tracing features, which enable ray-traced global illumination for diffuse lighting and reflective surfaces throughout the game, in its Fidelity Mode targeting 30 FPS gameplay, and its Balanced Mode targeting 40 FPS.</p>
<p>Together with the new details on Assassin’s Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro display modes, Ubisoft also released 20 minutes of new gameplay footage showcasing Naoe and Yasuke infiltrating Nijo Palace. You can check out the new footage below.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game is setting out to be the most visually advanced entry in the series to date, as Ubisoft detailed last year during <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">Gamescom.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-ending-june</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-descendant-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-june.1127046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-ending-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Nexon has announced that it will end support for the game on last-gen consoles later this year.</p>

<p>In a developer livestream held earlier today (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Nexon revealed that the PS4 and Xbox One versions of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down on June 19th, which, as TheGamer points out, is two weeks before the first anniversary of the game's original release.</p>

<p>Nexon says that because the scale of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has "increased" since release, the team is spending "a lot of effort and difficulty" keeping the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game afloat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-giant-robot.jpg?itok=hBZyZa0n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-giant-robot.jpg?itok=T4MjXvUJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The First Descendant</em>'s PS4 and Xbox One versions are going away in June.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer goes on to say that since&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>'s upcoming third season is "a mega season update", the development team wants to focus on "increasing player satisfaction", hence the cessation of PS4 and Xbox One support.</p>

<p>Not only is the game being removed from Sony and Microsoft's last-gen platforms, but you won't be able to continue playing it on those platforms after June 19th, even if you have it downloaded on your system.</p>

<p>However, if you do plan to upgrade to a next-gen console, you'll be pleased to know that&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>supports cross-saves, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off if you play on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>launched to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extremely strong Steam player numbers</a> back in July, but the player count has significantly dwindled since then, with around 8,000 players checking out the game in the last 24 hours. That's not nothing, of course, but it's a far cry from the 264,860 players the game attracted at its peak.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has received a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-update-new-boss-descendants" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, with new bosses, characters, and other goodies being added to the looter-shooter. The latest update adds the valkyrie-esque Serena to the game's roster, as well as new areas, a new weapon, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-first-descendant/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-descendant/9p8fbxkmclwc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. If you're planning to play on consoles, though, I'd plump for the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S if I were you.</p>

The <a href="https://shop.magicx.team/products/magicx-zero-40">MagicX Zero 40</a> is yet another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253993/anbernics-game-boy-advance-sp-is-now-available-in-three-new-transparent-colors">handheld emulator</a> but with a peculiar design incorporating a four-inch vertically-oriented 800x480 touchscreen display allowing emulated DS titles to be played like they are on Nintendo’s devices.</p><p>The Zero 40 is expected to be released sometime in April 2025 for around $75, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/this-usd75-handheld-could-be-the-best-way-to-emulate-nintendo-ds-in-2025">according to <em>Time Extension</em></a>. MagicX isn’t as well known as companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">Anbernic</a> that have been making handhelds for years, but the company debuted its first Android-powered gaming device, the <a href="https://shop.magicx.team/products/magicx-mini-28">Mini Zero 28</a>, earlier this year, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXAziPF9YS0">favorable reviews</a>.</p><p>The company is taking a similar approach with the Zero 40 as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/25/5025828/nintendo-2ds-review">Nintendo did with its 2DS</a>, and not just when it comes to skipping 3D. Although all of the folding devices in the DS lineup featured two separate displays, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/08/nintendo_2ds_is_actually_made_with_just_one_screen">2DS used just a single panel</a> that was made to look like two separate screens by the handheld’s plastic casing. That’s likely part of the reason the Zero 40 could launch as comparatively cheap as the 2DS.</p><p>The Zero 40 will be powered by an Allwinner A133P processor paired with 2GB of RAM and a 4,300mAh battery that MagicX says will be good for between five and seven hours of gameplay. Like the Mini Zero 28, the Zero 40 will run Android, although don’t expect the latest version of Google’s mobile OS as the company’s last device shipped with Android 10 a month ago. It will rely on the Drastic emulator for DS titles, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091561/nintendo-lawsuit-fallout-yuzu">made free last March for Android devices</a>.</p><p>Aside from <a href="https://youtu.be/Z7GThb_iobU?feature=shared">MagicX recently sharing a video</a> demonstrating gameplay on the Zero 40, there haven’t been any hands-ons or reviews of the device, so its capabilities aren’t yet known. But the company says it should be able to emulate N64, PSP, and Dreamcast titles, in addition to DS games. It’s nowhere near as powerful as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23923136/ayaneo-flip-ds-kb-handheld-gaming-pc-nintendo-emulation">clamshell Ayaneo Flip</a>, but that DS alternative was priced close to $1,000. If it launches close to $75, the MagicX Zero 40 could fill a void with handheld emulators at a reasonable price.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before you dive in with a friend or loved one, though, here are four things you should know about the game.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Whether you’re playing couch-based or online co-op, you only need to purchase a single copy of <em>Split Fiction</em> for both players to enjoy the experience. If the two of you are both sat on a couch, you can obviously share a screen. However, if you’re a pair playing online, the game’s owner can use a Friend’s Pass to allow their friend to join in free of charge.</p><p>Even better, your Friend’s Pass works cross-platform! This means if you grab the game on PlayStation 5 and your friend has an Xbox Series X, you’re still golden. Same goes for PC! No matter where you like to play your games, <em>Split Fiction</em> is good to go.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Split Fiction</em> isn’t an extraordinarily challenging game, but its difficulty is no doubt a notch above developer Hazelight’s previous title, <em>It Takes Two</em>. There are a lot of segments during the game that require intense focus and quick thinking to overcome, as both players help one another bypass obstacles or defeat enemies.</p><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em>’s checkpoint system is quite generous, and failure rarely puts you back more than a minute’s worth of gameplay. With this in mind, be patient if you’re playing with friends or family who don’t have your killer gaming acumen. With a bit of trial and error, you’ll get past even the most frustrating hangups!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-recommend-id="image://584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-recommend-id="image://584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you venture through the sci-fi and fantasy lands thought up by main characters Mio and Zoe, you’ll also encounter quite a few side stories that can be explored.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ creative producer, Jonathan Dumont, has revealed new details about the Claws of Awaji DLC, stating it will feature a ‘spookier’ and ‘different’ vibe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of the release, Dumont shared information about the game’s post-launch content during an interview with <a href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-development-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>. The creative producer stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows Claws of Awaji DLC will act as a “continuation” of the adventure and story of their two protagonists. The DLC will feature a “different vibe, a bit spookier,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows features “a definite ending”, and the Claws of Awaji DLC’s events occur after the “core story of the main game”. This means players will have much to explore after completing the base game, as the DLC will introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10+ hours of additional gameplay</a>. Check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> for Claws of Awaji here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Dumont also discussed the bonus pre-order quest for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Thrown to the Dogs. The creative producer described it as “a simple yet heartfelt side quest,” similar to the side content we saw in AC Odyssey. The quest begins with a beaten-up stray dog at a grave, who takes the protagonists to his former house to uncover some “family secrets,” stated Dumont.&nbsp;</p>

The sequel to <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> follows the steps of its predecessor including a brand new protagonist and a large interconnected world! After the events of the first game, the Queen of Light must stop the destruction of the very existence by challenging the Supreme God Chaos while seeking the location of their old nemesis.</p><p><strong>A New Installment in the <em>Aeterna</em> Universe</strong></p><p>The unforeseen consequences after the ending of <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> broke the balance between Light and Darkness. The Queen of Light awakes alone in a changing world at the edge of the void. It’s up to her luminous majesty to find answers and stop the end of all things.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The <em>Aeterna</em> Universe continues to expand with the highly anticipated sequel to <em>Aeterna Noctis</em>. This time players will take on the role of the other monarch cursed by the will of the Supreme God Chaos., a protagonist featuring new abilities and bearing the responsibility of saving everything that has existed and will exist.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Genres > Action [2,535 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Adventure First and Foremost</strong> – You’ll explore new areas interconnected in a large world map full of secrets, secondary quests, and evils to defeat. As the Queen of Light, you must uncover the mysteries of a land never seen before in the franchise and gather allies to stop the imminent collapse of space and time. The variety of settings is enormous, as is an artistic direction that gives each area a unique personality.</li><li><strong>Fast-Paced Gameplay</strong> – Every action adventure title focused on combat and exploration needs a fast-paced combat system and tons of passive and offensive skills… Guess what, both requirements are featured in <em>Aeterna Lucis</em>. The formula already implemented in its predecessor is now fully upgraded including much more polished combat controls, brand-new abilities, and exclusive weapons for the Queen of Light.</li><li><strong>Level Design and Progress</strong> – The game features an intuitive level design for the players to enjoy precise movement controls and complete liberty to explore and discover alternative routes. This is an action adventure game, remember? As you become more skilled and the Queen of Light gets new abilities, <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> allows players to exploit the full potential of their character in confrontations against final bosses that promise a visual, sound, and playable spectacle.</li><li><strong>Unique Art Direction</strong> – Since <em>Aeterna Noctis</em>, the franchise’s universe has always been characterized by a coherent art design that makes all gameplay areas, enemies, and NPCs feel part of the same world. Using our trademark stained glass art and hand drawing, all the settings and graphic elements stand out for their meticulous attention to detail. The music, another of the pillars of the game, will allow you to enjoy from the most epic moments to the most relaxing ones with a sound quality on par with the great titles of the genre.</li><li><strong>Rich Storyline</strong> – The <em>Aeterna</em> Universe uses dialogues, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling that don’t interfere with the player’s progress and the general flow of the game. <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> is no exception and introduces a lot of new details about the franchise’s lore and the secrets behind the curse of the two monarchs.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span>Teaser and Gameplay Reveal Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Aeterna Lucis - Official Teaser &amp; Gameplay Reveal | The Sequel to Aeterna Noctis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDjIQ89JEGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.</p><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-948467-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4</a></video></p><p>Castles are just one of many activities in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> that you can complete to increase your Knowledge Rank, which gives you access to higher level abilities and upgrades. Completing them will also earn you experience and mastery points, which you can use to directly upgrade Naoe and Yasuke’s abilities. Additionally, Castles are full of resources that you can claim for your hideout. Smaller resource bundles can be picked up manually, while larger stockpiles can be tagged by Naoe and Yasuke to be picked up and delivered to your hideout by scouts at the changing of the seasons.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>■ Naoe <a title="Genres > Stealth [75 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4</a></video></p><p>Our walkthrough begins with Naoe’s stealthy approach at night. After dispatching a perimeter guard with her Hidden Blade, she quickly takes to the rooftops with the help of her grappling hook and begins to scout out nearby patrols. Unlike recent games in the series, in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, you won’t have the ability to call upon an avian ally to scout from the skies for you. Instead, you’ll hold L2 to use the Observe mechanic and focus Naoe or Yasuke’s vision on an enemy / objective / loot to tag it.</p><p>While scouting, Naoe spots a Samurai Daisho, an elite guard that will have to be eliminated to conquer the tenshu and claim its ultimate reward. With her tanto blade equipped, Naoe can double assassinate targets, but the Samurai Daisho’s ample health means she can’t take him out with one hit… yet. Shadows’ gear not only offers distinct stat bonuses but unique engravings that can change your strategy at any moment. In this case, Naoe swaps her headgear to a piece that gives bonus damage on air assassinations—enough to take out the Samurai Daisho in a single blow.</p><p>Further into the castle, Naoe calls for help from one of her recruited allies, Gennojo. He’s able to stun a pair of nearby enemies allowing Naoe to close the gap and take them both out. Gennojo is just one of several recruitable allies that can be called up in the open world for help (fun fact, each ally is summoned with a different bird call). Once those guards are taken out, Naoe uses Eagle Vision to scope out the interior of a nearby building.</p><p>Hostile enemies appear in red in eagle vision, while civilians will cast an orange silhouette. Be warned, however: just because civilians won’t attack you, that doesn’t mean they won’t raise the alarm if they spot you. Thankfully, Naoe is able to utilize a host of new stealth features to avoid detection. She starts by extinguishing a nearby lantern, cloaking herself in darkness. She then uses her grappling hook to pull herself up to the ceiling to avoid a patrol before dropping down and assassinating a second Samurai Daisho through a shoji door with her katana.</p><p><strong>■ Yasuke Stealth Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4</a></video></p><p>Now, let’s flip to Yasuke as he approaches the palace. Yasuke may be a one-man army in Shadows, but he’s still capable of sneaking around. Without a grappling hook, he uses a nearby low-hanging tree to take to the rooftops before pulling out his bow to silently take out a guard from range. Then, while crouching, he sneaks up on another guard and dispatches him with a brutal assassination with his long katana. It’s not as inconspicuous as a Hidden Blade, but hey, it gets the job done and doesn’t alert anyone else in the area.</p><p>Yasuke’s infiltration takes place during the daytime, so he doesn’t have the benefit of hiding in the shadows that Naoe did, but by sticking to the rooftops and using the geometry of the pitched roofs, he can stay hidden while crawling prone. Here, Yasuke calls upon another ally, Oni-Yuri, a poison specialist who can knock multiple enemies unconscious.</p><p>As he moves into the next courtyard, Yasuke spots a bell tower that can alert the entire tenshu to his presence should he be noticed, but with his bow (or Naoe’s shuriken or kunai), he can disarm the bell tower. Now, it’s time to go loud and make an entrance to take out the final Samurai Daisho. Yasuke starts by shooting a gunpowder barrel with his bow, taking out a nearby guard, before switching out his bow for a massive kanabo club. The hulking weapon’s blows overwhelm the Samurai Daisho, earning Yasuke another mastery point.</p><p><strong>■ Naoe Combat Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4</a></video></p><p>Swapping back to Naoe for a combat approach, we see just how skilled a fighter she can be. This begins by exchanging her stealth gear for a more combat-focused headgear and armor that allows her to vault enemies by sprinting at them and knock them down by sliding into them. Finally, her tanto is replaced with a legendary kusarigama that increases damage to enemies over three meters away. The kusarigama is Naoe’s long range melee weapon, great for crowd control and fighting multiple enemies at once. It also enables Naoe to rush assassinate her targets (rush assassinate is a passive ability that is possible whenever the kusarigama is one of Naoe’s two equipped weapons and does not cost adrenaline to use) by wrapping one end of the kusarigama around them and using it to fling herself forward for the killing blow.</p><p>Once Naoe gets to an elevated position, she realizes that a servant that spotted her earlier has returned with reinforcements. Rather than dealing with them herself, she calls her ally Yaya, a hulking brawler, to take care of them for her. With the reinforcements handled, Naoe is able to use the Observe mechanic to scout out Takahashi Shiro, a member of The Twisted Tree family she’s been tasked to assassinate. This time around, Naoe’s air assassination attempt only does partial damage, meaning she has a fight on her hands. Using a combination of smoke bombs and her kusarigama, she makes quick work of the weaker guards as she dances around Shiro, dismantling his armor before going in for the killing blow. With her target assassinated and the Samurai Daisho eliminated, Naoe is free to scale Nijo Tenshu and open the chest, earning a new legendary armor set for Yasuke. Her run ends with her scaling the tenshu for a synchronization point, using the Observe mechanic to scout our nearby points of interest.</p><p><strong>■ Yasuke Combat Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-5" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4?_=5"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4</a></video></p><p>We end the walkthrough with Yasuke’s bread and butter, combat. As with Naoe, it begins with a gear swap as the katana and kanabo are replaced with a naginata and teppo (a single-shot rifle). Yasuke’s last armor was ideal for stealth as it provided a 200% damage bonus to ranged weapons while out of combat. This approach, however, will be loud so he needs a new armor set and thanks to a unique engraving, the new set allows him to parry unblockable attacks (red glowing attacks that can usually only be dodged). The armor pairs especially well with the accompanying helmet which grants 50% damage to the attacker on parry. Not only can Yasuke parry any attack now, but he’ll reflect 50% of that damage back on the attacker.</p><p>It’s not often you can go in “guns blazing” in an <em><a title="Series > Assassin's Creed [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a></em> game, but that’s exactly what Yasuke does, smashing down the door before executing the closest guard with his teppo. With Yasuke’s size comes a certain boldness (he can take and dish out more damage than Naoe in a straight up fight) and he sprints straight through the courtyard to confront Takahashi Shiro. Wielding his naginata and parrying nearly every attack thrown at him, Yasuke quickly dispatches all the guards, and even takes out Shiro without too much difficulty. He may not be the climber that Naoe is, but Yasuke still ascends the tenshu to claim the prized chest and conquer Nijo Palace.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ two distinct heroes offer up dramatically different abilities, weapons, and playstyles, but Naoe and Yasuke are versatile enough to change up their approach, allowing you to sneak or fight on the fly. Smash through the front door or lurk in the shadows for yourself on March 20 when <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launches on PlayStation 5.</p><p><strong>■ <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d for PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></p><p>As the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game built solely for current generation hardware, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> can be played at up to 2160p and 60 frames per second on both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro in Performance mode.

The new architecture is paired with AMD’s second-generation AI accelerators that aim to improve functionality outside of gaming. If you're a streamer or like to record gameplay, AMD says the upgraded display engine offers enhancements for creators.</p><p>The RX 9070 Series features 16GB GDDR6 memory, which is said to offer a 20% performance boost over the older RX 7900 GRE. The RX 9070 XT bumps that to a 40% performance increase. Other highlights include FSR 4 for upscaling, a Software Manager that ensures your cards are always running the latest drivers, and pricing that starts at $549 for the RX 9070 and $600 for the RX 9070 XT.</p><p>Prices are a bit higher than that, however, as companies like ASUS, Gigabyte, and PowerColor are selling their models for around $700.

Throughout the level you'll be faced with the challenge of piranha-infested water, and some of these aren't as easy to cross as they first seem.</p><p>The girls can shapeshift throughout this level. While Mio is safe in her "otter" form--which, if you ask us, looks much more like a lizard, Zoe isn't as lucky. If Zoe enters the water as a human, fairy, or tree, she will quickly become piranha food.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958"></a><figcaption>Wall running can save Zoe from piranhas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png"></figure><p>Some of the safe methods forward aren't very obvious. During the first area of piranha waters there is a short platforming section until you end up stranded on a patch of grass. While Mio can swim through the water, she soon faces a roadblock where Zoe needs to give her some help to life a barrier. At this point, Zoe should wall run on the left-hand wall. Don't worry, we forgot wall running was a thing too.</p><p>If you're struggling to make the distance, try angling Zoe towards the middle of the wall, jump dashing to get as far along as possible, and then wall running before jump dashing to the next platform. From here, Zoe should shapeshift into the tree and use the areas on the wall to grapple from point to point until the next safe platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959"></a><figcaption>Use Zoe's tree form to grapple across water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg"></figure><p>After landing there, you'll see a large rock blocks the way. As the tree, Zoe can lift the rock to allow Mio to get through. Here, Mio should shift into the gorilla form to break the log. When she is in a safe space, Zoe should let go of the giant rock which will fly forward and break through the barrier.</p><p>After a short cutscene, the two need to forge forward once more. Complete the platforming section until you find yourself looking over a large ledge to a round pool of water. Zoe can turn into a fairy and fly across the water to the flower stream which will carry her across the water to safety. As her gorilla form, Mio should use the pink leaves to swing across to the water and then quickly shift into her otter form as she drops to the water. Here, she can safely swim through a gap in the rocks underwater.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960"></a><figcaption>Some sections require quick shapeshifting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg"></figure><p>The next piranha waters are shortly afterwards. Zoe will need to use the grapples on the left wall before quickly shifting into her fairy form to fly towards the flower streams that will carry her to safety. Mio can use the same grapples before turning into her otter form in midair and swimming to the next section.</p><p>After yet more platforming and a puzzle sequence, Zoe and Mio find more piranha-infested waters. Here, Mio will need to transport a large plant stalk that Zoe is clinging to in order to save her from the waters, as well as some new contenders: flesh-eating flowers. To begin, Zoe just needs to slide up and down the stalk to remain out of the flowers' reach.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961"></a><figcaption>Another important wall running section</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg"></figure><p>When they reach the platform, Zoe needs to go on to it and turn into her tree form. By grappling the flower bud on the wall, she can make the flowers on the wall retract, meaning that Mio is free to transport the stalk through to the next section, and Zoe can transform into her fairy form to quickly fly through and rejoin the stalk.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962"></a><figcaption>Not all stalks will float for long</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg"></figure><p>In the next area, Mio needs to drag the stalk close to the flowers on the right so that Zoe can grapple across them and attach to the second stalk that's already waiting there. This pole will quickly begin to sink in the water, so Mio needs to swim around and bring the first stalk with her for Zoe to attach to.</p><p>That's all of the piranha water sections in the Underlands and how to safely navigate them.

                <p>The Kickstarter for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/" data-ref-id="5000-620867">The Sinking City 2</a> has gone live, and Frogwares has shown off a sneak peek at the game with a deep dive into its current state of development. The studio says that it'll be using crowdfunding to help create a safety net for the developer, as well as use the funds to secure additional features for the game. Currently, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1741196058798550&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kZebdK01qp7eWnGCKfScR" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frogwares is aiming to secure $105,000 in funding</a>, and similar to its previous Kickstarter campaign for Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, it'll offer various rewards to backers if certain goals are met.</p><p><span>This new campaign is launching during a dangerous time for the studio and Ukraine, as three years on, Russia's invasion of the country is still ongoing. "After three years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy," Frogwares CEO Wael Amr said in a press release.</span></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0mNkrXHJc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jN0mNkrXHJc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we've decided to take the same route as before."</p><p>For The Sinking City 2, Frogwares says players can expect a "horror-first" approach, with the gameplay being built around pillars of combat and exploration. The game will feature a Lovecraftian influence once again, as players will venture into the decaying city of Arkham, scrounge for limited resources, and solve various cases inside of a morally grey world that features an expanded Cthulu mythos.</p><p>"We're not ditching our investigation roots entirely but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow," Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Oganesyan added. "We've placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional."</p><p>It has been a long road for the sequel to 2019's The Sinking City, as several years back, Frogwares was involved in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nacon-fires-back-at-the-sinking-city-dev-over-games-sale-on-steam/1100-6488264/">infamous dispute with publisher Nacon</a> regarding ownership over the game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sinking-city-2-goes-from-mystery-to-full-horror-in-reveal-trailer/1100-6521650/">The Sinking City 2 was officially unveiled in March 2024</a>, and while it doesn't have a concrete release date yet, it will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

These optimizations include a visual improvement to Human Torch's Lord Proficiency avatar reward and a new voice-enhancement setting for in-game chat. But arguably the best optimization is the addition of a new feature that allows players to report other players who ditch matches before they're over. As of the latest patch, players can now report bad sports via the in-game menu while still in a match, which is a definite win for players who are tired of witnessing un-hero-like behavior and poor sportsmanship.</p><p dir="ltr">The new update also squashes some hero-based bugs. Players who are hit by Human Torch's Flaming Meteor ability will no longer find themselves trapped inside of walls, and Loki's UI no longer disappears when he takes on the form of other heroes. An issue with Loki's Regeneration Domains working incorrectly has also been resolved, and his sister Hela will no longer be haphazardly launched into the air after triggering her Goddess of Death ultimate ability.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the aforementioned new limited-time in-game activity--the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure Event--the game's developers haven't shared too many details on what the event itself will consist of. What we do know is that players who complete the event will be able to earn Black Widow's "Mrs. Barnes" series costume rewards, free of charge. Devs also shared that the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure Event will begin on Friday, March 7 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET and end on Friday, April 11 at 1:59 AM PT / 4:59 AM ET. Players will likely need to complete a series of in-game challenges to unlock the cosmetic rewards, but given the lack of details in the patch notes, it's possible the event may consist of other activities as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The real star of the latest Marvel Rivals update is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-event-will-let-you-unleash-chaos-as-an-entire-team-of-cloned-heroes/1100-6529857/">new game mode called Clone Rumble</a>. Clone Rumble is exactly what it sounds like: A game mode that allows players to form a team consisting entirely of the same hero. It's looking like Clone Rumble is a limited-time mode, as NetEase included a Clone Rumble schedule in the patch notes. Clone Rumble mode will be available during the following dates and times:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 7 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET - Monday, March 10 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 14 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET - Monday, March 17 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Friday, March 21 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET - Monday, March 24 at 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET</li></ul><p>Keep scrolling for a detailed look at the version 20250307 patch notes (which are listed in full below) or check them out via <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow ">the official Marvel Rivals website</a>.</p><h2>Patch Notes</h2><h3>Optimizations</h3><p>1. Improved the Human Torch's Lord Proficiency avatar reward.</p><p>2. Added a voice enhancement setting for the microphone.</p><p>3. You can now report those who leave matches prematurely via the menu while still in a match.</p><h3>Fixes</h3><h4>All Platforms</h4><h4>General</h4><p>1. Fixed an issue where switching from a Proficiency Deluxe Avatar back to the standard Avatar required a re-login to take effect.</p><p>2. Resolved an issue where other players viewing a career profile would not immediately see the latest scores added after reaching maximum proficiency with a hero. A re-login was required for the changes to take effect.</p><p>3. Corrected the blocklist full notification, which mistakenly stated that the friends list was full.</p><h4>Maps and Modes</h4><p>1. Fixed several terrain issues that could cause characters to become stuck or clip into strange areas.</p><p>2. Resolved various problems with broken collisions, floating objects, etc.</p><p>3. Addressed multiple map sound effect issues.</p><h4>Heroes</h4><p>1. Loki's Disappearing Act: Fixed an issue where Loki's UI would vanish after he transformed. The God of Mischief can now keep his tricks visible!</p><p>2.

Their scrappy multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) was taking off, but a few hours south in Anaheim, Blizzard was preparing to launch </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starcraft II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a blockbuster PC strategy game that could eat up their audience and smother </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> before it had a chance to explode. It was an inflection point for the studio and game industry as a whole. Both companies were asking the same fundamental question: "what do players want from online games?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Things worked out fine for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. 16 years after launch, it's still logging millions of daily average players and driving millions in revenue for Riot Games, which has since spun up other titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teamfight Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valorant</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and is about to dive into the tag-team fighting game genre with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/">2XKO</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, the company—and the game industry as a whole—are asking that question again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot has changed in those 16 years. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/riot-games-100-million-gender-discrimination-settlement-granted-preliminary-approval">Riot Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-settles-california-discrimination-suit-for-54-million">Blizzard Entertainment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had to grow up. Both have settled lawsuits with the California Civil Rights Department over allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace, and both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-staff-to-solve-challenges-and-build-for-the-future-">have laid</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-microsoft-follows-activision-blizzard-merger-with-1-900-layoffs">workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the face of rising production costs and plateauing player spending.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players have aged, meaning many can't commit as much time or physical effort into mastering their favorite champions. Younger players, raised on a feast of survival crafting games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or social UGC games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, have different tastes. And as studio co-founder and chief product officer Marc Merrill pointed out to Game Developer in a conversation at DICE 2025, audience expectations for what are now called "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-the-heck-is-happening-with-live-service-games-">live service games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" are higher than ever, raising the stakes for projects that sometimes require hundreds of millions of dollars to get off the ground.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, how does the company move forward? Merrill said Riot is eyeing at the "social interactions" that are driving conversation about online games of late, but it's also sticking to its original strategy: converting players into people who say "I play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," instead of "I play video games."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="2XKO"><span>2XKO</span>'s social lobby will be key to its success</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike MOBAs or tactical first-person shooters, fighting games have survived and thrived since the arcade eras thanks to robust, often player-driven meetups where players cheer each other on (or throw around trash talk) in real life. Riot has a history of spinning up esports events, but Merrill acknowledged meeting this community where it lives will require a more different approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But a more interesting question was this: while Riot's publishing arms get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in front of players, how will the development team help players socialize online? The answer is in the game's pre-match lobby. As the company's revealed in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcement/whats-in-2xko-alpha-lab/">its closed alpha tests,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players spend time between matches not staring at a matchmaking screen, but navigating a digital arcade using customizable avatars.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-WiTEnvhilw?si=wsYrsv2KLgRnBlIV" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riot's not the first to roll out a feature like this. Capcom's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Street Fighter VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a similar lobby feature. But in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2XKO</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s case you can see the groundwork for what you might call a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-ification" of online spaces. Emotes, character skins, the ability to just run around in circles next to your friends (making it a space for players who might just want to relax and chat with pals instead of square up for matches).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players in the lobby can even walk over to other arcade cabinets to peer at games in progress—certainly a more engaging way to spectate other games without navigating menus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riot's been experimenting with its pre-game lobby design for several years, going so far as to update the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launcher to allow players to pre-select what roles they'd like to play before entering a lobby—a significant move that cemented the fixed roles players take on in League matches (top lane, mid lane, "jungler," etc.).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an effective menu, but it's also overwhelming for new or (speaking from recent personal experience) returning players. "You can dunk on it," Merrill said in reference to the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> main menu as we compared and contrasted the two systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A perhaps unfair ribbing of the menu screen experienced by most of Riot Games' customers' aside (that is carefully maintained and updated by hardworking developers, the compare-and-contrast allowed us to discuss Riot's top-level strategy for the "lifespan" of its online games—and how taking a wide a view as possible of that lifespan is essential to its continued market position.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Avoiding conventional &quot;industry logic&quot; about online games">Avoiding conventional "industry logic" about online games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Merrill laid out two ideas about the future of online games that he fundamentally disagrees with. First, he said it's "absurd" to think that young </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players are forever bound to the block-based game's ecosystem, "A lot of times the social motivations and [desire] to play where your friends are playing—those things are incredibly powerful," he said. "But that doesn't mean if somebody grew up in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that all they're gonna do for their life is played like block games or a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox-like</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">." Those players—like any other player—are on the hunt for experiences that resonate with them, those experiences may just take different forms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second idea, was that the only way for a company to view an online game's lifespan was through the lens of growth, peak, and inevitable decline. If you followed that logic, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be considered a failure since its monthly average user count </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://prioridata.com/data/league-of-legends/">is estimated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to have peaked in 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One thing we try to fight a lot is the mindset that the product life cycle is one of growth, a spike, and then a slow decline. That's also silly," he said. "There is entropy, there's downward pressure, it's hard to keep people engaged over a long period of time and continue to make it fresh. But that doesn't mean there aren't incredible things to do to improve the experience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those "things" might not just be updates to the content pipeline. Riot's triple-pronged strategy of esports, animated adaptations, and music productions are all part of the strategy to sustain </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> even though it may not be as popular as it was in the 2010s. "That would never have happened if we were like 'well, you know, we start to see churn rates increasing, time to go move all resources to something else,'" said Merrill.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Devs who want to follow this strategy but maybe don't have Riot's cash can still study its success. "Look at it from a motivational lens," he continued. "Why do people like this game in the first place? And then it's, are [you] doing a sufficient job of delivering to those expectations or not?" He pointed to Blizzard's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-blizzard-is-doing-to-make-sure-world-of-warcraft-never-gets-old">World of Warcraft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as another game executing on this strategy (without an animated Netflix show in sight...just don't ask about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803096/">a certain 2016 feature film</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elsewhere, Riot continued experimenting in a bid to minimize the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/riot-games-is-taking-cross-team-chat-out-of-league-of-legends-to-curb-toxicity">infamous toxicity</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that's become affiliated with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Merrill repeated the company's talking point that in-game harassment is far less prevalent than it may seem from the outside (but the few bad eggs going above and beyond to hurt people have a big impact, he acknowledged), but there are fascinating new frontiers to explore. Of late, he said Riot is studying how the dynamics of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> matches drive toxicity, sometimes driven by a misalignment between what different teammates want out of a match.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some [toxic] players feel justified on what they're doing and why," he said, laying out a use case where a player in the "ADC" role (a damage-focused role in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) might feel frustrated by a "support" player not keeping up with them or being repeatedly taken out by the enemy team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or there's the inverse—where a support player is playing passively and has an ADC teammate they can't keep up with. Across millions of games being played, some percentage of them will trigger that "emotional spike" for players, and they'll say a thing they might not say otherwise. He compared it to how even the most mild-mannered of people will get aggressive when caught in traffic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Identifying those mismatches is relatively easy. The solutions are tricky. He said Riot is examining if there are matchmaking solutions to help players looking for similar experiences, saying it's an "untapped frontier." But if Riot overcommits to that strategy, it risks taking away some of the friction of a competitive multiplayer game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If there's one takeaway for other developers from the multi-pronged approach Riot is taking to changing player demographics, it's that you don't have to look at the popular interest in emerging genres as a sign players aren't into your game. Times change, tastes change, and companies can risk falling behind the curve—but you don't have to look at tomorrow's players as an impossible enigma. Just like yesterday's, they're searching for great experiences, and there's good odds your game might just be what they're looking for.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

		<p>Frogwares has released the first proper gameplay for The Sinking City 2, alongside the launch of the game’s Kickstarter campaign. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/the-sinking-city-2-has-gone-full-on-horror-coming-out-in-2025/">The Sinking City 2 was announced</a> in March last year following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/02/the-sinking-city-publishing-rights-now-fully-controlled-by-frogwares/">Frogwares successful bid</a> at securing the publishing rights to The Sinking City. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">The Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> has a goal of $105,000, with the funds primarily being used as a safety net for the studio, as Frogwares is based in Ukraine.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sinking City 2 - Gameplay Reveal &amp; Kickstarter Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AtyEOb2IBZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we’ve learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.”</em> , said Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares.</p>
<p>In addition to the teaser, there is also a five minute deep dive into the game and the new direction of putting horror first, though The Sinking City 2 will also retain some of the investigative style of the first game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sinking City 2 - Developer Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jN0mNkrXHJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of The Sinking City 2 will see you in Arkham, a city that is falling under the waves that you can explore on foot and in a boat. There are mansions and abandoned hospitals that will hold all sorts of mysteries and dangers. There will be 1920s styled weapons available but resources will be scarce, and the inventory will be very limited so you will have to decide on what to keep hold of, and what to ditch. There will be plenty of mysteries to discover and solve, with many being morally grey so no choice will be too easy. The Sinking City 2 is due to release this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-brings-new-sub-biome-and-more-next-week.1126983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>Bags and Blasts update, which will bring a new sub-biome, a new boss, and more next week.</p>

<p>Bags and Blasts will serve as&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s first major update since the sandbox survival game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">launched out of Early Access back in August</a>. Its first major addition is the Oasis, a new sub-biome that you'll find within the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-desert-of-beginnings-biome-guide" rel="nofollow">Desert of Beginnings area</a>.</p>

<p>In the Oasis, you'll find the adorable camel-like Drohmble, which you can ranch to "uncover a valuable (but stinky) resource useful for crafting new mid-late game weaponry". That one's only for those with strong stomachs, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-desert.jpg?itok=m_xQ3L4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-desert.jpg?itok=5wj3e42f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll find&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s new Oasis area in the Desert of Beginnings.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just the Drohmble you'll have to look out for. Bags and Blasts will also introduce Nimruza, a giant "super cicada" boss who serves as one of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s "biggest fights yet", according to Pugstorm.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of using explosives in&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, you'll likely also appreciate the new Explosives skill tree, which comes complete with eight new skills for you to try out. New bomb types will also be added, as well as a new grenade weapon type.</p>

<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s Bags and Blasts update also introduces Pouches, a "highly-requested" community feature that allows you to carry various resources in dedicated spaces, making inventory management easier.</p>

<p>You can also take advantage of a new hotbar swapping feature that lets you decide which inventory row you see in your hotbar. All in all, it sounds like Bags and Blasts will be perfect for you if you like to tinker with your items for hours on end.</p>




<p><em>Core Keeper</em>'s Bags and Blasts update launches on March 10th. You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/core-keeper/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/core-keeper/9pkw4gmx4j8k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/core-keeper-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can read our Ashley's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/core-keeper-review" rel="nofollow">review of its 1.0 release here</a>.</p>

However, today’s arrival of the beast-stabbin’, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/being-authorised-to-hunt-in-monster-hunter-wilds-is-a-kink">consent-grantin’</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> on Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-streaming">GeForce Now streaming platform</a> does enable a sort of bodged alternative: a way to play Wilds on this most modest of handhelds, potentially at a sturdy 60fps.</p>
<p>GeForce Now extracts a not-insubstantial fee to enable streaming from its best rigs: the Performance (formerly Priority) subscription is £10 / $10 per month for RTX 3060- or RTX 2080-level performance, while the £20 / $20 Ultimate tier provides access to an RTX 4080 system. But it also syncs with your existing Steam library, so if you already own Wilds, you can stream it via GFN at no additional cost. I tried it on the Steam Deck using my Ultimate subscription, and was almost always bumping up against the 60fps cap, even after enabling ray tracing.</p>

<p>For comparison, running under the Steam Deck’s own... well, steam, you’d be lucky to average out a coughing 25fps at potato settings. There is a tiny dash of input lag when steaming, but I found it generally smooth and responsive enough to control as well.</p>
<p>As with any kind of cloud gaming setup, there are other caveats besides the sub costs. That responsivity is reliant on a fast and stable Wi-Fi connection – if you have patchy spots in your house, or sluggish Internet in general, you run the danger of higher latency and/or impaired visuals from the slowed-down video feed. It also means that taking your Steam Deck out and about, as it was designed for in the first place, will oblige your monsters to remain unhunted unless you can find (and trust) some decent Wi-Fi in the wilds.</p>
<p>As such, I wouldn’t call streaming a fix for Wilds’ dodgy Deck performance, though for sofa/toilet-based playing at home, it does make for a happier marriage of game and hardware than installing and running it locally. And the possibility at least exists – unlike with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-use-steam-remote-play-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Remote Play</a> – to keep going round a friends’ house or in a hotel room. Small victories, ‘suppose.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Back in October 2023, former Bullfrog chappie and Fable developer Dene Carter sidled up out of nowhere and released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonring">Moonring</a>, a terrific open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultima">Ultima</a> tradition of top-down, tile-based bump-attacking. It had crisp neon sprites floating on seas of arcade cabinet black, an enticing mythology, elusive magic systems, procedural dungeons and dialogue based on remembering or deducing keywords. All this for free - statistically my second favourite price tag after the developer actually paying me to play the game. Which does not happen as often as you might think, you tinfoil hat-wearing scalliwags.
</p>
<p>
Now, Moonring <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2373630/view/508447709615623279?l=english">has some DLC</a>. It's called Moonring DLX and consists of the Egg, a 100 floor megadungeon "with the vague promise of a silly boss and a prize". Yes, the dungeon looks like an egg. Unlike Moonring and like most eggs encountered in daily life, the Egg costs money - $4.99, €4.99 or £4.29.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you have that amount of change to hand, and you've sunk tens of hours into Moonring, you might consider buying the DLX edition just to say thank you. I can't think of a way to make that not sound like guilt-tripping, so here's a video of the game instead.

<p>
I myself am still scratching at the upper levels and opening sanctums of Moonring's eerie universe. I still haven't worked out how to cast magic, a carrot dangled early on that seemingly requires a fair amount of investigation and questing. The highlights, for me, are those procgen dungeons, which string together traps, spawns, chests, locks and hazards in mildly broken ways. I wouldn't say no to another 100 floors of such shenanigans.
</p>
<p>Even if you don't plump for the DLC, you might want to revisit Moonring. It's been updated a fair bit since October 2023. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373630/Moonring/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are plenty of funny and heartfelt moments for you and a friend to experience in this adventure. But if you’re wondering how many hours of cooperative fun there is to be had, we’ve got the answer for you. Here’s how long it takes to beat <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,196578,194088" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1689963"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to beat <em>Split Fiction</em>?</strong></h2><p>Seeing as <em>Split Fiction</em> is an entirely cooperative title, the time it takes you to see it through depends largely on the skill level of both players. However, the average playthrough of <em>Split Fiction</em> will take roughly <strong>12 hours</strong>. This would be simply pushing through the game’s main storyline with minimal distractions.</p><p>It’s worth noting, though, that the distractions are half the fun of <em>Split Fiction</em>! Fully completing the game and snagging every trophy or achievement will take some dedication, as you’ll need to be on the same page about finishing every side story and finding a variety of optional one-off moments throughout the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em> has a very generous chapter select that allows you to revisit past segments of the game and wrap up any side content you may have missed on your first pass through a level. This makes full completion much less stressful, leaving you to enjoy your initial play at a pace that feels right for you and your gaming partner.</p><p>If you’re a completionist looking to get the absolute most out of <em>Split Fiction</em>, you can expect to spend around <strong>15 hours</strong> experiencing its sci-fi and fantasy worlds. This includes stopping to check out all of the side stories and fun little interactions, or using the aforementioned chapter select to catch up on any of these you missed your first time through the game.</p><hr><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC. And remember: Only one person has to buy the game, as it features a Friend’s Pass that allows a second person to play for free. So you only have half the excuses for not jumping into this thrilling co-op adventure right away!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
