<p data-characters="213" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Closing out the Latin American Games Showcase was an impressive new trailer for the gorgeous pixel-art hack-and-slash Mariachi Legends, with a mixture of live-action scenes and high-fidelity side-scrolling action.</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">You’d be forgiven for overlooking the Latin American Games Showcase last weekend. Let’s face it, with over a dozen unique showcases over the span of a few days, it is unlikely most audiences will catch them all, particularly when the shows are each focused on a specific niche.</p> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Mariachi Legends - Official Trailer | Latin American Games Showcase" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCHux28VA3s?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">But this show in particular was littered with beautiful works and inventive concepts, a description no less fitting of the presentation’s final game, <em>Mariachi Legends</em> from Halberd Studios, which was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mariachi-legends-metroidvania-mexican-trailer-summer-game-fest/">unveiled</a> at last year’s PC Gaming Show.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">Opening to a hazy sunset, the trailer begins with a live-action sequence introducing the fictional town of Santa Mascota and the lead character, Detective Pablo Cruz, who has been assigned by Lady Death to delve into the Realm of the Dead and collect a mystical amulet that is compromising her rule over the underworld.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">This is no simple task, as the group of beings known as the Mariachi Legends protect this dominion at all costs. In order to stand a chance against them, Pablo must don the powerful garment, La Sombra, which grants him otherworldly strength and abilities.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">With a transition to gameplay, it makes an immediate impression with its smooth and fluid animations, such as Pablo brandishing his pen and notebook with a flourish when taking investigation notes and trotting around with a swagger that closely resembles <em>Castlevania</em>’s <a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/762a8ac61e339469f8e9a9cdabf57c25/tumblr_or39wwPi5M1so2951o4_250.gif">Soma Cruz</a>.<br>Although these two protagonists may share a last name and running animation, ironically what they do not have in common is being part of the Metroidvania genre.</p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Unlike the studio’s previous work, <em>9 Years of Shadow</em>, which was a full-fledged metroidvania, Mariachi Legends describes itself as a branching beat-em-up platformer, with bounding, swinging, and dashing along platforms to navigate the game’s levels and an emphasis on extravagant combo-centric combat.</p> <figure data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">Pablo dual-wields a set of sabers and a pair of flintlock pistols, firing off point-blank barrages before effortlessly eviscerating his enemies in a spinning cyclone of carnage. He has a variety of special abilities as well, including a noxious face-cracker whip that melts flesh from the bone and morphing into a spectral skull enveloped in a sickly green flame to consume enemies whole.</p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">The end of the trailer blends more live-acton cuts with gameplay, this time to the kitchen to demonstrate the cooking component to the game. Pablo can spice up his special abilities by dishing up recipes he learns along his journey.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="false"><em>Mariachi Legends</em> will be available for Switch and Steam, with a 2024 release window listed on the store page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-fans-are-review-bombing-the-wrong-acolyte/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=star-wars-fans-are-review-bombing-the-wrong-acolyte<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="183" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A little over a week after the release of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-is-reviving-one-of-legends-best-lightsabers/">first two episodes of <em>Star Wars’</em> <em>The Acolyte</em></a>, an attempt at negatively review-bombing the new series on Rotten Tomatoes has begun. </p> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">Seeing anything <em>Star Wars</em>-related requiring more than one second after its release to gather an avalanche of negative reactions nowadays is already pretty surprising, but this story gets even better. It turns out that the review bombing campaign pretty much ignored the actual <em>Star Wars</em> <em>Acolyte</em> TV series, and accidentally ended up hitting other works whose creators were unlucky enough to name after the word “<em>Acolyte</em>“.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">The biggest victim is a 2008 Thriller called <em>Acolytes</em>, which is now sitting at 35% Audience Score after a barrage of negative <em>SW</em>-related ramblings.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="848" data-injectable="true">To be entirely honest, I’m yet to watch <em>Acolytes</em>, the movie, not the similarly-titled <em>SW</em> series, but I’m pretty sure that its only link with <em>Star Wars</em> is Joel Edgerton. I know he plays Owen Lars in one, and a serial killer in the other one — <em>Star Wars Episode III:</em> <em>Revenge Of The Sith,</em> I presume. I’m not sure, though. I have a hard time remembering what happened in the prequels because of all the damage I sustained from watching the prequels. Still, I’m leaving the trailer for <em>Acolytes</em> below to let you decide, anyway.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Official Trailer - ACOLYTES (2008, Joel Edgerton, Jon Hewitt)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViBLacRvmZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">And <em>Acolytes</em> wasn’t the only victim, as <em>The Acolyte</em>, a <em>Star Wars</em> fan film also saw a suspicious surge in the 1-star review department that completely destroyed its IMDb rating.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via <a href="https://x.com/Jay12678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Koos on Twitter</a></figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">This is completely unnecessary because it’s just mean, but also because fan movies don’t fare really well in the ratings department, anyway. I believe that the best thing we can do to help restore the balance is to post the whole <em>The Acolyte</em> fan movie below:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="The Acolyte | Star Wars Fan Film | Red Komodo" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tp6hLP1Ry0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Sound off in the comments to let me know if it’s any good!</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">You can now watch the first three episodes of <em>The Acolyte</em> — the real one, on <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-pt/series/the-acolyte/39RAA0bOYXQ0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney +</a>, and you can watch the unrelated and very hated <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/acolytes/umc.cmc.6v5sa4a6udo5ush5qz5tppbkx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Acolytes on </em>Apple TV</a>, if that’s your thing.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/preview-pax-dei-a-grand-experiment/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=preview-pax-dei-a-grand-experiment</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-pax-dei-%E2%80%93-a-grand-experiment.902826/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/preview-pax-dei-a-grand-experiment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=preview-pax-dei-a-grand-experiment<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="278" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Pax Dei</em> was announced in March 2023 and officially enters early access on Steam on June 18, 2024. Ahead of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pax-dei-release-date-editions-and-early-access-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Founder’s Packs going live</a> and players flooding the servers, developer Mainframe Industries invited me to take a look at the game and get a sense of its vision. </p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Calling <em>Pax Dei</em> an MMO would be underselling it. Once players load into the game, they’re able to choose their server, which is a chunk of the 400 square kilometer space available at launch. Each server or shard is a place where players can work together to build a settlement, but not in the traditional way you might think. </p> <figure data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mainframe Industries</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-pax-dei-is-redefining-the-sandbox-mmo" data-injectable="false">How Pax Dei is redefining the sandbox MMO</h2> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Mainframe Industries CEO Thor Gunnarsson explained how the game works based on its closed alpha tests. In those, content creators were given access and sets of codes to send to their communities. This drew in thousands of players, each forming a community on a server where they set about building a town, village, or city and creating the infrastructure that they needed. </p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true">For example, an architect was usually appointed to design the buildings. This is a pretty intense job because every single item in the construction menu is modular and can be tweaked to fit your needs. I was shown a guild hall with a goat head looking off into the distance and a colossal castle built into a mountain. A community with a vision can achieve anything in <em>Pax Dei</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">However, to build, you need resources. This isn’t like <em>Minecraft,</em> where you can go into creative mode and grab what you need. Instead, players have to organize themselves into groups. Some will collect wood, others stone, and more still will raid dungeons in the dangerous Wilderness area where they can get gold and other rare materials. </p> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">A settlement comes together over time as long as everyone in the community helps out. It reminds me of medieval England, or at least the way it’s often painted in books like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-read-the-kingsbridge-series-in-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of the Earth</a></em>. Everyone has a role in a community because they want to help build something bigger. Peasants work farms and get food, hunters get meat for the tavern and skins for the tanners, miners get the precious building blocks for every home, and so on. </p>
 <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">While being a wood or stone cutter might not sound like the most enthralling online experience, it’s the fact that you’re helping build something that should get you excited. On day one, you might be the only miner, but three years later, you could have a mining company that coordinates stone for trebuchets for the war effort. You never know where your journey will take you, and you’re always able to swap for something else. I quite fancy being a traveling merchant myself, selling gossip on the side to nobles who have the coin to pay for it. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mainframe Industries</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-pax-dei-s-grand-experiment" data-injectable="false">Pax Dei’s grand experiment</h2> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">From the start, Gunnarsson calls <em>Pax Dei</em> “a grand experiment,” which sounds like the perfect description. When it’s released in early access, the game won’t be feature-complete because the developer wants to build it with the community that invests in and lives in its world. New features will be added based on a rough roadmap but also the desires of the community and the direction they take the game in. </p>
 <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">If, for example, players delve more into PvP and create an economy from the loot around it, then that system will likely get updated before more building mechanics or PvE quests come to the game. In a way, players are free to choose where they want to push the game most because Mainframe Industries is eagerly watching, wanting to enable more dynamic, community-driven gameplay that can exist without constant supervision. </p>
 <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">As a parent, this reminds me of setting out groups of toys as stations at which your kids can play. Much like <em>Pax Dei</em>‘s players, some kids will sit at a station and play before moving to another one, while others will bring chaos to the system and mix up the toys with a wider game. It’s all playing, fun, and creating an engaging world for those involved, but everyone is free to choose how they want to play with the tools available to them. </p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">But this world isn’t all peace and prosperity. The Heartlands, areas where players build their settlements, are safe zones without combat. You can spend all your time in these areas if you don’t want to engage in combat, PvE, or PvP and have no interest in dungeons. </p> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true">Leaving the Heartlands will see you enter the Wilderness, areas where PvP is allowed and there are NPC enemies to engage with. This is how you’ll gather meat from animals and loot from dungeons. In one alpha, players even collectively created a zone in the center of the map that was free-for-all PvP where you could test your builds and see how many players you could kill before dying. </p>
 <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Keeping all this optional is actually more realistic than you might think. Throughout history, there were, of course, bandits and thugs on the road, but people stuck to their roles for the most part. This even applied to nobles and knights, meaning we’ll likely see in<em> Pax Dei</em> that PvP-focused players emerge to protect communities and do nothing else, offering their services so the rest of the group can go about their business safely. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Pax Dei | Early Access Announcement" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9kbu7qtYR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-the-eve-of-pax-dei" data-injectable="false">The EVE of Pax Dei</h2> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">If all this sounds a lot like <em>EVE Online</em>, that’s intentional. Gunnarsson and some of the other developers at Mainframe Industries worked on that game for many years and admire the emergent storytelling it plays host to. At one point, it was impossible to talk about games and not mention <em>EVE Online</em>‘s incredible tales of corporate espionage. Mainframe Industries is hoping for something similar for <em>Pax Dei</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">While corporate takeovers are probably a long way off, <em>Pax Dei</em>‘s world is ripe for creative storytelling that occurs organically. You might venture into a dungeon and encounter a group of raiders from a neighboring settlement that you manage to kill and steal from. The next thing you know, there could be a bounty on your head, or you could equip better and better gear until you effectively own a dungeon, charging a fee for anyone who wants to attempt to loot it. </p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Gunnarsson gave me a great example of how something similar happened in one of the game’s alphas. A glitch gave players the ability to build walls along paths, so naturally, each server set up checkpoints to charge travelers for passing through each section of the map. Gatehouses and entry fees were thought to evolve in the game’s society over time, but this proved that players could and would do anything with the right tools when given half a chance. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mainframe Industries</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-a-moment-in-time" data-injectable="false">A moment in time</h2> <p data-characters="609" data-current-count="909" data-injectable="true">To conclude my time speaking with Mainframe Industries, I was taken on a walkthrough of a server that had been preserved from its alpha state. The game will eventually feature regular server wipes, but this settlement has been saved for now as an example of the ingenuity shown by players in such a short space of time. A single architect, who happened to also be a professional architect, had designed the settlement and was effectively sucking up all the resources players brought them from around the world to put each structure together in a coherent way that would make for a nice flow through the area. </p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">There were furnished houses, a fancy hall, a guild hall, and several smaller structures that might be used for storage or the various industries a settlement needs to thrive. As the sun went down, lights lit up the distance. In <em>Pax Dei</em>, you can see across servers, meaning every light in the distance is a real player’s building plot or structure placed somewhere on the colossal world map. </p> <p data-characters="706" data-current-count="1103" data-injectable="true">Seeing this made me feel so incredibly tiny. Your character can spend hours chopping wood, but it’ll never be enough to create the grand projects seen in similar games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bellwright-is-a-promising-start-for-a-settlement-builder-in-which-you-enact-a-rebellion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bellwright</a></em> or <em>Valheim</em>. You are insignificant by yourself, but together with others, you form a whole that actually stands a chance of making an impact. You won’t lose your precious city upon death because the overarching goal you share as a small community doesn’t live or die on your shoulders alone. As long as you’re motivated to keep building, others will join you, and you’ll make something admirable, threatening, or awe-inspiring together, depending on how your intentions as a community evolve. </p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">While there are no firm details planned at the time of writing, war is definitely something that’s on Mainframe Industries’ mind. Pax Dei is a game built for petty feuds to transform into continent-spanning conquests. It’s just a matter of time before players get upset enough when someone destroys their settlement. </p>

<p>In a recent super-sized survey conducted by Capcom, a whopping 254,148 people gave their feedback on the company, the line-up of titles under the Capcom banner, and the future of the brand. The ‘Capcom Super Elections’ was a global undertaking, with people from a staggering 220 countries voting on various questions and propositions. </p>



<p>One key question was written to ask Capcom fans worldwide what series they’d ‘like to see get a sequel or new game’, and Dino Crisis won by almost 20,000 votes. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-us-back">Take us Back</h2>



<p>Shinji Mikami’s Dino Crisis hasn’t been seen since 2003 when the third (and currently final) core game in the series was released. Since then, it has remained one of the most-requested titles when it comes to remakes and remasters. In the Capcom Super Elections survey, fans were asked what series they wanted to see get a sequel, and Dino Crisis landed the winning spot with 80,769 votes.</p>



<p>In second place came Mega Man with 63,395 votes, then Devil May Cry with 60,371 votes.</p>



<p>One question asked users which Capcom games they liked the best, and in second place sat Dino Crisis, coming in closely behind Devil May Cry 5 and just ahead of Resident Evil 4. Despite not being seen for more than twenty years, Dino Crisis still holds a firm place in the hearts of gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the survey, it was revealed that DMC’s Dante is the all-time favourite character of Capcom fans everywhere, while 156,870 people said they seek ‘exhilarating gameplay’ when picking up a Capcom title.</p>

<p data-characters="365" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Video game adaptations have a&nbsp;harder&nbsp;job than most TV shows. While they come with an audience built in, game-inspired series have to do more than&nbsp;simply&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;fans of the original medium. They’ve got to attract longtime fans and lorehounds, all while simultaneously telling a story that can be understood by the uninitiated.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">While the task is difficult, it isn’t impossible. The <em>Fallout</em> TV show has shown itself to be a perfect example in this regard, earning praise from critics, <em>Fallout</em> fans, and general viewers alike. But what is it about the show that accomplishes what so many adaptions can’t? The secret sauce lies within a few of its classic narrative techniques, cleverly working in faithful nods to its source while creating a world for the general audience.</p>
 <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="112" data-injectable="false"><em>Note — major spoilers ahead. Don’t read further unless you’ve finished all of Fallout season one. </em></p> <h2 id="h-fallout-stars-a-fish-out-of-water-protagonist" data-injectable="false"><em>Fallout</em> stars a Fish Out of Water protagonist</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Lucy is a fantastic character but also an archetype you may have seen before. She is a vault dweller, one who has been lied to her entire life and has never seen the outside world. As such, she’s positive, chipper, and very, incredibly, ridiculously naive. By using a protagonist who lacks real-world knowledge, the writers get to do two things.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="719" data-current-count="1019" data-injectable="true">First, for those who aren’t fans of the IP, this gives viewers a way to learn about the world without&nbsp;it&nbsp;feeling like it coddles or&nbsp;like it’s&nbsp;an info dump.&nbsp;In the first episode, viewers&nbsp;are introduced&nbsp;to the idea of vaults,&nbsp;get to&nbsp;see how they work as a ‘utopian’ society, and witness how naive the character is as the brutality of the outside world comes calling. All of this is done with sick action sequences, entertaining comedy, and interesting visuals that show the ridiculous aesthetic of the vaults. None of this feels belabored or spoon-fed, as the knowledge is doled out as part of a character-driven narrative, giving new viewers a great way to learn without even knowing it.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">For fans of the <em>Fallout</em> games, the fish out of water protagonist provides a much different form of entertainment. <em>Fallout</em> focuses on dark comedy as a core component of its draw, and by giving fans a naive, happy-go-lucky protagonist, there’s some fun to have at Lucy’s expense. By knowing what’s to come, Lucy’s peppy persona is only that much funnier. She’s about to fall victim to the apocalyptic RPG’s hellish wasteland; it’s a joke we’re all in on. </p>
 <h3 id="h-old-information-builds-on-new-lore-in-the-fallout-universe" data-injectable="false">Old information builds on new lore in the Fallout universe</h3> <p data-characters="705" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">When trying to get a new audience into something like <em>Fallout</em>, a ton of work and screen time has to go into introducing new fans to the <em>Fallout</em> universe. We see this in Walter Goggins’ past storyline, dropping viewers into the world of 2077’s United States&nbsp;and introducing them to the retro aesthetics of the period, the political upheaval of the time,&nbsp;and Vault-Tec and its rampant growth. These are the things people need to know to understand <em>Fallout</em>, those things that players experience in the games time and time again. Still, how do you keep this interesting to old fans who have heard and witnessed this basic information a million times&nbsp;over&nbsp;in their playthroughs?</p>
 <p data-characters="625" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><em>Fallout</em> manages this by wrapping&nbsp;deeper&nbsp;lore implications and new characters within this core framework. Every single person who plays the game knows Vault Boy. He’s iconic, the image players see time and time again, from the tutorials to selecting perks to the bobbleheads waiting to be found around the map. Hell, he probably shows up when players close their eyes after gaming for 10 straight hours. The unknown history of the creation and development of Vault Boy gives writers room to play, allowing them to write a storyline that offers a much deeper look at one of the core images associated with the series.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="973" data-current-count="1273" data-injectable="true">The iconic&nbsp;jumpsuit&nbsp;and the creation of the thumbs-up&nbsp;pose are core to fans’ visual memory of the game, and further history only adds interest. And while Walter Goggins’ rise and fall from the position of Vault Boy gives fans enjoyment through new lore, there’s more to it than that. Goggins’ story allows the writers to portray the all-consuming nature of the <em>Fallout</em> companies, willing to throw to the wayside those that no longer serve their purposes, giving players an unexpected tether to the plot. In many ways, Goggins’ Ghoul is probably the character long time players will resonate with most. Having spent over 200 years surviving in the wilderness, about the same amount of time the average <em>Fallout</em> player has spent playing every game in the series, players will feel some kinship to his badassery. By tying him in to both past and future storylines, players can always have a character to sympathize and experience the plot with.</p>
 <h3 id="h-callbacks-vs-revelations" data-injectable="false">Callbacks vs revelations</h3> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">One of the more difficult problems to overcome in a series like this is the use of&nbsp;major&nbsp;plot points that are revelations to new&nbsp;viewers&nbsp;but expected outcomes to long-time fans. Players know how the past storyline is going to end. It’s kind of the whole point of <em>Fallout</em>: everything starts with the nuclear fallout. The buildup to Goggins’ realization of the true nature of the vaults,&nbsp;with most of them being experiments imposed on the residents by the CEOs of huge companies, is cool but nothing new to those who have played the games.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="609" data-current-count="909" data-injectable="true">At times like these, writers can appeal to these fans by giving them a good old ego boost. As viewers listen to the company heads describe the horrible experiments they wish to enact on people in each&nbsp;Vault, longtime fans get to feel smart, recognizing the Vaults that the CEOs are talking about. Many of these Vaults even appear in games, mostly in <em>Fallout 3, 4</em>, and <em>76</em>, meaning players will have more than likely blasted their way through them at some point. While new fans are interested in the reveal, longtime fans are rewarded for their IP knowledge and&nbsp;are given&nbsp;validation for knowing their lore.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="false">In the end, everything comes down to double meanings. The writers understand that their time is limited and that you have to be working with both audiences at all times. Luckily, gamers are nothing if not lore junkies, and the writers understood that, leaving enough goodies to keep players happy, even in those moments when outcomes are expected. It’s a difficult game to play, but the writers of <em>Fallout</em> did so with aplomb. Hopefully, we can see other video game adaptations follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p data-characters="476" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited’s</em> second set, <strong>Shadows of the Galaxy</strong>, takes players to the underbelly of worlds filled with smugglers, bounty hunters, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-acolyte-can-star-wars-fans-expect-any-big-cameos/">those who take matters into their own hands</a>. Shadows of the Galaxy brings many fan-favorite characters into the mix from series such as The Mandalorian, The Bad Batch, and The Book of Boba Fett. Players will be able to start buying and cracking open booster boxes or packs on<strong> July 12, 2024</strong>, when the set is released worldwide.</p> <h2 id="h-the-new-mechanics-of-shadows-of-the-galaxy" data-injectable="false">The new mechanics of Shadows of the Galaxy</h2> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">This set is filled with galactic criminals so it’s only appropriate that new mechanics are introduced to fit the theme. Three new mechanics are being added with Shadows of the Galaxy that will certainly spice up the meta. Units can be <strong>Captured</strong>, guarded, and rescued by other units, <strong>Bounties</strong> can be applied to units and claimed by opponents, and characters can <strong>Smuggle</strong> resources into play. </p> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Lucasfilm Ltd.</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-bounty" data-injectable="false">Bounty</h3> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">The Bounty mechanic adds various effects to units that trigger whenever the unit is defeated. Bounties can be attached to units via upgrade cards or can be found as an inherent ability with some units. Many bounty hunter characters gain bonuses when attacking units that actively have a bounty, making this a powerful mechanic to play around with.</p> <h3 id="h-capture-guard-rescue" data-injectable="false">Capture/Guard/Rescue</h3> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true">Three mechanics in one, capturing goes hand-in-hand with the new Bounty system in <em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em>. Using certain abilities or action cards, units can be captured and guarded by another unit. When the guard unit is defeated, the captured unit is Rescued or set free. Various actions allow rescuing units without needing to defeat the guard units. </p>
 <h3 id="h-smuggle" data-injectable="false">Smuggle</h3> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Cards with Smuggle can be used as a resource and then played for their Smuggle cost later on. This allows high-cost cards to be put to use generating resources early on while still being able to be played later in the game once players can afford them. While it’s a simple mechanic on the surface, many synergies and triggers work with Smuggle to make it a competitive theme to build around. </p> <h2 id="h-the-best-cards-of-shadows-of-the-galaxy" data-injectable="false">The best cards of Shadows of the Galaxy</h2> <h3 id="h-10-razor-crest-reliable-gunship" data-injectable="false">10. Razor Crest – Reliable Gunship</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>The new Mandalorian units of Shadows of the Galaxy have many bonuses that activate when attaching upgrades to them. Since the Razor Crest can return discarded upgrades to your hand, it’ll certainly become a staple card in Mandalorian or Upgrade-heavy decks. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-9-wrecker-boom" data-injectable="false">9. Wrecker – BOOM!</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Overwhelm is a powerful keyword on its own, especially on units with high power such as Wrecker. 5 damage from a low-cost ability is super valuable and can help create board advantage against some of the more bulky units in the game. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-8-unexpected-escape" data-injectable="false">8. Unexpected Escape</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>With the new Capture mechanic, this card will be a necessary inclusion in any deck. Even if it only rescued the captured unit, it would be worth it. However, being able to exhaust the guarding unit adds tremendous value for a 1-cost card. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-7-ruthlessness" data-injectable="false">7. Ruthlessness</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Base damage is how you win a <em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em> game. Within Spark of the Rebellion, Sabine Wren and decks revolving around base damage have dominated the competitive scene. Ruthlessness will find its home in these top-performing decks and extend its viability into future sets. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-6-maul-shadow-collective-visionary" data-injectable="false">6. Maul – Shadow Collective Visionary</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Maul is loaded with aggressive and defensive abilities alike. Ambush and Overwhelm with 7 power make him a threat that can close out games on his own. His ability to redirect damage to other friendly Underworld units makes him one of the hardest-to-kill units in the TCG. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-5-crosshair-following-orders" data-injectable="false">5. Crosshair – Following Orders</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Shadows of the Galaxy brings additional methods of boosting unit power to the game. With three different unit traits, experience counters, upgrades, and his inherent action, Crosshair’s power can easily be increased. His exhaust action can quickly become a unit-deleter, and his 6 HP gives him a fair bit of staying power.</p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-4-choose-sides" data-injectable="false">4. Choose Sides</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Swapping control of units has the potential to be the most broken ability in any TCG. Besides simply swapping a weak unit for a stronger one, players can trade units with bounties to their opponent so that they can claim the bounties for themselves. This card is one to revisit with every new set release, as the potential is limitless. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-3-ma-klounkee" data-injectable="false">3. Ma Klounkee</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Bounce effects are one of the strongest mechanics in any TCG. Ma Klounkee not only enables the bouncing of Underworld units but has a built-in burn. For 1-cost, having two effects of any kind is extremely valuable. This card effectively duplicates the effects of Underworld units that have triggers when entering play. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-2-dryden-vos-offering-no-escape" data-injectable="false">2. Dryden Vos – Offering No Escape</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>With 7 HP and the Shielded keyword, Dryden Vos is tough to kill. Although his stats aren’t too impressive for a 7-cost unit, his ability that allows him to take control of a captured card for free can drastically change the board state. Along with other cards with similar effects, such as Choose Sides, stealing your opponent’s cards can become a viable strategy. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-1-jango-fett-renowned-bounty-hunter" data-injectable="false">1. Jango Fett – Renowned Bounty Hunter</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Jango is one of the best units to take advantage of the new Bounty system. Within a deck filled with Bounty upgrades, Jango will have a high uptime for his +3/+0 Overwhelm ability. His card draw effect rounds out his kit and allows him to create both a card and board advantage for players. </p><figure></figure></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/productive-citybuilding-at-the-end-of-the-world/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>You play a “citybuilder” game, the city stays built, no? That’s been the tacit agreement since at least…what, 1989? Fires, meteor strikes, alien spider mechs all notwithstanding, you did the work, and so the work (mostly) stands, for as long as you would like it to at least. That’s remained the case even in our current age of climate anxiety, where “dystopian” has become the citybuilder’s prevailing aesthetic mode. There’s <em>Frostpunk</em>, set in the last surviving city during a new ice age, and <em>Endzone: A World Apart</em>, where electricity was so scarce as to verge on magical, but both nevertheless play out as exercises in accretion. The eponymous <em>Airborne Kingdom</em> decamped the earth’s surface altogether—and yet even it had a floating foundation you could just keep on adding buildings to, in defiance of both Icarian precept and the laws of aerodynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Only with <em>Against the Storm</em>, which officially released late last year to great acclaim, has one of these games truly invoked the power of an apocalyptic setting to unmake its players’ creations. In doing so, it also activated a latent, dark potential of the citybuilder genre. What, after all, does the destructive cycle of climate change represent, if not more and more opportunities to build back better?</p><p><em>Against the Storm</em> is a <em>roguelike </em>citybuilder, you see. Roguelikes are defined by, if nothing else, their purgatorial gameplay loops, where the player is regularly forced to relinquish much of their gained ground in favor of starting over. In this case, that ground includes everything built on top of it. Think of high tide vis-a-vis sandcastles, and you’ll get the gist. For a citybuilder, this sounds almost definitionally counterproductive, but <em>Against the Storm’s</em> popularity — with<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/4115799931699652974?ref=remapradio.com"><u> 1 million-plus sales on Steam</u></a> and the coveted “Overwhelmingly Positive” aggregate rating — shows that players aren’t troubled much by these losses. After all, a self-sustaining settlement is only a minor goal, here. Indeed, whether the player achieves one or not, <em>Against the Storm</em> invites them to move right on to another level, guiding the eye away from short term stability of the built environment and towards loftier measures of success. You may take this, as I initially did, to mean someday putting a stop to the climate apocalypse. But <em>Against the Storm</em> pitches a different vision for success. “Ask yourself,” it seems to be saying. “How can you make the storms work <em>for you</em>?”</p><p>That's “storms” plural: in <em>Against the Storm</em>, the “Storm” operates on more than one valence. The most obvious one would no doubt be the “Blightstorm,” the cataclysmic affair that arrives every 40 years or so, engulfs the world, and marks the end of the game’s roguelike calendar. When the Blightstorm arrives, your villagers must abandon their outskirt settlements and ride it out in the Smouldering City, a volcano that functions as a keep that’s safe in the storm’s eye. As a “Viceroy,” it’s the player’s job to begin resettling the surrounding wilds anew once the storm passes, searching for ancient seals that will purportedly help put a stop to this cycle of destruction. You have until the next Blightstorm to reach one, after which the process repeats.&nbsp;</p><p>This state of affairs seems, at least initially, to be unreservedly dire.</p><p>The player, though, ends up contending much more directly with smaller, seasonal storm varieties, such as “Drizzle,” “Clearance,” and, well, “Storm,” that rapidly cycle through as they work directly on their settlements. Raincoats are the fashion staple of the humans (along with the humanoid beavers, foxes, lizards and harpies of your villages, who scurry about foraging, mining, crafting, and collecting precipitation to power their “rainpunk” machines. Drizzle is the planting season, and also when upgrades and blueprints for new buildings get doled out. The harvest season, Clearance, is fêted on arrival with gentle musical notes and god rays. During Storm season things get a bit dicier, with heavier downpours and litany of negative effects. Regardless of the season, the rain never stops, nor does the work. In this sense, there is <em>one </em>storm, and though its character is ever shifting, it remains perpetual. The challenge is then about adaptability and perseverance.</p><figure></figure><p>The Storm as the looming void on the horizon, the end of history, and also just an ever-present thing that you have to cope with? That, at least, is certainly evocative of the perpetual dissonance of life with climate change, where we simultaneously get <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/01/22/new-climate-projections-heat-rain-sea-level/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>“more frequent severe rain events,” and also “unknown drought risk</u></a>,” with deadly summers and pleasantly mild winters. It was a broad trend corresponding with rising global averages, until suddenly it was radio and TV hosts asking scientists if a specific storm was due to climate change, to which the scientists started replying: kinda? The idea of eco-anxiety is simultaneously a non-pathological response and also <em>treatable</em>. In modern parlance<em> —</em> the “new normal.”</p><p>Conventional wisdom holds that capital, in prizing steady, reliable growth, must surely detest entropy of this sort. An especially Pollyanna-ish supply-sider might even still try arguing that this is why free market solutions for climate change are on their way…well, any day now. This is where you, the Viceroy in <em>Against the Storm,</em> are situated, sans irony. While your nominal role is putting a stop to the Blightstorm, in practice, it seems to mostly involve trading goods and amassing wealth. Now, in one sense I think, <em>OK fine,</em> <em>fair enough</em>. If a ping pong video game was actually about achieving world peace, I'd probably expect to find out that the global order hinged on my paddle skills all along. Maybe I could suspend my disbelief in the restorative power of trickle-down economics. So I daisy-chain successful settlements together, supply to demand, demand to supply, until I’ve done enough to put an ancient seal within reach, and amassed sufficient goods to appease Neptune, or the ghost of Ronald Reagan, or whoever. (For whatever it's worth, <em>Against the Storm</em> <em>did not</em> appear in Steam's recent "Capitalism and Economy Fest” sale, for which the header art featured flying bills and Scrooge McDuck-level stacks of gold coins).&nbsp;</p><p>But in another sense, how “against” the storm is the Viceroy, really? This is more than a matter of the game’s bumper sticker-ready slogan of a title. (As a New Jerseyan, “Against the Storm'' immediately puts me in mind of “Stronger than the Storm,” the cringey ad campaign the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/feds-investigating-christies-sandy-relief-funds/story?id=21511567&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>Christie administration appropriated $25 million</u></a> in federal Hurricane Sandy relief funding for.) They seem to have a pretty good thing going, since the demands of the storm mean they’re continually being furnished with new workers and claims just waiting to be staked. The stormwater itself is essentially liquid gold (some of it literally golden): with a few simple upgrades and for the small cost of a little ambient toxicity, it can be used to supercharge the output of almost any production line. And the Blightstorm’s cyclical resets ensure that the player, as the Viceroy from without, is always working with a clean canvas, unburdened by most of the fussier responsibilities of urban planning like maintenance, rezoning, or retrofitting. They’re positioned, in fact, like private equity, leveraging their settlements towards future gains and banking dividends in the form of upgrades and decorations for their in-game house — whether or not the roguelike venture succeeds or ends up liquidated.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>One can <em>laissez-faire les bon temps rouler</em> in this fashion for quite a while, it turns out. After a few cycles and with a dozen or so settlements under my belt, I finished my first Bronze Ancient Seal only to find, after Blightstorming the map clean again, another Bronze Ancient Seal floating out in the forest. I completed a “Lead” Seal instead, which yielded: more Bronze and Lead Seals. (As I would eventually learn, at least six other types of seal lurked further out in the wilderness). I decided to stop what I was doing, and dug up a thread on the game’s subreddit asking if there was an ending in the works. In it, one responding user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Against_the_Storm/comments/18rao2z/is_there_an_eventual_ending_in_the_works/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>suggested</u></a>:&nbsp;</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p><em>Aside from the gameplay of the climb, the idea of locking all of the seals was big for me, because if you think about the nature of the cycle, and what it means for that world, it's incredible.</em>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
</p><p><em>The cycle starts off at 40 years, and it's been like that for centuries. The storm itself lasts for an indeterminate amount of time, but when it's done entire biomes have changed, so you know it ain't a week or two. It drowns the whole world in blight.</em>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
</p><p><em>How many kids are born during the storm and don't live to see the end of it? How many elderly go into the storm knowing they'll never see the other side of it? All of these villagers risking their lives have families back in the citadel. They are desperately trying to scratch out a living on the frontiers hoping to stockpile enough food to let the citadel survive.</em>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
</p><p><em>But by the end, the cycle is over a century. People have a chance at having real lives. You're not able to save the whole world. The storm still comes. The blight still kills. But you make the whole world a better place, regardless.</em>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p>It’s a pretty stirring interpretation, but one that <em>Against the Storm</em> doesn’t put any of its own resources towards. The more honest answer, I think, is one the same user later appended, seemingly as an afterthought: “You got a whole as (sic) Prestige climb to finish, and then the Queen's Hand challenge. That's the actual end game. YMMV on how satisfying you consider that ending.”&nbsp;</p><p>So there you go. The challenge adds a run-based mode with perma-death and dash more narrative flavor, but it offers a feather in the cap, not closure. Small wonder then, all told, I started to find that the Blightstorm just wasn’t weighing especially heavy on my conscience. It is, after all, just a brief spiraling effect seen from above, followed swiftly by placidity. Whatever ostensible loss of life has just occurred, according to the game’s lore, it’s more like a toilet flush than an act of God. Hell, you can even trigger it whenever you want with the push of a button if you want to re-roll the overworld map. The storm leaves no visible devastation after it recedes, either. The hexes representing individual forest biomes are not razed, but reshuffled. There would be no sign of a storm having ever visited save the fact that the half-dozen tokens representing your settlements are gone. (As a bit of in-game text describes, they strike camp before the worst sets in.)</p><figure><figcaption><span>Satellite infrared image of Hurricane Sandy. Credit: NOAA</span></figcaption></figure><p>What it does do is provide the citybuilder with a perpetually replenishing supply of empty acreage for development. This brought to mind Naomi Klein’s book <em>The Shock Doctrine</em>, specifically its introductory chapter, which happens to be titled “Blank is Beautiful: Three Decades of Erasing and Remaking the World.” Klein describes a phenomenon whereby disasters (be they natural or manmade) often create fertile ground for cynical profiteering. Agents of free-market capitalism, applying the military principle of “Shock and Awe” to overwhelm and cow their foes with bombastic displays of power, seize upon these crises to sweep in, making audacious land grabs and foisting privatization on the still-reeling victims. Such vultures, Klein writes, “are convinced that only a great rupture — a flood, a war, a terrorist attack — can generate the kind of vast, clean canvases they crave.” (For my money, the Christie administration’s <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2017/07/christie_pictured_at_island_beach_state_park_durin.html?ref=remapradio.com#incart_2box_nj-homepage-featured"><u>Beachgate</u></a> scandal remains the most ludicrously individualized version of this in microcosm.)&nbsp;</p><p>With each press of the storm button, I thought increasingly about <em>The Shock Doctrine</em>. I began to feel, acutely, like I was tinkering with some mail-order Junior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Milton Friedman</u></a> starter kit, practicing how to pave paradise and fill it with microbreweries. I was acquiring monopoly money and a taste for the ephemera of late capitalism—an endless array of proximal goals, drip-fed unlockables, and superficial rewards. I thought about the government official Klein quotes who said, in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, "In a cruel twist of fate, nature has presented Sri Lanka with a unique opportunity, and out of great tragedy will come a world class tourism destination,” presaging the forced relocation of coastal fisherman and the granting of their former land to corporate entities for resort construction. Or Jared Kushner, who, as I was writing this, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/19/jared-kushner-gaza-waterfront-property-israel-negev?ref=remapradio.com"><u>suggesting that Israel forcibly relocate the people of Gaza to the Negev desert</u></a>, noting that “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable.” (Netanyahu’s Likud, for its part, released <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2024/05/benjamin-netanyahu-unveils-regional-plan-free-trade-zone-rail-service-neom/?ref=remapradio.com#google_vignette"><u>a master plan for “Gaza 2035,</u></a>” a “Gaza-Arish-Sderot Free Trade Zone,” complete with AI art that can only be read as a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-world-if?ref=remapradio.com"><u>The World If</u></a>… meme but for the elimination of Palestinians.)</p><p>This is a pretty malign thing to charge a video game about cartoon lizards and beavers with, even in metaphor, I know. Hardly any entry in the adjacent 4X genre (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) would stand up to even the most half-assed humanitarian audit. But for most of these games, problematic genre conventions are lamentable things to mitigate or filter out through layers of abstraction. The <em>Civilization </em>series eventually, and somewhat ham-handedly, created a “cultural victory” condition to subvert its original focus on conquest. (Granted: one of the ways you could achieve it was by looting other civilizations’ historical artifacts, but there were at least diplomatic repercussions for doing so.) With <em>Civilization 6</em>’s&nbsp; <em>Gathering Storm</em> expansion, it also made natural disasters and rising sea levels the consequences of rampant industrialization, and the board game <em>Settlers of Catan</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/22/1245096795/catan-board-game-climate-change-pollution?ref=remapradio.com"><u>looks to emulate that feature</u></a> later this year. Of the citybuilders, <em>Frostpunk</em> made a commendable effort to individualize its citizens and graphically illustrate the sacrifices the player was asking of them. But <em>Against the Storm</em>, as a work of appropriation both figuratively and literally, has no better angels.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Frostpunk's approach to city-building</span></figcaption></figure><p>The game is, in many ways, a doppelganger of <em>Frostpunk</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/markpopham/status/1186995263807864832?lang=en&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>the Wolf to its Klein, if you will</u></a>), cribbing liberally from the former's mechanics and conventions with little regard for the context they once operated within. <em>Frostpunk’s</em> iced-over settlements radiated out from their central generators, the foci about which all survival efforts hinged. <em>Against the Storm</em> imports these generators (here called Hearths), and deems that several buildings — especially residences&nbsp; — must be built within the orb of their warmth. Does the storm bring cold, too? It’s not entirely clear. Most production buildings aren’t subject to this heating requirement, nor is the settlement oriented around it. In fact, the Viceroy’s mandate is apparently to impose a grid-based system on the lands they claim, because <em>Against the Storm’s</em> settlements are uniformly rectilinear. And in keeping with imperial Roman form, they’re delineated by roads, which can be finished — perplexingly, considering all the rain — with copper (if I were a Viceroy, I would simply not further reduce the pervious surface area). The Fighting Pits in <em>Frostpunk</em> go from a somewhat weighty decision about how much violence you want to introduce to your fragile community to generic “Clan Houses” in <em>Against the Storm</em>, which flatly satisfy the Lizards’ need for brawling.&nbsp;</p><p>Uprooting these concepts from the context of their creation leaves them as empty signifiers, and in an attempt to fill them with meaning once again, <em>Against the Storm</em> turns <em>towards </em>the genre’s inherent colonialism and its ability to project ideology. Ushering it in behind the Blightstorm only compounds its potency—because historically, colonial expansion has always “uncannily syncopated the rhythms of natural disaster,” as historian Mike Davis observed in <em>Late Victorian Holocausts</em>. “If the southern African drought of 1877, for example, was Carnarvon’s opportunity to strike against Zulu independence, then the Ethiopian famine of 1889-91 was Crispi’s mandate to build a new Roman Empire in the Horn of Africa. Likewise Wilhelmine Germany exploited the floods and drought that devasted Shandong in the 1890s to aggressively expand its sphere of influence in North China.” These were the shock doctrine’s early adopters, and they provide the template for much of what the player gets up to in <em>Against the Storm</em>. The result is a work of colonial revanchism, with climate disaster providing the cover to reestablish beachheads for old hierarchies.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177873/sports-video-games-fanfiction-challengers-topspin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="AulgJT">I finally saw <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127886/challengers-review-zendaya-luca-guadagnino"><em>Challengers</em></a> this week. It immediately entered my personal echelon of the great modern <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23041486/best-sports-movies-good-watch-netflix-football-basketball-racing-fighting-boxing-mma">sports movies</a> (as well as a gripping, thorny romantic drama). The movie does a terrific job of using the <a href="https://www.mollybrooks.com/gals/comics/060_sports/index.php">existing powerful narrative structures and character archetypes in sports</a> to create a compelling story — the washed-up prospect, the fading star, the phenom who never got her seemingly fated shot at glory. </p>
<p id="lOkL8o">And as is my way, I purchased the relatively new tennis game <em>TopSpin 2K25</em> immediately after, returning to my roots as a (very bad) tennis player in my youth. In a surprising turn of events, the way I played <em>TopSpin </em>right after seeing <em>Challengers</em> sort of felt like writing fanfiction — and I realized that, without recognizing it, I’d been engaging with fanfiction in my own way for years.</p>
<p id="yPxkWG">In the character creator, I decided to make my tennis player one of the three central characters in the movie. Forget the boys — <em>Challengers</em>’<em> </em>most compelling star is Zendaya’s Tashi Duncan, a former teenage phenom whose knee blew up during a college match, ending her promising professional career before it started. But what if I could rewrite that narrative? What if her knee injury wasn’t quite so catastrophic, and she had another chance?</p>

<p id="u3kKi1">In my version of Tashi Duncan’s career, her knee injury still happens, but a full recovery is possible. My save file starts, in my head, at the beginning of that process, as she enters the tour lowly ranked, regaining her confidence and control over her body as I learn how to play this game. I gave her some kinesiology tape on her right knee<strong> </strong>and otherwise tried my best to style Tashi like she appears in the movie (I have limited apparel options this early in my career).</p>

<p id="cr7vAt">I’m in the early days of my career and having a great time. After a disappointing blowout loss in my first match (as Tashi got used to using her knee again and I got used to <em>TopSpin</em>’s controls and play patterns), I bounced back with an upset victory in the first round of my next tournament. Next up: an opportunity for revenge against the player who beat me in that first match.</p>
<p id="nL44Gm">I’ve never considered myself someone into fanfiction — I never begrudged anyone who was, I just never understood the appeal. But it all finally clicked while playing as my Tashi Duncan in <em>TopSpin</em>: Sports video games are often just their own form of fanfiction.</p>
<p id="vCl3aL">Once I came to that realization, my whole history with sports games clicked together. I’ve played so many of them this way. In Football Manager, I always set out with a specific goal, because the game has no natural win condition — maybe it’s to make Norway the premier soccer nation in the world, or to get tiny Boston United promoted to the Premier League. In <em>NCAA Football 14</em>, I created an alternate universe where North Texas was a national powerhouse. In the Out of the Park Baseball and Baseball Mogul franchises, which allow you to start a save file at any point in baseball history, my go-to save files are (1) eliminating baseball’s color barrier from the beginning and playing out careers with Negro League legends like Josh Gibson and Cool Papa Bell and (2) picking up in 1989 with my beloved Dodgers and seeing if I can avoid their awful slump in the ’90s, when I was a kid attending those games.</p>

<p id="r1t7a1">One of NBA 2K’s most exciting new features in the past decade has been the addition of its Eras mode, which allows you to replay the NBA’s most significant historical periods. Want to see what would have happened if Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were teammates, not rivals? You can make that happen. Want to see Michael Jordan play his whole career with the Wizards and not just the bitter end? Go for it!</p>
<p id="waG2fy">Even how I played these games as a kid fits into this new understanding of these games for me. Instead of my approach now, where I try to come up with a unique narrative or storyline to pursue, I would simply create self-inserts of myself in these games. Maybe I’m a star quarterback in Madden, or a 7-foot-tall center in NBA Live, or a baseball player that could actually hit a baseball — you know, fantasies. (Apologies to my former teammates on the Blair Blazers JV baseball team.) I was adding myself to my favorite stories… It just so happens that those stories aren’t purely fiction.</p>
<p id="BYawQ6">In turn, this changes my relationship with real sports — I have extra affinity for athletes who were crucial in my save files, and it’s especially fun to watch the real-life development of young players who I saw grow in the fast-paced world of sports video games, where you can speed into the future.</p>
<p id="UTBTM6">Sports games don’t have the prescribed narratives many other games do. Instead, you create them as you play. Like fanfiction, these games allow you to daydream about how things could be different from real life, or from a fictional story you are drawn to. I can’t actually participate in the professional sports leagues I follow in real life, but at home, I can create and enjoy new narratives adjacent to these worlds, and ones that I am a part of. And I would be lying if I said I haven’t hosted fake press conferences about my team where I am both interviewer and interviewee.</p>
<p id="GDqG5n">Anyways, back to my save file. Will Tashi Duncan (fingers crossed) eventually take home her own career Grand Slam, instead of having to live vicariously through the career of her clearly-no-longer-into-this husband? Can she reclaim her spot on top of the tennis world? I’m going to find out, and I can’t wait. </p>

<p>Since revealing the upcoming Indiana Jones game – ‘Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’, the team at MachineGames has been hard at work on the project, which is shaping up to be a passionate recreation of one of the most legendary film franchises ever made. In a recent article published <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/14/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the Xbox Wire</a>, the team revealed the depth of research that went into producing an authentic representation of Indy in this highly anticipated game.</p>



<p>Amongst other things, the team at MachineGames got to check out unseen Indiana Jones footage from ‘the Lucasfilm archives’, checking out content that very few people in history have seen.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-doing-it-right">Doing it Right</h2>



<p>Indiana Jones is one of those franchises that can’t be recreated lightly. To that end, the folks at MachineGames have been poring over as much source material as possible, including having lengthy discussions with the writers responsible for creating the original Indiana Jones movies all those years ago. The squad also got access to exclusive unseen footage that never made it to air:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We managed to get access into some of the Lucasfilm archives as well, which for Indy fans has been an absolute dream come true, to get access to some of these things that perhaps not so many people have seen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>MachineGames has also made the painstaking effort of recreating Indy’s iconic outfits and has plugged into the soundtrack with Grammy Award-winning artist Gordy Haab, who has collaborated with Lucasfilm Games for years.</p>



<p>Presently, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn’t have a release date, but it’s expected to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S in 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Rivers of London</em> series, by Ben Aaronovitch, was one of the first long fiction series I indulged in when I was younger, and it made me feel like magic was as real as physics. If you’re ready to embark on your journey, then you’ll need to know the proper reading order.</p> <h2 id="h-reading-orders-of-rivers-of-london" data-injectable="false">Reading orders of Rivers of London</h2> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/WHibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The <em>Rivers of London</em> series</a> consists of novels, novellas, a short story collection, and graphic novels. The novels tell the main story, with the novellas providing context and world-building. The graphic novels and short story collections provide extra stories and hijinx into the world.</p> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">The graphic novels and short story collection don’t really add too much to the main storyline, although they add color and context to the world and its characters, as well as being great reads in their own right. You could always read all of the mainline novels and novellas and then visit the graphic novels after if you wish, to satiate your Rivers of London cravings until more installments are published.</p>
 <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Note that the <a href="https://geni.us/WHibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Rivers of London</em> series</a> is not finished. More of everything is planned, including a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). </p> <h3 id="h-mainline-rivers-of-london-publication-reading-order" data-injectable="false">Mainline Rivers of London publication reading order</h3> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Excluding the graphic novels but including the novels, novellas, and short story collection, this reading order goes over the main story of <em>Rivers of London</em>, with the novellas adding context and appropriate world-building. </p> <figure data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Destructoid, Ben Aaronovitch</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">As far as the main entries are concerned, the publication is the chronological order of events, aside from certain novellas. This means there are minimal benefits to messing around the with the reading order, and no one has come forward with a unique reading order for us to consider.</p> <p data-characters="135" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">This is the reading order I’m currently following, and is the most straightforward way to take in the wonderfully confusing plot:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="15" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><strong>Rivers of London</strong> (called Midnight Riot in the US)</li> <li data-index="1"><strong>Moon over Soho</strong></li> <li data-index="2"><strong>Whispers Underground</strong></li> <li data-index="3"><strong>Broken Homes</strong></li> <li data-index="4"><strong>Foxglove Summer</strong></li> <li data-index="5"><strong>The Hanging Tree</strong></li> <li data-index="6"><strong>The Furthest Station</strong> (novella)</li> <li data-index="7"><strong>Lies Sleeping</strong></li> <li data-index="8"><strong>The October Man </strong>(novella)</li> <li data-index="9"><strong>False Value</strong></li> <li data-index="10"><strong>Tales from the Folly</strong> (short story collection)</li> <li data-index="11"><strong>What Abigail Did That Summer</strong> (novella)</li> <li data-index="12"><strong>Amongst Our Weapons</strong></li> <li data-index="13"><strong>Winter’s Gifts</strong> (novella)</li> <li data-index="14"><strong>The Masquerades of Spring</strong> (coming September 2024)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">Reading the novellas alongside the novels in publication order is simpler, even if <em>What Abigail Did That Summer</em> is a little out of synchronization. But if you really want to enjoy <em>Rivers of London</em> in timeline order, alongside all the graphic novels, then read on.</p> <figure data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Destructoid, Ben Aaronovitch</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-full-rivers-of-london-and-graphic-novels-chronological-order" data-injectable="false">Full Rivers of London and graphic novels chronological order</h3> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">The following reading order is the ultimate reading guide for <em>Rivers of London</em> in timeline order. Reading the story in this way isn’t really recommended, and after I’ll tell you how I’d recommend you enjoy the chronological reading order of <em>Rivers of London</em>.</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">The short story collection for <em>Rivers of London</em>, <em>Tales from the Folly</em>, is dissected among this list, so its various stories are placed alongside the other titles in chronological order.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="38" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1520" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><strong>Action At A Distance</strong> (graphic novel)</li> <li data-index="1"><strong>Nightingale: London 1966</strong> (Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="2"><strong>Dedicated Follower of Fashion</strong> (Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="3"><strong>Rivers of London</strong> (called Midnight Riot in the US)</li> <li data-index="4"><strong>The Home Crowd Advantage</strong> (Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="5"><strong>Tobias Winter </strong>(Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="6"><strong>Moon over Soho</strong></li> <li data-index="7"><strong>The Domestic </strong>(Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="8"><strong>Whispers Underground</strong></li> <li data-index="9" data-injectable="true"><strong>The Cockpit </strong>(Tales from the Folly)</li>

 <p data-characters="67" data-current-count="67" data-injectable="false">There we have it! All 37 entries into the <a href="https://geni.us/WHibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Rivers of London series</a>. </p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Although it may make sense to start reading it in chronological order right away, I would hold off doing that immediately. I’d strongly recommend you read <em>Rivers of London</em> first. This will introduce the characters and themes and preserve the mystery and the unknown that really pedals the enjoyment of that entry.</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">After reading <em>Rivers of London</em>, you can then go back and read all the entries in chronological order if that’s how you’ll enjoy the series. You can read as many of the mainline stories until you decide you’re comfortable to start reading all the graphic novels and the short story collection to expand the world even further.</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">With this knowledge at hand, I’d suggest you pick an order you’re comfortable with and get reading. Because once you start to get wrapped up in the Rivers of London world, there’ll be no stopping you.</p>

<p data-characters="231" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Throne of Glass</em> fantasy novel series by Sarah J. Maas concluded in 2018, although there’s no time like the present to join the infamous assassin Celaena Sardothien in her tragic and fantastical story in Erelia and beyond.</p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">There are a few ways in which to read the <a href="https://geni.us/UDE8zoa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Throne of Glass</em> series</a>, some being more convoluted than others. I’d suggest having a thorough inspection of the following recommended reading orders before you commit because once you start reading, you won’t be able to stop to reconsider.</p> <div data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false"><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-every-way-to-read-the-throne-of-glass-series" data-level="2">Every way to read the Throne of Glass series</a><ul><li><a href="#h-publication-order" data-level="3">Publication order</a></li><li><a href="#h-chronological-order" data-level="3">Chronological order</a></li><li><a href="#h-emotional-explosion-order" data-level="3">Emotional explosion order</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-tandem-variation" data-level="3">The tandem variation</a></li></ul></li></ul></div> <h2 id="h-every-way-to-read-the-throne-of-glass-series" data-injectable="false">Every way to read the Throne of Glass series</h2> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">I have scoured the internet for four different variations – suggested by the <em>Throne of Glass</em> publication and by fans. So have a peruse and choose your favorite.</p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">Note that <em>The Assassin’s Blade</em> is a series of four novellas and is a sequel to the original entry, “The <em>Throne of Glass</em>.” This prequel is what many of the reading orders hinge on – Celaena Sardothien’s origins. Although you’ll see this entry jump around in order a lot, it is important that you do not read it after <em>Queen of Shadows</em>. </p> <h3 id="h-publication-order" data-injectable="false">Publication order</h3> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">The most standard order to read the <em>Throne of Glass</em> series is in the order in which they were published. This is the recommended reading experience from Sarah J. Maas and her publication:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Throne of Glass (2012)</li> <li>Crown of Midnight (2013)</li> <li>The Assassin’s Blade (2014)</li> <li>Heir of Fire (2014)</li> <li>Queen of Shadows (2015)</li> <li>Empire of Storms (2016)</li> <li>Tower of Dawn (2017)</li> <li>Kingdom of Ash (2018)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true"><em>The Assassin’s Blade</em>, the sequel story, was written after the second book, <em>Crown of Midnight</em>, and unveils Sardothien’s tragic past, something mostly concealed. Unveiling this after getting to know her and her struggles for the first two books makes this an excellent point in which to read <em>The Assassin’s Blade</em>, and it’ll allow you to experience the story as it was written.</p>
 <p data-characters="71" data-current-count="71" data-injectable="false">Note that although Maas recommends this reading order, the fans do not.</p> <h3 id="h-chronological-order" data-injectable="false">Chronological order</h3> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">This is the order in which I read the <a href="https://geni.us/UDE8zoa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Throne of Glass</em> series</a> – in line with the chronological order of events. This means that I started with <em>The Assassin’s Blade</em>, which is something of a hot take, but I do have a strong case for this reading order. </p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true"> <li>The Assassin’s Blade (2014)</li> <li>Throne of Glass (2012)</li> <li>Crown of Midnight (2013)</li> <li>Heir of Fire (2014)</li> <li>Queen of Shadows (2015)</li> <li>Empire of Storms (2016)</li> <li>Tower of Dawn (2017)</li> <li>Kingdom of Ash (2018)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">Although the mystery behind Sardothien’s origins is incredibly compelling, having been with her from the very beginning is an emotional roller coaster in its own right. Knowing the tragedy and the motivation as she goes through the woes and the paces of the first two installments and beyond allows me to share in her regrets and grief as she feels them, not just pine after concealed information.</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Whenever she looked back, I looked back, too. Whenever she reflected on a piece of her past, I reflected, too. Personally, I find this makes the first installments much more emotional and personal with the context of why she is the way she is. </p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">However, if you’d rather have an explosion of tragic exposition knowing the weight of what her future holds, then it may be wise to leave <em>The Assassin’s Blade</em> until a little later.</p>
 <h3 id="h-emotional-explosion-order" data-injectable="false">Emotional explosion order</h3> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">This seems to be a very strong fan-favorite reading order. It is only a slight modification of the publication order, although many fans swear by it:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true"> <li>Throne of Glass (2012)</li> <li>Crown of Midnight (2013)</li> <li>Heir of Fire (2014)</li> <li>The Assassin’s Blade (2014)</li> <li>Queen of Shadows (2015)</li> <li>Empire of Storms (2016)</li> <li>Tower of Dawn (2017)</li> <li>Kingdom of Ash (2018)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Reading <em>The Assassin’s Blade</em> after <em>Heir of Fire</em> instead of before, you’ll have the pleasant experience of getting your heart untimely ripped out of your sobbing chest. I must admit I am envious of not being able to experience the story in this order first-hand, knowing what I now know.</p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">This is likely the best way to read the <em>Throne of Glass</em> series and is broadly the reading order I’d suggest. Although the emotional weight of this order can’t be shrugged off, there is incredible merit in reading the series in chronological order, as previously discussed.</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-tandem-variation" data-injectable="false">The tandem variation</h3> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">Interestingly, the <em>Empire of Shadows</em> and <em>Tower of Dawn</em> installments can be read in either order or in tandem. This is less of a new order and more of a variation that you can amend to your chosen reading order.</p> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Both stories happen at the same time, so ultimately, they both lead into the final entry, <em>Kingdom of Ash</em>.</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">The order in which you read these entries will depend largely on your chosen reading order. You may wish to read <em>Empire of Storms</em> first as that was written first, or you may wish to read <em>Tower of Dawn</em> first to allow for a cleaner transition between <em>Empire of Storms</em> and <em>Kingdom of Ash</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">Alternatively, you can read them both at the same time to have a more fleshed-out account of what happens during this time. T.L. Traver has made a <a href="https://www.tlbranson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Throne-of-Glass-Reading-Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wonderfully concise PDF to assist you in this reading order</a>.</p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">No matter your reading order, you can adopt one of these three variations for the two penultimate entries to make your reading experience your own.</p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="false">Now that you know all the recommended and best ways to read <a href="https://geni.us/UDE8zoa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Sarah J. Maas’ <em>Throne of Glass</em> series</a>, all that’s left to do is order every single one of them and not leave your room for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p data-characters="260" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Quite frankly, there are too many fantastic tracks for me to put on this list to elevate your reading experience. However, the following recommendations will likely become your go-to tracks for quite a while to come. So sit back, get comfy, and get swept away.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">I have gathered these tracks from my own extensive personal research, and from very popular recommendations from fellow fantasy readers, making this list rather comprehensive. Certain readers will want specific tracks to compliment the genre of fantasy they’re reading, so thankfully the following composers and OSTs will have something for everyone.</p> <div data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-best-composers-and-bands-for-fantasy-reading" data-level="2">Best composers and bands for fantasy reading</a><ul><li><a href="#h-faun" data-level="3">Faun</a></li><li><a href="#h-adrian-von-ziegler" data-level="3">Adrian von Ziegler</a></li><li><a href="#h-thomas-bergersen" data-level="3">Thomas Bergersen</a></li><li><a href="#h-peter-gundry" data-level="3">Peter Gundry</a></li><li><a href="#h-nest" data-level="3">Nest</a></li><li><a href="#h-rest-here-traveler-ambient-music" data-level="3">Rest Here Traveler ambient music</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#h-best-osts-to-listen-to-for-fantasy-reading" data-level="2">Best OSTs to listen to for fantasy reading</a><ul><li><a href="#h-dwarf-fortress-ost" data-level="3">Dwarf Fortress OST</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-witcher-3-ost" data-level="3">The Witcher 3 OST</a></li><li><a href="#h-pirates-of-the-caribbean-ost" data-level="3">Pirates of the Caribbean OST</a></li><li><a href="#h-elder-scrolls-osts" data-level="3">Elder Scrolls OSTs</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-lord-of-the-rings-ost" data-level="3">The Lord of the Rings OST</a></li></ul></li></ul></div> <h2 id="h-best-composers-and-bands-for-fantasy-reading" data-injectable="false">Best composers and bands for fantasy reading</h2> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">OSTs get a lot of love when it comes to fantasy music, so I’ll be starting with some lesser-known – yet excellent – composers. I either listen to these composers myself or keep seeing their names pop up around this discourse. Although there’s an unimaginable wealth of fantasy music out there, the following composers are some of the best.</p>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">There are some names you may expect to see here that I’ve omitted, as their works will be included in the OST section, so don’t worry.</p> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Lupercalia" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKXLg40eb4s?list=OLAK5uy_mrSm_kvalrLs26oeVblzNN9fMaEiGkpZU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h3 id="h-faun" data-injectable="false">Faun</h3> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">Faun is a band I’ve only just come across. Their music ranges from sweet and light fantastical pieces to more somber numbers with lyrics. It sounds not inspired by fantasy worlds but as though it were ripped right out of one. Heavier, darker pieces and more upbeat jigs also populate their works.</p> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">This is a band I’m going to be listening to more of immediately, as their music seems to fit effortlessly into almost any fantasy setting. </p>
 <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="81" data-injectable="false">I’d personally <a href="https://geni.us/AM5r9K" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">recommend their Eden album</a>, although honestly, any will do. </p> <figure data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Celtic Music - Tale of the Gaels" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-YxthsXo2Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h3 id="h-adrian-von-ziegler" data-injectable="false">Adrian von Ziegler</h3> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Adrian von Ziegler is a composer I had the privilege of stumbling across many years ago. He composes mostly Celtic pieces, although he does dabble in a variety of other genres. He has years of musical content to listen to, including collections of his compositions for an uninterrupted and flowing listening experience.</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">I would strongly suggest the celtic music, not only as there’s so much of it, but because it’s some of the best upbeat and lively fantasy music out there. As there are no lyrics, I can properly be immersed in the ebbs and flows of the music. His pieces immerse themselves into your reading experience fluidly.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend the <a href="https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/album/the-celtic-collection-adrian-von-ziegler/v6o36ogt0dwkc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celtic Collection</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Thomas Bergersen - Age of Gods (High Quality Audio)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fU3pHi6TCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h3 id="h-thomas-bergersen" data-injectable="false">Thomas Bergersen</h3> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">You’ve likely already heard lots of Thomas Bergersen’s music, or at least music from his production music company Two Steps From Hell. Seriously, open up Spotify or YouTube and search his name. The Invincible album is full of classic pieces that are instantly recognizable.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">For more exciting and action-packed fantasy stories, you can’t really go wrong with putting any of Thomas Bergersen’s tracks on. They have the power to turn any scene you’re reading into something ten times as epic.</p>
 <p data-characters="86" data-current-count="86" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/invincible/372716645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invincible album</a> for dramatic moments and chapters.</p> <figure data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Last of the Sky Guardians | Symphonic Destruction" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VUzg9K1DO4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h3 id="h-peter-gundry" data-injectable="false">Peter Gundry</h3> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">You have likely heard of Peter Gundry, for he is a rather popular composer. His music is typically slower, with more sinister or somber undertones for the most part. Each track makes the perfect background noise for darker or tragic fantasy stories.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">They will blend in with the words, slowly protruding into your mind until they become the backing track of the film playing in your mind. He is truly an excellent composer that I’ll certainly be listening to more of.</p> <p data-characters="58" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-edge-of-darkness/1023540312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Edge of Darkness album</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Moonbow" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZwCG2XWBoTM?list=OLAK5uy_lvBq9fbwjN5AxalbCJkoB6E3kQ_bENhpQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h3 id="h-nest" data-injectable="false">Nest</h3> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">I kept seeing Nest pop up – and I couldn’t resist but to give them a listen. The tracks that Nest produces are more mystical and slower pieces, to allow for the story to take center stage in your mind. </p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">The tracks are very lyric-light and tend to meander and weave around your mind. They’re not particularly exciting, although they’re not boring either. Such tracks could prove perfect for those who do not want anything too obnoxious to distract them from their reading.</p>
 <p data-characters="103" data-current-count="103" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/trail-of-the-unwary/1595733078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail of the Unwary album</a> for moody and more somber fantasy reading.</p> <figure data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="6 Hour Rest Here Traveler ambient music with fire burning" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K2VzuA6UZ7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h3 id="h-rest-here-traveler-ambient-music" data-injectable="false">Rest Here Traveler ambient music</h3> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">This isn’t a composer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2VzuA6UZ7A&amp;list=PLdMVpI56As754ealpF1zFGYGfNDh0Qa4p&amp;index=16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but is one track</a> I thought I’d add as a little bonus. I am unsure why, but I <em>adore</em> this track, and it is my go-to for lots more than just reading. Although it’s essentially the same melody repeating with the sound of a bonfire, I have yet to get bored of it.</p> <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">This track is a personal recommendation, sure, but I feel so strongly about it that I can’t not include it.</p>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend this track for more relaxing reads or to block out background noise.</p> <h2 id="h-best-osts-to-listen-to-for-fantasy-reading" data-injectable="false">Best OSTs to listen to for fantasy reading</h2> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Most readers who listen to music, myself included, love to listen to OSTs. So popular are these OSTs that you’ve likely already used them for your fantasy listening pleasure. If you find one or two that you haven’t yet listened to – then save it for later.</p> <h3 id="h-dwarf-fortress-ost" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/dwarf-fortress-original-game-soundtrack/1656317303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwarf Fortress OST</a></h3> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">Starting off with an OST I simply keep coming back to that’s also criminally underrated, I’d love to introduce you to the Dwarf Fortress OST by Dabu and Simon Swerwer. There is something too rich about this OST that is a struggle to put into words, but I’ll try my best.</p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">These tracks, especially the main theme, are brimming with their own stories woven into the mystical notes and melodies. This OST provides you with ominous ambiguity, action, melancholy, and, strangely, hope. I am literally listening to this OST as I write.</p> <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend this OST for melancholic, casual, and deeper fantasy stories (and for life in general).</p> <h3 id="h-the-witcher-3-ost" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-original-game-soundtrack/1333501415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3 OST</a></h3> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">The Witcher 3 is very renowned for its OST by Marcin Przybyłowicz. <em>Many</em> readers recommend the tracks in this OST that resemble the White Wolf himself: dark and hopeful, quick and calm, powerful and gentle. </p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">The world of The Witcher is a very detailed and rich fantasy world, and this OST pays it a huge compliment. These tracks feel native to the continent, and they’ll seep into your fantasy worlds effortlessly.</p> <p data-characters="72" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend this OST for casual high-fantasy reading.</p> <h3 id="h-pirates-of-the-caribbean-ost" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of/1440649561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pirates of the Caribbean OST</a></h3> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">The Pirates of the Caribbean has a vast OST if you include all five films, which I highly recommend you do. Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, and Geoff Zanelli all contributed to the exciting and incredible scores that make whatever you’re doing so much cooler than it already is.</p>
 <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">These OSTs hit many different themes expertly. You’ll find gloomy and sad pieces, romantic and tragic pieces, and, most importantly, epic action scores. The films are known for their excellent fantastical elements and action sequences, and none of them would be as good as it is without the music.</p> <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend this OST for grand adventures or action sequences.</p> <h3 id="h-elder-scrolls-osts" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-original-game-soundtrack/596951310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elder Scrolls OSTs</a></h3> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">The Elder Scrolls series is a franchise rich with entries – and with music. The past three installments of the main Elder Scrolls franchise, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim, have incredible and renowned fantasy tracks that inspire all sorts of emotions. Jeremy Soule is the music composer for all three titles.</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Considering how vast each of these three games is – in theme, locations, story, and setting – the soundtracks from these OSTs are ripe for any fantasy scenario. With such a grand catalog of premium fantasy music, you won’t be running out of music to listen to any time soon.</p> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Out of all the games, I’d personally recommend the Skyrim soundtrack for all sorts of fantasy reading. </p>
 <h3 id="h-the-lord-of-the-rings-ost" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship/323714092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings OST</a></h3> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Ending this list with an absolute classic and staple of fantasy culture – The Lord of the Rings OST, by Howard Shore. This collection of tracks really doesn’t need an introduction and has become the official soundtrack of fantasy for many.</p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">The pinnacle of fantasy – the books and films – were complimented perfectly by these tracks, so I’m sure they’ll transpose your stories into something even more magical. Also, there are loads of remixes and covers out there. I personally enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnVlN327sn0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lofi versions from Bits &amp; Hits</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false">I’d recommend this OST for almost <em>any</em> fantasy reading, be it dramatic, tragic, adventurous, or romantic.</p> <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">With these excellent music recommendations, your fantasy reading will be elevated to new heights.</p>

<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After the release of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-76-skyline-valley-patch-notes-map-expansion-vault-63-secrets-and-new-public-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyline Valley update for <em>Fallout 76</em></a><em>, </em>players quickly noticed that scrapping Pickaxes resulted in Legendary modules. This obvious glitch has fans on the hunt for these previously mediocre but now extremely valuable weapons.</p> <h2 id="h-pickaxe-spawns-have-been-temporarily-disabled" data-injectable="false">Pickaxe spawns have been temporarily disabled</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fallout-76-scrap-pickaxe-legendary-module.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately for players hoping to get some easy Legendary modules, this exploit was busting the economy of <em>Fallout 76</em>. Bethesda released a hotfix to temporarily disable Pickaxes from spawning in the world. This also means that if you have the blueprint to craft a Pickaxe, you’ll get a “lack the requirements” message when you try to make one.</p>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">However, even after the hotfix, Pickaxes still appear in some locations, and they occasionally drop from Scorched enemies as well. Here are the places you’ll want to check out to find a Pickaxe after the hotfix:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false"> <li>Foundation – Exterior</li> <li>Gauley Mine</li> <li>Glassed Cavern</li> <li>Nuka World On Tour – Tunnel of Love</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-pickaxes-in-fallout-76-normally" data-injectable="false">Where to find Pickaxes in Fallout 76 normally</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fallout-76-pickaxe-tunnel-of-love.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">If you want a Pickaxe because you’re a completionist and need to collect every weapon in the game, you might want to know all the places you can find them in normal circumstances. In addition to the above locations, Pickaxes usually spawn in the following areas:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true"> <li>Blackwater Mine</li> <li>Garrahan Mining Headquarters</li> <li>Greg’s Mine Supply</li> <li>Lucky Hole Mine</li> <li>Miners Monument</li> <li>Tygart Wastewater Treatment Plant </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Though Pickaxes can currently still be found in <em>Fallout 76 </em>even after the hotfix, it’s only a matter of time before Bethesda notices the oversight and also disables those spawn locations or patches the Legendary module glitch. So if you’re hoping for some easy looting, you might want to hurry.</p>

<p data-characters="62" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><strong><em>This article contains spoilers for Destiny 2: The Final Shape.</em></strong></p> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">If players have spent some time combing through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/"><em>Destiny</em>&nbsp;<em>2</em></a>‘s endgame content, there’s little doubt they’ve encountered one of the mysterious shrouded statues. These fixtures have been an enigma since their first appearance in-game, with little to no explanation about the origin or purpose of the identical structures.&nbsp;However, in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, Guardians finally get some answers about these creepy statues.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">The shrouded statues first appeared in the&nbsp;<em>Shadowkeep</em>&nbsp;expansion, found throughout the campaign and at the very end of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-raids-in-release-order-listed/">Garden of Salvation Raid</a>. Since then, they have sporadically popped up wherever Darkness gathers, like the Deep Stone Crypt Raid. While an apparent connection to the Darkness, as The Witness uses it to speak to players, the statues have literally remained shrouded in mystery until now.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-are-destiny-2-s-shrouded-statues" data-injectable="false">What are Destiny 2’s shrouded statues?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true">During The Final Shape’s campaign, the shrouded statues take a bit of a spotlight. After Commander Zavala’s past is dredged up and his resolve tested, the character notices the statues trying to speak with him. The Commander believes they’re trying to help. While Zavala’s abrupt change in demeanor and the clear connection between the statues and The Witness cause alarm for Ikora Rey and our allies, he’s ultimately&nbsp;right.</p>
 <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Investigating the statues deeper, players and Zavala discover that they are indeed trying to communicate with us&nbsp;—&nbsp;and&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;not overtly hostile.&nbsp;However, at first, the most Guardians can get out of the entities is their desire to see us give ourselves to Darkness. When Zavala briefly gives in to the influence of The Witness, the statues show him what they really are: dissenters.</p>
 <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">The Witness is an entity created from the mass sacrifice of an entire species.&nbsp;And we learn that not&nbsp;every one&nbsp;of those progenitor people&nbsp;shares&nbsp;the same vision as The Witness.&nbsp;The shrouded statues are still part of The Witness, but these individual conscious objectors have been suppressed and excised from the greater collective that’s unified in purpose.&nbsp;Some of the voices from these statues note that time has twisted the intent of The Witness, while others seem&nbsp;to&nbsp;never have&nbsp;been&nbsp;on board with the endeavor.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-do-the-shrouded-statues-want" data-injectable="false">What do the shrouded statues want?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">As dissenters, the individuals within the shrouded statues are&nbsp;aghast&nbsp;to see The Witness so close to enacting its Final Shape. Physically trapped and separated within statues, they’re almost powerless to stop The Witness. However, as they&nbsp;still are a&nbsp;part of The Witness, the shrouded statues are an unguarded weakpoint.</p>
 <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true">When we finally discover the statue’s intent, Guardians realize they must embrace Darkness to sequester their help. This comes to pass in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-defeat-dolgith-blade-of-reasoning-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Iconoclasm </a>mission, where we’re gifted a sword forged of Light and embrace Darkness while engaging The Witness. From within the Darkness, Guardians find themselves surrounded by the shrouded statues, with many more dissenters than initially imagined.&nbsp;They&nbsp;have a simple ask: to die.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">The dissenters within the shrouded statues are in a perpetual state of undeath as they watch The Witness carry out its heinous acts. They beg for Guardians to use the Light sword to destroy them, severing their connection to The Witness and ending their existence. While individually helpless in undying life, their collective dissection and death make The Witness vulnerable.</p>

<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Naoya Matsumoto’s <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>has been a smash hit for the past few years, and that trajectory got white hot when the anime adaptation premiered back in April. Now it’s getting a shot at video games with the <a href="https://x.com/kj8_thegame/status/1801984554858934272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly-announced</a> and tentatively-titled <em>Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">Akatsuki Games is in charge of development and distribution for the <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>game. The studio is also behind Extreme Baseball action-RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2376580/TRIBE_NINE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tribe Nine</em></a>, which was first announced in 2021 and finally has a closed beta test on the way this August. Neither that nor <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>have release dates in place yet.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Joining Akatsuki Games are TOHO Games and anime studio Production I.G, which handles animation production for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kaiju-no-8-is-the-feel-good-monster-mash-we-need-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>anime</a>. Beyond that, all we know is that <em>Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME </em>is in the works for mobile devices and PC, and will be available via the App Store, Google Play, and Steam. You can see a quick cinematic tease in the debut trailer below.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="『怪獣８号 THE GAME』第１弾トレーラー／『Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME』OFFICIAL TRAILER 1" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kJ7mXzFbGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">The original <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>manga has been running in the pages of <em>Weekly Shonen Jump </em>since July 2020. As of March 2023 it had 11 million copies in circulation around the world. Those numbers are sure to continue climbing following the anime, which is currently running with Shigeyuki Miya and Tomomi Kamiya directing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="600" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">The story follows Kafka Hibino, who finds that his dreams of enlisting in the Defense Force have fallen to the wayside by the time he’s in his thirties. Instead, he spends his days handling stomach-turning cleanup duties after the dust has settled on the latest colossal Kaiju battle. After meeting Reno Ichikawa, however, that ambitious spark is reunited, and he vows to join his childhood friend Mina Ashiro in the Defense Force ranks and protect humanity from the encroaching Kaiju threat. Then, in an unexpected twist of fate, he ends up gaining the ability to turn into a Kaiju himself… </p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">Yep, this is the good stuff. Both the <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>manga and anime are worth your time if you haven’t checked them out already. Hopefully the game will be able to follow suit with confidence whenever it arrives.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has donated $4311 (£3397) to the Save the Children charity after Helldivers chose morality over manslaughter earlier this week.</p>
<p>Arrowhead CCO and Helldiver 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt confirmed the donation after <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1800533719985311947">Helldivers players chose</a> to save the trapped survivors – which turned out to be thousands of sick children – on Vernen Wells rather than hunt down the raw ingredients they could use to make MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines on Marfark.</p>

<p>Why $4311 exactly? Well, that's because Helldivers managed to save 4311 in-game children, which turned into a charity donation to save real-life children, too.</p>
<p>"Since the Helldivers 2 community chose to save the children, [Arrowhead Game Studios] does the same," Pilestedt wrote. "We have made a donation to, well, Save the Children. Great job Divers!"</p> <div>

<p>Players were also then treated to a follow-up message from The Very Sick Children of Super Citizen Anne's.</p>
<p>"Dear Helldivers: Thank you so much for saving us. They told us you made a lot of sacrifices (mines/lives) to help us. We'll always be grateful. Now, we can grow up to become Helldivers too."</p> <div>

<p>Players were then <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801625047418667450">encouraged</a> to go for the mines, too, even though the development team was certain "they never will" get it done in time…</p>
<p>Sorry, Helldivers, but no – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-helldivers-2-story-mode-is-not-happening">Arrowhead has no plans to introduce a story mode for Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<p>Responding to a commenter on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, newly-appointed CEO Shams Jorjani confirmed a story mode was "not happening".</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 may be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">player numbers have declined</a>. A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to SteamDB, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 24 hours is 80,038, although that only accounts for Steam players, of course.</p>

		<p>Jason Schreier did as Jason Schreier does last week and published a behind-the-scenes look at the making of a big-name game, full of wild revelations from sources that did not want to be named in the article because these are the kinds of bombshell stories They don't want You to know.</p><p>The game in question was <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and the article told the shocking story of a celebrated development studio tried to branch out beyond its wheelhouse and realized that it wasn't as good at that new thing as the thing they've been doing to tremendous acclaim for the past decade or more.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<em>"Leadership didn't seem worried, they say, even as other traditionally single-player game studios that chased the live-service trend were delivering abysmal results with games such as Anthem (which earned a lowly score of 59 out of 100 on Metacritic), Marvel's Avengers (67 out of 100) and Redfall (56 out of 100)."</em> — Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry?ref=remapradio.com">notes in his Suicide Squad feature</a> that BioWare, Crystal Dynamics, and Arkane likewise struggled to reproduce their single-player success in a live service world.

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p><em>Suicide Squad’s</em> problems with creative direction at the highest levels that were so bad, even the rank-and-file developers could clearly see the pitfalls they were headed straight for. There was some chasing of trends, some organizational mismanagement, key leaders who had a hand in everything but didn't seem to know what game they were making, resulting in frequent changes that wasted a bunch of work.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<em>"Levine would tell his staff to overhaul large chunks of levels or sections of the city, seemingly at a whim, based on what he thought would be best for the game. Every cut or change Levine made had trickle-down effects for the lower-level designers, artists, and programmers. It was demoralizing to put weeks of your life into something only to watch it get flushed down the drain."</em> – In his book <em>Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/5/10/22424321/a-look-inside-bioshock-infinites-troubled-development?ref=remapradio.com">excerpted by Polygon</a>, Schreier details a lot of the same complaints from developers who worked on BioShock Infinite at Irrational Games.
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p>Schreier noted that <em>Suicide Squad</em> also suffered from "a culture of rigid perfectionism" at Rocksteady that aggravated the studio's other problems.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<em>"Shooting a sack of grain in Uncharted 4 would cause the sack to deflate as barley poured out of it. Shining a flashlight at Ellie's face in The Last of Us led her to blink and turn away. Those details exist because Naughty Dog has built a culture of perfectionism, where games have to be great, no matter the human cost."</em> – Schreier, in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962?ref=remapradio.com">2020 Kotaku feature</a> on the development of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>.
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p>And even as the troubled project limped down the home stretch, studio leadership was confident it would all come together at the last minute.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<em>"Within the studio, there's a term called 'BioWare magic.' It's a belief that no matter how rough a game's production might be, things will always come together in the final months. The game will always coalesce. It happened on the Mass Effect trilogy, on Dragon Age: Origins, and on Inquisition... Even when a project feels like a complete disaster, there's a belief that with enough hard work—and enough difficult crunch—it'll all come together."</em> – <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964?ref=remapradio.com">Schreier's Kotaku feature on Anthem.</a>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p>OK, so maybe the revelations in the <em>Suicide Squad</em> feature weren't quite as wild as the lead made it sound. If this feature feels a bit formulaic at this point, it's not because of the things Schreier had control over; the writing, the reporting, the facts included, and the context given. The problem was in the story itself, because it's a story we've seen time and time again in the AAA game space, and one Schreier has told himself more than a few times.</p><p>In fact, the behind-the-scenes game dev story is so formulaic at this point, I'm more interested in the parts of the formula that weren't included here, specifically the rampant crunch (of the kind detailed in Schreier's <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466?ref=remapradio.com"><u>2018<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> feature</u></a>) or sexism (as in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-scandal-harassment-sexism-and-abuse?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the feature he wrote about Ubisoft</u></a> in the wake of public allegations about the company culture).</p><p>The absence of such complaints doesn't necessarily mean these things weren't present, but given how these complaints have fit the formula we're talking about in the past, perhaps we can be cautiously optimistic about their omission here.</p><p>Those angles aside, the fact that these studio tell-all features have started to feel so same-y says less about the journalist reporting them and more about how mundane this kind of dysfunction is in AAA game development. That's why the stories behind flops like <em>Anthem</em> and <em>Suicide Squad</em> can sound so similar to the stories behind hits like <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, and <em>Mass Effect</em>, and it's why the people in charge of a team making the former can convince themselves they're actually making the latter until it's too late.</p><figure></figure><p>In a lot of ways this is simply how many AAA games are made, and this dysfunction no more guarantees a flop than a rational and efficient development process guarantees a hit.</p><p>Again, none of this is to take away from the work of Schreier, who has built his career on a valuable form of in-depth reporting that is not so regularly done in this field, and is vital given the industry's absolute disdain for any amount of transparency. His stories, however, are accounts of what happened behind the scenes, but they don’t explain why one game is good and successful and another is poor and a flop. Together they paint a picture of practices endemic to the industry.</p><p>Even if these stories don't stand out as singularly massive scandals or all start to blend into one another, I think there's still value in these kinds of stories. Because if the goal is to actually produce meaningful improvements in the way the industry makes games to reduce the amount of human collateral damage—and it really should be—blockbuster reporting on industry-shaking scandals doesn't really go as far as you might hope.</p><p>I'm thinking here of the sexism scandals we've seen around Riot Games, Ubisoft, and Activision Blizzard over the past six years or so, each of which was either sparked or furthered by investigative reporting. We've seen some accountability in the form of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/27/riot-discrimination-100-million-settlement/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>multimillion-dollar lawsuit settlements</u></a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/blizzard-entertainment-activision.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>executive departures</u></a>, and even <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-ubisoft-sexual-harassment-police-1850898896?ref=remapradio.com"><u>criminal investigations</u></a>, and that's not nothing. But in each case, the accountability has stopped short of the people most responsible for fostering corporate cultures where indefensible behavior was tolerated and even protected.</p><p>Riot co-founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill are still with the company in leadership roles. Yves Guillemot is still CEO at Ubisoft, if you can “<a href="https://x.com/UbisoftItalia/status/781531519198257152?ref=remapradio.com"><u>belYves</u></a>” it. And while Bobby Kotick is no longer running Activision Blizzard, it's hard to take a look at <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-ceo-stands-to-reap-nearly-400-million-in-microsoft-deal-and-that-may-be-just-the-start-11642540612?ref=remapradio.com"><u>how much he made</u></a> from the $70 billion sale to Microsoft and think this represents comeuppance of any sort.</p><p>As much as some people might have made a big show of how they would no longer support such companies (and let's go ahead and say every last one of them followed through for the sake of argument), it didn't really make a difference. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Ubisoft</u></a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/overwatch-2-helps-activision-blizzard-rake-in-record-bookings?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Activision Blizzard</u></a> both set new bookings records in the years since their scandals broke, so whatever negative impact the scandals may have had was more than offset by the masses of people who either never heard about them, or figured it wasn't a big enough deal to impact their purchasing decisions.</p><p>I'm convinced now that there is no story so earth-shattering, so horrifying, so diligently researched and expertly told that we could Upton Sinclair's<em> The Jungle</em> our way to a better games industry. Even Sinclair's landmark novel—informed in part by his first-hand experiences with the shockingly unsanitary and brutal working conditions in Chicago's meatpacking industry—didn't have the impact he wanted, despite it prompting popular outcry that ultimately <a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/changes-science-law-and-regulatory-authorities/part-i-1906-food-and-drugs-act-and-its-enforcement?ref=remapradio.com#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20the%20nauseating%20condition%20of%20the%20meat%2Dpacking%20industry%20that%20Upton%20Sinclair%20captured%20in%20The%20Jungle%20was%20the%20final%20precipitating%20force%20behind%20both%20a%20meat%20inspection%20law%20and%20a%20comprehensive%20food%20and%20drug%20law"><u>led to the creation</u></a> of what is now called the US Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Sinclair understood it wasn't his heartbreaking depiction of how capitalist structures enforce and exploit hopeless poverty that moved people; they were just grossed out at the idea of workers falling into the meat grinders and winding up in their food.</p><blockquote>"I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach." – Sinclair, on the response to The Jungle.</blockquote><p>Much of <em>The Jungle</em> is about the exploitation of the poor more broadly, but it was the meatpacking bits that resonated most strongly because while people generally dislike systemic abuse of the poor, they find fingers in their hotdogs infinitely more distasteful.</p><p>So while public outcry and the "vote with your wallets" crowd might have moved the needle in early 20<sup>th</sup> century meatpacking, it's not going to be effective in the modern games industry because there's no equivalently distasteful byproduct of these scandals that impacts the end user. (And that's not for lack of trying, given the industry has already forced <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-industrys-disingenuous-defense-of-loot-boxes-this-week-in-business?ref=remapradio.com"><u>gambling</u></a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/always-online-simcity-burns-to-the-ground-10-years-ago-this-month?ref=remapradio.com"><u>DRM</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-gives-gran-turismo-sport-the-boot-this-week-in-business?ref=remapradio.com"><u>planned obsolescence</u></a> into games over the objections of players, who eventually grew to just accept it all.)</p><figure><figcaption><span>The scene of some deeply ironic moments in Bioshock Infinite.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The industry's ongoing switch to digital effectively makes a surprise worker's finger in the end product even more of an impossibility (except in cases of $300 collector's editions, where an honest-to-goodness developer body part might be seen as a feature rather than a bug).</p><p>All that is to say I've lost a bit of faith in the power of one sensational story to bring about meaningful change. After all, journalism can't fix problems directly; it can only bring them to light, at which point the people and institutions that actually do have the power to hold others to account are supposed to kick in and do their job. And as you may have noticed, many of those people and institutions seem to have taken the past decade off.</p><p>So what can bring about meaningful change? It's not particularly sexy, but I think a better understanding of the common causes of these problems absolutely helps, and like water wearing down stone, that understanding is more likely to be driven by a continuous drip of stories like the <em>Suicide Squad</em> feature than one big splashy piece about the Worst Studio Ever.</p><p>It's easy for an executive to look at stories like Activision Blizzard or Riot Games and learn absolutely nothing, or come away thinking they are doing a good job because they aren't actively <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-activision-blizzards-kotick-knew-about-sexual-misconduct-allegations-for-years?ref=remapradio.com#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20the,allegations%2C%20it%20said"><u>overruling HR</u></a> to protect a studio co-head accused of sexual harassment, or because they aren't <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483?ref=remapradio.com#:~:text=One%20former%20male%20employee%20said%20that%20Riot%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cbro%20culture%E2%80%9D%20is%20more%20pronounced%20behind%20closed%20doors%2C%20and%20hurts%20men%20too%3A%20One%20of%20Riot%E2%80%99s%20male%20senior%20leaders%20regularly%20grabbed%20his%20genitals%2C%20the%20source%20said%2C%20adding%2C%20%E2%80%9CIf%20he%20walked%20into%20a%20meeting%20with%20no%20women%20he%E2%80%99d%20just%20fart%20on%20someone%E2%80%99s%20face.%E2%80%9D"><u>farting in employees' faces</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine it's harder for them to brush aside the drumbeat of stories about the <em>Suicide Squads</em> and <em>Anthems</em> of the world because what went on in those studios is not particularly sensational. It's the same kind of people in the same kind of roles making the same kind of mistakes over and over.</p><p>So how do things get better? Well, here's the concluding paragraph of the initial draft of this article I submitted:</p><p>"Assuming the creative directors running these studios aren't completely obtuse (just go with me here), there's only so many times you can see so many different peers stepping on the same rakes for the same reasons before you start watching where you put your own feet."</p><p>Originally, that was the end of the article. To which my editor here Rob Zacny took a page from <em>Return of the King </em>and said, “That was great, but what if it had more endings?”</p>

This is one of so very many details I desperately wish I could fact check, but never will. Because in 2016, my dad—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-hugh-walker-1949-2016&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-hugh-walker-1949-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugh Walker</a></span>—unexpectedly dropped dead on the sidewalk at the age of 66. He was walking home from breakfast at a friend’s, and then he wasn’t any more. And with him went nearly seven decades of encyclopedic information on every detail of world history, and forensic knowledge of the UK game development scene of the 1980s.</p><p>My dad was like a cuddly toy in many respects, but one in particular was the metaphorical hoop on a length of string protruding from his back, that when pulled would unleash a breathless spiel of informed and entertaining knowledge. It was always a monologue, but it was generally worth listening to. It might be that you’d accidentally trigger something on the royal turbulence of the 1500s, but it could equally be the origins of film-license specialists Ocean Software, or personal anecdotes on how he became friends with the developers at Level 9, developers behind text adventures like <em>Jewels of Darkness</em> and <em>Ingrid Strikes Back</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="912be8c7d4f82a1a97db45c9c6fd5725" data-recommend-id="image://912be8c7d4f82a1a97db45c9c6fd5725" data-format="jpg" data-width="988" data-height="556" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Level 9 text adventure Ingrid's Back, with drunk dwarfs in a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Level 9 text adventure Ingrid's Back, with drunk dwarfs in a bar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Level 9 / Mobygames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="912be8c7d4f82a1a97db45c9c6fd5725" data-recommend-id="image://912be8c7d4f82a1a97db45c9c6fd5725" data-format="jpg" data-width="988" data-height="556" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Level 9 text adventure Ingrid's Back, with drunk dwarfs in a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In 1981, Hugh Walker got the first ever affordable (although we could barely afford it) mass-produced home computer, the ZX-81. In 1982 he was sent a pre-release ZX Spectrum 48K to review for a magazine. In 1984 he had a game published, a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/type-ins/zx-comp/zx_names.htm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/type-ins/zx-comp/zx_names.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">type-in</a></span>” for a magazine, called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://worldofspectrum.net/item/0025997/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://worldofspectrum.net/item/0025997/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warlock</em></a></span>. (I can make a strong argument for it being the first ever roguelite.) He regularly contributed to a popular UK fanzine called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/adventure-probe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/adventure-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Adventure Probe</em></a></span> (in 1990 he wrote an against-the-grain lengthy feature arguing in favor of “character interaction” being included in games). I remember helping him playtest unreleased text adventures. And he’d come back from big gaming events like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Computer_Trade_Show&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Computer_Trade_Show" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECTS</a></span> with bags of swag—all of which is made much stranger when you learn that he didn’t work with computers, nor have anything to do with the gaming industry. He was an NHS dentist (as in, the badly paid kind)—computers and gaming were simply a hobby.<br></p><p>I was born in 1977, so I wasn’t even in school when computers first entered our house. Because of dad’s connections, I reviewed my first video game at the age of 11. It’s some messed up superhero origin story stuff, given my job now, minus the “super” and “hero” parts. And of course, growing up surrounded by gaming is the most normal thing imaginable now, but it was much more rare back then.</p><p>Games were a key part of my relationship with my dad. The first time I knew he was capable of being scared was watching his hand shake on the mouse as he battled the dragon on level 13 of FTL’s seminal 1987 RPG, <em>Dungeon Master</em>. He demonstrated his enormous tolerance of me as I begged him for a go in the middle of his game of <em>UFO: Enemy Unknown</em> and would get his entire squad killed because I wanted to play it like an arcade game. I learned of his enormous, inexplicable patience, as I would sit next to him, watching him play 1991’s original <em>Civilization</em>, pestering him to start a war rather than working out wheat prices or whatever the hell that boring-ass game had you do.</p><h2 id="h447695"><a id=""></a><strong>The great gaming schism</strong></h2><p>As I grew through childhood, so did games. From white text on a black screen, they gained crude images, then entire games were made from these moving sprites. And as I became a teenager, video games very appositely represented the ways in which I deviated from my father, as is tradition. Adventures had diverged, evolving into both graphic adventures and RPGs. I went left, he went right. I played every single Sierra and LucasArts game, plus all their knock-offs (as well as FPS games as well, of course), occupying his 486 PC until my bedtime mercifully returned his machine to him, when he would then be sat surrounded by hand-drawn maps on squared paper as he explored dungeon after dungeon. SSI’s <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> games occupied him far more than was reasonable, alongside stone-cold classics like <em>Betrayal At Krondor</em> and <em>Lands of Lore</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="86a679ed5880ce03a9fbf68c60749aa9" data-recommend-id="image://86a679ed5880ce03a9fbf68c60749aa9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Betrayal At Krondor has not, um, held up as well as I'd imagined." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Betrayal At Krondor has not, um, held up as well as I'd imagined." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Betrayal At Krondor has not, um, held up as well as I’d imagined.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86a679ed5880ce03a9fbf68c60749aa9" data-recommend-id="image://86a679ed5880ce03a9fbf68c60749aa9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Betrayal At Krondor has not, um, held up as well as I'd imagined." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But we still intersected, like slot cars on a crossover track. The collisions were when we both wanted to play the same game at the same time, as was certainly the case for the all-time great Looking Glass title, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/four-of-the-best-pc-games-ever-are-free-right-now-1847448962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/four-of-the-best-pc-games-ever-are-free-right-now-1847448962"><em>Ultima Underworld II</em></a></span>, the first game we bought for dad’s shiny new PC. (It pushed all 2 MB of RAM to the limits.) But primarily, dad lost his patience for obscure puzzles, and I lost my patience for mixing potions. It wouldn’t be until BioWare started flexing (with <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>) that I’d rediscover the RPG, but that would be the same time the genre lost dad’s interest.<br></p><p>Thankfully for him, <em>The Elder Scrolls </em>never went away. He adored all of them, and somehow without ever learning how to install a mod. And he loved none more than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72777&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Skyrim</em></a></span><em>.</em> After he died, one of the admin jobs I had to do was sort his PC, which was still logged into his Steam account. He had <em>hundreds</em> of hours on <em>Skyrim</em>. Although the “1,263 hours on record” for <em>X-COM: UFO Defense</em> suggests that maybe he left that running in the background rather often. Video games had been a permanent accompaniment for him (along with my mum, I should probably add) for 35 years.</p><figure id="" data-id="1abd5bb5c5f38d4b1e739f47d7f51f52" data-recommend-id="image://1abd5bb5c5f38d4b1e739f47d7f51f52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="896" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hugh Walker, in a red top, lit by a garish flash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hugh Walker, in a red top, lit by a garish flash." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Margaret Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1abd5bb5c5f38d4b1e739f47d7f51f52" data-recommend-id="image://1abd5bb5c5f38d4b1e739f47d7f51f52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="896" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hugh Walker, in a red top, lit by a garish flash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>My dad was a good man. One of the true ones. He was normal, he messed up, he sometimes made bad choices (he bought an Atari ST instead of an Amiga for goodness sake), and he and I shared similar struggles with anxiety and mental health. But he was a truly <em>good</em> person, who would fight for those with less, who was capable of changing his mind when he recognized his own prejudice, and who made sure the people around them knew they were loved. He had a solid grounding in his morality, and I knew he was there for me, had my back.<br></p><p>I very strongly remember in 2015, just under a year before he died, and very shortly before he retired, a great example of his just being there when I needed him.

I had spent the day receiving some of the most horrendous abuse on Twitter and in my email and via my website. At the same time, I had terrible toothache and—with some irony—had to travel across the country to Guildford, where my parents lived, and where Molyneux was based. And dad just understood. He knew I had done the right thing, that I had stood up for what was true and fair, and he made that clear to me. He hugged me, he made me feel safe. He also fixed my tooth.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="c474f8e8a1b299e89d4dfc262c8aafbf" data-recommend-id="image://c474f8e8a1b299e89d4dfc262c8aafbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Another picture from the mod an RPS reader made in tribute to Hugh." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Another picture from the mod an RPS reader made in tribute to Hugh." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nexus Mods / Elianora</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c474f8e8a1b299e89d4dfc262c8aafbf" data-recommend-id="image://c474f8e8a1b299e89d4dfc262c8aafbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Another picture from the mod an RPS reader made in tribute to Hugh." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All the way until his untimely end, we would chat about video games. As dad got older, his interests narrowed, and his tolerance for burgeoning genres lessened. Despite loving the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> so much, he bounced off of <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>4</em>. I would tease him for just replaying the same five games over and over, and especially for his habit of endlessly restarting things like <em>Civ</em> until he found some impossible perfect route. He was the sort of person who’d finish every RPG with a backpack full of potions that he was saving for the right time, then start over and do the exact same thing again.<br></p><p>But we did overlap one final time. It was the completely wonderful <em>Legends of Grimrock</em>, a traditional dungeon-crawling RPG made in tribute to the mighty <em>Dungeon Master</em>.

Obviously I miss having my father, miss being able to talk nonsense with him on the phone or in person late into the night, and I lament the loss of the vast amounts of knowledge he carried. But the thing that brings this home for me more often than anything else is video games. He would have played <em>Starfield</em>. He would have had a lot more patience for it than I do, and likely motivated me to stick with it past its abysmal beginning. He would have watched Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em>, but been incapable of discussing it without repeatedly explaining to me why he didn’t get on with the games. For some reason, Firaxis carried on making <em>Civilization</em> games after he died, which doesn’t even make sense to me. Why did they bother with <em>VI</em>, when dad was never going to get to play it? I want to pick up the phone and pester him to stop being stupid about it and play <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. And you know what? I absolutely cannot remember if he ever played <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and there’s literally nothing I can do to find out.<br></p><p>What do I want anyone to get from this meandering, shapeless thing? Honestly, that you learn my dad was a good man. He deserves people to know. And that such a person eventually goes away, often very suddenly. It’s worth knowing. Thanks dad.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-722<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            
<p>Sundays are for hoping the plumber has ordered that new sink part in. My sink is ‘non-standard’ apparently. "Why can't I just be normal?!" I scream in silent longing. Armitage Shanks would never. Before I look forward to no longer having to wash up my pasta bowl in the same place I brush my teeth, let’s read this week’s best writing about games (and game related things!)</p>

<p>For <a href="https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made">Aftermath</a>, Luke Plunkett spoke to ‘Albert’, an anonymous industry vet, about the struggles of making a demo for a big showcase or event - despite sometimes knowing it’s “100% Grade A Bullshit”.</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, now that I think about it, I was at a studio (if not directly involved) in a trailer that was 100% Grade A bullshit. Essentially our publisher really, really wanted stuff to show and despite the fact that our next project wasn't even in the pitch phase, let alone production, we had an external team create a trailer to build hype. It was completely divorced from anything we hoped to do, and it was so early in development that it couldn't help but be misleading or tie our hands. That one sucked. It thankfully didn't eat up a ton of our resources and time, but it was still demoralizing because we had little to do with it and we all knew it was going to be promises that we couldn't necessarily deliver on.</p></blockquote>
<p>For <a href="https://unwinnable.com/2024/06/06/supergiants-scrappier-better-underworld/">Unwinnable</a>, Jay Castello wrote about “Supergiant’s Scrappier, Better Underworld.” That being the landscapes and characters of my favourite Supergiant game, Pyre.</p>
<blockquote><p>But unlike the spaces of the Hades games, the Downside is not an infinite labyrinth of rooms, filled only with enemies (and the occasional Charon store). The Downside is a world. Escaping it is a journey that takes the Nightwings through a variety of jewel-toned, hazily lit environments, each with their own moods. It necessitates the wagon, a home base that feels simultaneously comforting and crowded. And it gives all the characters a sense of grounding, a place in the world that lends them important narrative weight.</p></blockquote>
<p>For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/06/reinventing-the-pdp-10">The Guardian</a>, Keith Stuart chatted to the enthusiasts creating a replica of the PDP-10 mainframe computer - the same series on which prehistoric game SpaceWar! was designed.</p>
<blockquote>The attention to detail is wild. The lights on the front aren’t just for show. As in the original machine they indicate the instructions being carried out, a smattering of CPU signals, the memory contents. Vermeulen refers to it as watching the heartbeat of the computer. This element was taken very seriously. “Two people spent months on one particular problem,” says Vermeulen. “As you know, LEDs flick on and off, but incandescent lamps kind of glow. So there was a whole study to make the LEDs simulate the glow of the original lamps. And then we found out that different lamps from different years had a different glow time. Measurements were done, math was applied, but we added lamp glow. More CPU time is spent on simulating that than on simulating the original CPU!”</blockquote>
<p>House Of The Dragon is back! The first season was great! I can understand if you’re twice shy by this point, but I think you should give it a shot. You could just absorb it all by proxy through Glidus’s <a href="https://youtu.be/uh8fpm4liB8">excellent recap videos</a>, though.</p>
<p>‘<a href="https://youtu.be/LR511iAedYU">Orientalism: Desert Level Music vs Actual Middle-Eastern Music</a>’ is a video Brendy recommended after a chat about Metal Slug Tactics.</p>
<p>Ed sent me this. While you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, why not play <a href="https://woe-industries.itch.io/fromsoftword?ref=warpdoor.com">FromSoft Word</a>? ‘The Dark Souls of word processors. One typo, and it's game over.’ I’m so mildly amused by it that I don’t even mind such flagrant simplification of FromSoft’s design ethos. In this seven hour long video essay I will…</p>
<p>Music this week is <a href="https://youtu.be/QmRwov11nkw">Previous Industries</a> by Open Mike Eagle, Video Dave and STILL RIFT. I once had an illuminating conversation with Open Mike outside a show about linguistic determinism and the work of Robert Anton Wilson. <a href="https://youtu.be/R3ib9gCw1F4">Ziggy Starfish</a> is still the vibiest song ever written about social anxiety. Thanks, Michael Eagle, and thank you readers. Have a great weekend!</p>

			<p>Will the upcoming Gears of War E-Day have a multiplayer mode like previous installments in the series? The Coalition talked about it in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The Coalition and Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted a stunning trailer</a> for E-Day during last week's Xbox Showcase. Yes, it turned out that this trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-wasnt-rendered-in-real-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn't in real-time</a>, but it has many excited nonetheless. Since the release of the trailer, fans have been wondering whether E-Day will also include Gears' iconic multiplayer mode. In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/will-gears-of-war-e-day-have-multiplayer-what-about-gears-6-the-coalition-gives-us-some-hints-at-the-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new interview</a> with WindowsCentral, Creative Director Matt Searcy briefly touched on the subject, and while he didn't directly confirm multiplayer, he did provide some hints.</p>
<p>"I would say, this is the next mainline Gears game," the Creative Director said when asked about multiplayer, "Gears has a pretty clear DNA for gameplay modes, so you can probably anticipate where we'll be going with E-Day."</p>
<p>Based on this reply, it's pretty likely that E-Day will offer a fan-favorite multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, further in the interview, Searcy and Brand Director Nicole Fawcette also mentioned the story arcs of Gears 4 and Gears 5. After all, many Gears fans expected The Coalition to announce Gears 6 after the events of Gears 5. This, however, didn't happen and the team announced a prequel. Luckily for some, The Coalition isn't deserting the story of Gears 4 and 5, as emphasized by Fawcette.</p>
<p>"We're focused on this and pouring everything we can into it right now, what the next game is will be for us to decide in the future," Searcy said. Fawcette added, "We're not retreating from the stories of Gears 4 and 5, though. We just spent time thinking about the stories we want to tell, and we can flex the franchise from both sides. We're excited about telling this story, and hopefully, fans will love this story too."</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day is coming to Xbox and PC on a yet-to-be-announced date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[700,000 People Are Clicking a Banana on Steam to Make Money]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/700-000-people-are-clicking-a-banana-on-steam-to-make-money.902652/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>That’s one of the strangest titles I’ve written in a long time, but it’s the way of the world. In recent days, a bizarre game on Steam has snowballed in popularity – Banana. The premise of this game is that players click on a banana until they earn new bananas. That’s it. But there’s a huge twist at play – users will periodically earn random banana skins (that’s clever) of varying rarities with which they can turn a profit, selling them in Steam’s marketplace to other users.</p>



<p>The problem is, that the developer has recognised that the vast majority of the 700,000 peak players recorded on Banana are bots. With this game using ‘less than 1%’ of your computer’s resources, people are setting up thousands of fake profiles to run this clicking-based game in the hope of securing and selling rare banana skins, which are quickly growing in value.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-secure-the-skins">Secure the Skins</h2>



<p>Presently, the most expensive banana skins to be sold on the marketplace have reached more than $1,000, which is why users with armies of bot accounts are getting involved. In an interview with Polygon, the game’s developer admitted it’s a ‘legal infinite money glitch’, and the team was pondering how long it’ll take before Valve steps in to shut the game down. </p>



<p>Here’s the gameplay loop:</p>



<ul>
<li>Open Banana</li>



<li>Click the on-screen banana</li>



<li>Earn drops</li>



<li>That’s it</li>
</ul>



<p>In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview</a>, the developer confirmed that when the player count was 141,000, only a third of those players were <strong>real</strong>. The rest were bots. While most users are selling their banana skins for single-digit cents, some have made hundreds of dollars through Banana. Also, the developer is pushing the community engagement aspect of the game, stressing that users are contributing their designs to the pot, which is indefinitely increasing the number of banana skins available for unlock.</p>



<p>On Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Banana is ranking higher</a> than Dota 2, PUBG, Apex Legends, and GTA 5 in terms of its overall player count, even if the majority of those ‘players’ are bots driven by auto-clicking functions.</p>



<p>What a world.</p>

<figcaption>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop's first trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUuWZs6HxME" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the video says at the start, RePop lets players choose between "Original mode", which maintains the grindhouse violence of the cult hit original, or the RePop mode which replaces some of that violence with "pop-art damage effects."
</p>
<p>It's one of several changes designed to make RePop the "definitive version of the game", according to producer Yoshimi Yasuda. RePop will also have faster load times, support for 4K resolutions and 60 frames per second.
</p>
<p>RePop was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lollipop-chainsaw-is-getting-a-remake-out-2023">announced back in 2022</a> with a summer 2023 release window, but soon slipped into 2024. We haven't heard much about it since, and what has been shared has been cause for concern. Original developers Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suda51-and-james-gunn-arent-back-for-the-lollipop-chainsaw-remake">aren't involved, and neither is original writer James Gunn</a>, who is fairly busy making superhero movies these days.
</p>
<p>Perhaps most worringly of all, RePop isn't expected to include the original soundtrack, which included licensed songs from Skrillex, The Human League and MSTRKRFT, among many others. Yasuda has said that the original soundtrack will be replaced, and will only include "a few licensed tracks".
</p>
<p>I never played Lollipop Chainsaw at the time, because it seemed the wrong kind of dumb. (For the record, Revengeance and Bayonetta were the right kind of dumb.) It also only got middling reviews, although its style and bombast seem to have earned it a cult following in the years since, like many Grasshopper games. Maybe this September is when I finally give it a go.</p>

            <p>League Of Geeks are going "into hibernation". The Australian developers behind fantasy strategy games such as the animal-themed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armello">Armello</a> and hellish remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/solium-infernum">Solium Infernum</a> said that their remaining staff are going to take an extended break, and they're not sure "when (or if)" they will revive the studio.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"With over 13 years under our belt as an entirely independent studio, and the economic situation in games being what it is right now, we have made the decision to put LoG into hibernation for the foreseeable future and take some extended time off," says <a href="https://leagueofgeeks.com/blog#gone-fishin">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>"The vast majority of our team have moved on to exciting new endeavours and those who remain are going to take a well deserved break over the next few months.
</p>
<p>"We’re not sure when (or if) we will resurrect this great beast, but we’re incredibly proud of all we’ve achieved, both in the experiences we’ve crafted together, the great developers who made LoG a world-class development environment, the peers we inspired along the way, and of course, those community members who believed in what we made, how we made it, and supported us fiercely in those convictions."
</p>
<p>Solium Infernum released earlier this year to strong reviews - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/solium-infernum-review">including our own</a> - but the remake of Cryptic Comet's niche, famously complex roleplaying strategy game has not achieved sales strong enough to fund further development or DLC, League Of Geeks say.
</p>
<p>There were already signs of trouble for League Of Geeks late in 2023, when the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jumplight-odyssey-development-suspended-indefinitely-as-league-of-geeks-face-redundancies">paused development of early access spaceship colony sim Jumplight Odyssey</a> and laid off half the studio. At the time, League Of Geeks cited rising operating costs, the weak Australian dollar, and poor sales, and said they'd be focusing on the then-imminent launch of Solium Infernum as the last best hope of securing the studio's future.
</p>
<p>The announcement of the studio's hibernation confirms that Jumplight Odyssey has "not found workable and timely investment that would reinstate development." Instead they're planning to bring the game out of Early Access in t he next 12 months without the "fully realised v1.0 release" they had orignaly planned.
</p>
<p>"Makin’ videogames is hard, excruciatingly hard these past few years, but the smart, lovely people we got to do it with, both inside LoG and out, made this crazy business worth it every single day."</p>

            <p>The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wizard-with-a-gun">Wizard With A Gun</a> are closing down. Galvanic Games, who released the sandbox survival game last year, said that ongoing sales of the game were not enough to keep the studio going, and they'd run out of time to find funding for a new project.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Despite the promising start of Wizard With A Gun, sales are  not strong enoguh to sustain our studio," said the <a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1801685792416498112">announcement shared on X</a> by company founder Patrick Morgan. "The last year has been particularly tough for games. While we had numerous encouraging conversations at DICE and GDC, the process of signing new projects, even in a good year, takes longer than the runway we had left."
</p>
<p>Wizard With A Gun was published by Devolver Digital, which Morgan described as a "dream come true for us." Morgan also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207451502972477440/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207451502972477440%2C7207451937464569857%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207451937464569857%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207451502972477440%29">shared a post on LinkedIn</a> which points to some of the Galvanic Games team members who will now be looking for work.
</p>
<p>Playable with 1-4 players and with an obvious combat-focus, Wizard With A Gun was also reminiscent of Don't Starve in its camera perspective, art style and collect-and-craft survival mechanics. It seemed to be well received when it launched in October last year, but the game-playing audience is fickle. Wizard With A Gun has a couple of thousand Steam reviews and a very positive rating, compared to the superficially similar Cult Of The Lamb, published by Devolver Digital the previous year, which has over 67k. 
</p>
<p>Galvanic Games released two games before Wizard With A Gun, including futuristic point-and-click Some Distant Memory, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-some-distant-memory">resonated with Katharine as we entered lockdown back in March 2020</a>.

<p data-characters="334" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Life is Strange </em>series is hailed for its impressive storytelling, iconic characters, and emotional impact. From the lighthouse in Arcadia Bay to the record store in Haven Springs, the spaces created for the games are filled to the brim with nostalgic feelings. As the series has grown, so too has the complexity of its timeline.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">Not counting <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>, which is <a href="https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com/en-gb/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">due to come out later this year</a>, the <em>Life is Strange </em>series currently spans about 12 years. However, the choices you make, particularly at the end of the original game, can send this timeline into a spin. Here’s a more organized look at all the <em>Life is Strange </em>games in chronological order.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-farewell-episode-dlc-life-is-strange-before-the-storm" data-injectable="false"><strong>Farewell Episode DLC (Life is Strange: Before the Storm)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2008</p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="760" data-injectable="true">The <em>Life is Strange </em>timeline begins with a pair of departures that impact Max and Chloe, the protagonists of the original two games, for years to come. The episode’s content goes by quickly and can be completed in under an hour. It’s best to play this after playing the original game, but you don’t necessarily have to finish the other parts of <em>Before the Storm </em>first.</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-before-the-storm" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2010</p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><em>Before the Storm </em>is a prequel to the first game that tells the story of Chloe’s relationship with Rachel Amber, the teenager who has gone missing when the events of the original game unfold. Together Chloe and Rachel ditch school, navigate trauma, and uncover family secrets.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2013</p> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">The original <em>Life is Strange </em>game features iconic storytelling, a beautiful soundtrack, and a cast of deeply drawn characters. In addition, Max’s ability to reverse time and change the outcome of every scene gives the player’s decisions serious weight. At the end of your quest to save Arcadia Bay, you’ll make a final critical decision that affects the rest of the universe’s timeline.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-comic-series" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange (Comic Series)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="37" data-current-count="37" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: Starting in 2014</p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://life-is-strange.fandom.com/wiki/Life_is_Strange_(Comic_Series)">comic book tie-in series</a> for the <em>Life is Strange </em>games begins about a year after the events of the first game, and takes place over the course of six story ‘arcs’. In order they are: Dust, Waves, Strings, Tracks, Coming Home, and Settling Dust. The comic series follows the Bae (not Bay) ending of the first game, but is in many ways a divergent timeline from the other games to come. &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-2-episodes-1-amp-2" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange 2: Episodes 1 &amp; 2</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="42" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: October-December 2016</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">The direct sequel game in the series follows two brothers, Sean and Daniel, as they journey south from Washington to the US-Mexico border. When their father is killed by a police officer, Daniel’s telekinesis powers aid the pair in escaping danger.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-awesome-adventures-of-captain-spirit" data-injectable="false"><strong>The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit</strong></h2> <p data-characters="34" data-current-count="34" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: December 2016</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false"><em>Captain Spirit </em>is a short demo game that allows players to learn more about Chris, a side character encountered by Sean and Daniel near the end of the second episode of <em>Life is Strange 2. </em>This chapter in the <em>Life is Strange </em>universe is often forgotten because it’s not as essential to the main story, but it’s worth playing nonetheless.</p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-2-episodes-3-5" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange 2: Episodes 3-5</strong></h2> <p data-characters="45" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">Year it takes place: December 2016- June 2017</p>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">The conclusion to Sean and Daniel’s story occurs over the course of many months, but also features flashbacks that bring players back to events that occur before the game starts.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-wavelengths-dlc-life-is-strange-true-colors" data-injectable="false"><strong>Wavelengths DLC (Life is Strange: True Colors)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

In many ways, this DLC is just as much a sequel for <em>Before the Storm </em>as it is a prequel for <em>True Colors.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-true-colors" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: True Colors</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

There are plenty of twists and turns here, and Alex’s superpower fits her story remarkably well.</p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-double-exposure" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="28" data-current-count="28" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: Unknown</p> <p data-characters="551" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">In <em>Double Exposure</em>, the original protagonist of the series Max Caulfield makes a welcome return. This time, we’ll be opening parallel universes in an attempt save her friend Safi. It’s apparent from Max’s character design in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOYz4NCFIXg">the reveal trailer</a> that several years have passed since the first game, and we know that she’s a photographer in residence at a university, but for now, the exact dates for the events of this game are unknown. From what we can see, however, it seems likely that this game is the furthest forward in the timeline.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-how-many-life-is-strange-games-are-there" data-injectable="false">How Many Life is Strange Games Are There?</h3> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Counting <em>Double Exposure</em>, which comes out October 29th, 2024, there are six games in the Life is Strange universe. However, the original <em>Life is Strange </em>and <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm </em>are available together as a single remastered collection on select consoles.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-which-life-is-strange-game-should-i-play-first" data-injectable="false">Which Life is Strange Game Should I Play First?</h3> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="false">If you are new to the series, the original <em>Life is Strange </em>is undoubtedly the best place to start. If you’re looking to relive the series, playing the games in timeline order can provide a unique and refreshing experience.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">From speedrunning to interesting mods to porting the games in unusual ways, <em>Doom</em> persists because it transcends the pixelated world built by its original developers. Now that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-the-dark-ages-takes-doomguy-back-to-his-days-as-a-sentinel/"><em>The Dark Ages</em> has been announced</a>, id Software’s iconic series is once again in the public eye.</p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">Although, it never really stopped being part of the wider gaming conversation. As a series, <em>Doom</em> has not only survived against an ever-changing industry, but has stayed relevant and continues to be successful. Sure, there was a period where it felt like it may not ever make a glorious comeback, but it’s stuck around because somebody needs to keep the demons of hell at bay.</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="true">With the new game on the horizon, I thought it was time to remind ourselves just where it all began. This <strong>brief history of <em>Doom</em></strong> aims to reflect on the early days and how it’s managed to remain impactful after three decades. And for once, I will make sure I don’t talk about how old all this makes me feel (this sentence notwithstanding, of course).</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-beginning-of-an-era" data-injectable="false">The beginning of an era</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="589" data-current-count="889" data-injectable="true">Let me say this first to just get it out the way: the original <em>Doom</em> was not the first ever FPS to be developed and released. That title doesn’t even go to <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, which came out the year before and was also created by id Software. You need to go way further back than the 90s. According to <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/95409-first-first-person-shooter-fps-videogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guinness World Records</a>, the first ever first-person shooter was <em>Maze War</em>, which came out in 1973. Much of what came during this period has largely been pushed to the wayside thanks to time, but it’s a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-complete-history-of-first-person-shooters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fascinating read</a> if you’re ever in the mood for a gaming history lesson.</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">The genre has only been growing ever since those heady days, but it was the original <em>Doom</em> (and, to some extent, <em>Wolfenstein</em>) that popularized 3D gaming, especially in the guise of a newfangled thing called an “FPS”. <a href="https://in.ign.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/134891/feature/most-impactful-fps-games-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> referred to the 1993 release as the “father” of the modern shooter, noting its fast-paced action and mindless violence, which would eventually catch the attention of fans and the media (see also: <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100412024424/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979298,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat</a></em>).</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">A sequel – <em>Doom 2: Hell on Earth</em> – was released in 1994, which kept much of its predecessor’s aesthetics and mechanics, but added in new monsters and weapons, including the now-legendary Super Shotgun. An expansion called <em>Master Levels</em> was released in 1995, as was an updated version of the first game called <em>Ultimate Doom</em>.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="true">While the two main entries alone solidified their place in PC gaming history, it was arguably the 1993 OG that had the most impact. Since then, these classics have been ported across many platforms over multiple generations, which also includes some pretty <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/literally-mow-down-demons-as-doom-comes-to-this-robotic-lawnmower/">gnarly ports of the origina</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sink-your-teeth-into-a-port-of-doom-playing-on-a-smart-toothbrush/">l <em>Doom</em></a>. As such, getting hold of a copy of the old <em>Doom</em> games is not exactly hard. Accessibility is probably one of the reasons we’re still talking about these retro titles to this day.</p>
 <h2 id="h-that-wobbly-bit-in-the-middle" data-injectable="false">That wobbly bit in the middle</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="860" data-injectable="true">Had <em>Doom</em> stopped in the mid-1990s, with two critically acclaimed releases under its belt, it would still have left its mark on the industry, given how influential it’s been. It led to the evolution of the first-person shooter, which seemed to tie in nicely with advances in gaming technology. Without it, we probably wouldn’t have <em>Quake</em> (another banger from id Software), which implemented full 3D models, <em>Half-Life</em>, which changed the way FPS narratives were told, or <em>Unreal</em>, which brought about visuals that were seen as unprecedented at the time.</p>
 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">But <em>Doom</em> carried on. In 1997, a Nintendo 64 game was released. Because it was locked to a single console, it didn’t have as wide an impact as its predecessors at the time. It has, however, gone down as something of a cult hit. It also wasn’t developed by id – instead being helmed by Midway, which was also responsible for bringing <em>Quake</em> to the N64 – but it wasn’t a port, either. Instead, it was its own standalone release with a new story that aimed to carry the baton for the original entries.</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Then things went quiet for a few years, until <em>Doom 3</em> launched in 2004. Now, technically <em>Final Doom</em> (released in 1996) was the third main installment, but you can class that as part of the first era of the series. I do, at least. Also, it was developed by the now-defunct TeamTNT. So for argument’s sake, we’ll say the third game was the early 2000s one.</p> <p data-characters="663" data-current-count="1028" data-injectable="true">Things had moved on in the FPS genre at this point. <em>Half-Life 2</em> was yet to come out, but <em>Halo</em> had been kicking about the place for a few years and was something of a game-changer. As such, <em>Doom 3</em> had to be pretty special to stand out. And stand out it did, but maybe not to everyone’s tastes, for it swapped out the high-octane action for something more horror-based (though it still had action). Maybe not everyone liked this direction the series had gone in (personally, I did), but it kept the <em>Doom</em> name in the limelight. At least for a little while. It also made use of the then-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">id Tech 4 engine</a>, so it had some pretty advanced visuals for the time.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-great-comeback" data-injectable="false">The great comeback</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">Look, for the sake of brevity, I’m skipping a few details here. In the interim before the big reboot, we got <em>Doom Resurrection</em> – which was an attempt to turn the franchise into a survival horror – as well as a couple of <em>Doom</em> RPGs (yes, seriously). But outside these, there wasn’t a lot going on until <em>Doom 2016</em> made an appearance.</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">Many of you are probably aware of this already, but for those who aren’t, we very nearly got a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-4-was-canceled-because-it-felt-too-much-like-call-of-duty/"><em>Call of Duty</em>-style <em>Doom</em> game</a> at one point. During the development of a fourth installment in the mid-2000s, parent company Zenimax pulled the plug and instead asked the studio to do a reboot of the series. And that was what we got in the end. You can see early footage from the cancelled project below.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Unreleased DOOM 4 [cancelled] &amp; DOOM 2016 Development Gameplay" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uvb04gU_UmU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true"><em>Doom 2016</em> was such a success because it was a return to those glory days of the 90s when it was all about the insane action, the brutal violence, and the sheer chaotic spectacle of it all. Sure, it was visually on par with the modern era, but it retained a lot of that fast-paced shooting that many of us grew up with thanks to the classics. It was also nice to play something where you felt like the most dangerous one among a horde of bloodthirsty monsters. Power fantasies, man.</p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><em>Doom Eternal</em> came in 2020, right before much of the world went into lockdown I hasten to add, and was as well-received as the previous game. Having recently replayed it myself, I think <em>Eternal</em> is great but has a number of flaws that stop it from being on the same pedestal as the 2016 reboot (first-person platforming, anyone?). Whatever your thoughts, <em>Doom</em> was truly back, and we now know it’s not going away any time soon.</p>
 <h2 id="h-and-here-we-are" data-injectable="false">And here we are</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via id Software/Steam.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">I’ll admit, I don’t quite know how to feel about <em>The Dark Ages</em>. On the one hand, it’s a new entry in the continued success of one of gaming’s most influential series. On the other, a third installment can be tricky to pull off, retaining what made the previous entries special while keeping things fresh. Generally, I like to think I’m keen to try it out when it releases next year.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">But it represents one more chapter in the <em>Doom</em> saga, a timeline that stretches back to the mid-1990s, when fresh-faced developers like John Carmack and John Romero were cutting their teeth in a relatively new industry. Not many other franchises can say they can comfortably keep the lights on for a solid 30+ years. Of course, id Software is not the studio it was back in the day, with people departing and new teams forming, but it counts itself as one of the big developers.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">But the fact is, the story of <em>Doom</em> is one that will live on for a very long time. Who knows for how long, really? But there’s a reason why the name crops up in lists of the most influential or <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most impactful FPS games</a> of all time. That goes for both the classics and the modern reboot. Both old and new are typically amongst some of the best in the business, and that’s not an easy feat.</p> <figure data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 1 (4K) | Coming 2025" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Many of us grew up playing the earlier games, so to see <em>Doom</em> still kicking it decades later is like a parent watching with pride as their child makes it in the big, wide world. When some young programmers and designers from Louisiana got together to start making games, there’s no way any of them could possibly have visualized just how far that ambition would take them.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="852" data-injectable="false">I don’t want to get too sentimental or hero worship-y about all this, because it is just a game, after all. Had <em>Doom</em> never come to fruition, would another name have emerged and we’d be talking about that instead? We’ll never know, but this is the timeline we’re living in and id Software is a studio that will forever be associated with thrusting the first-person shooter into the mainstream. Here’s hoping <em>The Dark Ages</em> can continue the legacy.</p>

			<p>2023 was a memorable year for fans of RPG titles, and the foreseeable future looks brighter than ever after the recent Summer Game Fest event. The biggest contribution comes arguably from Xbox Game Studios, thanks to Microsoft's investments in some of the most successful RPG studios and franchises. But there's a lot more coming to market - let's take a look at the next couple of years, beginning with the latter half of 2024.</p>
<p>In the action/soulslike (or lite) subgenre, players can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-preview-the-erdtrees-light-casts-the-longest-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> (out next week), the one and only expansion to 2022's game of the year. We've already said so much about this one that it's not worth dwelling too much on it, but feel free to check out our recent hands-on preview in case you missed it.</p>
<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-hands-on-preview-enjoyable-soulslite-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: Siege of Dawn</a>, the new game from Ashen developer A44. Its fantasy world mixes magic and supernatural with firearms while taking visual cues from the studio's home country of New Zealand. The 'wide linear' game will be released on July 18, and Game Pass subscribers will get it as a complimentary addition to their library on day one.</p>
<p>Just over a month later, Chinese developer Game Science has scheduled its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong.</a> This is a reinterpretation of the classical 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West. Players will be asked to play as the monkey-like 'Destined One' creature, who sets on a journey across beautiful landscapes to uncover the truth behind an old mystery. To defeat his many foes, designed out of Chinese mythology, the Destined One will have to master his staff's techniques while also wielding spells and abilities and acquiring powerful gear.</p>
<p>Another action RPG scheduled for August is <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Mana</a> by Square Enix. In this game, players explore a semi-open world with a party of three characters, all of whom can be directly controlled. Each character has different combat classes, which can be unlocked by acquiring items called Spirit Vessels and can be changed at will, giving them access to new abilities and powerful attacks called Class Strikes.</p>
<p>Going back to the soulslite genre, Italian developer Jyamma Games has set a September 19 date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-gets-another-short-delay-demo-out-next-week-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enotria: The Last Song.</a> Far removed from the gloomy atmospheres championed by FromSoftware, Enotria takes place in a sunny world inspired by Southern Italy, though that doesn't mean there aren't ominous enemies to conquer. You can play an updated demo right now on Steam.</p>
<p>Fans of Japanese-made RPGs will get their highlight in October when Atlus plans to launch the long-awaited new IP <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. With turn-based combat inspired by Persona and a medieval fantasy world called the United Kingdom of Euchronia that somehow mirrors the modern world, the game will also allow players to develop intimate relationships with their&nbsp;character's companions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Vampire-the-Masquerade-Bloodlines-2-Stare-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Gamers who prefer Western-style roleplaying games will undoubtedly find what they're looking for between these four heavy-hitters: Obsidian's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-new-trailer-but-still-has-no-final-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, BioWare's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, Warhorse's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-gorgeous-new-saints-sinners-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a>, and The Chinese Room's <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sees-its-debut-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines II</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous titles mentioned in this article, these four underline the R in RPG by allowing players to shape the world around them and the storylines through choice-based gameplay, potentially leading to major differences and even multiple endings.</p>
<p>Despite this similarity, there are some key differences. Avowed, set in the fantasy world of Eora (previously seen in the Pillars of Eternity games), can be played in either first-person or third-person view. It features a party of three characters, although the action is focused on the main character and there is no tactical pause. However, players can quickly swap their loadout in combat as required by the situation, switching from a two-handed ax to a sword and a Grimoire, for example. While interacting with companions and befriending them is a major part of the game, there won't be any romance.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard takes place in the fantasy world of Thedas, following more or less directly from the plot of 2014's Inquisition. The game is played from a fairly close third-person camera to enhance immersion. Like in Avowed, the party size is three; however, The Veilguard lets you pause the action and issue orders to your companions to activate specific skills against the targets on the battlefield, potentially enabling devastating combos. The game also allows players to romance any of the seven companions, regardless of the main character's race or gender, and there will even be some nudity.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance II, on the other hand, is set in a purely medieval world, more specifically, 15th-century Bohemia. Unlike the previous two RPGs, this one is not party-based and features a fixed protagonist (the same as the first installment), Henry from Skalitz, who's on a revenge mission against Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, responsible for the destruction of his village and the death of his parents. Kingdom Come Deliverance II is only available in first-person view. Moreover, its unique directional combat system certainly sets its apart from the other games, though the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-says-combat-will-be-more-accessible-explains-why-the-game-still-uses-cryengine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it will be a bit more accessible.</p>
<p>The last of the Big Four Western RPGs in 2024, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines II is also the one that raised the most concerns due to its highly troubled development phase. A new studio (The Chinese Room) was brought in following the split with Hardsuit Labs, but they don't exactly have a track record in the genre. Anyway, like Kingdom Come Deliverance II the game is played in first-person view and does not rely on companions. Players will step in the shoes of an Elder vampire who was mysteriously put into slumber for over a century. They'll be able to choose gender, appearance, backstory, and clan, the latter of which will influence the kind of powers and abilities at their disposal. Clans Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue will be playable at launch, with two more set to be added later.</p>
<p>Finally, cRPG fans will want to take note of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-is-a-gorgeous-fantasy-steampunk-crpg-in-development-at-a-new-ukrainian-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Arc Line</a>, a steampunk/fantasy turn-based game from Ukrainian indie studio Dreamate Games. It's slated to launch later this year.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fable-trailer-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, roleplaying game aficionados can look forward to many interesting projects even going into 2025 and beyond. At Summer Game Fest 2024, Playground <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that its Fable reboot (<a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed</a> with the collaboration of Eidos Montreal) would launch at some point next year, and the in-engine trailer certainly had fans excited to return to the city of Bowerstone after a long time.</p>
<p>We didn't see it at this Summer Game Fest, but last year inXile's steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution made a big impression with a gameplay trailer, and a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-ace-combat-8-squadron-42-and-gearboxs-next-game-all-target-2025-launch-according-to-actors-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> it may indeed launch in 2025.</p>
<p>Next year is also when Spiders plans to release GreedFall: The Dying World out of early access. This game has transitioned from action to tactical gameplay; you can read more about that <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-hands-on-preview-swapping-places-with-dragon-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the fresh preview.</a> The Gothic Remake is also currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> to launch by March 2025 at the latest, with more information likely coming this August at gamescom. Indie game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, also slated for 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitely caught our attention</a> at Summer Game Fest thanks to its unique setting and mix of turn-based and real-time combat. Lastly,</p>
<p>Finally, Q4 2025 is the expected launch window for Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy, the new fantasy cRPG from the makers of the old Fallout-style games Atom and Atom: Trudograd. The game was crowdfunded last month <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/atomrpg/swordhaven-iron-conspiracy?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Swordhaven" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Kickstarter</a> and will enter early access in Q4 2024.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Elder-Scrolls-VI-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Looking at 2026 and farther into the future, there's a few triple-A RPG titles already lined up: the remake of The Witcher, in development at Fool's Theory; the new The Witcher 4 game, in development at CD Projekt RED, just like the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel; Bethesda's Elder Scrolls VI and Fallout 5; BioWare's new Mass Effect; and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2. On the AA spectrum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/outward-2-qa-director-says-sequel-is-a-few-years-away-will-be-just-as-cruel-obscure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outward 2</a> is also worth mentioning, as well as the indie Daggerfall-inspired <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wayward-realms-kickstarter-qa-there-are-plenty-of-ways-to-advance-procedural-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wayward Realms</a>, which was just funded on Kickstarter. Many more games will doubtless be announced over time, but even with just those listed here, fans of roleplaying games will have thousands of hours worth spending in these increasingly lifelike virtual worlds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-atlus-enhanced-edition-ranked-shin-megami-tensei-5-vengeance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance<em> </em>is finally here! Branded by developer ATLUS as the “definitive” version of the game, it promises to expand on the original with iterated mechanics, new characters, and a new storyline that revolves around the Qadištu faction; which consists of demonic women who, depending on who you ask, are either evil or are wrongfully scorned by society. This game seems to be an expansion at all costs, though, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-5-to-be-delisted-from-nintendo-eshop-next-month"><u>ATLUS is delisting the original Shin Megami Tensei V from the Nintendo eShop on June 13th</u></a>. This has left many questioning ATLUS’s penchant for releasing enhanced versions of their games and if they’re always good enough to merit the soft erasure of the original version of the game.  </p><p>That’s why this article is going to dig into every enhanced version of a game in ATLUS’s discography, and sort them from worst to best for some added fun. ATLUS has a long history of releasing games this way, and there have been both missteps and back steps in crafting rereleases that truly improve upon the base game. By looking at what’s worked and what hasn't, it’ll become easier to evaluate Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance as a new take on the original, rather than assume it’s the new and improved version of the original title. </p><p>As a clerical note before kicking this list off, ports from one platform to another do not count as an enhanced edition and will not be included in this list. There has to be a significant material change beyond the device the game runs on for a game to meet the “enhanced” criteria. So the likes of the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection will not be included here, but the reimaginings of the first two Etrian Odyssey games for the Nintendo 3DS will be discussed. </p><h3><strong>19. Growlanser (remake)</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2012/01/19/growlanser-iv-wayfarer-of-time-20120118052459104-3589750.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Growlanser series of games are a consequence of the Career Soft division of Mayasa Games split away from the Mayasa brand, and partnered with ATLUS to create a spiritual successor to the still ongoing Langrisser franchise. They’re tactical RPGs with a distinctly shojo visual style, and the entire franchise is viewed as a bit of a cult classic by people who are, both, way into anime and tactics games. </p><p>The Growlanser enhanced remake for the PSP is at the bottom of this list, though, because it <strong>BIZARRELY </strong>was never released outside of Japan. Growlanser 2, 3, and 4 were all localized but, in spite of their mixed to favorable reception, the Growlanswer enhanced remake remained a Japan-only title. As there’s no legitimate way to play this title outside of Japan, it can’t be discussed further or evaluated higher. </p><h3><strong>18. Persona 2: Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment for the PSP</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Persona 2 duology (treated here as a single entry as this is already a pretty long list) has always been a bit of a black sheep in the Persona series. While segments of the older fanbase love it for its queer themes, catching art direction, and distinct setting; the games never really got </p><p>a fair shake outside of Japan. </p><p>The original version of the first game, Innocent Sin, was never released outside of Japan; making the second game, Eternal Punishment, the international entry point. This was flipped for the PSP enhanced remakes, though, where the upgraded version of Innocent Sin was available globally but not Eternal Punishment. Honestly, these games are in desperate need of Persona 3: Reload style remakes, and hopefully this lower ranking will encourage that kind of updated release. </p><h3><strong>17. Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/08/06/etrianodysseyuntold21600jpg-67c0e1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Etrian Odyssey series is made up of some of the best games around for dungeon crawling sickos. In a similar vein to Square Enix’s Dungeon Encounters, the Etrian Odyssey games heavily prioritize gameplay loops like exploring and mapping dungeons, turn based combat, and managing the economy of running a guild over any kind of narrative. Which is why it’s strange that the enhanced edition of Etrian Odyssey 2 tacks on story mode that detracts from the focus of the original title. </p><p>There’s a reason that ATLUS decided to use the base versions of the first two Etrian Odyssey games for the recent Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection, and it's because the “enhanced” part of Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight feels more like an ancillary add-on than something that builds upon the game’s strong points. </p><h3><strong>16. Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Everything about the enhanced version of Etrian Odyssey 2<em> </em>is applicable for the enhanced version of<em> </em>Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl, which also focuses on story content. So, go re-read that first paragraph and a half if you want a quick rundown of why this title is also fairly low on this list. </p><p>The Millennium Girl<em> </em>beatus out The Fafnir Knight, though, because this 3DS enhanced edition actually scored a few Metacritic points higher than its original version. Whether this is a statistical quirk or an indication of genuine improvement is unclear, but that’s enough of a reason to rank The Millennium Girl one slot higher than its sequel. </p><h3><strong>15. Catherine: Full Body</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/09/23/03-1537680347210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Catherine series is a bit of a minefield. On the one hand, it’s action-puzzler gameplay, adult cast of characters, and supernatural murder mystery plot make it feel like it was tailor made for older Persona 4 fans. On the other hand, many objected to the casual bigotry levied towards trans characters in the original release, and trans and gender nonconforming characters in the Full Body enhanced edition.    </p><p>In fairness, plenty of people did find the gender expression of the marginalized characters in both versions of Catherine to be inspiring too. However, this game is also a prime example of ATLUS’s on-again, off-again, “more is better” enhanced edition philosophy; where over-encumbering a game with more story and levels is treated as a superior experience. Bigger, of course, does not always equate to better and this added material detracts from the tighter experience of the original Catherine.</p><h3><strong>14. Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/06/16/wiiugeneiibunrokufescrn03e3jpg-bfd659.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>As a crossover between Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei games with a focus on idol culture, Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE<em> </em>is a game made for very specific segment of the gaming audience. Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore<em> </em>does a solid job building upon the original, even if piled on characters and story content can feel like it’s putting a hat on top of a hat. </p><p>The US and Japanese release of this game were mired in a bit of controversy, though, which knocks it down a few ranks on this list. Tokyo Mirage Sessions is the source of the infamous “vagina bones” meme, which is both hilarious out of context and still potent shorthand for localization changes around the sexualization of characters. Additionally, all versions of Encore were based on the Western version of the original game, meaning that the more risque content of the Japanese version of the original did not appear in any version of the enhanced edition.</p><p>While that content is definitely a weird thing to be left on the cutting room floor, removing material whole cloth definitely works against the idea of an “enhanced” edition of a game. </p><h3><strong>13. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor is a tactics based spin-off of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise for the Nintendo DS. Think Persona 5 Tactica, but with an original cast of characters. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked<em> </em>is an enhanced port for the Nintendo 3DS, that adds the compendium mechanic featured in most mainline games, and even adds voice acting! </p><p>While these more deliberate and mechanically focused add ons are in the spirit of what make enhanced versions of games worthwhile, they don’t quite work cohesively in Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked. In fact, the enhanced version of this title actually has an aggregate review score that’s a few points lower than the original version of the game, so it falls to the bottom half of this list. </p><h3><strong>12. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/12/10/smt-record-breaker-desu2jpg-8775bf.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The sequel to Devil Survivor, aptly named Devil Survivor 2, also got an enhanced edition in the form of Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker. While this 3DS enhanced edition did mostly boil down to additional content after the original game’s ending, this enhanced edition was reviewed more favorably than its base version. Between this higher critical reception, and the fact that characters from the Durarara!! anime inexplicably appeared as DLC characters in the enhanced edition, Record Breaker<em> </em>narrowly beats out Overclocked on this list. </p><h3><strong>11. Persona 5: Royal</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/04/24/persona-5-royal-1556114898757.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>For as much as Persona 5: Royal is seen as the definitive version of the game that brought mainstream acclaim to the long running series, it actually exacerbates some of the original’s biggest issues. While it’s great to spend more time with Akechi after he outs himself as a lil freak, and Sumire’s storyline is certainly moving; Royal tacks on at least fifteen hours of gameplay to a title that already bridged into a triple digit runtime. </p><p>While both Persona 5 and Royal are great games, the pacing and repetitive writing are low points and Royal’s tacked on third semester can make the game feel like even more of a slog. While more of a great video game sounds ideal on paper, it’s not as appealing when most of the additional content doesn’t address underlying issues. I’ve said it before, but when it comes to Shin Megami Tensei games, there’s a difference between “more” and “enhanced” and that’s why Royal is in the middle of the pack in this ranking. </p><h3><strong>10. Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/07/1-1496872814814.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux<em> </em>is a pretty standard enhanced edition as far as ATLUS games go. There are some new demons, quality of life changes, an additional dungeon, and a new character that also brings some new endings. What makes Redux a better than average ATLUS enhanced edition is the timing of its release more than its content, though. </p><p>SMT: Strange Journey Redux came to the 3DS a little over a year after the original version of Persona 5, and about seven months after the release of the Nintendo Switch. So not only did it capitalize on the growing interest in the broader SMT franchise, but it also breathed a last bit of life into a sunsetting console. It’s important to remember that “enhanced editions” of games are, on some level, marketing tactics; and Redux deserves props for releasing as interest was peaking and on a ubiquitous piece of hardware about to fall into irrelevancy.</p><h3><strong>9. Maken Shao: Demon Sword</strong></h3><p>Maken X is a hack and slash game for the Dreamcast and was also the directorial debut of Katsura Hashino, who would go on to direct Persona 3, 4, and 5. The game also received a manga adaptation by Q Hayashida, the famed mangaka behind series like Dorohedoro and Dai Dark. </p><p>While Maken X received a mixed at best reception, the Maken Shao: Demon Sword enhanced edition earns a higher spot on this list by transforming the first person action game into a third person action game. While the enhanced edition doesn’t quite come together cohesively, this change had to be a massive undertaking and offers the kind of refreshed experience that makes enhanced editions worthwhile. </p><h3><strong>8. Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/08/18/shin-megami-tensei-iii-nocturne-hd-remaster-51125672274-o-1629329279415.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Did you know that the version of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne that most people outside of Japan are familiar with is actually an enhanced version of the game? Dubbed the Maniax edition and often referred to as a Director’s Cut, and included the famed cameo of Dante from the Devil May Cry series. This version of the game also featured the enhanced difficulty that the title, and future SMT games, would become known for. </p><p>Is it a little weird to include an enhanced edition that most people know as the default version of the game so high up on this list? Yes, but also Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax<em> </em>got the ball rolling for the slowing growing popularity of the SMT and Persona franchises, so Maniax deserves this recognition and praise. </p><h3><strong>7. Persona 3: FES</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/12/18/persona-3-wallpaper-hdjpg-c73627.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: FES is the first enhanced edition of Persona 3, and is the first time a Persona title got this kind of upgrade. Today it can more or less be viewed as the template from which later enhanced editions of their games would draw upon. FES adds story content beyond the ending of the original game, and cleans up a lot of backend technical issues. </p><p>While FES is a rock solid foundation from which ATLUS has developed their enhanced game identity, there are better versions of Persona 3 that you can play right now and therefore this game falls a bit short of the top five on this list. </p><h3><strong>6. Persona 3: Reload</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/21/persona3reloadaigistrailer-ign-blogroll-1700577589695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: Reload has enough graphical changes and quality of life improvements to make it as much of an enhanced edition as it is a remake of the original game. Also, with ‘The Answer’<em> </em>content from FES on the horizon as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-dlc-announced-xbox-partner-preview"><u>DLC</u></a>, it’s  starting to feel more like a refresh of the enhanced edition than just a remake of the original game. This version of Persona 3 is far and away the easiest way for fans to experience the title that would influence the franchise for more than a decade to come. </p><p>That being said, some of the changes in Reload work against the intent of the original game. Reload borrowers the peppier visuals of Persona 5, which undermine the melancholic tone and themes of the original game. This enhanced version makes the game more approachable, but less distinct, and an enhanced version of a game should build a title up rather than squeeze it into a popular mold. </p><h3><strong>5. Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Radiant Historia<em> </em>was a rock solid turn based role playing game that had the misfortune of releasing internationally in 2011, when global interest in those kinds of games was at an all time low. This means that, despite resoundingly positive reviews, not many played the title; making it a prime candidate for an enhanced edition that could give it another chance to shine. </p><p>Perfect Chronology for the 3DS does just that while also adding animation from the famed A-1 Pictures studio, voice acting, and quality of life changes that sped up gameplay. Sure, the new story content felt a bit tacked on, but it’s difficult to pick up on that if you aren’t familiar with the original release. Ultimately, Perfect Chronology does exactly what an enhanced version of a game should; which is to further polish what worked in the original and build upon the momentum of the previous release to take a title to even greater heights. </p><h3><strong>4. Persona 4: Golden</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/28/nintendoswitch-persona4golden-screenshot-2-1656445494022.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 4: Golden is one of the best enhanced editions of a game ATLUS has ever made because I can’t think of a single reason why someone should play the base version over this edition. Does the added story content pad out the runtime? Yes, but the game can still be beaten in around 80 hours, which is the sweet spot for these kinds of sprawling RPGs. Golden also adds new cutscenes and character interactions, which is more than welcome for a game that thrives on the quality of its character writing. </p><p>Chances are, though, that you already knew that Persona 4: Golden<em> </em>was one of the best enhanced games in ATLUS’s catalog. Even as the Persona 5 games have become the new hotness and many people’s gateway into the franchise, Golden remains the gold standard in which all other ATLUS games are measured. </p><h3><strong>3. Shin Megami Tensei: Persona for the PSP</strong></h3><p>The PSP remake of the original Persona game, titled Revelations: Persona on the PS1, is definitely a strange pick for one of ATLUS’s best enhanced editions, but it’s here for good reason. Did you know that only half of the original Persona game was ever released in the US? No, this isn’t a Persona 2 situation where a sequel/prequel was left unlocalized; half of the story in the first Persona game was removed in the Western release! </p><p>Dubbed the Snow Queen route, this storyline leans into the urban legends elements that would go on to make the Persona franchise so endearing. With this content restored in the PSP enhanced edition of Persona, the game is made complete and becomes even more of a gem that new fans should check out. The game’s more grounded, biblical apocalypse setting still feels novel today and this version of the game enhances the base game more than any other title on this list. </p><h3><strong>2. Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/04/27/5jpg-652ae5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>What happens when one of the best games made by ATLUS and Vanillawear gets an enhanced edition? It becomes arguably the best game to come out of either studio. Odin Sphere was a cult classic that was deeply influential to all who played it, as evident by American folk band sensation The Mountain Goat’s hidden track, “Enoch 18:14”<em> </em>on The Life of the World to Come album. Leifthrasir brought the action RPG to a broader audience as the best version of itself. </p><p>In a departure from most other enhanced editions on this list, Leifthrasir makes no story changes to the base game and instead focuses on graphical improvements and refining gameplay systems. In perfectly recognizing what worked and the base game and what could be refined, Leifthrasir is the ideal of what an enhanced edition of a game should be, and is only by an enhanced edition that goes well above and beyond what is reasonable for this kind of release. </p><h3><strong>1. Persona 3: Portable</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/10/xbox-game-pass-in-january-2023-1673360336609.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: Portable<em> </em>lets you play as a girl and date the male cast characters present in the game. While that might sound like a small change, it’s actually a fairly large undertaking from a writing and coding perspective and is probably the reason enhanced editions of later Persona games haven’t had that feature. However, this change indicates that the team behind it knew exactly what was appealing about the original Persona 3, and enhances that experience without any form of detraction. </p><p>The main appeal of Persona 3, or any of the modern Persona titles, are the characters. In playing the game you get to experience some of the best character writing in the games medium, and you’re left wanting more time and new experiences with these characters by the end of it. P3P does just that, as giving the player the option to play the game with a character of a different gender identity, lets you see new sides of established characters and connect to them in different ways. </p><p>Between this brilliant recontextualization of the game and some battle mechanic updates to make it play more similarly to Person 4, Persona 3 Portable is the best enhanced edition that ATLUS has ever put out. While it would be a phenomenal undertaking for ATLUS to iterate upon other games to this degree for future enhanced editions, no game better encapsulates everything associated with that kind of release than Persona 3 Portable. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Be sure to check out IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review">review of Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</a> for our take on the most recent Atlus expanded re-release.
