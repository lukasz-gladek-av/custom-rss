            <p>Betting sponsorships are being introduced into tier one Valorant and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> esports, Riot Games has revealed.</p>
<p>This announcement <a href="https://x.com/riotgames/status/1938282007148253261">came in the form of a lengthy post by John Needham</a>, head of publishing and esports at Riot Games. In it, Needham justifies the inclusion of sports betting as part of the company's desire to build "a sustainable ecosystem" for its games.</p>
<p>Needham said this is something professional teams "have been asking us to consider for years". Gambling sponsors will be permitted across the Americas and EMEA regions, with no stated plans to permit these sorts of sponsorships among other regions around the world.</p>

<p>Needham goes on to explain: "We know sports betting isn't for everyone, and that some fans have strong feelings about it, and we respect that. However, the reality is that betting activity already exists around our sports and will continue whether we engage with it or not."</p>
<p>He continued: "Historically, this has been a restricted sponsorship category, and Riot has not engaged with betting companies. Teams have asked us to reconsider our stance, and after years of analysis to ensure we got it right, we agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams."</p>
<p>Needham goes on to explain that, according to sports technology company Sportradar, total betting turnover in just League of Legends esports exceeded $10.7bn, with 70 percent of those bets taking place on unregulated sites via unlicensed bookmakers. As such, it is Riot's position from here on out that if betting is going to happen, it may as well happen under its watch.</p>
<p>Needham also established three "guardrails" for its new sports betting partnership program. These include opening up sponsorship opportunities with betting brands to generate revenue, supporting the development of regulations and education programs around esports betting, and strengthening competitive integrity around Riot's esports events.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It's worth noting that recently the tier two Valorant scene was in the midst of a serious competitive integrity scandal, as Sean Gares, general manager of esports team Shopify Rebels, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-hHuBN27Nk&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=seangares">released a video exposing </a>the prevalence of match-fixing and the intentional throwing of games.</p>
<p>In the post Needham then stated Riot would be vetting all betting partners, mandate team integrity checks, and that it would use the proceeds of these betting partnerships to maintain its tier two competitive scene. That tier two scene being an aspect of the wider Riot esports space that has struggled immensely with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23619393/disguised-toast-twitch-streamer-valorant-dsg">financial stability</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Needham assured the public that no Riot-owned broadcasts would feature advertisements for betting companies. A nice stance, though it's worth noting that <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-casters-viewership-results-worlds-2024">according to a report by esports charts</a>, 40 percent of English speaking viewership for Worlds (the biggest annual event for League of Legends) come from co-streams. These aren't Riot-owned, and judging by Needham's statement won't be barred from taking betting sponsorships.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>many esports watchers spectate events with streamers like this, rather than directly. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Twitch / Caedrel</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Okay, so why is this happening? Well, as you may or may not know, esports has largely been a hole in which you burn money in. It has historically struggled with generating profit. It has long been true that esports has been sold as a way to reach a younger audience to plenty of massive companies, many of them have since pulled back from the industry <a href="https://digiday.com/media/how-the-worlds-most-ambitious-esports-league-shrank-to-nothing-an-oral-history-of-the-overwatch-league/">following the collapse of the Overwatch League</a>.</p>
<p>Add on top of this an increase in expansion and investment during Covid when interest in gaming was incredibly high. This growth did not continue as expected, leading to a real financial crisis for the esports sector <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2024/03/esports-layoff-tracker-2024">with layoffs hitting the sector in the years </a>following. If you've been paying attention to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">ongoing game development layoffs these past years</a>, it's a similar thing.</p>
<p>But it's actually worse. The problem is that throughout all these years esports teams have either failed to, or ignored the need to, use the money they had to create a stable income revenue. If you release a game, you can sell the game itself or microtransactions. If you own an esports team, you sell… T-shirts? All the games are streamed online for free, you don't have the equivalent of a football stadium. It's dire.</p>
<p>As such esports teams have essentially spent the last few years hopping from one wallet to another, looking for capital to stay afloat. With the speculative investors walking out the door, they've turned to the Saudi Arabian government and its Esports World Cup in recent years. Saudi Arabia, a country with <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">an ongoing history of human rights abuses</a>, also happens to have a lot of money, and is keen on spending it on PR to make the country look appealing. This is called Sportswashing: it's prevalent in football, F1, and yes, video games.</p>
<p>But even this isn't sustainable. Saudi Arabia could twist the money faucet off any time it wants to, and given the country will be <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/inaugural-olympic-esports-games-to-be-held-in-riyadh-in-2027-road-to-the-games-to-start-this-year">hosting the video game olympics starting in 2027</a>, maybe the need to throw away so much money will lessen.</p>
<p>So esports teams need another source of income: gambling. As you can see yourself in Needham's statement, it repeatedly mentions the push from the teams themselves to implement betting sponsors into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ultimately, regardless of all the guardrails Riot Games may implement, it's a bummer. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gambling-related-harms-evidence-review/gambling-related-harms-evidence-review-summary--2">Sports betting is addictive</a>. It has and will ruin lives. A UK government report cites two quantitative studies that found deaths from suicide were "significantly higher among adults with gambling disorder or problems compared to the general adult population."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-opens-the-door-to-betting-sponsorships-in-professional-league-of-legends-and-valorant]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-cube-q-a-%E2%80%93-mundfish-confirms-dungeon-like-zones-dynamic-events-and-regular-post-launch-support.1229988/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The unveiling of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CUBE</a> certainly surprised fans of Atomic Heart. While a sequel was more than warranted given that over 10 million people played the original game, they definitely weren't expecting to also get an online multiplayer spin-off featuring MMORPG elements.</p>
<p>When we contacted Mundfish to <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-2-qa-its-a-few-years-out-were-taking-the-time-to-make-it-tighter-and-more-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more about Atomic Heart 2</a>, we also set up an interview to discuss The CUBE. Once again, studio founder, CEO, and game director Robert Bagratuni kindly obliged, allowing us to craft this exclusive interview dedicated to the exciting project and the brand new split-rendering technology created specifically for it. Bagratuni also discussed the increased team size to handle all these projects, the current state of the game (internal playtesting), and the desire to support The CUBE well after launch with new content and features.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I was absentmindedly sketching a tic-tac-toe grid and squares on a notepad. Then a thought hit me: what if these cube tiles rotated? What if its surfaces shifted, folded, expanded? What if this structure wasn’t just abstract, but alive - a space that actually impacted traversal, physics, logic, even multiplayer behavior? That single moment sparked something.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How many developers from Mundfish are working on The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>We've grown significantly since the development of Atomic Heart 1. Back then, the entire game was created by a team of around 50 developers, growing to about 80 by the time of release. Today, the structure is quite different: the team has more than doubled in size, and we now have multiple dedicated teams. One team is fully focused on DLC#4 for Atomic Heart 1, another is working on Atomic Heart 2, and a separate team is developing The CUBE.</p>
<p>Many of those working on The CUBE joined the studio after the project received internal greenlight, especially given its multiplayer focus, which required new expertise. That said, of course, there’s crossover between teams, particularly in areas like narrative, where maintaining consistency across our universe is essential. The same goes for shared characters and cutscene production. So, while it’s difficult to give a precise headcount, what’s clear is that each current project is being developed by equally strong teams that are significantly larger than what we had during AH1.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with the concept for this game?</strong></p>
<p>It all started with a phone call - one of those long, uneventful conversations where your mind begins to drift. I was absentmindedly sketching a tic-tac-toe grid and squares on a notepad. Then a thought hit me: what if these cube tiles rotated? What if its surfaces shifted, folded, expanded?</p>
<p>What if this structure wasn’t just abstract, but alive - a space that actually impacted traversal, physics, logic, even multiplayer behavior? That single moment sparked something. Oleg Gorodishenin, our executive producer and co-founder, and I quietly excused ourselves from the call. The next two hours were pure creative flow - and by the end of it, The CUBE was born.</p>
<p><strong>Chronologically, does it take place before or after Atomic Heart 2?</strong></p>
<p>Great question, but we’re being careful not to reveal too much just yet. What we can say is that The CUBE takes place after the events of Atomic Heart 1. As for how it connects to Atomic Heart 2, there’s definitely a timeline relationship, but we’ll let players piece that together as more is revealed. The CUBE isn’t just a standalone concept, it’s a key part of the evolving universe.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss the split-rendering system? Why is it unique and how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>To bring The CUBE to life, we had to develop entirely new systems that could support a world in constant motion, both structurally and technically. At the heart of this is our split-rendering system, a breakthrough method that allows thousands of objects on what we call “tiles” (or world clusters) to move and rotate in real time across massive multiplayer environments. This isn’t just visual spectacle - it directly affects gameplay, traversal, and the rules of physics inside the world.</p>
<p>The system works by splitting how motion, rendering, and synchronization are handled between client and server, making it possible to maintain seamless transitions, dynamic gravity, and accurate object tracking, even when the entire world around you is shifting. It enables what we think of as a truly living environment, and it's currently patent-pending.</p>
<p>The CUBE is developed on Unreal Engine 5, and we’ve implemented several custom modifications to both its physics and rendering subsystems to fully support our approach. UE5 gives us so much development freedom and the visual fidelity to match the scale and ambition of this concept. At the end of the day, this isn’t just tech for the sake of tech - it’s what allows The Cube to feel unique, unpredictable, and fully alive in the hands of the player.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The CUBE is not about static quest hubs or routine grinds - it’s about exploration, discovery, and adapting to a shifting, surreal environment that changes over time. Players will engage in cooperative missions, dynamic world events, and possibly confront other players in certain regions, depending on the context. The CUBE itself acts as a living system - part structure, part mystery - and what you do inside it affects both your journey and the shape of the world for others.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You've presented the game as an MMORPG shooter. Could you share which MMORPG elements will be featured?</strong></p>
<p>At its core, The CUBE is built around a deep narrative set in the evolving Atomic Universe. We’re calling it an MMORPG shooter because it blends that strong narrative foundation with large-scale systems: deep and persistent character progression, customizable loadouts, long-term gear upgrades, quests, and evolving objectives, like expeditions, shaped by the community. But unlike traditional MMOs, The CUBE is not about static quest hubs or routine grinds - it’s about exploration, discovery, and adapting to a shifting, surreal environment that changes over time.</p>
<p>Players will engage in cooperative missions, dynamic world events, and possibly confront other players in certain regions, depending on the context. The CUBE itself acts as a living system - part structure, part mystery - and what you do inside it affects both your journey and the shape of the world for others.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any extraction shooter modes or elements in the game? How does PvP work in the game?</strong></p>
<p>While The CUBE offers a wide range of gameplay experiences from exploration and constant progression to narrative-driven quests and deep social interactions, combat is just one of the tools players use to achieve their goals. At its core, The CUBE is closer to classic MMORPGs than to extraction shooters or battle royales, which usually don’t focus on the above.</p>
<p>That said, elements commonly associated with extraction gameplay, like venturing into dangerous zones and returning with valuable loot, are present in many RPGs such as Diablo, WoW, and Destiny, right? In that medium, The CUBE shares a similar dynamic: players will have opportunities to explore, take risks and return with meaningful rewards. But that’s only one layer or, let’s say, face of The CUBE - the overall experience will consist of a mix of many more gameplay elements. Our task is to offer players something fresh - something they really want and are not tired of yet.</p>
<p>Even though we’re not ready to reveal everything just yet, observant players may have already noticed several hints about what’s to come on the game’s Steam page. A closer look might uncover some intriguing new details. So, stay tuned, more details about the game systems are coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any dungeon-like experiences?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as part of the exploration, players will find dungeon-like zones with high stakes, tough enemies, and unique rewards. The deeper you go, the weirder it gets.</p>
<p><strong>What are the differences in terms of character progression with AH2?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a great question, but it’s still too early to go into detail. We’ll share more when the time is right. But we can say that, as a multiplayer project, The CUBE will let you shape and adapt your gameplay style to respond effectively to the ever-changing world around you.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share the business model for The CUBE (free to play or premium)?</strong></p>
<p>We’re still finalizing the business model for The CUBE, so it’s not something we’re ready to reveal just yet. Our focus right now is on building a great game, and whatever model we choose, it will be designed to support a fair, player-first experience.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, The CUBE is in active internal playtesting. We’re using this phase to refine core systems and ensure the experience feels right. At the same time, we’re already thinking about how to approach open testing - we definitely want to involve the community and gather feedback as early as it makes sense to fine-tune the final gaming experience. More on that soon.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What is the current state of the game? Are you planning several beta tests to receive feedback from fans?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, The CUBE is in active internal playtesting. We’re using this phase to refine core systems and ensure the experience feels right. At the same time, we’re already thinking about how to approach open testing - we definitely want to involve the community and gather feedback as early as it makes sense to fine-tune the final gaming experience. More on that soon.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the post-launch support of The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>The CUBE is designed from the ground up as a continuing experience. Post-launch, we’ll be regularly rolling out new content, quests, story beats, events, and features to keep the world evolving. This world is built to grow, impress, and surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

                <p>Summer sales have begun kicking off everywhere--from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-summer-game-sale-2025-best-deals/1100-6532543/" data-ref-id="1100-6532543">GOG</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-summer-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-6667/" data-ref-id="2900-6667">Steam</a>--and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/summer-sale/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo is also throwing its hat</a> into the commerce ring with discounts on dozens of its games. The Nintendo Summer Sale is primarily focused on digital games, and right now, there are some great deals for Switch exclusives and third-party titles from a number of studios. All of these games will work on both Switch and Switch 2 consoles, and considering that the Switch 2 has a decent amount of storage capacity, this is a nice way to fill up the library on that machine.</p><p>On the Nintendo side, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-odyssey-switch/">Super Mario Odyssey</a> has been discounted to $40, and considering that it just got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">graphical upgrade for Switch 2</a>, it's definitely worth picking up if you've got the new hybrid console. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-3d-world-plus-bowsers-fury-switch/">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> also got a free upgrade for Switch 2, and it's on sale for $40 (was $60). 3D Super Mario games are generally some of the best in any Nintendo library, and this upgraded version of the Wii U/Switch classic doesn't disappoint.</p><p>Not one to be left out, Mario's brother Luigi is also ready to rock in a discounted adventure. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/luigis-mansion-2-hd-switch/">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> is a lovely game starring the lanky plumber as he embarks on a ghost-busting career, and you can grab this for $42. One of the biggest bargains here is for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-plus-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-switch/">Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</a>, as it has been discounted from $60 to $15. If you love turn-based strategy, then this is a marvelous game to pick up, especially at this price. It's charming, hilarious, and the gameplay features an impressive amount of depth to it.</p><p>We've also listed several third-party games below, so don't miss out on a chance to enjoy modern-day classics like <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/it-takes-two-switch/">It Takes Two</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-digital-deluxe-edition-switch/">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-plucky-squire-switch/">The Plucky Squire</a>.</p><h2>Nintendo Store Summer Sale</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> -- $42 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cult-of-the-lamb-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cult of the Lamb</a> -- $12.49 (<strike>$25</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/doom-eternal-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom Eternal</a> -- $10 (<strike>$40</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-fighterz-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> -- $9.59 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ea-sports-fc-25-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports FC 25</a> -- $18 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/enter-the-gungeon-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enter the Gungeon</a> -- $3.74 (<strike>$15</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fitness-boxing-3-your-personal-trainer-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fitness Boxing 3</a> -- $35 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/freedom-wars-remastered-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom Wars Remastered</a> -- $30 (<strike>$40</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/it-takes-two-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a> --$20 (<strike>$40</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/just-dance-2025-edition-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Dance 2025 Edition</a> -- $25 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a> -- $42 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/luigis-mansion-2-hd-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> -- $42 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-plus-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</a> -- $15 (<strike>$60</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-tokyo-2020-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario &amp;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mod test was shared online this week, highlighting how much the new system can improve ARK: Survival Evolved, one of the worst original Switch ports released to date, even at resolutions higher than the vanilla 1080p.</p>
<p>The new test video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a>, compares the game running on an overclocked Nintendo Switch and on the current generation system with some graphics mods like an FPS unlocker setting the cap to 60 FPS and increased resolution. At base 1080p resolution, ARK runs great on Nintendo Switch 2, consistently hitting the modded 60 FPS cap without the massive stuttering seen on the original console. The new generation system handles 1440p resolution quite well, not hitting the 60 FPS, but keeping a relatively steady 50 FPS range performance that's more than playable. At 4K resolution, however, the system begins to struggle, as the game runs in the 25 FPS range, and textures start showing some issues likely related to RAM, although the absence of the massive stuttering seen on the original system still makes this impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARK Graphics Mods on Switch 2 - 60 FPS / 4K Resolution" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mY16ahbIAB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those not in the know, seeing Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mods already may seem surprising, especially as the console hasn't been hacked yet, but unlocking framerates and increasing resolution in select backward-compatible titles is entirely possible by importing a modded save file where graphics settings have been changed. Using this method, naga tested out how much the system can be pushed by running games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-unlock-framerate-and-increase-graphics-settings/">Grid Autosport and Alien Isolation</a> with higher resolutions and unlocked framerates.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 graphics mods, however, are not needed to enjoy improved backward-compatible titles, as many games can use the system's increased hardware specifications over its predecessor to offer improved framerates and more, even without dedicated patches.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-brings-lagiacrus-and-more-next-week.1229955/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update 2 will arrive next week, bringing with it two new monsters to fight, new layered weapons, and extra quality-of-life features, plus more.</p>

<p>This update is the game's second major content drop, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's Title Update 1</a>. Its first major new addition is Lagiacrus, who is available to fight as part of an extra mission. You'll have to reach Hunter Rank 31, and you'll need to complete the missions A World Turned Upside Down and Forest Doshaguma.</p>

<p>Your fight against Lagiacrus won't just take place on the ground, either; you'll also be able to play through "a special underwater sequence" when you're fighting it, so you should have a spectacular battle on your hands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-seregios.jpg?itok=g2j2MEbL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-seregios.jpg?itok=l1f_vmBW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update 2 will bring two monsters for you to fight, plus more.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as Lagiacrus, you'll also get the chance to fight Seregios, who made his last appearance in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">recently topped ten million sales</a>).</p>

<p>Once again, you'll need to be Hunter Rank 31 or above, and you'll need to complete A World Turned Upside Down to fight him. He's known for inflicting the Bleeding status effect, so make sure you've got stuff with you to get rid of that.</p>

<p>Other additions in this update include new layered weapons to collect, the ability to swap between Alma and Erik as your handler, and a new Support Hunter, plus the ability to select the Support Hunter you want to join you on your quests.</p>




<p>A new update for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is all well and good, but it might not do much to allay the mounting criticism being leveled at the game by fans; it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at an Overwhelmingly Negative score</a> across recent Steam ratings.</p>

<p>Criticisms range from poor performance through to a lack of content and complaints about the streamlined nature of the game, and while some of these issues appear to have plagued&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>since its launch, some seem to be rearing their heads as more players reach the endgame.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Title Update 2 will be released on June 30th.

            <title><![CDATA[Arc System Works Reveals Two Intriguing New Non-Fighting Games]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-system-works-two-new-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-system-works-reveals-two-intriguing-new-non-fighting-games.1229952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arc System Works, best known for fighting games like&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>, have announced two brand new projects, and they both look like they're pretty far out of the developer's usual wheelhouse.</p>

<p>Both games were announced during the developer's showcase yesterday. The first,&nbsp;<em>Dear Me, I Was</em>, is a Switch 2 exclusive that Arc describes as an "interactive adventure" featuring a "story woven with beautiful visuals".</p>

<p>It features the distinctive art style of Taisuke Kanasaki, the artist behind the cult classic DS adventure games&nbsp;<em>Hotel Dusk&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Another Code</i>. As a reminder, the latter, along with its Wii sequel, received a re-release on the Switch last year courtesy of Arc System Works.</p>




<p>We don't know too much about how&nbsp;<em>Dear Me, I Was&nbsp;</em>will play yet, but we do know that the game's launch is scheduled for sometime this summer. That means we can likely expect a release sometime before mid-September, at least.</p>

<h2>Arc System Works' second new game is "an action game, not a fighting game"</h2>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Dear Me, I Was</em>, Arc System Works also announced&nbsp;<em>Damon and Baby&nbsp;</em>during yesterday's showcase. It's "the first step" towards a new future for the company, one in which it diversifies and makes games other than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/guilty-gear-strive" rel="nofollow">fighters</a> for which it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/granblue-fantasy-versus" rel="nofollow">known</a>.</p>

<p><em>Damon and Baby&nbsp;</em>revolves around the Demon King, who is "cursed to never be able to part from a human child". He must embark on a journey to lift the curse and rid himself of his burden, although I'm betting he'll grow to love the little scamp by the end of the game.</p>




<p>Gameplay-wise, it looks like&nbsp;<em>Damon and Baby&nbsp;</em>will mostly take the form of a top-down-slash-sidescrolling action game, with plenty of variety in the form of setpieces and boss fights to enjoy.</p>

<p>Neither game has a concrete release date yet, but Arc System Works has promised more information soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of Atomic Heart 2 at Summer Game Fest 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-2-qa-its-a-few-years-out-were-taking-the-time-to-make-it-tighter-and-more-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Mundfish Founder, CEO, and Game Director Robert Bagratuni, whose interviews were often featured on Wccftech throughout the development of the first installment, to learn more about the sequel of the popular first-person shooter game.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole chat, two topics were worth highlighting in a separate story: the greater focus on roleplaying game elements and the larger, more dynamic world that players will find in the sequel. Here are the respective quotes from Bagratuni:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We’re introducing a more expanded RPG layer in Atomic Heart 2, but we’re doing it the Mundfish way - integrated into the world and the experience, not layered on top just for complexity’s sake. The “living world” means that we want the world to feel less like a backdrop and more like a responsive, evolving system. As for the RPG elements - we are aiming for deeper weapon customization, skill trees, and progression paths that allow players to shape their playstyle much more than before. </em><em>When we talk about “various activities,” we mean things that reward curiosity: things to do between the main missions. But always in service of the core experience - we’re not turning it into a checklist-style open-world game. Everything still has that handcrafted, surreal tone fans expect. Atomic Heart 2 will offer players more agency than before. Choices do matter, and your actions can influence how certain events or missions unfold. As for companions… that’s a tricky one to answer without spoilers. Let’s just say: you won’t be entirely alone.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>The game is much more open in structure. We’re building larger, interconnected spaces that offer more freedom in how you explore, revisit, and engage with different systems - vehicles, traversal tools, and new verticality are all part of that. There’s a core narrative path, but also a lot of space for discovery and replayability. We’re not ready to reveal all the environmental systems yet, but expect more dynamic elements like time of day and weather to play a role in shaping both mood and gameplay. That said, everything is still grounded in story and world logic - the scale is there to serve immersion, not overwhelm it.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, Bagratuni also told us that Atomic Heart 2 is 'a few years out', partly because the team wants to improve the sequel's polish, make it tighter and more immersive. However, we'll keep covering any relevant news and rumors throughout the whole development phase.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the first post-launch GameCube game coming to the Switch 2 as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service, and it's none other than arcade sports classic&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>will be joining <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">the console's GameCube lineup</a> on July 3rd, taking its place alongside games like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;SoulCalibur II</i>.</p>

<p>Just like with other GameCube games, as well as titles available on systems like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streets-of-rage-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Sega Genesis</a>, you're going to need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-strikers-switch-2-game.jpg?itok=NAhtA9Nt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-strikers-switch-2-game.jpg?itok=tK4OBeQI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>is the next GameCube game coming to Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, it's a soccer (or football, if you're from the same sceptred isle as me) game that stars characters from the&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>franchise. Playables include Mario himself, of course, as well as Donkey Kong, Waluigi, and more.</p>

<p>Originally released in 2005,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>was developed by Next Level Games, who, at that point, were known only for 2003 sports title&nbsp;<em>NHL Hitz Pro</em>. The studio would go on to work alongside Nintendo on games like the Wii's&nbsp;<em>Punch-Out!!&nbsp;</em>remake, as well as the two&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>sequels.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>puts a characteristically Nintendo spin on soccer; while the basic rules remain largely intact, you can use&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed items to gain an advantage, and characters also have access to special attacks to turn the tide of play.</p>




<p><em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>serves as the first in a series of three games; the first followup, 2007's&nbsp;<em>Mario Strikers Charged</em>, was released for the Wii, but it would take another fifteen years before&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mario-strikers-battle-league" rel="nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>&nbsp;</em>would appear on the Switch, once again developed by Next Level Games.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>as part of the Nintendo Switch Online GameCube lineup when it takes to the pitch on July 3rd. Again, though, you'll need a Switch Online Expansion Pack addon to enjoy it.</p>

            <p>Congrats, Andrew! You're almost certainly not reading this, but regardless, it's only polite for me to offer you a big well done, Mr Wilson. After all, you, EA's CEO, were paid $30.5 million (around £22 million) in the financial year just gone, nearly $5 million (around £3.6 million) than you were the one before that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company's full-time workers only took home $117,000 (around £85k) on average, down from $149,000 (around £108k) in 2024, and the lowest since 2022, which saw EA employees earn $116,000 (around £84.5k) according to the average EA used. In order to illustrate just how huge the gulf between the cash given to Wilson per year and the median pay of the people under him who actually do the work, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">Game File</a>'s Stephen Totilo has made a hugely stretched graph that's well worth checking out if you want a good laugh followed by a big sigh.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>EA opted to use the median rather than the mean to calculate that average salary among its staff in its latest <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000130817925000556/ea014143-def14a.htm#pro014143a014">proxy statement</a>. Basically, they pulled the middle salary number from the bunch, rather than adding them all together and dividing by the total number of salaries included. Hello, secondary school maths.</p>
<p>Wilson's $30 milion in cash and stock during the 12 months that drew to a close on March 31 was up on the $26 million he earned the year before that, and his biggest windfall since taking home $39 million in 2021. Time for a new yacht, methinks. And during a period that saw EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">lay off</a> a bunch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">of staff</a>.</p>
<p>His base salary of $1.3 million (about £947k) was the same as it has been since at least 2023, with $25.7 million (around £18.7 million) in stock awards, $2.8 million (around £2 million) via a non-equity incentive plan, and $678,000 (around £494k) in "other compensation" bringing his pay up to that $30 million total. The vast majority of the bump came from his stock increasing to that new number from just over $20 million (around $14.5 million) in 2024.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-earned-260-times-more-than-the-median-worker-last-year">Game Developer</a>, it wasn't just Wilson getting more money either. All four of the other top execs EA listed individual pay numbers for in the proxy statement containing this data recieved increases by either a little or a lot compared to their 2024 totals.</p>
<p>Congrats to all of them! Stuart Canfield, Laura Miele, Mala Singh, Jacob Schatz, you too! Well deserved millions, all of which should definitely have been given to just five people, who'll need every last dime just to pay their bills.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-got-a-nice-pay-bump-last-year-while-the-companys-workers-earned-less-on-average]]></content:encoded>

When it arrives next year, Requiem will be a single-player game, and offline only.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've managed to pack a lot into this game. We were even exploring many different systems early in development," producer Masachika Kawata noted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You might have heard some of the rumors," Nakanishi continued. "Things like an online Resident Evil, or an open-world Resident Evil, which we spent some time experimenting with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But in the end, although we had some interesting concepts, we realized that it wasn't what fans wanted to see or play. So we went back to the drawing board, and created what led to Resident Evil: Requiem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see a few brief shots of the cancelled online version of Requiem below:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The cancelled Resident Evil 9 project <a href="https://t.co/Vu7z2tlppQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Vu7z2tlppQ</a></p>— Waleed (@Waleedx2007) <a href="https://twitter.com/Waleedx2007/status/1938392141769687115?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing Requiem's setting, art director Tomonori Takano noted that Capcom had made the deliberate choice to place the game's action in urban environments, in order to differentiate it from other recent games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village and the recent Resident Evil 4 Remake are all set outside major population centers, whereas Requiem will see the return of Raccoon City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Previous titles were often set in rural areas with lots of nature," Takano noted. "This time it is more focused on the urban environment. And there are many scenarios that are set as a modern drama, including Raccoon City."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we now know the setting and single-player focus of Requiem for certain, Capcom remains more coy over whether floppy-haired fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy is also playable in the game, alongside its currently-announced protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed">Capcom Spotlight 2025 broadcast</a> included comments from Nakanishi that stated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon would be a "bad match for horror"</a> — though the director stopped short of confirming the character would not be present at all.

<p>"Matches unfold with white-hot speed, intensity, and familiar items, like shells and mushrooms, to give you a boost in crushing your opponent," reads the official blurb. "But the real key to winning is the Super Strike, a powerful shot that can net you two points at once! Jump right in with simple controls, hone your techniques, and hit the pitch with Mario and his friends!"</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for it all in the video above (it's the US version, because Nintendo UK has not uploaded its own one yet).</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has plenty of new features over its predecessor, including some RPG-lite mechanics like Sam's Stats, which determine how well he performs specific actions. And in true RPG fashion, these stats can be increased during the course of the game, making Sam even better at traversing terrain, resisting getting knocked out by specific attacks, and so on.</p>
<h2>Sam's Stats in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250627130510-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Sam's Stats in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are self-explanatory, and the in-game menu provides a good overview of how each stat impacts Sam's performance and by how much. What the game doesn't tell you, however, is how to level them up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terrain Traversal</strong> indicates Sam's ability to resist fatigue while traversing difficult terrain, such as rivers and slopes.&nbsp;The higher this stat, the slower Endurance will reduce when he does so. This stat is increased by traversing this difficult terrain.</li>
<li><strong>Carry Capacity</strong> indicates Sam's proficiency at carrying cargo, granting him an increased capacity of additional kilograms depending on the stat's level. This stat is increased by traveling with plenty of cargo, the higher the weight, the better.</li>
<li><strong>Endurance</strong> indicates Sam's proficiency at resisting fatigue while traveling, which is indicated by the bar located on the Stamina Gauge. The higher this stat, the slower Fatigue will accumulate. This stat is increased by running over long distances.</li>
<li><strong>KO Resistance</strong> indicates how much Sam can resist getting knocked out by specific enemy attacks, losing balance, and dropping cargo. The higher the stat, the harder it will be for enemies to knock the porter off balance and steal his cargo. This stat is increased by blocking enemy attacks and centering Sam's balance while under attack holding the L2 and R2 buttons. Doing so when unbalanced and not in combat does not count.</li>
<li><strong>Lung Capacity</strong> indicates how much Sam can hold his breath using the Stamina Gauge to easily make it past human enemies and BTs undetected. The higher the stat, the higher his lung capacity will be. To increase this stat, all you need to do is hold Sam's breath by pressing the R1 button.</li>
<li><strong>Strand Skills</strong> indicate how good Sam is at binding enemies undetected from behind using his Strand. The higher the stat is, the bigger is the distance from which Sam can bind unaware human enemies. To increase this stat, simply bind enemies using the weapon repeatedly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the Stats above, Sam also has <strong>Mastery Stats for weapon types</strong>, which increase Reload Speed and lower Reticle Sway and Recoil the higher they are. Master for each weapon type is increased by defeating enemies with the related weapon type.</p>
<h2>The Most Important Stat to Increase as Quickly as Possible</h2>
<p>While increasing all the stats outlined above provides some tangible benefits, some are more impactful than others and can make Death Stranding 2: On the Beach more enjoyable. <strong>The most important of them, regardless of playstyle, is Carry Capacity</strong>, and it's easy to understand why as soon as the game begins. An increased carry capacity makes it easier for Sam to carry many items, which is beneficial for deliveries and combat. While it's true that vehicles eventually make Carry Capacity not that important later on, there will be plenty of times during the course of the game when you cannot use one, having to rely on Sam's foot to complete a delivery. In combat, having a higher Carry Capacity means being able to carry more weapons, which is always a great help. As such, you will want to increase this stat as quickly as possible, and you can do so already during Sam's time in Mexico at the start of the game. <strong>Make sure to travel as close to maximum carry capacity as possible from one place to the other, avoid enemy camps, and it shouldn't take too long to level up the stat up a couple of ranks</strong>.</p>
<p>Increasing every other stat, however, is entirely dependent on your playstyle. If you like to take on enemies head-on, increasing Lung Capacity and Striking Skills won't be very beneficial for you, and you should focus on Weapon Mastery instead, as well as KO Endurance to avoid getting your cargo stolen in case something goes wrong during a fight. If you're a Metal Gear Solid fan and prefer a stealthy approach, however, Lung Capacity and Strand Skills are more valuable stats to improve. Ultimately, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a very flexible game that can be played with different playstyles, providing everything needed to make any playstyle enjoyable.</p>

                <p>Since his breakthrough role in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, fans can't get enough of Ben Starr. Neither can he, as in a video for GameSpot, the voice actor decided to play through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/date-everything/">Date Everything</a> by only dating his own character.</p><p dir="ltr">The surreal and comedic sandbox dating sim lets you literally date everything, thanks to a pair of magical glasses called Dateviators, which transform everyday household objects into dateable characters with their own stories. Each one is brought to by a huge roster of voice actors, including Ashly Burch, Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, Felicia Day, Steve Blum, Ashley Johnson, as well as the game's lead designer and veteran voice actor Ray Chase of Final Fantasy XV fame. Despite more than 100 dateable objects, "resident video game narcissist" Starr has opted to only date himself.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NZAuS3INM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1-NZAuS3INM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Starr actually voices multiple characters as he plays a personified door called Dorian and there are 17 variations of Dorian throughout the house. There's Front Dorian who wears a little hat, Back Dorian, which the actor said he recorded "facing away from the microphone with my hand over my mouth", as well as Trap Dorian, who happens to wear a lot less clothes than the rest.</p><p dir="ltr">Date Everything is considerably more lighthearted than Starr's more dramatic roles, including this year's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. But he is no stranger to getting weird and silly, having donned costume and makeup as the Balatro jester Jimbo for a trailer announcing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatros-next-free-update-adds-eight-more-crossovers-today/1100-6528418/">Balatro's Friends of Jimbo 3 update</a>, and did the same when he collected the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-bafta-games-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6298/#12">Bafta games</a> award for best debut on behalf of developer Localthunk.</p><p dir="ltr">Since its release earlier this month, Date Everything has had "generally favourable" reviews on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/date-everything/">Metacritic</a>, and "overwhelmingly positive" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> user reviews.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Ruffy is an off-brand Ewok, a bear with a huge grin, a hidden destiny and a penchant for funky tunes. He’s also got one hell of a special ability, being able to scan things in his environment, and then transfer their texture and qualities to something else. Need to get to the top of a waterfall? How about turning the water into clinging vines to climb? Need to clear a path? Why not turn the stone into wood that you can smash apart? The swapping mechanic is at the heart of Ruffy and the Riverside, adding a heap of puzzling action to its charming 3D platforming, and it’s mostly a winning combination.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ruffy and the Riverside - Announcement Trailer PC and Consoles" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9h_gM-S-og?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ruffy is a bear that’s been raised by his uncle, cultivating his amazing swap ability as he grew. This seems to have been used for an illicit counterfeit art business, but let’s paper over that particular crack. When Sir Eddler arrives to take Ruffy off on an adventure, it soon becomes clear that Ruffy is the chosen one, capable of restoring the power of Riverside and fighting back against the evil Groll.</p>


<p>Ruffy and the Riverside is undoubtedly distinctive. It combines an N64/Dreamcast-esque polygonal platforming world with 2D hand-drawn characters and art, making it feel as though a sketch pad has come to life. It’s colourful, unique and joyful; I love it, even if there are some limitations with animations, such as how each character moves through a short window of movement when you’re talking to them.</p>


<p>Swapping is the key mechanic here, and Ruffy is far more of a puzzler than it is a platformer. Swapping the textures of each different substance is such a great idea, it’s hard to believe that it hasn’t been done on this scale before. The puzzles start off with simple solutions, the textures you need to swap being quite obvious, but as you progress things get increasingly trickier, forcing you to really think things through.</p>
<p>You can brute force your way through if you’re stuck – there does tend to be a limited number of possible textures in each area, and you can only hang onto the texture for a short amount of time, so you can’t race around the map using the same one over and over again – but a bit of careful thought will normally see you through.</p>
<p>This is truly Ruffy’s reason for existing, and the whole game hangs on how intriguing and clever this one mechanic is. You’ll likely be surprised by how many different ways it’s implemented, and there’s a steady trickle of dopamine as your reward for each successful section.</p>

<p>As you race around following the main storyline, there’s a bunch of additional challenges and puzzles to distract and obsess over, starting with the puzzle potatoes, which ask you to replicate a shape found in the environment by swapping nine tiles around. These were my favourite puzzles, if only because you have to memorise the shape in your head, and be careful not to erase a tile you’re going to need.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s Etoi to find, little creatures hidden around the environment, butterflies to collect, and the shady crows who offer you riddles. Solve these, and you’ll gain access to a 2D platforming section that sees you embossed on a wall or the side of a cliff. These areas have definitely taken inspiration from a raft of Mario games, but if you’re going to copy someone’s homework, make it the smartest kid in class.</p>

<p>As an indie title, Ruffy does have a few rougher edges, not least a slightly unstable framerate on Nintendo Switch. That’s not entirely evened out by playing on Switch 2 either, though it’s only particularly noticeable when you’re running around at full speed in a feature-packed area. Besides that, the swapping mechanic can sometimes be very particular about which section of a texture it’s going to lock onto, and you might occasionally think that you can’t swap a texture when you can.</p>
<p>While I did like the suitably cheerful music that accompanies Ruffy’s adventure, you’ll find that there’s a lot of repetition, with the same musical sections returning time and time again, and each being on a fairly short loop. One of these sounds like David Bowie’s Golden Years which had me on a Apple Music-fuelled adventure of my own while I tried to work it out. If you’re interested I got there by remembering Heath Ledge dancing to it, which first had me stop off at 10 Things I Hate About You, before finally working out it was A Knight’s Tale. As far as Ruffy goes, it’s a shame if you’re the kind of player who won’t be able to tune out from the repeating sections, and it would have been nice to have more variety and longer musical compositions.</p>
<p>These are all minor quibbles in the scheme of things though, and Ruffy manages to smooth over most of them with its visual charm, witty dialogue and smart mechanics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There used to be - and might still be - a tradition at the UK's Reading music festival where you'd be lying in your sleeping bag at night and you'd suddenly hear a low rumbling in the distance, which would then become indecipherable shouting, which you'd soon realise was rows of campers shouting the word 'bollocks' from their tents in a sort of Mexican wave, getting louder and closer as you waited in fizzy anticipation for your turn to shout. You'd then listen to the whole thing play out in reverse as the bollocktide receded into the pleasant autumn twilight.</p>
<p>I thought about this as I read multiple headlines referring to the Windows blue screen of death as 'iconic' this morning. Extreme annoyance elevated to the status of folk legend. Mythologising a shared experience of catastrophe. The whole world shouting 'bollocks' together.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Microsoft announced that they'd be redesigning the BSOD back in March via a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/28/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26120-3653-beta-channel/">blog post</a> accompanying a preview build for members of their Windows Insiders program. Those using the preview found that the BlueSOD was no more, replaced instead by a BlackSOD. Now, Windows have confirmed they're sticking with it, and it's due for a rollout for everyone on Windows 11 later this Summer.</p>
<p>“This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster,” Microsoft's VP of enterprise and OS security David Weston told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692648/microsoft-bsod-black-screen-of-death-color-change-official">The Verge</a>. “Part of it just cleaner information on what exactly went wrong, where it’s Windows versus a component.”</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/26/the-windows-resiliency-initiative-building-resilience-for-a-future-ready-enterprise/">blog post</a> from yesterday if you fancy reading their full explanation of the update. It contains sentences like "a key trait of a resilient organization is the ability to maintain productivity and minimize disruptions", and "in today’s threat landscape, organizations can’t afford to treat resilience as a reactive measure". As the Verge note, this is all likely in response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages">far-reaching Crowdstrike outages</a> last year, which indeed had a lot of people shouting "bollocks" in unison.</p>
<p>The blue screen of death has been around for 40 years at this point, since Windows' first version in 1985. I imagine most of you also remember the BSOD's console gaming cousin, the Xbox 360's hardware failure-signifying red ring of death, aka the reason I've never played Fable 2. Other variants include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Meditation">Amiga's Guru Meditation Error</a> (based on an in-joke about staff adopting calming poses in response to crashes), and <a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Sad_Mac">Apple's Sad Mac</a>. None of which are as good as <a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/t/funny-error-informational-messages/476910/2">this one</a> though:</p>

<p>If you've missed out on what else those loveable tykes at Microsoft HQ have been up to recently, the company confirmed in May that they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">supplied AI technology to the Israeli military for use in Gaza</a>.

<figure><a title="EA CEO PAY INCREASE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc250c7342108/ea-ceo-pay-increase.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p>EA's CEO, Andrew Wilson, has somehow managed to find himself $5 million richer than usual this year, according to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000130817925000556/ea014143-def14a.htm">latest Proxy filing by the company</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">Stephen Totilo over at Game File</a>, the extra cash on top of an already very nice annual income, flies directly in the face of how the general population of workers for the company are being renumerated. This is all bad, however it has made for a rather amusingly shaped graph, so silver linings and all that.</p>

<p>Indeed, and ignoring the huge graph for just a second, EA reported the median income for full-time employees in the company circa 2024 was $117,000, down from $149,000 in 2023. That's...that's a massive drop. Now Totilo goes into some really depressing details here, in that EA's reported figures, according to Game File, are notoriously imprecise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s ostensibly based on a median average, not the mean (median = pulling the middle number from a stack of salaries; mean = adding the salary stack together, then dividing by the number of salaries in that stack).<br>
Confusingly, EA says it used “the same median employee” in 2025 that it used to compare compensation with Wilson in 2023 and 2024.<br>
It does not explain that workers’ 2025 pay drop, but says its figures for CEO and worker pay both include bonuses and stock grants, which can rise and fall in a given year."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you catch all that, the main thing to note, as ever, is that Joe Public gets less, while the CEO makes an extra stash that's more than most of us will see in our entire lives. As you were, comrades.</p>
<p>Now onto the graphs, and we'll let you <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">click through</a> to the very tall one but let's just say it really highlights, by having you scroll a few seconds longer than you may think you're gonna, all the way up from $100k right to that big fat £39 million dollar pay stack of Wilson's, just how huge the gap is between top and bottom...and with seemingly very little explanation.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><br></em><em>Think there's a bit of an unfair discrepancy between what CEOs are paid compared to their workforce? Would it be quicker to ask only those who don't to leave a comment? Let us know!</em></p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It had been six months since Pascal Gilcher, also known as Marty McFly, had released an update for his popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-shader-adds-image-based-lighting-extended-ray-length-multiplier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTGI ReShade shader</a>.&nbsp;However, a new version just became available to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> subscribers, and it's a big one.</p>
<p>The modder tried to implement the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-researchers-demonstrate-new-raytracing-algorithm-that-can-render-direct-lighting-from-millions-of-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> algorithm in his shader, but encountered several limitations, like chroma noise (because reservoir sampling can only hold light from a single direction), sample correlation that breaks denoiser variance estimation, and white noise output. Eventually, Gilcher decided to design his own sampling algorithm, which he reckons vastly outperforms ReSTIR GI in terms of quality.&nbsp;The RTGI shader has also received significant improvements to its reflections, which now trace pixel-perfect paths using HiZ Min-Max Tracing.</p>
<p>The modder also shared future plans to split RTGI's diffuse and specular components into separate shaders to manage them more easily.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marty's Mods | Update June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PImgAUIoyZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There were also improvements to other Gilcher's shaders, such as MXAO, which saw the fixing of the low-radius halos that manifested around objects, and especially Launchpad, whose optical flow is used by several other shaders. This new version of Launchpad introduces an innovative gradient descent-based algorithm that can handle subpixel shifts more effectively than traditional grid-based search methods.</p>
<p>Users can now choose from two general-purpose gradient descent optimizers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newton: Converges quickly, making it more suitable for lower-quality settings.</li>
<li>SophiaG: Converges more slowly, but finds better minima, making it a good fit for high-quality settings.</li>
</ul>
<figure><figcaption>Launchpad - Before and After</figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Gilcher has released a brand new shader: path traced volumetric fog. It was originally built as a ground truth reference for a real-time effect, but the modder ultimately enjoyed it so much that the full path-traced version is now available in beta testing, although it's meant to be used for screenshots only. Check out the example below, which was captured in God of War.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Before</figcaption></figure>
<figure><figcaption>After</figcaption></figure>
<p>The path traced volumetric fog shader is currently only available at the most expensive Patreon tier, 'Photon Mappers', which costs $20 monthly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Is there any video game series better suited to the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing with History</a> treatment than the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite">Sniper Elite</a> franchise? <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rebellion">Rebellion Developments</a>’ finest has been encouraging players to crotch-shot Nazis for two decades now, ever since the first Sniper Elite was released way back in 2005 for the humble PlayStation 2 and original Xbox generation. It’s a series that has enabled players to fight alongside the French Resistance, explore the battlefields of North Africa, and infiltrate a multitude of supposedly impregnable German fortresses. This third-person stealth game has had a darn impressive run, and, with the success of this year’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>, that trend shows no signs of abating anytime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfZU8JnBtrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, considering all that, it’s no surprise I sought out the creative minds behind Sniper Elite to ask questions and find out more about the real-life history that helped bring the fictional adventures of Karl Fairburn to life. Questions like, across the Sniper Elite series, what informs the set-up and content of the missions that the player undertakes? Are they based on real missions that took place in WW2? Entirely invented? Or a combination of the two? I didn’t know the answers to any of these quandaries. Fortunately, Beck Shaw – Lead Level Designer, did:</p>


<p>“Early in the process of any Sniper Elite entry, we try to set the overall narrative of the game” explained Beck. “Within this, we look at location (country), enemies (who is the big baddie going to be?), when during the war does the game take place? etc. Once we have this foundation, we continue to refine it further and scout iconic locations (towns, cities, geographical landmarks) from within the country where we have decided to set the story. In terms of the actual missions, we take an amalgamation of inspiration from real wartime operations, popular media (movies, books, games) and also cool ideas that come to the team during our brainstorming sessions.”</p>
<p>This response got me to wondering… with all that research, have there been any real-life events or historical moments that have turned up in Sniper Elite which are so weird or unusual that most players think they are made up?</p>


<p>“Great question!” exclaimed Jean-Baptiste Bolcato – Executive Producer, Simon Richards – Lead Environment Artist, and Martin Carter – Studio Art Lead, in unison – causing my already quite substantial ego to expand enormously and, if I’m honest, rather painfully. “There are several super weapons that have featured in the series that are grounded in real life. One of these is the Ratte tank from Sniper Elite 3, which was a humungous tank that would have used a battleship turret for its main gun. It was never actually produced, but plans were made and shown to Hitler himself. There are other oversized “Wunderwaffe” and structures in the series that are grounded in reality, like the railway gun from Sniper Elite 4, the sub pen from St. Nazaire, and the fortified flak towers, which were built to protect Berlin and could house 15,000 people in one tower! Perhaps the wackiest weapon though is the Rat Bombs used in Sniper Elite 5 and Sniper Elite: Resistance – players might not think these were a real thing, but they were!”</p>
<p>That’s right, dear reader, the Rat Bomb was very much a real thing and is up there with the Bat Bomb in terms of animal-exploding brilliance. Back in 1941, boffins from the Special Operations Executive procured one hundred dead rats that were then stuffed full of explosives and sewn shut. Their cunning plan involved leaving the dynamite padded dead rat by a boiler. When the rat was inevitably spotted, the oblivious German would lob the critter into the flames to dispose of it, and then boom! Thing is, it never actually worked, as the Germans discovered the Rat Bombs before any went off. Though on the plus side, they spent a lot of time and effort regularly looking for more Rat Bombs which never existed.</p>
<p>Exploding pests aside, how do the team go about researching more conventional weaponry, to ensure they look and feel right?</p>
<p>“We put a lot of effort into ensuring the weapons that players use in the Sniper Elite series are as accurate as possible,” confirms Martin. “Firstly, we have a long-standing relationship with the Imperial War Museum which allows us to digitally map the rifles, pistols, and submachine guns. Enabling our design and art teams to create authentic in-game representations. We also undertake days on shooting ranges to fire as many of the weapons as possible. These sessions are filmed, and we use this footage to map the sounds of each weapon, as well as examine aspects like recoil.”</p>

<p>Now that is dedication. It also sounds like tremendous fun too. Though surely changes must be made to these weapons to ensure they work within the context of a video game?</p>
<p>Martin again: “In terms of weapons and their accuracy, we always aim to make the main weapon a 1-to-1 representation of their real-life counterpart. Examples of where we stretch the rules is when we create items like barrel variants – either to simply give the gun a new aesthetic, or to an improved attribute, such as increase reload or accuracy etc. Also, the camouflage painting of weapons is also not accurate to the WW2 period, although on many occasions, the camouflage paint used is based on real-world examples that could be found on uniforms or vehicles.”</p>
<p>When talking about guns in Sniper Elite, so the next obvious question has to do with the series distinctive ‘X-Ray Kill Cam’. This innovative feature is a gory delight that follows a bullet from the barrel of the player’s gun, right into the delicates of an unsuspecting Nazi. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to know the answer, but being a lover of danger, I thought I’d ask it anyway: What sort of research goes into ensuring this Kill Cam induced maiming is as realistic an experience as possible for the player?</p>
<p>“Our art team spends a rather disturbing amount of time looking at references for the Kill Cam.” Expounds Tom Beesley – Art Director, with a twisted grin. “This mainly focuses on studying the ballistics using high speed film and ballistic gel to get a far better visual representation of the cause and effect of a bullet impact on soft tissue. We have also studied in detail how organs would look and react to gunshot wounds, as well as using photogrammetry to scan organics to add a far higher quality bar to the overall visual. We established Sniper Elite’s Kill Cam as a ‘best in class’ some time ago, and we recognise its appeal to the players, so we are always trying to experiment and expand where it goes next.”</p>

<p>I can tell you where the bullet goes next, likely straight into a Nazi’s testicles. Talking of testicles – a question I never thought I’d type – for those players who have decided to shoot Hitler in the genitals using Kill Cam, did any research take place to confirm if the iconic marching song was correct and that Hitler did indeed only have one ball? If so, is there any truth that the missing ball bag was displayed as a war trophy displayed in the Royal Albert Hall?</p>
<p>Tom steps up to answer my probing and insightful question with relish. “There are many differing opinions as to whether Hitler was indeed running at 50%. Medical records apparently exist that attest to him having a condition called cryptorchidism. Equally there is a lot of evidence that the British propaganda machine was also working very effectively to build this into one of the original truly viral stories, even if it wasn’t true. As we know the despot loved to use body doubles and we have touched on that in the Sniper Elite series, so the question is how far would those body doubles be willing to go for an acting job!?”</p>
<p>That is an excellent, and rather unpleasant, thought. When it comes to Hitler’s doubles, Sniper Elite has dispatched numerous of their number in a variety of satisfyingly unpleasant ways. What has been the team’s favourite way to see off a Hitler clone?</p>
<p>Simon Richards, Lead Environment Artist: “I’m going to go with crushing Hitler with the bell in Sniper Elite 3”. Simon crows, “that one always stands out to me!” Meanwhile, Beck, goes with a far more understated option, “I think my favourite one is the bowling pin flying down the bowling alley in Sniper Elite 5!” To explain more of this would spoil the surprise, but it’s definitely worth booting up the game and doing some experimenting if you ask me.</p>

<p>As my time with the Sniper Elite team draws to an end, I just had to know, where’s next for the Sniper Elite series? Will Karl Fairburn be returning? “There’s so much of World War 2 we’ve not even explored in the Sniper Elite series, so who knows where we may end up” replies Beck, sneakily not giving anything away, “I obviously can’t talk about any specifics right now as we don’t have anything to announce just yet, but, in the meantime, we have another mission for Harry Hawker to undertake in Sniper Elite: Resistance!”</p>
<p><em>Excellent news! Frankly, the PWH Team can’t get enough of Sniper Elite, which is why you’ll definitely be finding out more about the fascinating real-life history that informed the series in our forthcoming book which, funnily enough, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past?ref=discovery&amp;term=playing%20with%20history&amp;total_hits=28&amp;category_id=35">is live on Kickstarter right now</a>! Our first volume will feature over 100 games, 200 pages, and 10,000,000 years of history – make sure you check it out!</em></p>

		<p>Super Mario Strikers will be joining the Nintendo GameCube library of games on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Switch Online</a> + Expansion Pack next week, with kick off set for 3rd July 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Strikers – Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Released back in 2005 toward the tail end of the GameCube era, Super Mario Strikers has become a real fan favourite, even with Mario Strikers Charged launching a couple years later for Wii, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/14/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-switch-football/">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a> coming 15 years later for Switch. They didn’t quite scratch the same itch, and there’s plenty that will still proclaim the original Mario football game to be the best.</p>
<p>Super Mario Strikers will be playable exclusively on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-exclusive-to-switch-2/">GameCube game emulation is only available to the Switch 2 console</a>. While we’ve seen GameCube games ported to original Switch, including Super Mario Sunshine and the first two Pikmin games, Nintendo has chosen to segment this as a new console perk.</p>
<p>This joins a trio of games that were available for the Switch 2’s launch, so the full GameCube lineup from 3rd July will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</li>
<li>SoulCalibur 2</li>
<li>F-Zero GX</li>
<li>Super Mario Strikers</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously teased as coming in future are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Fire Emblem Path of Radiance</li>
<li>Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo!</li>
<li>Luigi’s Mansion</li>
<li>Pokémon Colosseum</li>
</ul>
<p>Playing GameCube games again is great, especially with built-in support for wide screen and the ability to run at higher resolutions, and even with online multiplayer a possibility.</p>

<p>For the most authentic experience, you’ll want the official GameCube gamepad recreation which Nintendo has produced, and updated with wireless and Switch 2 system buttons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-controller-review/">I gave this a review</a>, saying “The Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube Controller is a great-feeling recreation of a classic gamepad, furnished with some extra hidden buttons to make it a shade more modern, but it’s too limited to use outside of the Switch Online game library.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides new content, Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 is introducing some new features on PC, the full update notes confirmed.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">release date</a> and most significant additions, which include returning monsters Lagiacrus and Seregios, the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title Update 2 full notes</a> have gone live, confirming it will add NVIDIA DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 4 support on PC. Multi Frame Generation support is also being added by the update, featuring an Auto option that will dynamically turn frame generation on and off depending on the load. The upscaling and frame generation options will also be separated once the title update goes live, allowing users, for example, to use NVIDIA DLSS for upscaling and AMD FSR frame generation together, or any other combination. Rounding up the PC-specific additions are a warning dialogue that warns the user they are using out-of-date GPU drivers, new customizable keyboard configuration controls, and the option of copying the Lobby ID/ Hunter ID via the Start Menu and the Squad ID via the Squad Menu. Unfortunately, the Title Update 2 notes make no mention of performance or optimization improvements, besides a reduction in VRAM usage, so most users will still have to rely on Frame Generation to hit acceptable levels of performance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2, which launches next week on June 30, introduces Lagiacrus and Seregios, a Layered Weapons system, and many other features. Next month, hunters will also be able to take on Arch-tempered Uth Duna and participate in a Fender Special Collaboration event in August. The following Title Update, which has yet to be detailed, will launch in September.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

<p>"Some people said, 'Oh you're now rich.' That's bullshit, I didn't make it for the money at all," Zurawka said, revealing that in its biggest month so far it raked in $4,050 once expenses like Steam's cut were factored in. That was in April, when the game was at its attention zenith, with the number looking like it's steadily dropping in the couple of months since.</p>
<p>"It's not even paying a developer for us," the CEO claimed, "If you just look at the numbers, it's actually losing us money in the end."</p>
<p>This is where things get weird. Like some other free-to-play clickers seemingly attracting high player numbers on Steam, a lot of the folks the data counts as 'playing' Bongo Cat aren't people, they're bots farming and selling the cat hats and skins it dishes out on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=3419430">Steam's community market</a> for real cash. Zurawka estimates that "roughly 50 percent" of Bongo Cat's player base, which <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3419430/charts/#1m">currently ranges</a> from about 150,000 to just under 200,000 at peak, is made up of these automated auctioneers.</p>
<p>Despite that, the developer says money made from this robotic wheeler dealing only amounts to roughly half or less what the game makes each month. Where does it prove its worth, then? Well, as a big bot-infested advert for another game Irox Games are trying to ensure doesn't drown in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">Steam's discoverability maelstrom</a>.</p>
<p>After having a roguelite city builder called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473640/EcoGnomix/?curator_clanid=45040150">EcoGnomix</a> flop, Zurawka and co are using Bongo Cat to promote their next game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590650/OKU/?curator_clanid=45040150">Oku</a> - a very un-Bongo Catty monk adventure. They're even giving out some of those cosmetics to folks who do stuff like watch Oku's trailer. The exec says he's had publishers ask how much Bongo Cat cost to make, something that Eurogamer note could lead to potentially less ethical Bongo copycats.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, Steam's already bulging ranks being filled up even further with games that mainly exist, at least from a practical perspective, to advertise other games isn't a future I'd be a fan of. Though, given the times we're living in, that probably means it's the one we'll end up with.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it's great to see devs working to find themselves solutions to the incredibly tough task that is making smaller games stand out from the crowd in the great rat race for Steampremacy, and Zurawka does appear to care about making Bongo Cat a good game real people do actually enjoy playing. It might be a tad idealistic, but I'm just hoping there's a better way that'll allow devs to concentrate on just making the games they want to, without having to consider aiming for a short turnaround viral hit that the robo-grinders really love.</p>
<p>As the dev told EG: "It's a bit disappointing to see that it takes you to having to be successful to be successful."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-popular-bongo-cat-clicker-is-losing-money-but-its-worth-to-its-devs-lies-elsewhere]]></content:encoded>

That total includes a base salary of $1.3 million, $25.7 million in stock awards, $2.8 million via a non-equity incentive plan, and $678,000 in other compensation that largely includes personal security benefits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a figure that made Wilson the highest-earner on the company's executive team by some margin. Notably, it also confirms Wilson netted a fairly substantial compensation increase on the $25.6 million he received the year prior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does Wilson's compensation package compare to that of your median EA worker? According to EA's pay ratio breakdown for the 2025 fiscal year, the annual total compensation of its "median employee" was $117,302. Or, to put it another way, Wilson earned 260 times more than the median EA worker over the past 12 months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a notable shift compared to the 2024 fiscal year, which saw the median EA employee earn $148,704. In short, that means EA has handed more cash to its top executive while paying workers less—at least according to the methodology applied by the publisher.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-11-peak-hits-new-heights-layoffs-all-the-way-down-and-union-workers-make-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #11: Peak hits new heights, the layoffs keep on coming, and union workers make history</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Executive compensation rises at EA, but the median employee is earning less">Executive compensation rises at EA, but the median employee is earning less</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA uses a consistently applied compensation measure (CACM) to identify its median employee, which it explains includes full time, part-time, regular, and temporary staffers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's CACM considers the base salary of workers as of March 15, 2025; discretionary bonuses paid to employees throughout the fiscal year; the grant date fair market value of equity awards granted to employees in fiscal year 2025; and exchange rates used to convert all non-US currencies into US dollars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Other than annualizing base salary for permanent employees, we did not make any compensation adjustments whether for cost of living or otherwise in the identification process," added the company, which noted it's definition of "median employee" has remained consistent since 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall, all of the executives listed by EA received compensation increases of varying degrees in 2025.

<figure><a title="teamgroup memory cards" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b91240dae428/teamgroup-memory-cards.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: TeamGroup</em></figcaption></figure><p>TeamGroup, a UK-based memory brand, has just announced a new line of those ever-elusive MicroSD Express cards that we've all been trying to find the largest sizes of...with very little success.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/amp/">WCCFTech</a>, the company has detailed its Apex SD7.1 range, which includes storage sizes from 128gb right up to 1TB. From the press release, here's some further info. Oh, and we do like the little controller design on these, we must say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Next-Gen MicroSD Express Technology – Comprehensive Performance Upgrade</em></li>
<li><em>Fully Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2<sup>[4]</sup> with Broad Device Compatibility</em></li>
<li><em>Ultra-Fast Read/Write Speeds up to 800MB/s &amp; 700MB/s</em></li>
<li><em>Certified by SD Association’s SVP Program</em></li>
<li><em>Evolved High Capacity Storage Space of up to 1TB</em></li>
<li><em>Seamless 4K Recording to Capture Every Moment</em></li>
<li><em>Comprehensive Protection with Lifetime Warranty</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a bunch of details about how these cards are "resistant to water, shock, X-rays, static electricity, and extreme temperatures, enabling stable performance even in harsh environments." So, a standard Saturday night out in Glasgow with your Switch 2 should be fine, then.</p>
<p>Sounds great! Now, how much are they and where can we get all the biggest ones before they sell out? Well, for now, we have no details on pricing, but you can head over to the TeamGroup's website, where they detail <a href="https://www.teamgroupinc.com/en/shop/united-kingdom/">stores that should stock the cards once they release</a>. We've had a quick look and we can see that Overclockers is one supplier for UK-based gamers, whilst in the US you have Amazon and Newegg amongst your choices.</p>
<p>We'll keep you updated as soon as we've got further details on release dates and that all-important pricing!

            <title><![CDATA[The Outer Worlds 2 Won’t Let You Respec to Make Choices Truly Matter]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-wont-let-you-respec-to-make-choices-truly-matter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2-won%E2%80%99t-let-you-respec-to-make-choices-truly-matter.1229844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 may be a sequel, but it's definitely doing some things differently than its predecessor. One of those things is the ability for players to 'respec', that is to say, to change their allocation of perks, traits, and whatnot. The first game supported that, but the new game director Brandon Adler, who did not work on the original The Outer Worlds (but has credits in Obsidian RPGs like Neverwinter Nights 2, Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, and Avowed), has a different view on the matter. Speaking to RPG Site, he <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17785-outer-worlds-2-director-interview-respec-rpg-choice-consequences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>We don't allow respec. Lots of people love respec… that is definitely one way you can go about things. I personally want the player to understand their choices are permanent – they matter – and then they think more about their choices. There's a lot of times where you'll see games where they allow infinite respec, and at that point I'm not really role-playing a character, because I'm jumping between -- well my guy is a really great assassin that snipes from long range, and then oh, y'know, now I'm going to be a speech person, then respec again.</em></p>
<p><em>For me, it's not wrong that people like to play like that. But I just like to make sure... Look, if we're going to do The Outer Worlds 2, I want to make sure that the role playing is really strong. I want to make sure that you're building your character and really doubling down - making sure that role-playing comes through the whole experience.</em></p>
<p>It's definitely an interesting view. I can see where he's coming from, although others will be disappointed by the lack of flexibility when building their new character. However, you are still allowed a bit of experimentation in the beginning, as you can still respect while in the tutorial area.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debut</a> on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X and will be available on Game Pass from day one.</p>
