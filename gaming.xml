            <p>
Amazon has unveiled the latest fist of games it's making available for Prime members to download and keep as part of its regular monthly offerings, with July's titles set to include Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and Cat Quest 2.
</p>
<p>
In total, six titles are available for Prime members in July, with the full line-up as follow:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition</li>
<li>Cat Quest 2</li>
<li>Maneater</li>
<li>Midnight Fight Express</li>
<li>Masterplan Tycoon</li>
<li>YouTubers Life 2</li>
</ul>
<p>
So that's one stone-cold RPG classic, a casual action-RPG treat for co-op cat and dog lovers (honestly, the Cat Quest series is a delight), plus an open-world survival game about mauling everything you come across while playing as a massive shark.
</p>

<p>
As for the remaining three games, there's isometric beat-'em-up action in Midnight Fight Express, logistical resource management in Masterplan Tycoon, and YouTubers Life 2 - which, if I've learned anything from Eurogamer's Ian Higton, is basically: jorts.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the above, July makes a couple more titles available for streaming via Amazon Luna (for Prime members in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, or Poland, at least). Those games are Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game, Spells &amp; Secrets, Strayed Lights, and A Little Golf Journey.
</p>
<p>
Amazon Prime Gaming's July line-up news follows the announcement it's giving away 15 additional games to Prime members in the run-up to Prime Day on 16th-17th July. These include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, Card Shark, Hitman Absolution, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 - The Sith Lords, and Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX. So there's some decent, varied stuff there.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there's still time to snap up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-battlefront-2-free-with-prime-gaming-for-june-2024">June's Prime Gaming offerings</a>, which include Star Wars Battlefront 2, Weird West Definitive Edition, Mythforce, and Genesis Noir. Enjoy!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24187195/thiollier-st-trina-questline-steps-imbibe-nectar-sote-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="rojhAZ"><strong>Thiollier and St. Trina</strong> are NPCs you’ll meet at the Three-Path Cross <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182490/site-of-grace-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Site of Grace</a> early on in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a><em> </em>DLC.</p>
<p id="Y5hlIX">At first, Thiollier is just a vendor for poison-related items, but his full story — along with St. Trina’s — will take the rest of your time in the Shadow Realm to play out.</p>
<p id="3dIGrn">Our <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC guide will walk you through <strong>where to find Thiollier and St. Trina</strong>, and all the steps you’ll need to take to complete their questline.</p>

<hr id="2LvuVn">
<h2 id="rMyjkp"><strong>Thiollier and St. Trina locations</strong></h2>


<p id="YVj8kz">You’ll meet Thiollier first near the <strong>Pillar Path Cross Site of Grace</strong> in Gravesite Plain. You can reach him there before you take on Castle Ensis.</p>
<p id="GxuHd2">Later, after you enter <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180868/shadow-keep-walkthrough-dlc-sote">Shadow Keep</a>, you’ll be able to find St. Trina in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24184742/cerulean-coast-how-to-get-to-route-dlc">Cerulean Coast</a> at the <strong>Garden of Deep Purple Site of Grace</strong>, and Thiollier will move to be with her there.</p>
<hr id="UBpJhk">
<h2 id="mdagQz"><strong>Thiollier first meeting in Graveyard Plain</strong></h2>
<p id="SszPua">There’s not really a rush to go find Thiollier at his initial location by <strong>Pillar Path Cross Site of Grace</strong>, but, since his questline overlaps with Moore’s, it’s probably best to get that initial meeting out of the way early before things get complicated. You can get there before tackling Castle Ensis by crossing Ellac Greatbridge, and then just taking the right inside the solider camp.</p>

<p id="7dSpZ3">All the way at the southern tip of the Southern Shores, there’s a fissure you can climb (fall) down. That’s your next stop. At the bottom, you’ll find the The Fissure Site of Grace at the entrance to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24184742/cerulean-coast-how-to-get-to-route-dlc">Cerulean Coast</a> and the Stone Coffin Fissure — this is where the rune we broke was blocking your progress.</p>

<p id="HEMnbC">Once you hear St. Trina’s words, head back and try to pass the message on to Thiollier. It’ll take two tries, and he won’t be receptive.</p>

As it stood, every three months, Bungie would launch a new season of content, including new storylines, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-fishing-removing-content-1851516335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-fishing-removing-content-1851516335">activities</a></span>, and new gear. Narrative moments would be delivered piecemeal via weekly missions, radio chatter, and the occasionally rousing conclusion, but for the most part, seasons boiled down to the same repetition of events with different dialogue. Sometimes there wouldn’t even be new story content for weeks on end, leaving players to wonder when the narrative would pick back up.</p><p>By comparison, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s first episode, Echoes, concluded its first of three acts this week, and fans aren’t exactly thrilled with what they got. The bulk of Echoes content right now is a repeatable few activities, some new gear themed after the Vex enemy faction (who seem to be the focus right now), and the occasional cutscene or bit of dialogue. Now that the act has concluded, there’s nothing to really do but wait till the next one unlocks in a matter of weeks, meaning there’s basically a built-in down period now due to timegating. Sound familiar?</p><p>Suffice to say, seasons in <em>Destiny 2 </em>were often tiring, mind-numbing, and occasionally confusing to have to keep up with, and to make matters worse, every feature or mechanic introduced within them has been ripped out of the game once a new expansion launched. This approach has needed a change for a long time, and the new episodes should’ve been that. We’re off to a poor start if that’s the case, though, because things seem fundamentally the same as ever, if not a little worse.</p><p><em>Destiny</em> players have spent the past few weeks <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dj28ia/i_was_really_hoping_with_the_switch_to_episodes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dj28ia/i_was_really_hoping_with_the_switch_to_episodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voicing these exact sentiments</a></span> and hoping that the best is still to come. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1djauvb/episodes_have_been_a_let_down_so_far/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1djauvb/episodes_have_been_a_let_down_so_far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One post</a></span> on the official <em>Destiny</em> subreddit called the structure of the first episode “a let down so far,” suggesting that “Echoes so far has just been an extended seasonal model with more time gating.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dobzux/episodes_are_worse_dripfed_content_that_seasons/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dobzux/episodes_are_worse_dripfed_content_that_seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another</a></span> called episodes “worse dripfed content than seasons.” The assumption that some are running with is that since Echoes is wrapped up in the release of a new expansion, it’s also starting slow to not overwhelm players. If that just so happens to be the case, there’s now a lot of pressure on the rest of the episode to drum up some excitement.</p><p>Part of the problem is that Bungie never explicitly detailed what the difference here was going to be. While the studio touted episodes as a major shift that’d change the way it delivered content, it never broke down the model outside of a rough roadmap. Players understand that the three episodes following <em>The Final Shape </em>are going to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-next-year-1851530230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-next-year-1851530230">more standalone stories</a></span>, rather than the connective seasonal narratives fans are used to, but what they really wanted to know was what to expect and when to expect it.</p><p>Instead, Bungie waited forever to follow up, and even when they did detail the subjects of the episodes, they still offered little in the way of a breakdown as to what players should expect to be doing. By offering little in the way of communication—a problem Bungie keeps running into and then amending for—expectations were allowed to build, and now many are disappointed to see that they’re seemingly getting even shorter bursts of content in their favorite ongoing game.

<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that XDefiant has passed 11 million players since its launch.</p>



<p>In the brand-new Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Yves touched on the company’s success with one of its GaaS titles, XDefiant. On XDefiant’s success, Guillemot said, “There’s a lot of work to do, but it was able to attract 11 million players in a short time. And that number will increase with all the work done by the team to ensure Season One brings a lot more to the existing experience. It’s about making the right choices and sticking to them.”</p>



<p>In May 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively reported that XDefiant became <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s fastest-ever title to reach one million players 2.5 hours</a> after its launch. After one week, the game achieved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight million unique players</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Ubisoft has since limited access to player data for all its employees, which is limited to a select number of people. Fortunately, though, Insider Gaming can report that the 10 million mark was passed in the first week of June, which suggests that new players coming to the game have drastically dropped. It’s also understood that concurrent player numbers have started to decline significantly, but there are hopes from the studio that the game’s first season will bring them back. By all accounts, though, XDefiant has surpassed all internal expectations and met its desired 10% retention rate after one month.</p>



<p>Continuing on XDefiant’s success, Yves said, “Well, outside of it being continually updated, with different experiences and optimized gameplay, I’d love to see it as a serious esport. But really, for a game like this, there’s no limit to its future. And we’ve got a fantastic team on it, who are listening to our players~~,~~ and communicating with them, which is so crucial. We’ve started off strong, but there’s still a long way to go, and I’m excited for us to step up to the challenge.”</p>



<p>XDefiant Season 1 is scheduled to launch on June 2, 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"There are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich.”</h2></div><section><p>Ubisoft is working on multiple Assassin’s Creed remakes, according to CEO Yves Guillemot.</p><p>The publisher’s head spoke about its flagship series’ future in an interview published on the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft website</a>. When asked if the company will continue to offer a variety of experiences from the franchise, Guillemot told players to get excited for “some remakes.” It’s not clear just how many remakes there will be or which Assassin’s Creed stories they will cover.</p><p>“Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes,” Guillemot said, “which will allow us to revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/09/16/ac-1-1663336669216.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft has big plans for the future of Assassin's Creed.</figcaption></figure></output><p>He continued: “Secondly, to answer your question, there will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin’s Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including Assassin’s Creed Hexe, which we’ve announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. We’re going to surprise people, I think.”</p><p>One remake contender that fans may already have their eyes on is 2013’s Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag. Last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a> reported that Ubisoft Singapore was heavily involved in the development of a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-working-on-an-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake"><u>reimagining of the fourth mainline Assassin’s Creed game</u></a>. Now, more than a decade old, the pirate-themed action-stealth game remains a favorite among longtime enjoyers of the franchise, though the company hasn't gone as far as to confirm that a remake for this specific title is in the works.</p><p>Ubisoft has never released a full-on Assassin’s Creed remake before, but the series has a lot of options to pull from. The original Assassin's Creed launched in 2007 and was followed by the Ezio trilogy, which includes Assassin’s Creed 2, Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, and Assassin’s Creed: Revelations.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s first Iron Banner since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape expansion</a> kicks off on July 2, and it'll see some significant changes from the PvP event's past iterations. The biggest is that, for the first time ever, Iron Banner will last two weeks, instead of the typical one.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie detailed the Iron Banner changes in its latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_06_27_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week in Destiny blog post</a>. In the past, Iron Banner has come with a specific game mode for its week-long tenure; it used to be Control, but Bungie has been changing that up lately for some more dynamic, objective-based modes like Rift and Eruption. With the new two-week-long event, each week will feature a particular mode. For the first week, you'll play the king of the hill-like Control; in the second week, it'll be Tribute mode, which is similar to Supremacy, where you pick up crests dropped by players when they're killed.</p><p dir="ltr">Extending Iron Banner to two weeks should change some elements of it--namely, the grind should be a lot easier to rank up the event's reputation, gild its Triumph Seal, and earn its specific rewards. The week duration of past Iron Banners has meant that, if you really want to make the most of it, you have to play <em>a lot</em>. This longer version of the event should make it a little less of a pain for players who want to grab its special guns.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of guns, the upcoming Iron Banner will add two guns to the event's loot pool. The first is an updated version of Cimril's Dagger, a Kinetic hand cannon, which Bungie says has received a small boost to its stats and comes with a new pool of available perks. The second is Claws of the Wolf, the rapid-fire Void pulse rifle that has appeared in the event many times before. Claws can also roll with some of the new perks that have been added to the game in The Final Shape.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside more time to earn those guns, Bungie has also made the grind to unlock them a little easier. First, you need to rank up your reputation with Iron Banner vendor Lord Saladin by playing in the event, hitting Rank 4 for Cimril's Dagger and Rank 7 for Claws of the Wolf. Once that's done, you'll be able to focus Iron Banner engrams you earn from playing into whichever weapon you want. You'll also receive more rewards just for playing matches, Bungie wrote. "Wins now guarantee a random Iron Banner weapon while also having a very high chance to award an Iron Banner engram on top of that. As for defeats, both weapon drops and engrams have a higher drop rate, too."</p><p dir="ltr">As in the past, you'll get a reputation boost for wearing Iron Banner armor, equipping Iron Banner emblems, and using Iron Banner weapons while playing matches in the event. That should make grinding out those new gun rolls less arduous than they have been in the past, but we'll have to see how the changes actually feel in practice when Iron Banner returns next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, Assassin's Creed remakes are coming. The Ubisoft boss said as much in a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freshly-published interview</a> on the Ubisoft blog.</p>
<p>In the interview, Guillemot touched on Ubisoft's upcoming announced titles, XDefiant, the company's proprietary engines, and the Assassin's Creed franchise. Aside from saying that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-hexe-magic-powers-possession-fear-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a> will "surprise" fans, the CEO also confirmed the existence of several remakes of older entries in the series. According to Guillemot, the worlds in the older entries still have stories to be told. "Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes, which will allow us to revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich", the Ubisoft boss said.</p>
<p>Guillemot then said that the upcoming project Hexe will be vastly different from the recently-announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-smaller-origins-sized-map-not-all-of-japan-covered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>"Secondly, to answer your question, there will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including Assassin's Creed Hexe, which we've announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin's Creed Shadows. We're going to surprise people, I think."</p>
<p>Earlier this year we reported that development on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake might very well have kicked off late last year</a>. Interestingly enough, outlet Insider-Gaming writes to have seen "brief" footage of Black Flag's main protagonist, Edward Kenway, in the remake. This footage, however, was shown to the outlet under the condition that it wasn't made public.</p>
<p>Many consider Black Flag one of the best entries in the popular Assassin's Creed franchise. The game was originally released as a cross-gen title in 2013 for PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4, and Xbox One. The game was later also released for PC and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft is cooking up multiple Assassin's Creed game remakes, according to company CEO Yves Guillemot. And while he hasn't revealed which ones yet, the news follows reports last year that Ubisoft's much-loved Assassin's Creed Black Flag is getting the remake treatment.
</p>
<p>
Guillemot made the comments in an <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">interview on Ubisoft website</a>, discussing the company's upcoming portfolio. And while it offered little in the way of surprises - Yves once again talked about generative AI NPCs, insisting they could be "more intelligent, more interactive" (and not just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">dead-eyed creepy</a>) - he did manage to share a smattering of fresh information.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to those remakes. In answer to a question about Ubisoft's future plans for the series, Yves revealed, "Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes, which will allow us to revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernise them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich."

<p>
That lends credence to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">Kotaku report last year</a> claiming Skull and Bones studio Ubisoft Singapore was "heavily involved" in a remake of fan-favourite pirate-themed Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. However, the project was said to be "still in its earliest stages" and unlikely to be complete "for at least a few years". Of course, Guillemot has now confirmed <em>remakes</em>, opening up a world of possibility - although my money's probably on Assassin's Creed 2. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJcPc6OQ384">best joke in the series</a> deserves another chance to shine.
</p>
<p>
But Guillemot had a little more to say about Assassin's Creed, too. When asked if the difference in approaches between the leaner Mirage and more traditionally hefty upcoming Shadows was indicative of Ubisoft's future plans, Guillemot said, "There will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year."
</p>
<p>
"There are a lot of good things to come," he added, "including Assassin's Creed Hexe, which we've announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin's Creed Shadows. We're going to surprise people, I think."
</p>
<p>
Hexe, of course, is the one of several new series instalments that were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">confirmed to be in development</a> all the way back in September 2022. It's set in 16th century Europe and appears to be targeting a 2026 launch, with the mobile-focused Assassin's Creed Jade expected first in 2025. As for this year's feudal-Japan-set <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, that's coming to PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on 15th November.

He explains:</p><div><blockquote><p>“The metric we’re using to determine top-played is a combination of unique users and interest. <em>Hades 2</em> has only been out for a month, but so many Steam Deck players have it as one of their top played games for the entire year, that it was lifted in the rankings.”</p></blockquote></div><p>The new chart includes the current pricing and promotions for the top 100 titles (it’s launching on the same day that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185077/valve-steam-summer-sale-steam-deck-lcd-pc-deal-sale">Valve’s Summer Sale</a> is getting underway, which includes a discount on the LCD Steam Deck), day-to-day changes in each game’s ranking, and whether the title is verified for the console so it runs without compatibility issues.

Khvostov has dominated PvP as of late, but Bungie is nerfing the gun in ways that are likely to reel in its Crucible supremacy.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just Khvostov that's getting adjusted, either. In its latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_06_27_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week in Destiny blog post</a>, Bungie addressed three Exotics that are currently seeing a ton of use in the Crucible, and particularly in high-stakes Trials of Osiris weekend multiplayer event. Those are Red Death Reformed, a pulse rifle players get from the current season pass, and Speaker's Sight, an Exotic helmet for Warlocks. Khvostov and Speaker's Sight work particularly well together for an easy-to-use strategy that boosts the gun's power, while Red Death Reformed hits hard and heals its user when they score a kill, making it the go-to response to Khvostov.</p><p dir="ltr">A few things are going on with Khvostov to make it so strong. First off: It's bugged. Khvostov's Exotic perk makes its bullets occasionally ricochet, bouncing around and hitting multiple targets while dealing additional damage. Bungie said it wanted to reduce the recoil created by those ricochet bullets in particular, but the glitch in how the gun works caused <em>all</em> the bullets to receive that reduced recoil.</p><p dir="ltr">That means that Khvostov essentially gets maximum stability, reducing its kickback and making it <em>extremely</em> easy to use to land headshots. The gun also has very high aim assist, the stat that helps your bullets land where you want them. So taken together, both the low recoil and the high aim assist make Khvostov extremely easy to use well, and that's before you even take the ricochet bullets into consideration.</p><p dir="ltr">Those ricochet bullets get a boost whenever you pick up an Orb of Light, and this is where the Speaker's Sight Exotic helmet comes into play. That helmet allows Warlocks to turn their grenades into healing turrets, and whenever they drop one of those turrets, they generate an Orb of Power, instantly buffing Khvostov. So not only is the gun barely recoiling and making it easy to land headshots, but it's also firing ricochet rounds that can hit multiple targets and are easily powered up for even more damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie's addressing those issues by fixing the recoil bug on Khvostov, but it's trying not to make it <em>too much</em> worse. Players have been enjoying the low-recoil version of the gun, and Bungie wants to maintain that Exotic feel, so it's lowering its overall Stability level to 72, down 30 points. That should make it pretty stable, but not incredibly stable.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the ricochet bullets, which deal damage both on initial impact and on their ricochet strikes, Bungie feels they're too strong and too easy to activate in PvP, essentially giving a big damage buff to Khvostov users that's similar to much harder-to-activate perks on other guns. The initial bonus damage of a ricochet round is being reduced, from 15% to 5%, while the bouncing bullets are being ratcheted down from 18.4 points of damage on a hit to 4.6 damage. Bungie says those changes will maintain how often ricochets are happening, but make them less overwhelmingly powerful. However, Bungie doesn't want to alter how Khvostov feels in PvE activities, so those changes only apply to how the gun works in the Crucible.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Speaker's Sight, as of right now, the Exotic helmet's ability to generate Orbs of Power is being turned off in the Crucible altogether. Speaker's Sight will still generate Orbs normally in PvE, however.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie acknowledged that the helmet is making it too easy to generate a lot of Orbs of Power too easily in the Crucible, and that can give a big advantage for a lot of different player builds. While Bungie wants to maintain the fantasy the helmet facilitates--namely, of being a very focused healer--the developer says it needs to find a better balance between that function and how useful Orbs of Power can be in the Crucible.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, there's Red Death Reformed. Like Khvostov, it also benefits from high Stability and a tight recoil pattern that makes it very easy to use effectively in the Crucible, but unlike Khvostov, this is by design. Red Death has a special recoil pattern meant to make it fire tighter bursts than most pulse rifles, but Bungie says it has turned out to be <em>too</em> good at dealing out death against players, so the developer is bringing down the Stability stat a bit. The result should be that Red Death Reformed still has a specific feel when firing it and is still pretty effective, but with a little more kick that should balance it better against other pulse rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">As with all balancing changes when it comes to the Crucible, we'll have to wait and see how these changes alter the state of the PvP meta and whether they're enough to weaken Khvostov's dominance, or go too far and wind up taking it out of the rotation entirely. Destiny 2's Iron Banner kicks off next week, which should provide plenty of information on how the community receives the changes.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-frostpunk-2-its-not-the-cold-thats-your-enemy-but-human-nature">Frostpunk 2</a> is being delayed so its developers have time to address player feedback gathered during the beta earlier this year. The survival citybuilder was originally due to begin shovelling orphans into the furnace in July, but those dear children now have a reprieve until September 20th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Based on the surveys we received from you after playing, the average rating you gave the Beta was 8 out of 10," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775">the announcement of the delay</a>. "We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, the Beta was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, the Beta was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet. This allowed us to prioritize things better, and bring to the front the features and modifications we were already working on (we hope!) you’ll enjoy the most."
</p>
<p>To deliver those newly prioritised features and "guarantee the best possible experience at launch," 11bit say they need more time.
</p>
<p>The full announcement goes into some detail about the changes that are being introduced since the beta, and they don't sound small. Temperature and heat-based systems, a core part of the Frostpunk experience, are being revised. A new resource is being introduced to make city-building "more strategic". Players will be able to modify city districts after they're first constructed. Faction behaviour will more closely align to their lore. The UI is being revamped to make the world more readable. 
</p>
<p>11bit are also adding a new feature they call "Zoom Stories", which will let you snap closer to your city in order to "watch the day-to-day life of your citizens." The aim is to make players feel more attached to those orphans as in the short spell before you shovel them into the furnace.
</p>
<p>Matt Cox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2-reveals-a-wasteland-thats-more-about-wheelin-and-dealin-than-mere-survivin">enjoyed his time with the Frostpunk 2 beta</a> back in April, finding it "quite promising" after playing a relatively "small sliver" of the full game. We'll now need to wait longer before we find out whether that promise has been fulfilled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-do-better-justice-to-its-settings-americana-thanks-to-the-new-boston-studio-says-cdpr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new episode of the AnsweRED podcast</a> mainly focuses on a chat with the developers leading the work on Project Orion, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly built Boston studio</a> can bring to the game.&nbsp;Acting Executive Producer Dan Hernberg explained:</p>
<p><em>I think Cyberpunk is obviously a uniquely American story. It's got a lot of like punk energy, and it was written by an American, so it just seems right to do it in America.</em></p>
<p>Associate Game Director Paweł Sasko also shared a specific example: Cyberpunk 2077, which was made in Poland, had the wrong manhole covers for a US-based city.</p>
<p><em>There's this interesting story after the release of Cyberpunk 2077 that blew up on Reddit at some point, and it's the manhole debacle. Like, the manholes that are covering the roads, right? There was this post with the guy saying that there is this immersive breaking bug in Cyberpunk, and the bug was about the fact that the covers for manholes for a sewer were the manholes that you use normally in Europe, in Germany, for a pavement. Those are not manholes that you normally cover in America on the streets.</em></p>
<p><em>This is basically showing you the differences, right? When you go to America, there's things like hydrants, where they are placed and how they look like. The street lights, the positions of that, the trash bins, right? They're in the front of the house, right by the street. In Poland, in Europe, you don't see it almost anywhere. There's so much nuance. Dan, when we talk about it, he calls it the Americana.</em></p>
<p>Dan Hernberg then said:</p>
<p><em>Our curbs are different, our color is different on all of our signs. Everything's just slightly different.&nbsp; It doesn't break immersion, but it's just that little thing where you're like, "Well, maybe this wasn't made by people who live here or people who fully understand all of American culture."</em></p>
<p><em>I also think that being in America, it allows us to have those cultural touchpoints with the larger American, you know, kind of influence with Hollywood. Obviously, Cyberpunk 2077 took place in LA, and so there's just kind of all these cultural touchpoints and things that we can kind of interact with, whether that's from music or story or just different parts of America that are interesting to explore.</em></p>
<p>One of the perks of the Boston studio is that CD Projekt RED will be able to tap into the North American talent pool, including graduates from high-profile universities like Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Moreover, they are collaborating with the existing Vancouver studio on Project Orion, with Hernberg teasing that the Canadian team is working on some 'really cool stuff' for the sequel.</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel is undoubtedly going to take a while to materialize. That said, CD Projekt RED obviously built the new studio specifically to build the game in parallel with the new The Witcher saga. Indeed, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-aims-to-increase-the-cadence-of-game-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aims to speed up the cadence of its game releases</a>, so you can hold on to that hope of playing Orion within this decade.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s beloved driving MMO, The Crew, was taken offline on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-taking-the-crew-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 31, 2024</a>. But the game’s community hasn’t given up; some are yet pushing hard to revive the game. In a heartwarming display of dedication, a group of passionate modders, Whammy 4, have announced their commitment to resurrect the title. </p>



<p>Their upcoming project, The Crew Offline+Online Server Emulator, showcases their unwavering love for the game. Through this project, they aim not only to restore the game to its former glory but also to add new features that the developers never did, giving the community a renewed sense of hope.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-in-business">Back in Business</h2>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> interviewed a member of the Whammy4 team, and they spoke more about the project. The member stated that the team had begun work on their project as soon as Ubisoft announced The Crew’s closure in December 2023. </p>



<p>The member said that their project retains the same game everyone knows and loves, but instead of using Ubisoft’s servers, the community will have to use Whammy4’s servers to access the game. Whammy4 recently released a new video on YouTube: The Crew – First Roadtrip After The Shutdown.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Crew - First Roadtrip After The Shutdown" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIo4l-BpK8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The Whammy4 member then speaks about game preservation, stating that if things keep on going the way they are now, then pretty soon, most video games that players love will become dead video games. Hence, game preservation should be the utmost priority “before the situation spins out of control.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Returning to The Crew, Whammy4 talks about how this is the only title where players get to cruise around a scaled-down and open-world version of the United States of America, and “to give up on such a remarkable game would be a crime.” Whammy4 believes they should be able to get the project up and running for the franchise’s 10th Anniversary, which arrives in December 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ubisoft revealed The Crew Motorfest’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-motorfest-year-2-plans-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 2 plans</a> earlier this month. Are you excited about The Crew being revived? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/27/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>As BioWare prepared to show me the character creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in its Edmonton, Canada, offices, I expected something robust – it's 2024, character creators have come a long way, and Bioware has a rich history of good customization. Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet. At the heart of it is inclusivity, Veilguard game director Corinne Busche tells me before letting me guide her through creating my own character.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="25af3836-ce01-4d19-ba05-b9c3fa20f533" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>As is usual, there are four races to choose from: Elves, Qunari, Humans, and Dwarves. After selecting Qunari, Busche pages through various presets, explaining the game allows for more detailed looks at each and the ability to choose pronouns with she/her, he/him, and they/them separately from gender, select different body types, and more. You can view your character, referred to as Rook in-game, in four different lighting scenes at any time, including The Veilguard's keynote purple hue, a bright and sunny tropical day, and a gothic night.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I joke with the team that after spending upwards of an hour creating my Dragon Age: Inquisition character in 2014, I immediately restarted the game after seeing him in the first cutscene; the in-game lighting made my hair color look terrible amongst other issues I had with my Inquisitor. Veilguard creative director John Epler says the team is aware of countless stories like that with Inquisition and its green-hued character creator, adding BioWare worked hard to squash that concern in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Head and body presets can be selected individually and customized to your liking with 40 different complexions that include smooth, rugged, youthful, and freckled skin tones, skin hues ranging from cool to neutral to warm, undertones to those skin tones, and even a melanin slider. Busche tells me BioWare relied on consultation to represent all people authentically. There's a Vitiligo slider (where you can adjust the intensity and amount of it) and sliders for your forehead, brow, cheeks, jaw, chin, larynx, and scalp. You can select your undergarments, with nudity as well because "this is a mature RPG," Busche adds, and use the "Body Morpher" to select three presets for each corner of a triangle and then move a cursor within it to morph your body or head into a mix of these presets. It's an impressive technology I'd like to see adopted in other games.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>I can keep going: You can adjust height, shoulder width, chest size, glute and bulge size, hip width, how bloodshot your eyes are, how visible cataracts are, the sclera color, how crooked your nose is, how big its bridge is, the size of nostrils and the nose tip, and there are as many sliders, if not more, for things like Rook's mouth and ears. On ears alone, I see you can adjust asymmetry, depth, rotation, earlobe size, and even add cauliflower ear to your Rook. Busche says makeup blends modern stylings with the fantasy of Dragon Age with more than 30 options, including eyeliner intensity, color, glitter, eye shadow, lips, and blush.</p>

<p>Tattoos are just as customizable alongside options for scars and paint. Tattoos, scars, and paint are very culturally relevant to some lineages, BioWare tells me, with unique tattoos for elves, for example. You can add tattoos to Rook's face, body, arms, and legs, and you can adjust things like intensity, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Im most impressed, however, by the hair options on display; there are a ton, and as someone with long hair, I'm especially excited about the fun selections I can make. You can finally dye your hair with non-traditional colors, and it's gorgeous. EA's Frostbite engine uses the Strand system to render each style fully with physics. "The technology has finally caught up to our ambition," Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes says.</p>

<p>After customizing all of that and selecting our Qunari's horn type and material (of which there are more than 40 options to choose from), it's time to pick a class out of the Rogue, Mage, and Warrior – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/25/breaking-down-dragon-age-the-veilguards-classes-and-factions">read more about Veilguard's classes here</a>. Since we built a Qunari, we went with Warrior. For the penultimate step of the character creator, at least during the demo BioWare shows me, we select a faction. Out of the six options, we select the pirate-themed Lords of Fortune.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a6dade5c-c48d-4b2d-ac89-eae180556205" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>"Rook ascends because of competency, not because of a magical McGuffin," BioWare core lead and Mass Effect executive producer Michael Gamble tells me in contrast to Inquisition's destiny-has-chosen-you-characterization.</p>

<p>"Rook is here because they choose to be and that speaks to the kind of character that we've built," Busche adds. "Someone needs to stop this, and Rook says, 'I guess that’s me.'"</p>

<p>Ready to begin our Rook's journey, we select a first and last name and one of four voices out of English masculine, English feminine, American masculine, or American feminine options. There's a pitch shifter for each voice, too, allowing you to tweak it to your liking further.</p>

<p>Don't stress too much about locking in your character creations before beginning the game – the Mirror of Transformation, which is found in Veilguard's main hub, The Lighthouse, allows you to change your physical appearance at any time.&nbsp;However, class, lineage, and identity are locked in and cannot be changed after you select them in the game's character creator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From here, we're off to Minrathous, and you can read more about that famed city in our cover story, which is available <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2024/06/18/the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-digital-issue-is-now-live">here</a>.</p>
