<p><em>Today, Jim and Alana are heading off to Kalos for Lumiose City Fashion Week...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>What's the best part about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>? The battle system? The catching? The Wild Zones? The Z-A Royale? No. All of those are factually incorrect answers. The best thing about Pokémon Legends: Z-A is buying clothes. Lots and lots of clothes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59qyhvit&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>I'll hear no other opinions on the matter. Z-A is far from the character customisation of a <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate</a> or a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout</a>, but who needs 14 types of nose, forehead shapes, and muscle builds when you could have berets, wide-leg pants, and a frilly little satchel?</p>
<p>I've put more time into my outfit choices than I care to admit, and I know for a fact that fellow fashionista Alana has done the same. So join us as we celebrate Lumiose Fashion Week (an event we made up to distract from the Poké Dollars we've spent on shoes) by styling out some of our favourite fits.</p>
<h2>The 'Official' Lumiose City Fashion Show</h2>
<figure data-uuid="de097e1fa51c5"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de097e1fa51c5/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-woman-taking-photo-of-a-woman-in-silver-dress-7778884/">Nintendo Life / Ron Lach / Pexels</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, it's not 'official', nor is it a 'fashion show', but we've each been rifling through our virtual wardrobes to pick out the very best 'fits we can muster.</p>
<p>And of course we've based our looks on our beloved teams — what do you think we are? Rookies?</p>
<h3>Norman's Lumiose looks</h3>
<p>I never normally make myself in a Pokémon game. I almost always pick a different gender and name from my own and see the game through a <em>character's</em> eyes instead.</p>
<p>The exception is when the Pokémon game in question offers a bunch of outfits that I'd very much like to add to my real-life wardrobe. Then, Trainer Jim needs to have a shaggy bob, he needs to wear glasses, and he needs to slay every. single. look.</p>
<p>And so we arrive at my Lumiose collection. Not so much an attempt to directly imitate my Pokémon as it is to match their vibes. If those static NPCs could turn their heads when I walk down the street in my little Gengar number, they would. If they could move their eyes, I'd catch them with my vibrant Feraligatr get-up.</p>
<p>It's new. It's fresh. It's <a href="https://youtu.be/mIydlgER51o?si=RsIJD2nH-Bf1tbfA&amp;t=53">fashion</a>.</p>
<h4>Feraligatr Fit</h4>
<figure data-uuid="f57dc514a4f5d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f57dc514a4f5d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My beloved, vibrant boi needed a big, bold fit to match. Once you see that cream stripe as a little exposed belly sticking out from under a crop top, there's no going back. As for the trousers, well, they're the best money can buy in Lumiose and I won't hear otherwise.</p>
<h4>Absol-utely Fabulous</h4>
<figure data-uuid="6507534c4b6ef"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6507534c4b6ef/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Absol is high-end and edgy, so my fit is too. A white leather jacket and turtleneck are a bold pairing with some chino shorts, but those space boots tie everything together.</p>
<h4>Venusaur 'Venturing</h4>
<figure data-uuid="db4a98a33cff7"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db4a98a33cff7/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>What is Venusaur if not a streetwear hiker's dream? The cargos, thicc trainers, and cap are all about presenting a hip exterior, while the fluffy jumper ups the cuddle-factor.</p>
<h4>Gengar Get-Up</h4>
<figure data-uuid="df0d3a87bfd9d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df0d3a87bfd9d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wanted the Gengar fit to feel like it was floating, hence the vaguely camo bottoms and floral boots. It's a blessing that I don't own one of these beanies in real life. You'd never see me without it.</p>
<h4>Cosy Camerupt</h4>
<figure data-uuid="7d6eee166ee96"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d6eee166ee96/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sure, Camerupt might have a tough exterior (just look at that scowl!), but there's something about him that just feels cosy — hence the comfy cardigan and wide-leg jeans. I'm colour matching a little, but this one's all about the vibes.</p>
<h4>Ooh La La, Gardevoir</h4>
<figure data-uuid="978af0e90dfb1"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/978af0e90dfb1/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Call off the stylists, I've found my favourite fit! The whites are classy, chic, and clean. There's a subtle floral undertone in the loafers, on my beret and in the earrings. Don't even get me started on that hip pop!</p>
<p>If you see this pair heading for you in the mall, you'd better know your azures from your ceruleans.</p>
<h3>Hagues' Kalos kit</h3>
<p>Okay, first off, let's address the Copperajah in the room — I do not have long blue hair in real life. But this trainer also isn't me. This is Kisa, an avatar character I've been using for quite a while. She's my Warrior of Light in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and, as a result, I've grown quite attached to her and sometimes let her jump ship into other games.</p>
<p>Anyone who's played FFXIV knows that 'glamour is the true end-game', so you <em>know</em> we've got some fashion chops here.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm usually a <em>little</em> more girly with my looks, but my team is a mix of ethereal, dopey, and cool. How do you make that work? Well...</p>
<h4>Florges' Fall Florals</h4>
<figure data-uuid="dcc14a95a5e2d"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dcc14a95a5e2d/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>I know</em> I went florals for Florges... but only a little. I can't not. (I'm sorry, Miranda.)</p>
<p>But I didn't go <em>full</em> floral, I went Fall floral. I knew I had to fit the grey morning of Lumiose a little, so a cute little sweater and some sneakers rounded things out.</p>
<h4>Eclectic Eelektross</h4>
<figure data-uuid="eab7bcf9105b2"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eab7bcf9105b2/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the more difficult looks to assemble, Eelektross' colour scheme is gorgeous, but there aren't many easy matches here. The headphones were a must, as was yellow, but I can't match Canari's drip that well.</p>
<h4>Trendy Tyrantrum</h4>
<figure data-uuid="8fea7c3bed3d1"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8fea7c3bed3d1/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Chic fossil hunter was my goal here, but Tyrantrum isn't exactly going to pair with an art deco jumpsuit. A boilersuit with a headband, though? Now that's a little bit cute.</p>
<h4>Hawlucha's a Hipster</h4>
<figure data-uuid="2a70dc4907199"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a70dc4907199/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am not a sportswear person, so I was most worried about pairing Kisa up with Hawlucha. Luckily, bright colours are kinda a lucha libre thing, therefore a Hawlucha thing. I can do brights; <em>that's</em> my thing.</p>
<h4>Chandelure Chic</h4>
<figure data-uuid="e6b4b7d49d1ba"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6b4b7d49d1ba/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ghost Pokémon are a gift for fashion, but there are so many obvious routes you could go down. Ultimately, Chandelure screams class to me, so an expensive suit and the hotel interior mean this was the easiest outfit to put together. Just save those Poké Dollars...</p>
<h4>Feraligatr feels Mega Fetching</h4>
<figure data-uuid="91a19b699ec30"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Fashion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91a19b699ec30/pokemon-legends-z-a-fashion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Totodile line has never been fierce to me — it's always been a goofy line that <em>tries</em> to be fierce. And I love that the Mega evolution for Feraligatr leans into that.</p>
<p>I adore Jim's vibrant red and blue look, but I went a little more classic sailor. Very French.</p>

Oh yes, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>. And we've got some fireworks in here.</p>
<p>Spooky season has passed and many of us are now looking ahead to the 'H' season (or perhaps there's some Turkey in the near future for you for those of you in the US). So it's time to load up on the best games you can get on the eShop for the chilly months ahead.</p>
<p>Just in case you need reminding, here are the rules: Our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from last month (that's October 2025) from our suite of reviews. The three games with the highest scores will make the podium. It's that simple!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vuwmxg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>It's been a crazy busy month what with Pokémon and tons of Switch 2 ports and indie releases, though that feels like every month at the moment, doesn't it? Every eShop game we scored a 7/10 or above is eligible here.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a big one missing — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies Replanted</a>. We're working on our full review and it'll be with you soon, but until then, make sure you check out <a href="https://youtu.be/zik-Cx7oxQE?si=70EZwzHIvWj1mkfB">Felix's video on the Switch 2 release</a>.</p>
<p>Alrighty then, here are all the games that didn't <em>quite</em> make the cut for the top three; plenty of fantastic games, but the cream of the crop was <em>very</em> good this time around:</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">3rd Place - Absolum (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>When Dotemu speaks, we listen. And we've been particularly excited about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, a brand new IP from the French studio that made its name on Streets of Rage 4 and Windjammers 2. Developed alongside Guard Crush Games and Supamonks, this is a roguelike beat 'em up with tons of style and customisation.</p>
<p>Besides looking <em>beautiful</em>, Absolum is all about finding the build that fits your play and combo style. You can play as one of four characters either alone or in two-player co-op and go through run after run as you try to save the world.</p>
<p>It's fiendishly good, and on Switch 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/absolum">we scored it a 9/10</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:188446 @ 1762099413 -->
<p><em>Note: Absolum did receive a physical launch just a few weeks after its release, but we've allowed it to remain part of the votes this month.</em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">2nd Place - Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p>It may not be Metroid Prime Pinball, but hey, we don't <em>need</em> Samus when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action</a> is loaded up. A bullet hell pinball follow up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demons_tilt">Demon's Tilt</a>? Cyberpunk imagery, a huge table, 9 balls? You'll never need another pinball table again.</p>
<p>You have a three-story pinball table to conquer, and it'll take you a good while to get your head around everything you can do in-game. But that Genesis-style soundtrack and those neon visuals will be more than enough to tempt you back for one more go.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/xenotilt-hostile-pinball-action">another 9/10 for us</a> on the Switch 1. Heck of a game, that.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:192469 @ 1762099166 -->
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Ball x Pit  (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a> is impossible to get away from right now. If you're a fan of roguelikes, Breakout, or Vampire Survivors, then you've probably already poured hours into this thing. It's <em>the</em> hot thing this October, and it's no surprise it won our staff's eShop Selects vote.</p>
<p>This mishmash of things, which includes base-building, multiple playable characters, tons of ball combinations (no giggling in the back, there), and waves and waves of enemies to stop you on each of your runs, is a cacophony of numbers, colours, and euphoria. Once you nail the formula with one character, you'll want to do it with them all. Keep aiming, bouncing, and combining, and you'll get there soon enough.</p>
<p>Rounding out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ball-x-pit">9/10s this month</a>, congrats to Ball x Pit for completely surprising us and taking away all of our free time! Oh! And a Switch 2 version dropped just last week, so go try it for yourself.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-october-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a brief update posted over the weekend, Battlefield Studios noted an "issue" that was impacting the amount of XP earned in the mode, and, to ensure "fair and consistent progression", it has made a brief change whilst it investigates.</p>

Is the Animalese-to-English translator up and running? It is? Good. Welcome back to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Last time</a>, we put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> under the microscope, and it was a pretty close-run contest.

<p>We've got Animal Crossing on the mind this week (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">why on Earth could that be?</a>), so we're matching up two covers from the wonderful DS entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/animal_crossing_wild_world">Wild World</a>.

<p>There are just two designs to check out this week, so let's get to it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:100046,193209 @ 1762097441 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26c0bab9dd418"><a title="Animal Crossing: Wild World - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26c0bab9dd418/animal-crossing-wild-world-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6281-animal-crossing-wild-world">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're all familiar with this one, right? The Western design is, well, it's a world. What's more, it's adorable. Just look at those polygonal little guys going about their lives! It crams in a good amount of series iconography, too, with plenty of familiar faces, stores and floating packages. It's just a very pleasing cover to look at.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e5dc7f0d8011e"><a title="Animal Crossing: Wild World - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5dc7f0d8011e/animal-crossing-wild-world-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6281-animal-crossing-wild-world">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design is similar, but different. Rather than present the world as a cohesive whole, this cover bisects it, pushing the characters from the Western box art to the top and bottom. All of the characters are still present and correct, but a few crop up in different positions to account for the division — get off the roof, Celeste!</p>
<p>It all leaves more room for the central logo, it's true, but we miss the sense of unity brought by seeing the world as a whole. Maybe that's just us, though.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! W</em><em>e'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-animal-crossing-wild-world]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Darkstone Digital, the developer behind the viral hit The Mortuary Assistant, has unveiled its next game: Paranormal Activity: Threshold.</p>
<p>With warnings for language, violence, murder, suicide, and "references to the occult", the horror game lets you play across multiple timelines, hunt and communicate with entities, "perform demonic rituals to alter your fate", and offers multiple endings that "expand the story".</p>
<p>No release date has been revealed as yet, but Steam lists it as "coming soon". You can check out its announcement teaser below:</p>

<p>"Daniel and Jessica Stewart have decided to remodel their first home," the description teases. "Old and dilapidated, they begin to record the adventures of their renovation, but the couple soon discovers their new home hides much more than asbestos and faulty wiring.</p><p>"As they dig deeper into the mysterious house, their excitement turns to concern when they uncover strange markings and items hidden within the walls. The more time they spend there, the clearer it becomes that they are not the home's only occupant. Sinking deeper into the influences of a dark presence, Daniel and Jessica are unprepared for the horrifying events that follow."</p>
<p>The Mortuary Assistant is, of course, one of the biggest horror games of the last few years, weaving an unusual story around an unusual job in which a mortuary assistant has to grapple with both the dead and the living dead. It was so successful, in fact, that earlier this year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arrow-star-willa-holland-to-lead-the-mortuary-assistant-film-adaptation">production has started on the film adaptation of horror work sim The Mortuary Assistant</a>, with Willa Holland in the lead role.</p>
<p>Holland - who has previously starred in Arrow and Gossip Girl - will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as, you guessed it, a mortuary assistant. Holland is joined by House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire actor Paul Sparks, who plays Rebecca's boss Raymond Delver in the upcoming film.</p>

<p>Online Arcade is also "coming soon"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Digital Eclipse launched its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> this week, and while it's a good history lesson, the team already has plans to improve certain aspects of it.</p>
<p>This starts with a patch dropping today on Steam, with "other platforms" to follow next week. This update will come with audio improvements, improvements for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_4">Mortal Kombat 4</a> and some stability improvements for the Genesis titles.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown about this latest hotfix via the official Steam game page, and "additional fixes" are planned to be addressed in the coming days in "another update".</p>
<h2>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection - Hotfix (Coming soon)</h2>
<p>The following issues have been addressed in this hotfix update:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved audio buffer for online play</em></li>
<li><em>Restore missing audio in 32X MKII</em></li>
<li><em>General improvements to MK4</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed issue that caused UMK3 to reboot after Scorpion fatality</em></li>
<li><em>General stability improvements for Genesis titles</em></li>
<li><em>Pause button hold time reduced by 50%</em></li>
<li><em>One-Button Fatalities added for all arcade titles</em></li>
<li><em>General stability updates to Music Player</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">In case you missed our review</a>, the team has also outlined a future update for "lobbies and online play", including the Online Arcade, which is "coming soon". This mode has also been detailed on the <a href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/media/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-launch-faq">official FAQ page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will add Online Arcade, a system where you can create lobbies, choose the players, and rotate games for the tastes of your private group of friends. We're finalizing the UI details on these features now.</p>
<p><strong>Will Online Arcade allow players to create private lobbies for online play?</strong>‍</p>
<p>Online Arcade will give players the opportunity to create private or public rooms, select the games they want to play, and invite friends to join in. Each room can host up to 16 players, and multiple games can be played simultaneously; think of it as your personal Mortal Kombat game room, filled with just the games you love most. On individual games within the room, players rotate playing in a classic arcade "winner stays" queue structure or they can choose to simply spectate.</p>
<p>‍This Online Arcade feature is much more robust than Quick Match and is more ambitious than what Digital Eclipse has done in its previous games, so it demands additional testing both internally and from external partners before it's ready for players to enjoy. We expect this feature to be added via an update within a few weeks after launch, but this is dependent on internal and first-party approval timeframes, which can vary between platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for crossplay support, although it's not available at launch and the team is "not committing to adding cross-play", once same-system matches are working smoothly, it will take a "second look" and see if cross-play is "feasible". The developer is also looking into ranked matches.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-ensemble-studios-dev-blames-xbox-head-don-mattrick-for-%E2%80%98killing%E2%80%99-halo-mmo.1341511/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once upon a time, Halo was set to secure an MMO dubbed ‘Titan’, pieced together by Ensemble Studios, a company shut down in January 2009. In a scalding post on social media, Sandy Petersen, who had been with Ensemble since the 1990s, revealed that Don Mattrick, former overseer of the Xbox brand, killed the project to protect his corporate bonus.</p>



<p>This pulling back of the curtain is a fiery look back at the scrapping of a game that, on paper, sounded very interesting.</p>



<h2 id="h-titan-was-a-prequel-mmo-in-the-halo-universe">Titan Was a Prequel MMO in the Halo Universe</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/1982965186781954468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>, Sandy Petersen, who was once a level designer working on Doom and Quake before joining Ensemble Studios, revealed why Halo’s ‘Titan’ MMO never saw the light of day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, Ensemble Studios started planning a gigantic MMO set in the Halo universe. We code-named it Titan. It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago, before the Halos were set off &amp; destroyed all sentient life in the Galaxy.</p>



<p>It was all brought to naught when Don Mattrick realized that his stock bonus was based on the income MS had from games in 3 years.</p>



<p>You see, we estimated 3.5 years to finish Titan if we did it right. And that’s beyond Mattrick’s drop dead date. </p>



<p>So by firing ALL of Ensemble, he didn’t have to pay for our expensive studio for 3 years and he didn’t care about Titan.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Petersen revealed that the would-be Halo MMO would have featured an expansive universe that allowed players to assume control of Forerunners or Covenant characters. The Flood also had a starring spot in the game, but wouldn’t have been playable, of course.</p>



<p>The quest lines were mapped out, the homeworlds were designed, and Microsoft estimated that the game would have made a whopping <strong>$1.1 billion</strong>.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In 2008, Ensemble Studios started planning a gigantic MMO set in the Halo universe. We code-named it Titan. It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago, before the Halos were set off &amp; destroyed all sentient life in the Galaxy. </p><p>I was in charge of the universe-building -… <a href="https://t.co/8eaSbEt81X">pic.twitter.com/8eaSbEt81X</a></p></div>— Sandy Petersen 🪔 (@SandyofCthulhu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/1982965186781954468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Petersen went on to further slam Mattrick, settling on it being part of the executive’s nature in the industry:P</p>



<blockquote>
<p>All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made. I don’t believe he did justice to MicroSoft stockholders but hey – Don started as an EA hatchet man so what would you expect?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Petersen and the wider Ensemble Studios team were tasked with bringing to life this ancient Halo setting, and the game was seemingly deep in development when the plug was pulled, and the hand on the cable was Don Mattrick’s. It was once suggested that Titan would have taken unique concepts, such as time travel, and taken a deep dive into the lore of Halo.</p>



<p>Don Mattrick served as the President of Microsoft’s Interactive Entertainment arm, overseeing the strategy of Xbox until he departed from the firm in 2013 to instead serve as the CEO of Zynga.</p>



<p>Halo’s Titan isn’t to be confused with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-blizzards-cancelled-mmo-titan/">Blizzard’s Titan MMO</a>, another canceled game that came to a head after an $80 million investment.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kt-rolster-shatter-expectations-to-reach-worlds-2025-finals-for-the-first-time.1341508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KT Rolster has pulled something monumental out of the bag, handing Gen.G an insane loss at the League of Legends World Championship in Shanghai. This is the first time that KT Rolster has reached such lofty heights, and it came after knocking out one of the favorites to win the entire event.</p>



<p>The devastating loss kicks Gen.G out of the tournament in fourth place, mere weeks after winning the 2025 Mid-Season Invitational, the Esports World Cup, <strong>and </strong>the LCK 2025 season.</p>



<h2 id="h-gen-g-fails-to-make-finals-yet-again">Gen.G Fails to Make Finals Yet Again</h2>



<p>Gen.G has now failed to make the finals at LoL Worlds <strong>eight years in a row</strong>. In 2021, the organization secured a third-place finish, which is the closest the team has been thus far to making the number one spot.</p>



<p>KT Rolster proved to be the obstacle too strong to overcome for Gen.G this time around. The South Korean squad put up one hell of a fight, going the distance in a best-of-five series mere days after devastating CTBC Flying Oyster in a 3 – 0 sweep.</p>



<p>The team now has a spot in the Grand Final, poised to fight either T1 or Top Esports. It’ll be one for the history books, especially with T1 sitting on a burner with the squad’s typical Worlds buff.</p>



<p>In KT Rolster’s history in the League of Legends space, the organization has won almost <strong>nothing </strong>to write home about, and in the last three Worlds tournaments the brand has attended, lacklustre finishes have left fans wanting more. Even if KT Rolster doesn’t win at the November 9 final, it’ll be the biggest single prize the organization has ever claimed – $800,000.</p>



<p>Do you have any high expectations for KT Rolster, and do you believe the team could beat a dominant T1? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamerlegion-ceo-disputes-100-thieves-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamerlegion-ceo-disputes-claims-of-100-thieves-player-buyout-but-confirms-return.1341505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, rumors surfaced in the Counter-Strike space that 100 Thieves is preparing for a mighty comeback to the scene, signing Håvard ‘rain’ Nygaard to lead a new roster backed by GamerLegion talent. In an <strong>even more recent post</strong>, the CEO of GamerLegion confirmed that <strong>no such sales </strong>are lined up.</p>



<p>However, the CEO, Nicolas Reber, <span><strong>confirmed&nbsp;</strong>that the organization met</span> with 100 Thieves to discuss ‘their intention to come back to CS’. This effectively bolsters the recent suggestions that the LA-based company is breaking back into Counter-Strike.</p>



<h2 id="h-gamerlegion-isn-t-selling-players-to-100-thieves">GamerLegion Isn’t Selling Players to 100 Thieves</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/GL_L3gi/status/1984552479753978259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>, Nicolas Reber, CEO of GamerLegion, confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Guess its worth to share. </p>



<p>We had a chat with 100T few weeks ago about their intention to come back to CS, but there is no active discussion about selling any players or cores. We focus on the team we have right now. </p>



<p>Lets get that 3rd place at @pglesports!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-returning-counter-strike-rain-signing/">signing of rain</a> hasn’t been announced yet either, so there’s still time for that claim to be refuted.</p>



<p>100 Thieves was last seen in Counter-Strike more than five years ago. It’s a new world these days, but with 100 Thieves preparing to pull out of League of Legends after Worlds, there’s room for a new roster to rise. The iconic organization fields a current roster in painfully few games, and Counter-Strike is an easy one to step into.</p>



<p>Some have questioned 100 Thieves potentially signing GamerLegion talent, given that there are ‘much better organizations’ to pick from and GamerLegion has had more than a year of bad luck, failing to secure a single major victory for a long while.</p>



<p>What do you think about the potential return of 100 Thieves to Counter-Strike? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PGL is yet again doubling down on an ongoing commitment to Counter-Strike 2 after unveiling a huge competitive calendar for 2028. Between 2027 and 2028, a whopping <strong>15 Tier 1 tournaments </strong>will play out, including a full slate of <strong>eight events </strong>for 2028 alone. It’s easily one of the most ambitious schedules in Counter-Strike’s esports history.</p>



<p>PGL’s 2027 calendar is looking similarly hefty, with six tournaments being lined up to span January through October.</p>



<h2 id="h-pgl-is-supercharging-counter-strike-2-s-calendar">PGL is Supercharging Counter-Strike 2’s Calendar</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.pglesports.com/news/1760364087969-pgl-confirms-at-least-15-counter-strike-2-tier-1-events-planned-for-2027-and-2028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, the PGL team revealed that 2027 will see <strong>six </strong>independently produced tournaments and one massive collaboration: the Perfect World Counter-Strike Asia Championships.</p>



<p>Here’s the schedule revealed thus far for 2027:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>February 11–22</strong></li>



<li><strong>March 17–29</strong></li>



<li><strong>April 14–26</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 17–29</strong></li>



<li><strong>September 1–13</strong></li>



<li><strong>October 6–18</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Looking even further ahead into 2028, a staggering schedule has been lined up for Counter-Strike fans around the world. Here’s the full list of PGL tournaments planned for 2028:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>February 9–21</strong></li>



<li><strong>March 22–April 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>April 19–May 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 16–28</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 31–September 11</strong></li>



<li><strong>October 4–16</strong></li>



<li><strong>November 1–13</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>This is shaping up to be unprecedented in the Counter-Strike 2 space, and it reflects the ongoing value of the game and the ecosystem surrounding it.</p>



<p>The most recent PGL event, PGL Masters Bucharest, wrapped up just yesterday, with Aurora securing the trophy and picking up the lion’s share of the $625,000 grand prize. The win marked Aurora’s most sizeable victory to date in the Counter-Strike space and came mere months after falling in second place at the Esports World Cup.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-2-875/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-875-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-november-2.1341481/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a sleepy Sunday, but while you’re finding time to relax, you’ll also need to find an opportunity to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Fortunately, I’m here to help you on your way with the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions, to give you the best chance possible of dominating today’s challenge.</p>



<p>Read on to get the best NYT Connections hints, and scroll to the bottom of the page if you want to jump to today’s answers.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 2)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #875:</p>



<ul>
<li>GEM</li>



<li>LOAD</li>



<li>FAWN</li>



<li>SWEAT</li>



<li>CARGO</li>



<li>TAN</li>



<li>SAG</li>



<li>CRAMP</li>



<li>HAUL</li>



<li>AQUA</li>



<li>REDDEN</li>



<li>CAMEL</li>



<li>FREIGHT</li>



<li>PANT</li>



<li>KHAAKI</li>



<li>CAPRI</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of items or terms associated with moving goods or heavy items. These are all about what gets carried or shipped.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word here is a color that falls within the brown or beige spectrum—often used in fashion or design.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These words describe what happens to your body when you’re working hard, exercising, or overheating.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are all names or abbreviations of astrological signs. Some are less obvious, so think symbolically.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 2.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-2-875">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 2 (#875)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CARGO, FREIGHT, HAUL, LOAD</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CAMEL, FAWN, KHAKI, TAN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CRAMP, PANT, REDDEN, SWEAT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – AQUA, CAPRI, GEM, SAG</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Drop into... Springfield!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Epic's free-to-play battle royale <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has hosted all sorts of exciting collabs over the years, but this latest one, focused on the long-running cartoon series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/simpsons_hit_and_run">The Simpsons</a>, arguably goes above and beyond.</p>
<p>Players will be dropping into an 80-player cel-shaded Springfield Island, featuring a "back-to-basics" style Battle Royale experience. Each week will bring new Simpsons-themed gameplay, shop offerings and much more.</p>
<p>Alongside this will be new "mini episodes", which preview each week's gameplay narrative and map updates. These are original animated shorts, co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic, and released on Disney+ globally and Fortnite's social channels. You can watch the first one below (<strong>warning:</strong> video contains flashing lights).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st November</strong> - <em>“Apocalypse D’Oh"</em></li>
<li><strong>10th November</strong> - <em>“Sugar High”</em></li>
<li><strong>17th November</strong> - <em>“Multiplidiocy”</em></li>
<li><strong>24th November</strong> - <em>“The Incredible Bulk”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to look the part, there'll also be a Springfield Battle Pass, which comes loaded with Outfits as premium rewards including Homer, Marge, Flanders, Blinky Fishstick, and a Springfielder version of the Fortnite character Peely. This Battle Pass also has Fortnite's first Sidekick Peels, with <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks">more coming to the Shop</a> next week.</p>
<p>This event follows the release of Fortnite on the Switch 2 in June. You can get the rundown about this version of the game and how it performs in our review here on Nintendo Life:</p>

<h2>How To Play Wordle</h2>



<p>Wordle is a simple but addictive word puzzle. Each day, players have to <strong>guess a five-letter word answer</strong> in no more than six attempts. After each guess:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p>Wordle can only be played on the New York Times website. There is currently no app for you to download the official game.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arknights-endfield">Arknights: Endfield</a>. It is One Of Those Games, to which there are two versions of. Arknights: Endfield is One Of Those Games, as in an anime gacha game filled with anthro-adjacent women for you to roll for and fight with in flashy, lackluster-in-feeling combat. Arknights: Endfield is also One Of Those Games, a factory sim where you build complex systems to produce, uh, something. This is a combination I cannot fathom, but registration for its next beta test is open, so perhaps I can figure it out.
</p>
<p>
Signing up to the test is pretty simple, you just need to head to the <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us/news/3859">official website</a>, fill out a little survey, and at some point you might be told you're in. No guarantees there, but if you're curious about playing it, there's no real risk involved. This is actually the second beta test for the game, and according to the press release, it'll be a bit different from the first one.
</p>

<p>
For starters, the story has apparently received a complete rework, from new cutscenes and dialogue, to choices that you can make that "lead to unique outcomes." There's a new region called Wuling to explore too, a "region that blends Eastern aesthetics with futuristic elements, combining traditional with contemporary."
</p><p>
The test includes nine new operators to try out, and combat has had a bit of a refresh too, with some new skills, tweaked abilities, and updated bosses. There is, of course, that whole factory system to try out too, and controls and visuals across the whole game have apparently been "enhanced."
</p>
<p>
Again, it feels slightly odd for it Arknights: Endfield to essentially be two games in one. I understand the original has some strategy roots, so it feels like a factory sim feels like it might be appealing to a similar kind of crowd, there's just an awkwardness to it. I wonder how the game will reckon with its sense of self because of those stark differences. There's no release date for the game just yet, so we'll have to wait to find out I suppose.

            <p>
I know that with winter on the way, you might be wanting to play some summery games to remind you of what life was like before Jack Frost started nipping at your chestnuts. Put that to the side, perhaps, just for a while, as developer 11 bit studios have revealed the release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2's</a> first bit of DLC, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2791510/Frostpunk_2_Fractured_Utopias/">Fractured Utopias</a>.
</p>
<p>
Said release date is, quite appropriate for the season, December 8th, so a little over a month away. If you already own Frostpunk 2 and fancy giving it a go before it launches, you can actually sign up to try it out right <a href="https://frostpunk2.firstlook.gg/">here</a>. The beta test for it kicked off yesterday, and is only meant to last a few days, so there's a chance you're too late, but there's never any harm in putting your name down on a waitlist. Fact!

<p>
Anyway, how about some Fractured Utopias details. According to the game's Steam page, it's all about embracing the "core concept of Utopia Builder mode." How that manifests is apparently by giving it more structure, as well as giving the choices you make a greater sense of weight.
</p><p>
Every faction in the game will be able to build towards its own idea of what a utopia is, complete with new systems, tools, and even a new endgame. There'll be 12 unique unlocks like laws, HUBs, and abilities per faction, and eight new faction hubs in total. On top of that, there's eight new faction-specific variants of the housing district, over 100 new narrative events, a couple premium tales, and to top it all off, a new map.
</p>
<p>
Is any of that worth paying for? Maybe! The base game's been a bit iffy so far judging by the word on the street, and this DLC does sound a bit bare-bones. Guess we'll find out in December! At least the base game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/">40% off on Steam</a>, if you fancy giving it a pop anyway.

<p>Crucially, you'll clock up full XP from "real player actions", and reduced XP for any actions with a bot.</p>
<p>Here's what you can expect from Casual Breakthrough:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller player teams: 16 real players (8 per team) with 32 bot teammates/enemies (16 per team)</li>
<li>Progression: Earn Career XP, Weapon XP, Battle Pass XP, and complete Challenges</li>

            <p>Arc Raiders will return items to your inventory if you lose them to cheaters, saying it is "committed to skill and fun, not unfair advantages".</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/casual-mode-added-to-battlefield-6-with-32-bots-in-each-match.1341328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA DICE has added a new ‘Casual Breakthrough’ mode to Battlefield 6 with a new update, accessible via the core multiplayer menu. This new mode is designed to be a more comfortable entry point for new players, allowing them to rank up while fighting mostly <strong>bot </strong>enemies.</p>



<p>It was stated by EA that teams will consist of eight real players apiece and 16 bot characters per team.</p>



<h2 id="h-bots-are-making-life-easier">Bots Are Making Life Easier</h2>



<p>Die-hard Battlefield fans have argued that this kind of mode shouldn’t exist outside of Portal, but here it is. Electronic Arts has added Casual Breakthrough to Battlefield 6, introducing a bot-filled mode that allows users to earn career, weapon, and battle pass XP, all while completing challenges and grinding unlocks.</p>



<p>The key thing to note is that any actions against <strong>bot characters </strong>will reward reduced XP, while taking on human enemies yields the full rewards.</p>



<p>Initially, only Siege of Cairo and Empire State have been added to the map rotation, but it was stressed that EA DICE will be monitoring feedback to ‘determine if further adjustments are needed in the future.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing: Casual Breakthrough</p><p>We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The only things that don’t align with the core multiplayer experience are career stat updates, dogtag grabs, and accolades.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to share mixed feedback in the comments section under the post, with many defending the addition. The vibe is, ‘if you don’t like it, don’t play it,’ which makes sense.</p>



<p>One concern is that some players will find an inevitable way to turn Casual Breakthrough into an XP farm mode, but let’s hope that Electronic Arts has its eyes fixed firmly on the data to avoid that happening.</p>



<p>Will you give Casual Breakthrough a try, or are you comfortable enough with the standard mode? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
