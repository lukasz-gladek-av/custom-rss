<figure data-uuid="d5a922d8707e4"><a title="Mega Starmie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d5a922d8707e4/mega-starmie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It came during the night. From the darkest, most existentially tortured recesses of a Game Freak designer’s brain. Diffidently, at first, then more boldly. Finally, hips swishing, stripper heels glittering, it announced itself across the Internet in a burst of dramatics. I am speaking, of course, of Mega Starmie, the breakout Internet star of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>At first, Mega Starmie frightened us. In its first official days of life, its long, powerful legs and humanoid gait evoked images of runway models, male, female, or otherwise; however, its lack of a head seemed at odds with this, confusing anyone who had liked those legs. <em>“Am I attracted to Mega Starmie?”</em> asked certain players, before ultimately dismissing Mega Starmie as a valiant yet unfinished design. Certainly, it was not something that they had thought of sexually when alone and three drinks in, staring out the window during a rainstorm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59kmgtzu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Next came the memes. They cast Mega Starmie as an outsider, an abomination, a sentient pair of legs with no real purpose for existing. And man, those legs took a beating. Every joke seemed to zero in on this one physical trait over which Mega Starmie had no real control.</p>
<p>They compared Mega Starmie to Patrick from <strong>SpongeBob SquarePants</strong>. They claimed that Mega Starmie was a bug the programmers had forgotten to address. They suggested Mega Starmie was physically violent. No one ever stopped to think about how this made Mega Starmie feel.</p>

<p>But it’s always darkest before dawn, and Mega Starmie began to build a cult of personality. Perhaps it was the meme of Mega Starmie as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fno-one-will-ever-convince-me-mega-starmie-is-bad-v0-nrjp2t8wqxxf1.png">Patrick in sexy fishnets</a>; perhaps it was Mega Starmie’s status as an underdog, spurned by society. Perhaps it was because of Mega Starmie’s Pokédex entry, which suggested that it had become more humanoid “to supplant humanity.” To break the wheel.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Mega Starmie began to assume the role of a self-possessed rebel imbued with feminine power. A symbol of resistance. A queer icon.</p>

<p>Queer cosplayers across the Internet started <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@weeeelson/video/7568166463383571725">dressing as Mega Starmie</a>, both for Halloween and just to terrorise their conservative relatives. Awarding her the pronouns of she/her, they recast her as the protagonist of a new, celebratory strain of memes, positioning her as a SheEO and arbiter of taste. She appeared in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gay_irl/comments/1okhu8j/gayirl/"><strong>Devil Wears Prada</strong> memes</a>, <strong>Bridesmaids</strong> memes, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/3152153-mega-starmie">Jean Claude Van Damme memes</a>. Drag queens learned how to paint like Mega Starmie and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP9-eQFEktz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">constructed entire garments</a> to evoke her potent, otherworldly glamour.</p>
<p>Finally, Mega Starmie had a purpose in life: to slay.</p>

<p>Regular Starmie has already been memed before, of course. Once the Internet caught on to its vaguely sexual cries in French dubs of the original Pokémon series, people had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dOzdKjux6vI">field day.</a> But even French Starmie’s sex positivity and certified freak status weren’t enough to make it into a queer icon.</p>
<p>This time around, things are different. Mega Starmie is a former reject of society, excluded for her very nature. She didn’t choose to have long, muscular legs. She was born this way.</p>
<p>It also helps that Regular Starmie was already a queer icon of sorts before Legends: Z-A came out. Thanks to its officially genderless status according to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/starmie">the National Pokédex</a> and its purple-and-yellow colouring, which evokes the non-binary flag, Regular Starmie <a href="https://adobe-outdesign.tumblr.com/post/686157350094192640/starmie-has-been-referred-to-as-a-non-binary">has already been</a> a non-binary icon for many.</p>

<p>In fact, its former status has inspired passionate questions about how Mega Starmie should identify now in terms of its pronouns. Is Mega Starmie she/her? Or is Mega Starmie they/them? Perhaps she/they are comfortable with both labels and will accept either.</p>
<p>I choose to believe that Mega Starmie is nothing if not passionate about making her gender identity non-controversial. For this reason, I believe that she’s a she/they who uses any <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/guilhernunes.bsky.social/post/3m3dnvqn3q22z">discussion surrounding her labels</a> as an opportunity to educate her friends and provoke her haters, in a non-pedantic way.</p>
<p>And just like non-binary and trans people these days, Mega Starmie has often been misunderstood and even feared by the general populace. I mean, it’s not like she’s turning children gay by breathing on them, or Hydro Pump-ing every man she sees; a lot of the time, she’s just trying to teleport up to her trainer as he completes yet another scaffolding obstacle course. And we’re going to snicker behind her back? Wow.</p>
<figure data-uuid="51a923bceb5a4"><a title="Mega Starmie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51a923bceb5a4/mega-starmie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whatever people say about her, Mega Starmie is thriving these days. And she may even have a love interest soon. Word on the street is that Mega Malamar has also been claimed as a queer icon, one that’s even more out and proud than Mega Starmie. In one meme, Mega Malamar can be seen using his psychic powers to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DObbGIYCK3-/?hl=en">spread gay rights around the world</a>. Honestly, he sounds like a perfect match for Meg. They can attend rallies together.</p>
<p>Also, the world needs another ludicrous fictional couple to root for now that Pennywise and the Babadook have parted ways. At least, I assume they have. I used to check every year but I haven’t in a while. Maybe that’s because my mental health has improved.</p>
<p>And maybe <em>that’s</em> because I know that there’s a Mega Starmie out there somewhere, watching over the queers, singing <strong>God Help the Outcasts</strong> as she struts down Centrico Plaza, Mega Kick-ing anyone who doesn’t have a Pride flag on their porch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no mystery that Valve's Steam platform continues to grow at a steady rate. Over the past few years, we've reported several new concurrent peak player records, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recorded a month ago with around 41.6 million users</a> online at the same time.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this also translates into higher sales on the store. <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/valves-bold-expected-return-to-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics</a>, Steam has already generated sales for around $16.2 billion in 2025, a 5.7% increase over 2024's estimated $15.33 billion. Do note that 2024's data point is, of course, final, whereas there are still 44 days left in 2025, and it's arguably the period when people spend more due to Thanksgiving, Black Friday sales, Holiday gifts, and so on. It would not be a surprise to see Steam break the $17 billion threshold by year's end.</p>



<p>Valve takes a substantial cut out of each sale conducted on the store: 30% until the product reaches $10 million in revenue, 25% between $10 million and $50 million, and 20% over $50 million. It's one of the ways the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-taking-fight-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-store-fee-lowered-from-30-to-12-for-pc-games-halo-infinite-will-have-crossplay-and-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later the Microsoft Store</a> have attempted to compete with Valve's store (which many game developers still consider a monopoly) by offering a higher revenue per sale than they can get on Steam. On those stores, developers only pay a 12% fee and get 88% of the sale.</p>



<p>Epic also famously paid hefty sums to secure big temporary game exclusives, such as Borderlands 3, on its store. At one point, Epic founder Tim Sweeney even <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-tim-sweeney-promises-forego-exclusive-deals-if/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenged Valve to match the Epic Games Store's revenue split</a>, stating that he would have ended the exclusivity program if they agreed to do so.</p>



<p>Valve never flinched, though, thanks to the unwavering loyalty of hundreds of millions of gamers. While Epic did manage to carve for itself a sizable platform on the EGS, between exclusive, free games, and the evergreen Fortnite, Steam did not suffer in the least and, as shown by these figures, keeps growing.</p>



<p>Alinea Analytics estimates that Valve has already earned $4 billion in 2025 from the sales on its store. With these numbers, it's perhaps no wonder that its president, co-founder, and majority stakeholder, Gabe Newell, has a lot of money to spare.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, website Boat International <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/oceanco-y722-superyacht-leviathan-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Newell has just received his latest superyacht, a 111-meter entirely custom wonder called Leviathan. Produced by Oceanco (which was also acquired by the Valve owner earlier this year), it can accommodate up to 22 guests plus 33 crew members. It features two gyms, a spa, a bar, a basketball half-court, a beach club, a small hospital, and, of course, an entertainment room equipped with fifteen top-of-the-line gaming PCs.</p>



<p>With Steam poised to expand its ecosystem even further <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the launches of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller products early next year</a>, Valve's billionaire owner, who recently said he lives full-time at sea but still works remotely on various company projects, will probably be able to afford more of these superyachts in the near future.</p>

            <p>November digs in. The conveyor belt of crowns, clowns and clones that is Videogaming rattles onward through the midnight forest. The rains swept past over the weekend and now the mud is waist-deep, worryingly responsive, and rank with the stench of neglected deckbuilders. Several sedan chairs carrying former BioWare creative leads are caught in a wave of slop, becoming a disorderly barricade of people crying out for Femshep to come save them from the GAAS. Tencent executives rush over with handfuls of rope, but whether they mean to drag the afflicted free or bind their limbs is unclear.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Answering the call of nature, you wade away from the tumult of shovels and torches. As you pass behind a trunk, you are caught in the spell of metsänpeitto, and are suddenly alone. There is no sound, neither the shriek of mired horses nor the clinking of coins in the CEO carriages. The trunks lean towards the glow of your lantern. Then you hear a crackle. Twitching radiance guides you through a gap to a clearing, where five hooded arcanists circle a ritual pyre. Each is named for a weekday, and each has a bagful of new PC games they now thrust upon you. Which will you choose? Do not refuse them all: the flames can always take another body.

<p>The choice is made. Your sight thickens abruptly, the fire falling still. The hooded figures swell and pustulate and you realise that you are looking at a circle of mushrooms, while lying flat on a boulder of moss.</p>
<p>You rise to your feet groggily. Behind you, the great procession of Videogaming continues. Somebody has resolved the sedan chair situation by rolling the ex-BioWare contingent into an enormous, squelching katamari. A few bats swoop past as you resume your place in the convoy. Keep trudging onward. Surely this forest has an outside. Some day, December will come.</p>

              <p>One of the main ways to play on the Nintendo Switch is with the Joy-Con controllers. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your existing ones or just want to gift a fresh set to a gamer in your life this holiday season, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/">Right now, the Nintendo Joy-Con (L/R) are down to $79 on Amazon, which is 12% off their usual $90 price tag.</a> Joy-Cons rarely see major discounts, which makes this one a great option to grab a new pair without paying the full price. There are other color options available, too, though the discount may vary depending on the one you choose. The Neon Red and Blue combo is a classic, though, and it makes the most sense to grab it while it’s the most heavily discounted. We just highly recommend acting fast to snag it up, as the deal is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Play</h2>
<p>These Bluetooth controllers can be used in multiple ways. You can use them independently in each hand, attach them to a Joy-Con grip for a single controller-style unit, or snap them onto the Switch for handheld gaming. Each of these has a full set of buttons, so using one as a standalone mini-controller won’t feel limiting at all. In fact, it’s going to come in handy for some two-player sessions in games!</p>
<p>There’s an accelerometer paired with a gyro-sensor for accurate, two-dimensional movement tracking. These make it possible to pull off motion-based gameplay without requiring any additional accessories.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 20 hours of continuous use on a full charge, which is more than enough to support at least a couple days of gaming. They recharge quickly too and are back to full in about 3.5 hours, so you can get back to the action without much downtime. Recharging can be done by attaching them to the Nintendo Switch console while it’s docked or plugged in. You can also insert them in the Joy-Con Charging Grip which is sold separately, or go for third-party charging accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5630/">Again, it’s best to grab the offer sooner rather than later. We’re not expecting Amazon to keep this deal live for too long, especially with holiday shopping ramping up.</a> Once the discount disappears, you’ll have to pay the full $90 price or worse, deal with shipping delays.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Everstone Studio's Where Winds Meet does a lot of things right, but its AI chatbot NPCs are unironically one of its best features, leading to all sorts of hilarious interactions that players are fully embracing.</p>



<p>Many of the game's NPCs, with which players can build lasting relationships as part of the game's core mechanics, are actually powered by AI chatbots that reply to all sorts of inputs from the player. During the early access review period of the global version, I wasn't able to make them do anything other than repeat some set lines, but now that the game is finally live, these NPCs are fully functional, and players have been testing how much they can be pushed to provide some genuinely fun interactions.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-most-vicious-ai-break-up-child-support-and-grief">The Most Vicious AI Break-Up: Child Support and Grief</h3>



<p>One user on the game's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/">official subreddit</a>, MisterZan25, proved to be particularly cruel, subjecting the Zhao Dali NPC to a vicious narrative arc. The player made the NPC believe their character was pregnant with their child, demanded child support, and eventually informed them that the child had died.</p>



<p>The AI NPC believed the entire scenario and reacted dramatically to the news, <strong>providing a moment of dark comedy.</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<figure></figure>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="h-life-advice-and-martial-arts-moves">Life Advice and Martial Arts Moves</h3>



<p>Not all interactions have to be so destructive in Where Winds Meet. Some kind-hearted players have tried to lift the spirits of some AI NPCs, often resulting in reactions that fit the Wuxia setting.</p>



<p>User lessobvious had a <strong>constructive exchange</strong> with an NPC, successfully lifting their spirits by highlighting the value of training, even after that training had failed to help the NPC find a wife.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>User zheiro provided life advice to an AI NPC, who <strong>appreciated the guidance and thanked the user gracefully</strong> in a manner that felt perfectly in line with the game’s aesthetic.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>User OtherwiseEnd944, on the other hand, decided to have a little bit of fun with another NPC, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1oxmtez/the_ai_is_killing_me/">suggesting a rather "peculiar" martial arts move</a>, which<strong> left the NPC baffled</strong>, proving the system reacts even to the most absurd of interactions.</p>



<h3 id="h-taunt-npcs-and-pay-the-price">Taunt NPCs and Pay the Price</h3>



<p>The AI’s reactivity extends beyond mere conversation. Treating the NPCs rudely can lead to believable, and sometimes violent, reactions. User Sensitive_Touch_8190 taunted an AI NPC repeatedly, and after having had enough, <strong>the character retaliated</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if this sort of bizarre, player-driven feature isn't your alley, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Where Winds Meet</strong> has a lot to offer for all sorts of players.

            <title><![CDATA[MSI’s $380 QD-OLED gaming monitor is one of 2025’s best deals so far]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/820451/msi-qd-oled-1440p-gaming-monitor-deal-sale-black-friday</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi%E2%80%99s-380-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-is-one-of-2025%E2%80%99s-best-deals-so-far.1355518/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At $380, MSI’s 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitor is one of the best purchases <em>Verge </em>readers who want an awesome gaming upgrade can make now. That’s how much it costs in an online-only deal at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/p/-/msi-265-wqhd-qd-oled-240hz-amd-freesync-premium-pro-gaming-monitor/4000411993?langId=-1" rel="sponsored">Costco</a> for <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html" rel="sponsored">membership holders</a> through December 1st. In case you’re curious as to what kind of OLED monitor you can get for just $380, so was I. So I got MSI to send over a review unit, which I’ve been using for over a week.</p><p>This monitor (model MAG271QPX E2) doesn’t really differ from several other similarly-sized models. It offers a fast 240Hz refresh rate, fantastic viewing angles compared to cheaper panel types, and colors that really pop. It’s not typically one I’d suggest most people buy at its usual <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-QD-OLED-27-inch-Response-Adjustable/dp/B0D68C1BVS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$599</a> sale price, but it becomes an extremely compelling value for $200 less.</p><p>MSI’s QD-OLED replaced an aging Acer 1440p IPS 144Hz monitor at my desk, and the difference was profound when I jumped into a game. I’ve been playing a lot of <em>Battlefield 6</em> lately, and the landscapes look more lived-in than they do with the limited, pale color gamut that my IPS can muster. The chaotic action looks a little more real, thanks to more vivid-looking explosions. Every little aspect of the interface is easier to parse, too, thanks to OLEDs unbeatable contrast ratio.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I’m happy with how this monitor looks, especially for this doorbuster price.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> is another title I recently picked up that looks particularly stunning on this display. I wish I had started testing this around Halloween, when I was playing more scary games, because its deep black levels look fantastic in my home office — it’s got great contrast. If this is your first OLED gaming monitor and you haven’t yet experienced the difference between that and an inferior panel type, you’re in for a treat that keeps on giving.</p><p>I play a lot of games, but I type articles in Google Docs more often because of my job. OLEDs have a bad reputation for rendering text; various subpixel layout types introduce color-tinged aliasing that’s not present on IPS and other types of non-OLED panels. The evidence of this is irrefutable under close inspection, as this <a href="https://youtu.be/lrdllziZe5w?si=isDLVHCijYqUKk2a&amp;t=159">Monitors Unboxed hands-on video</a> proves. However, as the video mentions, you may not notice it. From the distance I sit from the monitor, it looks fine to me.</p><p>This monitor’s specs make it a particularly good deal compared to other non-OLED monitors at this price point. This model supports variable refresh rate between the range of 48Hz and 240Hz. While it only lists support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro adaptive sync, not Nvidia G-Sync, I’ve been happy with its performance in a range of games while connected to my Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti-powered PC. The panel itself is covered in an “anti-reflection” coating that appears semi-glossy, so it might catch reflections in a well-lit room. This monitor comes with a nice height-adjustable stand that allows for tilting, swiveling, and pivoting, but I just tossed it on my monitor arm thanks to its VESA mount.</p><p>MSI covers the monitor with a three-year warranty that includes panel burn-in, which is great. I’m also smitten with this model’s ports. It sports one DisplayPort 1.4a port, two HDMI 2.1 ports supporting up to 240Hz on PC (or up to 120Hz on consoles), plus one USB-C with DisplayPort video, which works great with my Steam Deck, and a headphone jack. That port allows 15W PD charging, but is turned off by default.</p><p>If there’s one complaint that I have, it’s that the plastic chassis on the back is a bit chunky compared to other models that I’ve tested. However, MSI says that this is where the monitor’s heatsink is located, which allows it to have a fanless design. And at $380, this complaint doesn’t hold much water.</p><p>If you aren’t a Costco member, it may be worth it to become one if only just for this deal. But if you don’t plan to become one, it’s possible that we’ll see deals at other retailers for this model. It sold for $449.99 at Amazon during the Prime Big Deal Days, so hopefully that price (or ideally, something better) will pop up during Black Friday.</p><p>While Best Buy only sells the MSI monitor through a third-party seller, the retailer currently has <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Falienware-aw2725d-27-qd-oled-qhd-280hz-0-03-ms-freesync-and-g-sync-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-hdmi-displayport-black%2FJ3K4L6RFPL%2Fsku%2F6640502" rel="sponsored">Alienware’s AW2725D</a>, the company’s 27-inch 280Hz 1440p QD-OLED, for $499.99 — a $50 price drop.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-practically-giving-away-the-new-fire-tv-stick-hd-in-a-pre%E2%80%93black-friday-price-meltdown.1355515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back when the Amazon Fire TV Stick first showed up, the whole pitch was basically, “Hey, plug this in and boom—your old TV is suddenly smart.” Fast-forward to now, and most TVs fresh off the shelf already have some kind of smart interface built in. The thing is, a lot of those built-in interfaces… kind of suck. Some companies still haven’t cracked the code on making a simple, smooth UI. (Looking at you, LG, with your strange Wiimote-wannabe remotes). So at this point, the real draw of the Fire TV Stick isn’t that it makes your TV “smart”—it’s that it gives you a <em data-start="722" data-end="730">better</em> smart experience. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">And right now, the newest Fire TV Stick HD is down to just $18.</a> Normally it runs $35, but this deal chops nearly half off the price, which is pretty hard to complain about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Once you plug it in, you can basically stream anything you’d expect: Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max (or whatever they’re deciding to call it this month), Disney+, Prime Video—the usual cast.. As long as you’ve got the subscriptions, the content is there. But even if you don’t want to spend any more on streaming subs, the Fire TV Stick actually has quite a bit of free stuff built in. Apps like Freevee, Tubi, Pluto TV, and a ton of Fire TV’s own free channels give you a surprising amount of movies and TV show episodes to just kick back and watch. Sure, they’re ad-supported, but free is free.</p>
<p data-start="1513" data-end="1986">One of the nicest quality-of-life things is the Alexa remote. No one enjoys hunting and pecking their way through an on-screen keyboard with a clunky d-pad. With the Alexa button, you literally just say what you want—“play <em data-start="1736" data-end="1742">Dune</em>” or “find <em data-start="1753" data-end="1770">The Mandalorian</em>”—and it pulls it up for you. It even scans across multiple apps to tell you which service actually has the thing you’re searching for, which saves you from the endless “which app did I watch that on?” guessing game.</p>


<h2 data-start="1513" data-end="1986">Cloud-based Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="1988" data-end="2503">Another neat perk that’s becoming more and more practical: you can actually play cloud-streamed Xbox games through it. If you’ve got Game Pass Ultimate, you don’t need an Xbox console at all—the cloud streaming service lets you play straight on your Fire Stick as long as your internet isn’t terrible. It’s kind of wild being able to fire up games like <em data-start="2321" data-end="2334">Animal Well</em> or <em data-start="2338" data-end="2374">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> on something only marginally larger than pack of gum. As long as your Wi-Fi is steady, the whole experience is way smoother than you’d expect. And now with&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>coming to a number of services including Netflix, now’s a great time to experiment with cloud gaming.</p>

<p>Valve’s second big foray into first-party PC hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valve-says-its-still-waiting-for-better-chips-to-power-steam-deck-2/">isn’t</a> a sequel to the much-imitated Steam Deck portable, but rather <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">a desktop computer</a> called the Steam Machine. And while it could go on your desk, Valve clearly intends for it to fit in an entertainment center under a TV—next to, or perhaps even instead of, a game console like the Xbox or PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this idea could work, and it’s because I’ve already been experimenting with what is essentially a “Steam Machine” underneath my own TV for months, starting in May when Valve began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/">making it possible to install SteamOS on certain kinds of generic PC hardware</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on what it costs—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">and we can only guess what it will cost</a>—the Steam Machine could be a good fit for people who just want to plug a more powerful version of the Steam Deck experience into their TVs. But for people who like tinkering or who, like me, have been messing with miniature TV-connecting gaming PCs for years and are simply tired of trying to make Windows workable, the future promised by the Steam Machine is already here.</p>
<h2>My TV PC setup</h2>
<p>I had always been sort of TV PC-curious, but I can trace my current setup to December 2018, when, according to a Micro Center receipt in my inbox, I built a $504.51 PC in a tiny InWin Chopin case centered on an <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/cpu-specs/ryzen-5-2400g.c1976">AMD Ryzen 5 2400G processor</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, the Ryzen brand was only a couple of years old, and the 2400G <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-2400g-zen-vega-cpu-gpu,5467-11.html">had impressed reviewers</a> by combining a competent-enough quad-core CPU with a usably performant integrated GPU. And the good news was: It worked! It was nowhere near as good as the graphical experience that, say, a PlayStation 4 could provide, but it worked well for older and indie games, while also giving me access to a TV-connected computer for the occasions when I wanted to stream things from a browser, or participate in a living room-scale Zoom call (something that would become the box’s main job during the pandemic-induced isolation of 2020 and early 2021).</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>(This PC evolved over time and currently uses a Ryzen 8700G processor, which includes AMD’s best CPU and integrated GPU for socketed desktop motherboards. I did this to get more stable 1080p performance in more games, but I would not recommend this build to most people right now—more on that in a bit.)</p>
<p>The main problem was Windows, which was not and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/full-screen-xbox-handheld-ui-is-coming-to-all-windows-pcs-starting-next-year/">still is not</a> particularly well-optimized for controller-driven living room use. What I really wanted was a startup process that felt more or less like a game console: hit the power button, and automatically get launched into a gamepad-navigable interface that would let me launch and play things without touching a mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>There are third-party apps like <a href="https://www.launchbox-app.com/">Launchbox</a> that make a go of providing this functionality for people more interested in emulation or who own games from multiple PC storefronts. What I eventually settled on was <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/838506/how-to-sign-into-your-windows-11-pc-automatically/">a sort of hacky fix</a> that allowed my user account to log in automatically, and then automatically launch Steam in <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3725-76D3-3F31-FB63">Big Picture Mode</a>.</p>
<p>This worked… fine—except when I needed to interact with a mouse and keyboard to install driver updates, or when some component of the Windows UI would steal focus from the Big Picture Mode window and make it impossible to use the controller to navigate.</p>
<p>So when reports indicated that Valve was working on a SteamOS version that would run on more hardware, I was immediately interested. SteamOS was designed to boot right into its gaming interface, and the desktop mode was its own separate thing that you needed to open up manually—ideal for my usage model, since I didn’t want to <em>give up</em> the desktop mode but also didn’t need to use it often. But I did run into some bumps during the installation process, which I’ll share here in case it helps you avoid them.</p>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>I had trouble using Valve’s official restore image (SteamOS version 3.7.7, from <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1b71-edf2-eb6d-2bb3#reimage">this support page</a>) to get newer hardware working, which may be one reason why that language was softened. It was no problem to install official first-party SteamOS on slightly older hardware, like the Ryzen 7040 version of the Framework Laptop 13 or an older Acer laptop with a Ryzen 6000-series processor installed. But trying to install the software on newer hardware failed no matter what I tried. Those systems included the Ryzen AI 300 version of the Framework Laptop; a socket AM5 testbed desktop with a dedicated Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU; and, to my great disappointment, my TV desktop’s Ryzen 7 8700G.</p>
<p>There’s very little information out there about installing or troubleshooting SteamOS on generic hardware, but if you poke around on Reddit about much of anything, you’ll quickly meet a specific Type of Guy who believes that anyone with hardware compatibility issues should just use <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a>, a community-developed alternate operating system that attempts to provide a SteamOS-ish alternative with wider hardware support (including for Intel and Nvidia hardware, which isn’t likely to be supported by the official SteamOS any time soon).</p>
<p>And so Bazzite I tried! Indicating that I used an AMD GPU and wanted to boot into the SteamOS interface offered me the exact same image that Bazzite offers for the Steam Deck and other handhelds, and it installed on my Ryzen desktop with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>Bazzite also came&nbsp;<em>painfully</em> close to what I wanted it to be, in terms of user experience—a desktop mode to boot into on the occasions I needed one, but otherwise I could just fire up the Xbox controller I had paired to the PC and jump right into a game.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But Bazzite was sunk by the same kind of bugs and edge cases that often chase me away from Linux operating systems when I try them. The main issue was that periodically, the system would boot up into desktop mode without asking (usually this seemed to happen when the Steam client software needed an update, but I can’t say for sure). Restarting the system would usually boot it back into the SteamOS interface—but I’d need to log in all over again, <em>and</em> the OS would switch Bluetooth off by default. Not only am I having to dig out a keyboard and mouse to solve this problem, but I’m needing to use a&nbsp;<em>wired</em> keyboard until I could get Bluetooth turned back on.</p>
<p>By the time this had happened twice, I was sure it wasn’t a fluke; by the time it had happened four or five times, I was determined to blow the entire operating system away and try again. And I was particularly interested in trying actual, for-real SteamOS again, just in case a new Bazzite install would have the same problems as the one I was already using.</p>
<p>After some digging, I found <a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/">this directory</a>. If you look through those folders, you’ll see OS images for various versions of SteamOS, including newer versions of SteamOS 3.7 (the “stable” version you’ll find on the Deck) and builds of both SteamOS 3.8 and 3.9 (the Deck will pull these down if you switch from the “stable” OS channel to “main”). Not all of those folders include the repair image you need to wipe a device and install SteamOS, but a few do—<a href="https://steamdeck-images.steamos.cloud/steamdeck/20251027.1000/">this one</a>, dated October 27, is the most recent as of this writing.</p>
<p>Those newer versions of the operating system include changes that expand SteamOS’s hardware support, most notably a step up from Linux kernel version 6.11 to version 6.16. And it was that <code>steamdeck-repair-main-20251027.1000-3.8.0.img.zip</code> file that I was finally able to <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">flash to a USB drive</a> and install on my TV desktop <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/65B4-2AA3-5F37-4227">using Valve’s instructions</a>.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It has only been a week or so since then, but at least so far I’m finally getting what I wanted: the same experience as on my Deck, just on my TV, with hardware that is somewhat better-suited for a larger and higher-resolution screen (and that’s the main reason to do this, rather than use a docked Steam Deck for everything).</p>
<h2>The SteamOS experience</h2>

      The “console-like experience” designed for the Steam Deck also works well with a TV and a gamepad.

<p>Once the OS is installed and is up and running, anyone who has used a Steam Deck will find it instantly familiar, and all you’ll need to do to get going is connect or pair a gamepad and/or a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Most of the bugs and quirks I’ve run into stem from the fact that this software was developed for standalone handheld gaming consoles first and foremost. There are multiple settings toggles—including those for adaptive brightness and HDMI-CEC—that serve a purpose on the Steam Deck but just don’t function on a desktop, where these features usually aren’t present or aren’t supported.</p>
<p>SteamOS is also pretty hit or miss about selecting the correct resolution and refresh rate for a connected display. Navigate to the Settings, to Display, and then turn off the “Automatically Set Resolution” toggle, and you’ll see a full list of supported resolutions and refresh rates that you can pick from. You may also want to scroll down and change the “Maximum Game Resolution” from “Native” to the actual native resolution of your screen, since I occasionally encountered games that wouldn’t offer resolutions that were supported by the display I was using.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may need to navigate to the Audio settings and switch output devices if you’re sending audio over HDMI. I also needed to turn the audio output volume up to around 80 percent before the sound coming out of my Steam Machine would match the volume of all the other boxes connected to my TV.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And if you’ve never used SteamOS before, it’s worth reading up on some of its limitations. While its compatibility with Windows games is quite good, Valve’s Proton compatibility layer is in continuous development, and not every game will play perfectly or play at all. Games that use anti-cheat software are <a href="https://areweanticheatyet.com/">still broadly incompatible with SteamOS</a>, since many anti-cheat programs hook into the Windows kernel in ways that are impossible to translate or emulate. And while it’s possible to run games from other storefronts like Epic or GOG, it’s best done with third-party software like the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic Games Launcher</a>, adding an extra layer of complexity.</p>
<p>And although SteamOS includes a useful desktop mode, it’s really not meant to be used as a day-to-day workhorse operating system—security features like “using a password to log in” are off by default in the interest of expediency, and you need to open your system to bootloader tampering just to install it. It’s fine for installing and running the odd desktop app every once in a while, but I’d hesitate to trust it with anything sensitive.</p>
<p>Finally, while our tests have shown that SteamOS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">generally performs at least as well, if not better, than Windows</a> running on the same hardware, the first-party version of SteamOS is still made with handhelds and other low-power hardware in mind. In my limited testing of SteamOS on desktops with both integrated and with more powerful dedicated GPUs, I’ve generally found that those observations hold up. But I’ve only tested on a narrow range of hardware, and you could easily encounter a setup where SteamOS just doesn’t run games as well as Windows does.</p>

<p>Say you’re interested in having a Steam Machine, you don’t want to wait for Valve, and you don’t just happen to have a spare ideally configured AMD-based PC to sacrifice to the testing gods.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>I am more or less happy with my custom-built mini ITX Steam Machine, but I find it difficult to recommend this hardware combination to basically anybody at this point. For me, it scratched a PC-building itch, and the potential for future upgradability is mildly interesting to me. But given the high cost of AMD’s Socket AM5 platform and spiking costs for RAM and SSDs, it’s going to be difficult to put together an 8700G-focused system in an InWin Chopin for less than $800. And that’s a whole lot to pay for a years-old Radeon 780M GPU.</p>
<p>For a more budget-friendly Steam Machine, consider the range of no-name mini PCs available on Amazon and some other places. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/what-i-learned-when-i-replaced-my-cheap-pi-5-pc-with-a-no-name-amazon-mini-desktop/">We’ve dabbled with systems</a> from manufacturers like Aoostar, Beelink, Bosgame, and GMKtec before and come away conditionally impressed by the ratio of utility-to-performance, and YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLl0WU8Gkzk">RetroGameCorps</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N88lXCTMNqE">ETA Prime</a> periodically cover new ones and generally have positive things to say. You’re rolling the dice on long-term reliability and support, but it’s also tough to argue with the convenience of the form factor or the pricing compared to a custom-built system.</p>
<p>If you’re going this route, we have some general recommendations and performance numbers, based on testing of similar chips in other laptops and desktops. Note that the Ryzen 6800U/Radeon 680M system is an Acer Swift Edge 16 laptop with 16GB of soldered DDR5, while the Ryzen 7840U/Radeon 780M system is a Framework Laptop 13 with non-soldered DDR5. Performance may differ a few FPS in either direction depending on your hardware configuration. The Ryzen 7700X/Radeon RX 7600 system is a custom-built testbed desktop similar to the one we use for testing CPUs and GPUs; based on hardware alone, we’d expect the real Steam Machine to perform near or slightly below .</p>

<p>In the $350 to $400 range, look for PCs with a Ryzen 6800-series chip in them, like the 6800H or 6850H (here’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQKRXKS5">one from GMKTec for $385</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F62L51RJ">one from Beelink for $379</a>). These processors come with a Radeon 680M integrated GPU, with 12 compute units (CUs) based on the RDNA2 architecture. These boxes will offer performance slightly superior to the actual Steam Deck, which uses eight RDNA2 CUs and squeezes them into a system with a small power envelope.</p>
<p>If you can spend around $500, that generally seems to get you the best performance for the price right now. Look for processors in the Ryzen 7040 or 8040 series, or the Ryzen 250 series (here’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ4WBV8L">one for $$490 from GMKtec</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZBSPBN9">one for $499 from Bosgame</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FSKYK2MQ">one for $449 from Aoostar</a>). These chips all offer broadly similar combinations of eight Zen 4-based CPU cores, and a 12-core Radeon 780M GPU based on the RDNA3 architecture.</p>
<p>In a mini desktop, this GPU can come pretty close to doubling the performance of the Steam Deck, though it will still fall short of most dedicated graphics cards. It’s similar to the performance level of <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/handhelds/ryzen-z-series/z2-series/z2.html">the non-Extreme version of the Ryzen Z2 chip</a> for competing handhelds. The 780M is also the same GPU that comes with the Ryzen 8700G desktop chip I use, and I’ve found that it gets you decent 1080p performance in many games.</p>
<p>The GPU is the most important thing to focus on in these systems, since it’s going to have the most impact on the way games actually run. But keep an eye on RAM and storage, too; a 1TB SSD is obviously preferable to a 500GB SSD. And while most of these come with a healthy 32GB of RAM by default, pay attention to the <em>type</em> of RAM. If it just says “DDR5,” that’s most likely to be socketed RAM that’s a bit slower, but which you can upgrade yourself if you want. If it comes with LPDDR5X, that’s going to be soldered down, but also a bit faster, maximizing your graphics performance.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>The Steam Deck is a useful benchmark here, because it’s a fixed hardware platform that’s popular enough that PC game developers sometimes go out of their way to target. Games often include Steam Deck-specific graphics presets, which are a useful starting point when you’re fiddling with settings.</p>
<p>I would generally try to avoid systems with Ryzen AI 300-series chips in them—their Radeon 890M GPUs are faster, but they can also be twice as expensive as the Radeon 780M boxes. I’d also stay away from anything with Ryzen 5000 or 3000-series chips, or Ryzen 7030-series chips. The price tags on these $200 to $300 systems are tempting, and they <em>will</em> probably run SteamOS, but their older Vega-based GPUs will fall far short of the Steam Deck’s GPU, let alone the Radeon 680M or 780M.</p>

<p>OK, but what if you have more money to spend, and you’re more interested in 1440p or 4K gaming performance (roughly what Valve is targeting with the actual Steam Machine)? I think that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/review-framework-desktop-is-a-mash-up-of-a-regular-desktop-pc-and-the-mac-studio/">the Framework Desktop</a> is a surprisingly good fit here; <a href="https://frame.work/products/desktop-diy-amd-aimax300/configuration/new">$1,200</a> will get you a console-sized PC with an eight-core Zen 5 CPU, a Radeon 8050S GPU with 32 CUs based on the RDNA 3.5 architecture (the Steam Machine has 28 RDNA3 CUs), 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD.&nbsp; I can confirm firsthand that SteamOS 3.8/3.9 installs and runs just fine.</p>
<p>This desktop is <em>probably</em> a bit more expensive than the Steam Machine will end up being, but it’s impossible to say how much more expensive before Valve actually puts out a price.</p>
<h2>The TV PC is ready for its close-up</h2>
<p>TV-connected PCs have historically been a niche thing. They’re expensive, they’re finicky, and purpose-built game consoles have always provided a more pleasant and seamless experience for people who just want to do everything with a controller from the couch.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>But the TV PC could finally be ready for its moment. In SteamOS, Valve has created a pretty good, pretty widely compatible Windows substitute that buries a lot of the PC’s complexity (without totally removing it, for the people who want it sometimes). Like the Nintendo Switch, Valve has crafted a user interface that feels good to use on a handheld screen and on a TV from 10 feet away.</p>
<p>And this is happening at the same time as a weird detente in the console wars, where Sony seems to be embracing PC ports and easing up on exclusive releases at the same time as Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">seems</a>, for all intents and purposes, to be winding down the Xbox hardware operation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">in favor of Windows</a>. Valve is way out in front of Microsoft on its console-style PC interface at the same time as the PC is becoming a sort of universally compatible über-console.</p>
<p>I’m kind of the ideal audience for the Steam Machine; nearly all my PC games are on Steam, I play practically nothing that requires anti-cheat software, and I play mostly graphically undemanding indie games rather than GPU-bruising AAA titles. So, you know, take my enthusiasm for the concept with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>But as someone who has already functionally been living with a Steam Machine for months, I think that Valve’s new hardware could do for living room PCs what the Steam Deck has done for handhelds: defining and expanding a product category that others have tried and failed to crack. This year, my Steam Machine has ably kept up with me as I’ve played&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/explaining-the-internets-obsession-with-silksong-which-finally-comes-out-sept-4/"><em>Silksong</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/ufo-50-is-the-best-retro-gaming-homage-ive-ever-played/"><em>UFO 50</em></a>, <em>Dave the Diver</em>, both HD-2D <em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>remakes, part of a bad-guy run through&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>, some multiplayer <em>Vampire Survivors </em>experimentation, several <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> sessions, and more besides. I’ve never been less tempted to buy a PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Capcom is working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC, following a multitude of technical issues this year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>The company has been heavily criticised for the performance of Monster Hunter Wilds, though it's acknowledged those issues. A <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1988371442619003050?s=20">free update is due on 16th December</a>, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-players-wait-almost-a-year-for-better-performance-capcom-is-in-danger-of-losing-its-most-important-audience">players have been waiting the majority of the year for</a>.</p>
<p>It seems Capcom has learned its lesson, though, and will ensure Resident Evil Requiem won't suffer a similar fate.</p>

<p>"Resident Evil Requiem differs from Monster Hunter Wilds in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features," said Capcom during a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">Q&amp;A for its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>"At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, the ninth mainline game in the series, launches next year on 27th February. Not only will it be released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">coming to Switch 2 too</a> along with Resident Evil Biohazard and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> on the same day.</p>
<p>As such, Capcom has an extra platform on its hands to optimise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-producer-explains-why-capcom-scrapped-multiplayer-horror-we-cant-just-slap-on-new-skins-and-characters">Resident Evil Requiem actually started life as an online multiplayer open-world game</a>, it was recently reported, and it retains "some" elements of that concept.</p>
<p>"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild," said producer Masato Kumazawa. "However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play. But we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they [...] probably wouldn't enjoy it as much."</p>

              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones tend to be a choice between Sony’s 1000XM5 and Apple’s AirPods Max and the price difference is just ridiculous. Apple wants $549 for their headphones, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/">while Sony’s flagship just dropped to $248 on Amazon, down from $399 in a Black Friday deal</a> that hits nearly all color options. Some colors are selling out fast as people realize they can get comparable performance for 2.5 times less money. If you’re willing to step outside the Apple bubble and give up the brand premium, you’re getting essentially the same listening experience for half the cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Sony’s Noise Cancellation Beats All Competitors</h2>
<p>The<strong> noise cancellation is powered by a pair of processors and eight microphones</strong> and it is as good as it gets: yes, even better than Apple’s implementation. It works in real-time and adjusts to your surroundings to block out the din of airplane engines, coffee shop chit-chat, and street noise with scary effectiveness. An Auto NC Optimizer adjusts for atmospheric pressure, so the noise cancellation doesn’t change whether you’re at sea level or cruising at 35,000 feet. You can genuinely work or relax in near-silence even in the noisiest environments.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life hits 30 hours on a single charge</strong> to cover multiple cross-country flights or weeks of daily commutes without hunting for an outlet. With quick charging, you’ll get three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in, so forgetting to charge overnight doesn’t ruin your day. A USB-C cable comes included, and the headphones work while charging if you absolutely need them immediately.</p>



<p>Hands-free calling uses four beamforming microphones in concert with <strong>advanced audio signal processing to isolate your voice from ambient noise</strong>. These microphones focus on your voice while filtering out wind, traffic, and the general hum of people chatting in the background that usually ruins phone calls. Video conferences sound professional, even when you’re calling in from a busy street or noisy office.</p>



<p>Touch controls on the ear cups let you pause, play, skip tracks, adjust volume and answer calls without having to pull out your phone. After one day of usage, gestures become second nature, and responsiveness is immediate without lag or missed inputs. You can swipe up and down for volume, tap to pause, or hold to activate your voice assistant. It’s large enough to register gestures but not so sensitive that an accidental touch constantly stops playback.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort comes from the lightweight design and soft-fit leather that distributes pressure equally</strong> across your head. The headband has just enough padding to prevent hotspots during long listening sessions without adding bulk. The ear cups create a seal that enables noise cancellation while staying breathable enough to wear for hours without sweating. These headphones disappear on your head in a way that heavier models never do.</p>
<p>Sound quality provides the well-balanced and detailed profile Sony is known for without the bass-heavy tuning some brands use to impress in quick demos. Mids and highs remain clear and separated, which means vocals and instruments don’t muddy together during complex tracks. The soundstage feels wide and natural rather than artificially processed. Audiophiles will appreciate the fidelity and casual listeners will enjoy how everything just sounds right without needing EQ adjustments.</p>
<p>At $248 for headphones that go head-to-head with $549 AirPods Max, you save $301 and get equal noise cancellation, better battery life, and similar audio quality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has issued takedown notices for videos showcasing a fan-led project that's bringing doomed PlayStation live-service game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a> back to life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation's quickly-binned hero shooter Concord was one of the biggest flops in the compay's history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony pulled the game offline just two weeks after launch, with one estimate suggesting it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>sold just 25,000 copies</u></a>. It proved a costly failure for Sony, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted. Its developer, Firewalk Studios, closed shortly thereafter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its brief life, or perhaps because of it, Concord remains of interest — with a dedicated group of players dedicating "months" of work to getting the game back online again, reverse-engineering the code and using private servers to host online matches of Clash Point. And now, it seems, Sony has taken notice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a long time of reverse engineering [and] server development, we just managed to play a match of Concord!" the team announced on Discord (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Post</u></a>). "The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we'll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience)." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the volunteer developers admitted the build could be "buggy," the team managed to get the main menu, character select screen, and matchmaking working again, with one team member <a href="https://discord.gg/q9Q2N52agh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a>, "the project is still a [work in progress but] it's playable."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time, volunteers began sharing videos and images of their project in action and posted them to YouTube. But news of the project gained traction, it also appears to have caught the eye of Sony, which has seemingly begun striking down the videos with copyright notices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans behind the rebuilt game appear keen to make clear their attempt only provides server access to players who had legitimately bought the game, rather than anyone using or sharing "copyrighted files." In a message on the fan project's Discord: "I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do. We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, however, the group leaders have now paused invitations, stating they had received "worrying legal action."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2022, Jim Ryan, then-PlayStation's boss, announced that the company would launch more than 10 new live-service games by<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026"><u> March 2026</u></a>, and spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, Jade Raymond's Haven Studios (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern"><u>Raymond has since left the company</u></a>), and the now-shuttered Firewalk Studios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, however, Sony has cancelled a slew of projects, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>live-service God of War title in development at Bluepoint</u></a>, and another live-service title being made by Days Gone developer Bend.

            <p>It has been reported that PlayStation's Horizon series, which began in 2017 with Zero Dawn, has now passed 40m sales.</p>
<p>These latest figures come from a Korean news article, which was translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-franchise-has-reached-40-million-units-sold-according-to-a-korean-news-article.1354003/">ResetEra</a>. If accurate, that means the Horizon series has sold roughly 2m copies in the last few months. In July of this year as part of a filed legal complaint against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony accused the Chinese technology conglomerate of ripping off its Horizon video game franchise with its upcoming release Light of Motiram</a>, the PlayStation maker said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">Horizon franchise had sold in excess of 38m units</a>.</p>

<p>As for the most recent Horizon figures, they were shared as part of a report on the upcoming MMO spin-off from NCSoft, known as Steel Frontiers. "It is an MMORPG currently in development, based on the 'Horizon' series of open-world action adventure games with cumulative global sales reaching 40m units, designed to be playable on mobile devices," the translation reads.</p>
<p>"This new title was described by Co-CEO Park Byung-moo during the Q3 earnings conference call as one that 'earned a standing ovation'. It garnered significant attention as the main highlight of NCSoft's opening speech on the 13th."</p>
<p>To compare Horizon's latest alleged sales numbers with another of Sony's properties, in 2022 PlayStation announced that <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/22q2_sonyspeech.pdf">Santa Monica's God of War reboot had surpassed 23m units sold</a>. That same year, the company announced that its sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-sells-51m-copies-in-first-week">God of War Ragnarök had sold 5.1m copies in its first week</a>, making it officially the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation title to date. By November 2023, PlayStation revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> had sold through more than 15m units worldwide across both PlayStation 4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Meanwhile earlier this month, Sony's shared its latest financial results, where it indicated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-sells-over-33m-units-in-one-month-which-makes-it-about-twice-as-popular-as-astro-bot">Ghost of Yōtei had sold-through 3.3m units</a> as of November 2, 2025. That's roughly within one month of its release. </p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Sony for comment on Horizon's sales figures.</p>

<p>Looking at what's next for the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Horizon Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system" on the game's eventual release.</p>
<p>While it is currently slated for release on mobile and PC, last week executive producer Lee Song shed a bit more light on why NCSoft's game isn't coming to PlayStation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-steel-frontier-developer-wants-playstation-release-but-its-not-something-we-can-decide-on-our-own">suggesting excluding the platform was not NCSoft's decision</a>.</p>
<p>For more on Horizon, earlier this year Aloy actress Ashly Burch spoke to Eurogamer about her thoughts on AI, and why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-developer-replacing-all-actors-with-robots-not-going-to-happen-says-aloy-voice-actress">she believes developer Guerrilla replacing all actors with robots is "not going to happen"</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has blown past its concurrent player count on Steam yet again, hitting close to half a million PC players online at the same time over the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, the popular extraction shooter hit its peak of 481,996 yesterday, topping the previous peak by roughly 30,000 players. The game is also out on consoles whose player figures remain largely a mystery, so even this figure is only a piece of the wider picture.</p>
<p>Why has Arc Raiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">broken its concurrent player record yet again</a>? Well, there may be two major reasons. For one, word of mouth. The game continues to garner praise from a vast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">variety of friendly fans</a>, including many influencers. It seems as though the game has found a gap in the market where it can thrive, even at a time where bigger franchises like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> are still wobbling around.</p>

</figure>
<p>The second reason can likely be attributed to recent major content drops. Arc Raiders recently held a massive community event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">to open up its latest map</a>: Stella Montis. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-finish-community-event-and-unlock-a-new-map-in-just-one-day">The playerbase managed to smash this resource-gathering challenge in only one day</a>, despite the developers at Embark <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-first-major-community-unlock-event-has-been-made-harder-mere-hours-after-launch-as-players-were-completing-it-too-fast">making it harder to finish</a>. As such, there's a lot to do right now for fresh and experienced players alike.</p><p>Can Arc Raiders hit the 500,000 mark? Probably! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-an-impressive-2025-roadmap-and-its-bringing-a-new-map-new-events-and-other-game-changers">There are still a handful of events yet to happen this year</a> including a new weather effect on maps which should maintain interest for the short term at least. On top of that, we're near the holiday season. If Arc Raiders can keep players engaged for a few more weeks it'll enter a period where a bunch of people are off work and school and can spend their free time throwing purple gear at me during night raids. Nice!</p>
<p>If you're curious to read about what the big deal is with Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">you can read Eurogamer's review</a>. It dives into all the merits of the extraction shooter, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nexon-ceo-believes-its-important-to-assume-that-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-following-arc-raiders-launch">the use of generative AI</a> voice acting which sadly stands opposed to an otherwise enjoyable game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anno-117-pax-romana-review.1355461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> sees <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>‘s long-running real-time strategy series enter a bold new era, winding back the clock by almost two thousand years when compared the most recent entry, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/anno-1800">Anno 1800</a>. This leap back in time offers a whole new setting and aesthetic for the franchise compared to other instalments that have taken place during the late Medieval, Renaissance, and the Industrial Age, as well as those Anno games set in the near and distant future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oVSysv9uH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At its core, Anno 117: Pax Romana offers the same rich, layered web of strategy game mechanics that have been continually tweaked and refined over the years. While dense in certain aspects, the game is far more approachable in comparison to grand strategy epics such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings III</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/Europa-Universalis-V">Europa Universalis V</a>. This is mainly thanks to its scale, tasking players with managing cities rather than globe-spanning empires.</p>


<p>For the first time in the series’ history, Anno offers a story-driven campaign where you choose one of two main characters, playing through a series of quests that serves as an extended tutorial. Set during the Pax Romana – a time of peace of prosperity following bloody campaigns and civil war – you slip into the role of either Macus or Marcia, son and daughter to a governor in Rome’s Egyptian provinces.</p>
<p>Inexperienced but not entirely naïve, they are tasked with rebuilding the lost city of Ambrosia to its former glory (now named Juliana after the wife of the Emperor). It’s a pretty ideal scenario, giving you a fertile patch to plant the seeds of your own soon-to-be bustling metropolis.</p>


<p>While the game’s story features twists, turns, and a growing cast of characters, it never intrudes, allowing players to go at their own pace without piling on urgent tasks or dragging them away from their city-building. There is one exception to this, however, and it’s not too long before you’ll be whisked away from the sunny Latium to the uncharted, and somewhat ominous, wilds of Albion.</p>
<p>It’s here, within a cluster of islands resembling Celtic Britain, that you’ll gain more freedom, learning Anno 117’s advanced systems such as diplomacy, warfare, and establishing trade routes. Again, story elements are there to compliment your learning experience: well-crafted and immersive without hindering gameplay.</p>
<p>Speaking of gameplay, Pax Romana is relatively easy to dive into even if you’re completely new to the genre. The Anno games are best known as city-building sims that have a strong emphasis on trade and economy rather than warfare and real-time battles (though these do play a part in the overall experience). One key element that makes Anno 117 more accessible than menu-loving grand strategy games is being able to see your city fully realised in 3D with workers and citizens all milling around. Instead of viewing a number or a UI icon to denote the grandeur and prestige of a city, you can see it with your own eyes.</p>
<p>Creating a thriving metropolis will take time, however, and plenty of careful planning. With that said, there’s no right or wrong way to play Anno 117. Sure, for competitive players there will always be an optimal path that takes them from a single modest trading port to a sprawling cityscape in the shortest amount of time, but the same amount of satisfaction can be derived from crafting gorgeous cities that can be customised using a suite of clever tools.</p>

<p>For the most part, you’ll be constructing various buildings that each perform their own function. Housing, for instance, adds citizens to your workforce who can also be regularly taxed to bring in a steady income. These workers will man the various production stations you build within your territory, from vineyard farmers to iron miners, transporting these raw materials to other stations where they’ll be processed into goods such as wine and weapons. By producing and trading a growing portfolio of these goods you’ll satisfy the needs of your populace, allowing you to upgrade them to artisans and nobles and thereby unlocking even more building types to construct.</p>
<p>While there is certainly an emphasis on building – and optimising the placement of stations, ports, and warehouses to meet local demands – you’ll also need to juggle affairs from beyond your own borders. While some factions will happily engage in trade, exchange gifts, and form alliances, others are more hostile in their approach. A good governor will know how to balance the economic output of their city with its defences, not just against invading enemies but from fires and disease, too.</p>

<p>Keeping on top of everything requires quick and effective navigation of Anno 117’s various menus which are concise and well-presented. Nothing is hidden away or buried though console players will hit the occasional snag due to the inherent clumsiness of gamepad controls when sifting through multi-layered menus, search bars, and icons to find what they need.</p>
<p>Several hours into the game – once the main events of the campaign have been resolved – players can stay within this sandbox or jump into Anno’s Endless Mode which can be enjoyed either in solo or co-op with the option for 16-player competitive games that divide rival governors into teams of four. This multiplayer offering, combined with a roadmap of upcoming content, and the game’s inherent replayability are all conspiring to eat away the free time of any strategy fan with a taste of Ancient Rome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Leon S. Kennedy is rumored to be the second protagonist of the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem, but until CAPCOM confirms his presence in the next entry in the series, anything seen or heard online should not be believed, according to the game's producer.</p>



<p>In a new interview with<a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/"> Stevivor</a>, Producer Masato Kumazawa addressed the rumors that have been circulating online for a few months, highlighting how <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">any supposed evidence is the result of detective work from players</a> and should not be taken at face value.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation,"</em> Kumazawa-san added. Likewise, the image going around showing Leon with an eye patch, and mentions of an extra DLC costume for the character are all fake, the producer concluded. However, Kumazawa-san didn't not deny the character isn't in, so there's still hope he is as rumored and speculated.</p>



<p>The Resident Evil Requiem producer also commented on the ability to switch between first- and third-person views, as well as the reasoning behind it.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the developer received lots of feedback from players after the release of the third-person view mode for Resident Evil Village, so much so that Kumazawa-san decided to let players choose which one they prefer between first and third-person view. In addition, the implementation of the third-person view allowed the team to&nbsp;<em>"sort of ease the horror"</em>, as many players thought that<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">&nbsp;Resident Evil VII Biohazard</a>&nbsp;was a little too scary with the first-person view only.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems ike fans of the series will have to wait until February 2026 to get their first taste of Resident Evil Requiem. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"So, in terms of a demo play, we actually have no plan for one at the stage. None at all. We just want to focus on finishing off the game,"</em> Kumazawa-san said in regards to a playable demo. With the game launching in a little over three months, chances are slim that plans may change, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-final-demo-availability-extended/">every recent entry in the series</a> getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-chainsaw-demo-new-video-provides-an-out-of-bounds-look-at-the-village/">a demo before launch</a>, there's still the chance for one to launch for Resident Evil Requiem as well.</p>



<p>While I would definitely love to see Leon in Resident Evil Requiem, the idea of having the vulnarable Grace as the only protagonist would be very intriguing, to say the least. When I tried the game a few months ago during Gamescom, I really appreciated what CAPCOM has done with the character, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">and the feeling of helplessness that permeated the demo</a>. If this were also to permeate the combat mechanics, I think it would make for a really different experience.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft's UK publishing arm have filed a strategic report for the year ending March 2025 in which they warn that they expect yearly revenue to fall in the current fiscal year, ending March 2026. They attribute this partly to slumping sales of physical copies of games, and more broadly to the fact that people are fixating on a fistful of mega-popular games at the expense of all others, with subscription and streaming services like Microsoft's Game Pass making us all feel less inclined to buy individual new games. Plus ça change.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"The traditional 'full game' model of selling a single £50-60 game to a consumer as a one-time purchase continues to become less ubiquitous, with Multi Game subscription services, long running Games As A Service titles, Free To Play games and Cloud Streaming offers all providing new and attractive ways for consumers to access gaming content," reads <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02409000/filing-history">the report</a>, which was filed on 13th November last week and passed along by <a href="https://www.cityam.com/ubisoft-issues-sales-warning-as-gamers-habits-change/">City AM</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Consumers are playing fewer games, playing them for longer, and as a result, outside of a few notable exceptions, many new games are struggling to stand out and achieve the sales they may once have had, whilst the market is more volatile and the potential for any specific title less predictable as a result," it continues.
</p>
<p>"As a result of a smaller physical new releases schedules in the coming year, Ubisoft Limited expects revenue to fall in FY26."
</p>
<p>All this comes in the context of dramatic wider corporate musical chairs across Ubisoft's international dominions. The company recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">struck a deal with Tencent to carve out a new subsidiary</a>, Vantage Studios, dedicated to the best-selling Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six series.</p><p>The remainder of the company's development studios are being reorganised into "creative houses", with a familiar and worrying emphasis on being "agile" and "focussed". Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">announced layoff plans</a> at The Division developers Massive and Trials developers Redlynx, both of whom fall outside the new Tencent-backed subsidiary.
</p>
<p>More Ubihappenings may be in the offing. A few days ago, the company <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/uh-oh-ubisoft-postpones-its-quarterly-financial-report-at-the-last-minute-and-halts-stock-trading/">postponed the release of their latest half-year earnings report</a> while requesting that European exchange Euronext halt trading of Ubisoft shares and bonds until the report's publication. According to rumour, the company's founding Guillemot family are having a staring match with Tencent about whether they can retain their dominance. Yves Guillemot recently appointed his son Charlie Guillemot as co-chief of Vantage, which feels a bit, you know, Succession-y.</p>
<p>Investors appear cool on the new direction: as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ubisoft-delays-half-year-results-requests-trading-suspension-2025-11-13/">reported by Reuters</a>, Ubisoft's Paris-listed share price was down 49% year-to-date as of 13th November. Me am just humble dormouse guzzling crumbs under the banquet table, with no real understanding of the arcane financial phrases uttered by the courtiers above, but these seem like worrying numbers.
</p>
<p>To return to the broader topic here, games industry bigwigs and assorted wonks have long warned that subscription models and a handful of enduringly popular games are sucking up all the oxygen. Back in 2024, Inflexion's Aaryn Flynn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-new-games-struggle-because-evergreen-hits-like-fortnite-pull-players-towards-them-at-all-times-says-former-bioware-gm">spoke to us at length</a> about how "evergreen" games like Fortnite trample new releases that are still finding their legs. "There's this incredibly thick line now of [yearly revenue], which is games that are five, even 10 years old, like GTA Online, and those games have done so good, and are so exceptional because of the just enormous amount of investment that's been put into them, that they are evergreen," he said. 
</p>
<p>More recently, market research company Circana <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/more-than-60-of-us-game-players-only-buy-two-games-or-fewer-per-year-survey-finds/">shared a survey</a> indicating that the majority of videogame players in the USA only buy one or two games a year.
</p>
<p>Again, me am just brainless sheep pundit nuzzling at King Guillemot's electric fences, but whenever I read reports about the industry being eaten alive by the Steam top 10 most-played, I find it helpful to browse, say, one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-358">our weekend What Are We All Playing articles</a>. I can only marvel at the range of things people say they're playing in those comments threads.</p><p>That's a small and purely anecdotal research sample, of course, but then, I imagine Ubisoft UK's research criteria from the above report are quite selective as well: they need to release games that make many millions of pounds. The fortunes of games from much smaller teams and companies do not, I imagine, enter into their calculus.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/small-content-creator-sues-inkslasher/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-small-content-creator-is-suing-inkslasher-for-allegedly-stealing-her-content.1355452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A small content creator by the name of EvenBadWolves Gaming (real name Elizabeth McAulay) has decided that she will be suing a much larger content creator by the name of InkSlasher for allegedly stealing her content. </p>



<p>In her video, which she uploaded to her YouTube channel, EvenBadWolves Gaming, she releases a side-by-side comparison of both her video and InkSlasher’s, of which she claims over 30 minutes of InkSlasher’s 43-minute video is directly ripped from her video. The side-by-side comparisons show duplicate footage and the same editing style, and, in some cases, the same watermarks.</p>







<p>According to McAulay, her original video took 200 hours to create, so seeing the majority of her content stolen is understandably frustrating. As she explains, such issues are typically swept under the rug by YouTube because of its copyright policies, where counter-notifications make it nearly impossible for smaller creators to obtain justification for their content being stolen.</p>



<p>However, McAulay is a real lawyer, and as such, she has decided to sue InkFlasher for stealing her content. McAulay says she has submitted her case to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia over copyright infringement.</p>



<p>Of course, McAulay says that taking someone to court isn’t cheap, and she was quoted up to $135,000 Australian for the case. <span>McAulay currently has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-big-youtuber-stole-my-video-im-fighting-back" target="_blank">GoFundMe setup</a>&nbsp;to try to</span> raise some of the funds for her case, for which she is seeking $50,000 AUD. Alternatively, you can watch EvenBadWolves Gaming’s video below to help support her.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Since the video was uploaded to YouTube, InkSlasher’s video has mysteriously disappeared from YouTube, and he’s seemingly avoiding discussing the allegations as anything said will likely be used against him in court.</p>

            <p>Sales of the Xbox ROG Ally X have exceeded Asus's expectations, as production ramps up to meet demand.</p>
<p>The Microsoft and Asus handheld collaboration was released last month, and while its tech is impressive it's been criticised for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-rog-ally-handheld-now-available-to-pre-order-but-its-pricier-than-a-home-console">its high price</a> - the premium model is £799, while the basic model is £499.</p>
<p>This doesn't appear to be a deterrent, however, as even the more expensive model is currently in short supply.</p>

<p>Responding to a question during its latest investor call (thanks <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-ally-x-supply-woes-continue-as-asus-admits-demand-exceeded-expectations-we-are-working-with-closely-with-key-component-suppliers-to-ramp-up-production">Windows Central</a>), Asus said: "As many of you know, we introduced the first generation ROG Ally 2-3 years ago as a market pioneer, over the past couple of years this new category, especially, the Windows ecosystem has proven itself highly successful.</p><p>"We believe that we have achieved our original goals of premium positioning, creating a new growth driver in our gaming segment. That's why we released our third-generation ROG Ally last month. It featured deeper collaboration with Xbox. Since its launch, we see the market response for it has been extremely positive, particularly, there has been an appetite for the premium higher-end models, exceeding our expectations. These high-ended variants are currently in short supply. We are working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that exists. Our goal with the ROG Ally is for it to remain a core pillar within the Asus gaming portfolio."</p>
<p>The Xbox ROG Ally X is essentially a handheld gaming PC to rival the Steam Deck, though as per Microsoft's advertising it's also 'an Xbox'. Eurogamer's Tom Orry was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">impressed by the machine</a>, noting: "It's not a true Xbox handheld console, but for a lot of people it's probably a better, more versatile device."</p>
<p>Alex Donaldson, meanwhile, was left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whatever-it-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-makes-me-pine-for-xboxs-distant-heyday">pining for the old days of Xbox and its ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>And while the Xbox handheld rivals the Steam Deck, Valve has since announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-machine-everything-we-know-about-valves-new-console">Steam Machine console</a> - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-xbox-boss-responds-to-valves-new-hardware-fellow-microsoft-employee-jokes-it-looks-like-those-rumoured-series-s-leaks">even Xbox boss Phil Spencer is a fan</a>.</p>

			<p>GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, and the long wait for its release is reportedly going to be well worth it, as other games will require decades to match some of the things Rockstar Games is doing for its game.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz">Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly</a>, who proved in the past to have solid sources for Rockstar news, replied to a fan's question asking about GTA 6 potentially being just a GTA V 2.0. This isn't going to be the case, according to Reilly, as some of the stuff Rockstar Games is doing with GTA 6 is extremely ambitious and will likely be unmatched for almost two decades, as developers may require 15/20 years to do the same things the Grand Theft Auto developer is doing for the next entry in the series.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>lol it definitely isn't GTA V 2.0 and people have no idea what they are talking about.</p><p>Some of the stuff I have heard Rockstar are doing with GTA 6 is super ambitious and it is unlikely any other developer will be able to match what they are doing for 15-20+ years.</p></div>— Reece “Kiwi Talkz” Reilly (@kiwitalkz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kiwitalkz/status/1989106189830168934?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although this statement may sound hyperbolic, there's likely some truth to what Kiwi Talks has heard. <span>While we have seen very little of the game in action, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-patents-revolutionize-open-world-forever/">patents and leaks</a> have highlighted how&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-advanced-ai-dynamic-environments/" target="_blank">GTA 6 is attempting to push the franchise and the open-world genre as a whole forward</a>&nbsp;with some impressive advanced features.</span> </p>



<p>The NPC AI features, in particular, sound extremely interesting, as human NPCs are reportedly going to feature an AIMemory system that will allow them to remember players' actions and decisions, influencing their interactions. Reportedly, NPCs will also be able to smell the player and other NPCs, which is definitely an unusual feature, but one that could further improve immersion, as will dynamic environments, which will be influenced not only by story progression, but also by players' actions.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it will be some time before fans can finally get their hands on GTA 6 to check out these features for themselves. The official release window for the sixth entry in the series has been the subject of several announcements, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">moving from an initial target of Fall 2025 to May 2026</a>, and then being <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">officially adjusted once more to November 2026.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During the monthly Soulframe developer stream, Canadian developer Digital Extremes announced that the <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Founders program</a> will go live on Tuesday, November 25, 2025, coinciding with the twelfth <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-preludes-opens-public-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preludes</a> (Pre-Alpha) update to the game.</p>



<p>Geoff Crookes, Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Founders is the next major step for Soulframe, welcoming anyone to join us in building something truly special. During our Pre-Alpha period, Preludes, we’ve built upon new ideas entirely from scratch and begun to craft a meaningful, strong foundation for a world that offers something important missing from our everyday lives: hope. Soulframe is meant to become a home for redemption, while feeling grounded and patient for everyone who plants their roots here. For those who have long wished to support Soulframe from its roots, this is an invitation to do so from the beginning.</em></p>



<p>Fans will be able to pick between four Founders paths that embody the Virtues of Courage, Spirit, and Grace. There's the path of the brave fighter (Wyld Tethren), willpowered mage (Wyld Oscelda), and rogueish archer (Wyld Sirin). These options are outfitted with an exclusive character Wyld Pact, main weapon and sidearm, armour set, talisman, dye Hues, bird cosmetics, Arcs (premium currency), two extra Preludes invite codes, among other benefits like the “Envoy's Sphere Sword Skin” for use in Warframe.</p>



<p>The ultimate option, the Paragon, includes all the benefits of other Founders' paths in addition to an exclusive Paragon Greatsword and an additional allotment of Arcs (premium currency), Armor Bestitching items, and 10 Preludes invite codes. Lastly, Founders will be able to etch their names in the Eternium Garden, planting their exclusive Founder flora and thus leaving a lasting mark in Soulframe.</p>



<p>The new Preludes update adds a new weapon grip type, and significantly overhauls the onboarding process of new players. When starting the game, they can now discover Grandfa's Hut and test all three starting Pacts there before committing to a Pact and Enclave. Exploration is also going to be a bit easier thanks to clearer marker placements for essential destinations, as well as fast travel with Wevetseeds.</p>



<p>A new elixir called The Cogah can be discovered. Drinking it triggers the ability to challenge the Agari overworld bosses roaming the overworld to a more difficult fight, thus unlocking new rewards. Finally, Digital Extremes is adding new Totems and Runes that can be used to specialize weapon types further.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the near future, players can expect a new mission type called Siege Encounters, which will take place at various enemy-filled forts. The Envoys must force out the Ode occupation, take down sub-bosses waiting within, and bring down the balloon laying claim to the territory. After the completion of a Siege Encounter, the new infamy rating system will be affected depending on how the mission is approached, persisting with the player into the following Siege. </p>



<p>Lastly, Jennifer English (Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3, Latenna in Elden Ring, and Maelle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33) will be joining the Soulframe cast soon as a new character, Alora, the Empress of Eldveil.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem Producer Addresses Leon Kennedy Rumors]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-producer-addresses-leon-kennedy-rumors.1355437/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Leon Kennedy has overshadowed all of Resident Evil Requiem’s development so far, as fans are more fixated on the long-term hero either making an appearance or being a playable character. It’s no longer a vocal minority, and Resident Evil Requiem’s producer has commented on the rumors.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the horror series. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-camera-because-resident-evil-7-was-too-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7 Was “Scary,”</a> and Resident Evil 8 did a great job of making a quiet village terrifying. Resident Evil Requiem takes us back to Raccoon City, and everyone wants to know if Leon Kennedy will be there.</p>







<h2 id="h-could-leon-kennedy-be-in-resident-evil-requiem">Could Leon Kennedy Be In Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He has to be, right? Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stevivor</a>, Resident Evil Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa opened up on the upcoming sequel. </p>



<p>It should be noted that Kumazawa’s responses were translated via an interpreter. While we don’t discredit the translator, there’s always the possibility that something was lost in translation. But when asked about the future of Leon Kennedy and the rumors that he might be in Resident Evil Requiem, Kumazawa had a simple response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more detective work [on the part of players]. So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation. There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eye patch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Firstly, at no point did Kumazawa outright say Leon isn’t in the game. He merely stated that speculation is speculation, and AI could be responsible for the leaks. On the other hand, this is the most PR-appropriate answer he could’ve given.</p>







<p>Of course, he’s not going to say if Leon is in RE9 and ruin the surprise. <strong>However, he could certainly shut down any suggestions, and he didn’t outright</strong>. Fake news doesn’t mean no, and how many times have we seen or heard a dev say something isn’t happening, knowing full well it is?</p>



<p>You only have to look at Summer Game Fest 2025, where Capcom fooled everyone by teasing us with future RE9 news, before unveiling the game at the end of the show to fake everyone out!</p>



<p>With news of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-skin-spotted-on-playstation-portugal-pre-order-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Leon Skin Being Spotted On The PlayStation Portugal Pre-Order Page</a>, all signs point toward the legendary character being involved one way or another.</p>



<p>We’ll keep monitoring the situation and checking the latest RE9 leaks. DO you think Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem?

			<p>Bloodborne has now become even more playable on a wider range of PC configurations thanks to the latest version of the ShadPS4 emulator, now available for download.</p>



<p>Version 0.12.6 of the emulator developed initially by George Moralis, which can now be downloaded as a nightly build <a href="https://shadps4.net/downloads/">using the installer found on the emulator's official website</a>, packs some performance and emulation improvements for select PlayStation 4 exclusives that have yet to officially launch on PC, such as the aforementioned Bloodborne and God of War III Remastered.</p>



<p>FromSoftware's hardcore action role-playing game seems to have benefited the most from the improvements made to the emulator's latest build. As shown in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">Tabeneru</a>, the game's performance on an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU is doubled in some instances over the previous version of the emulator.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the game runs almost flawlessly on an RTX 4080 with none of the frame pacing issues that plague it on PlayStation 5, as shown in another video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam.</a></p>

<p>This is great news for most players, but especially for those with mid or low end hardware, as these improvements make it possible for such users to enjoy the game without performance issues, although issues still present (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">some fixable with mods</a>) prevent the game from being perfectly emulated. Still, Steam Deck users can similarly benefit from these improvements, as Bloodborne now runs much better on the handheld system, as showcased in a new video by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard.</a></p>

<p>God of War III Remastered, on the other hand, is still not entirely playable due to evident visual glitches in multiple stages, but now the game's epic intro sequence is perfectly emulated, which bodes for the rest of the game getting properly emulated with improved performance down the line. You can check out how the game runs on ShadPS4 0.12.6 in the video below shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alepc7480">Ale PC</a> on YouTube.</p>

<p>The new ShadPS4 0.12.6 version also introduces significant performance improvements in other PlayStation 4 exclusives, such as InFAMOUS Second Son, which is sadly still far from being playable, The Last Guardian, and others.

              <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> is proving pretty popular with critics. The latest entry in the infinitely-running series is sitting on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">Metascore of 83</a>, with no reviews so far marked as “negative.” The same, however, can not be said of user reviews. At a desultory <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc">Metascore of 1.9</a>, it’s the worst-rated&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> ever.</p> <p>A lot of the ire in the Metascore reviews is focused on the game’s “lackluster” multiplayer-only campaign, faulty matchmaking, litany of bugs, and very unfavorable comparisons with <em>Arc Raiders</em>, but the use of AI also comes up a great deal as people vent their frustrations. It was noticed immediately after launch that the latest entry in one of the biggest franchises in the world had used AI-plagiarized art for player banners, calling cards and even artwork within the campaign. <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397">When&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> approached Activision for comment on this</a>, the company seemed entirely nonplussed by the situation, simply stating “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams…”</p>

 <p>“Just pure trash full of ai slop,” says one Metacritic user. “What AI bot did they use to puke up this garbage?” asks another. A third comments, “It’s just another hurriedly rushed AI slop-fest.” One comment that appears to capture the mood of most poetically phrases it, “Unbelievable, abysmal dogshit. Save your money please! The use of AI is just the cherry on top.”</p>

 <p>Of course, user scores do tend to be marked on a binary scale, rather than adopting the full spread of numbers. People tend to leave reviews not out of a sense of civic duty, but rather because they’re either delighted or furious, hence the majority of these scores being a possibly somewhat exaggerated 0. Scattered throughout (albeit very much in the minority), bringing the overall average to 1.9, are 9s and 10s from enthusiasts. It’s obviously not a useful metric of a game’s quality, but it’s certainly a very useful way to see which way a game is being received by the wider public.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, over on Steam, the game is currently sitting on the very low end of “Mixed” reviews, with just 42 percent of reader reviews finding&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> to be positive. (However, that rating drops to “Mostly Negative” when reviews are filtered for English language only. Chinese players seem to be having a better response.) “chatgpt generate me a lackluster campaign with reused assets and cringe worthy dialogue,” reads one popular review. “Activision just pay for art you clearly have money and it won’t look like shit,” says another.</p> <p>It’s something of a relief that the brazen use of AI in games still generates fury like this, players yet to be inoculated to it by its widespread use. Companies are keen to trot out the “But everyone else is doing it!” excuse, like a child caught cheating in a test, but right now this isn’t cutting it with audiences. It seems pretty likely that any major company pledging&nbsp;<em>not</em> to use AI could win enormous favor with players in this climate. It’s probably worth a try!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar Games sent the world into overdrive two years ago with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1. It has amassed countless views, and now it’s been claimed that it’s risen to the top as the number one YouTube trailer without ads.</p>



<p>One day, many from now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> will release. It will be a glorious day, everyone will rejoice in the game’s outrageous content and over-the-top violence, and appreciate that Rockstar Games spent a lot of time crafting a probable masterpiece. The most recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 delay</a> hurts, yes, but we’ll look back on the journey with newfound fondness—particularly Trailer 1.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 set the wheels in motion, and it continues to be watched worldwide.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The day and nightlife. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evidence shows that Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 has recently passed 269 million views (and counting) on YouTube, making it allegedly the number one YouTube trailer of all time <strong>without ads</strong>.</p>



<p>We have to emphasize this as there are a small handful of worldwide trailers that eclipse this, but do feature YouTube ads. It’s an incredible feat as Rockstar Games could quite easily have monetized this trailer, and still landed themselves a nice, hefty chunk of revenue.</p>



<p>The video also has over 1 million comments! Trailer 2 isn’t doing too badly either, sitting at just under 150 million views at the time of writing.</p>



<p>With another year to go until Grand Theft Auto 6, we’ll keep rewatching Trailer 1 (and Trailer 3), await Trailer 3, and hope for a full gameplay reveal or walkthrough sooner rather than later.</p>

These Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 editions also run perfectly on Switch 2 and PS5, so you’re covered on the hardware front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe you’ve recently discovered Final Fantasy because of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">Magic: The Gathering crossover</a>, and you’re curious where those characters and creatures actually come from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the easiest way to get the full tour. You’re getting the first six games with modern touches like adjustable EXP gain, toggleable encounters, and auto-battle, all of which make these versions the most approachable they’ve ever been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not long ago, the physical edition was one of those almost impossible-to-find collector items. Reprints finally fixed that, and now all six games cost about half the price of a single new release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned, it's the best price ever on this collection, so you're getting the best deal possible (backed up by trusted price trackers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?th=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CamelCamelCamel</a>).</p></div><div catalogid="f468f4d5-e228-4975-aea6-e336d85547ce" id="224484"><div id="224484" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (PS4)</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Should You Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably not. When a deal hits an all-time low during the run up to Black Friday, that’s usually the signal that retailers have already fired their biggest shot for deals like this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This collection doesn’t swing up and down like mainstream blockbusters, and Square Enix hasn’t been in the habit of pushing deeper cuts on it outside the major tentpole events. The last meaningful drop was during Prime Day, and this price already beats that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, physical stock also isn’t guaranteed to sit around forever. This is still a niche collector-leaning release, and once the early Black Friday rush cleans out retailers, you’re at risk of FOMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Black Friday proper knock off another dollar or two? In theory. In practice, retailers use early Black Friday offers to test demand, and if something sells well at an all-time low, they don’t bother dropping it further. So if you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab this set, in my expert opinion, this is the moment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Early Black Friday Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday discounts are already starting to roll in, and we'll see a whole host of sales go officially live in the next few days across retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big new deals include <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6MlA?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$50 off the Meta Quest 3S at Amazon</a>, now $249, or just <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrAgBD?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$329 for the 256GB version with Batman Arkham Shadow included</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The DualSense Edge controller is also down to just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVjGO?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$159.99 at Amazon</a> today as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

<p>In speaking with <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/">Press Start Australia</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa shared more details on the game's development, and it turns out that the team "tried really hard" to implement the Switch 2's mouse controls into Requiem, but ultimately decided against it when it became apparent that mouse controls "confused and convoluted the gameplay":</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lktqzp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Actually, we tried really hard to implement mouse controls for Nintendo Switch 2. When we did put it in, it confused and convoluted the gameplay and became too complicated. So actually, we are using gyro instead."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you ask us, this is music to our ears. In terms of offering options, yes, it's a shame Capcom couldn't quite make mouse controls work, but we're <em>big</em> fans of gyro aiming, so you can bet we'll be making use of this in the final game. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> both included gyro controls for the Switch, but curiously, Capcom opted to exclude it from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>Kumazawa-san also mentions that Requiem still contains "remaining elements" from when it was initially conceived as an online multiplayer game six years back. He states that this version was fun to play, but "the horror part was very mild", so a decision was made to revert it back to a single-player experience – wise move, indeed.</p>
<p>To potentially assuage fears that Resident Evil might be veering back into the action genre following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, Kumazawa-san also states that the development team "wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part" in Requiem. That's not to say, however, that there won't be at least <em>some</em> action, as he states that "by putting in the action, and making sure the player isn’t thinking about the horror, the next horror part will scare more effectively than non-stop scares".</p>
<p>Fans have long speculated that Resident Evil veteran Leon Kennedy may crop up in Requiem as a second playable character. Capcom has remained tight-lipped on the idea, but it would certainly add more weight to the fact that players will be revisiting Raccoon City and the decimated R.P.D station.</p>

            <p>US Congressman Ro Khanna has responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/1989470230356308349">Taking to social media</a> and responding to a viral post about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">AI calling cards in the recent AAA FPS</a>, Khanna wrote: "We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits. And there should be a tax on mass displacement."</p>
<p>In response to queries to whether AI was explicitly used to create these calling cards, Activision responded late last week with the following statement: "Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios."</p>

<p>These calling cards, as well as the campaign for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, have been met with a negative reception from the wider Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 fanbase, with some shocked at how apparent the use of image generation software appears to be across some portions of the game.</p><p>Ro Khanna, for his part, has been pushing for AI regulation for some time now. <a href="https://khanna.house.gov/media/in-the-news/rep-ro-khanna-what-it-will-take-congress-regulate-ai-privacy-and-social-media">As early as January 2024</a> the congressman was pushing for wider controls for the massive industry, one which is now taking up a vast amount of US growth and investment.</p>
<p>Generative AI use has started to become rather widespread across the video game industry, or at the very least, that's what public statements from developer owners have indicated. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">Square Enix recently noted its intent to replace 70 percent of its QA work with generative AI</a>, while a survey at Tokyo Game Show noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese developers were using AI in some form</a>. It's certainly not isolated to Eastern development either, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-is-leveraging-ai-in-ethical-and-sustainable-ways-says-new-ceo-insisting-human-authorship-is-final">Embracer's CEO acknowledging his company's intent to leverage AI</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft's insistence on AI use as two examples of large Western moves to embrace the tech</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">you can read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, reviewer Jeremy Peel describes it as : "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>
