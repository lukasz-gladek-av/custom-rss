			<p>PC gaming has dominated the mainstream markets over the past decade, as revealed in this <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">new report</a> by Epyllion. Traditionally, video game markets have always favored console platforms in terms of product launches, given that the PC version often comes years after the mainstream release, but despite this disparity, it seems like PC gaming has managed to compete in the gaming segment tremendously. Epyllion's newest report has revealed that PC gaming consumer revenue share has grown by up to 20% in years, while console revenue has "stagnated," showing the interest around both platforms.</p>
<p>The data reveals that while both platforms have seen exponential growth over the years, it seems like PC gaming has seen a stronger momentum, which has certainly been reflected in the revenue figures. Since the last decade, PC gaming has been said to bring in up to 220% higher revenue than the console platform, which is indeed astonishing, considering how the general notion is that consoles have contributed more to the gaming industry in general.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image credits: Epyllion</figcaption></figure>
<p>Epyllion claims that the platform's growth over the years is due to its "compounding advantages" over the console platform and a more interactive environment, which means backward compatibility and greater control over the gaming performance of the respective systems. Along with this, the sluggish selling momentum of consoles has also been attributed to the figures, which is why PC gaming has seen accelerated progress over the past few years, especially after 2021.</p>
<p>Whatever platform emerges at the top, it's safe to say that this progress is ultimately healthy for the gaming markets since the revenue figures rising over the years mean we are witnessing sustainable growth. Let us know which platform you prefer, PC or console, and why.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/karma-the-dark-world-understands-that-horror-lives-in-your-head<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Stephen King once famously wrote that there were three levels of terror: the gross-out, when blood and guts are everywhere; horror, as King put it, “the unnatural, spiders the size of bears, the dead up and walking around, it’s when something with claws grabs you by the arms”; and terror: “when the lights go out and when you feel something behind you, you hear it, you feel its breath against you, and you turn around, there’s nothing there.” King believed terror was the finest emotion of the three, and it’s the one he always tried to evoke in his readers. And make no mistake, terror is an emotion. Horror is something you experience. Terror is the work of the mind, the imagination of what’s absent, of what might be under the rug or around the corner. It is what you <em>live through</em>. Karma: The Dark World has its share of horror, yes. But it is primarily concerned with terror. And more to the point, it is <em>good</em> at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were times during my roughly two-hour demo when I was playing at night, with headphones off, and I had to pause and take a breath. Horror games don’t generally “scare” me. I don’t jump, don’t yell, don’t scream. I know the tricks. But it was two in the morning and I was tired and alone and wearing headphones and something had wormed its way into my brain, and when I had to climb into that vent to enter that blocked-off, red-tinged room, I decided that was enough for the evening. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Karma is full of little moments like that, where you don’t want to go forward, don’t want to bear witness, but you must. Karma is set in an alternate-history 1976, and you’re stepping into the shoes of Roam Agent Daniel McGovern. Daniel is what they call a Nightcrawler. An employee of the omnipresent Leviathan Corporation’s Thought Bureau, he spends most of his time inside other people’s heads. As my demo started, he was being sent to investigate Sean Mehndez, who was accused of stealing something from the Winston Research Institute. You’re to investigate that, as well as an “unusual incident” that took place in the clerical office around the same time. It sounds, as Daniel notes, fairly routine. It isn’t.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Big Brother is Watching</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Karma’s world is explicitly dystopian, and you’ll notice how wrong everything feels right off the bat. Some people have televisions for heads. Everyone has a social level, and every minor infraction is recorded, catalogued, tracked, and held against you – even things as seemingly insignificant as having a stain on your work uniform or applying makeup during work hours. Telescreens requiring user IDs, shaped like floppy disks, are tied to social level and hang in every room. Leviathan’s all-seeing eye is watching you. None of this stuff was explained in the demo I played. It didn’t need to be; you understand it immediately, the way you understand a weight hanging around your neck, the same way you understand a noose. This world is <em>wrong</em>, which only adds to what’s to come.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Karma is a first-person game, which only adds to the dread that creeps into you as you play. You are always aware of what you can’t see, what you have to look away from to progress, what might happen if you do. Daniel’s investigation starts off innocently enough. You explore the Research Institute, piecing together what has happened and solving simple puzzles. You need an ID to open the storage room, so you piece together the code by reading a diary entry and using that to find the clue you need in the world. But soon, The Horrors ™ start to creep in. “Don’t look back” appears scrawled on a wall when you flick off a lightswitch. If you do, you’ll see… something, a man, a shape, a ghost, appear and then vanishes. When you examine the recordings of infractions, some…thing with too many legs seems to be in the image. Something is deeply wrong here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Karma builds dread in more subtle ways, too. Musical stings that appear and then vanish as suddenly as they came, seemingly at random. The lighting of a room. The destroyed area you’re to investigate. It always feels like you’re moving towards something, witnessing something, and often, you won’t want to. Daniel even moves slowly, lumbering, like he knows he shouldn’t be here, that advancing will lead him to a place he doesn’t want to go.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Splinters in the Mind’s Eye</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most memorable moment of my time with Karma came after I found the evidence of Mehndez’s crime. When I went to return it via the pneumatic tubes that dispensed my orders, I saw Mehndez walking, like a ghost, through the hallway. I followed him, and he led me into a dark room, with a single door. When I entered, I found myself in what I can best describe as Twin Peaks’s Black Lodge: red curtains everywhere, mannequins, a family around a table. It took me a moment to realize I was seeing Mehndez’s memories – his life, his fears, maybe. Something. I read about his daughter, saw her room, and then when I returned, they had moved in front of the TV, and eventually, they led me to an elevator going down. I descended.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What followed was one of the most disturbing sequences I’ve ever experienced in a horror game. Alarm clocks hanging from the ceiling, going off. Bodies covered in some sort of black goo, mannequins splattered with blood, lying haphazardly along gurneys. I learned about what had happened to Mehndez, to his wife, his daughter. I watched their home disintegrate; I put my hand into a computer and watched a man, strung up by his arms, explode; I entered an office and watched it go mad, the mannequins inside cowering in fear. At one point I turned around, tried to go another way, and they were all suddenly behind me, hands up, forcing me to go forward. Sometimes, the greatest horror is to be forced to watch. And I thought of Revelation. And a voice said “come and see,” and I looked.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw those mannequins hover, saw the black goo cover the floor, saw Mehndez’s home disintegrate further, learned what befell his family. And the curtains around me, always the red curtains. Then back into the office, answering the ringing phone, previously silent. “War. Peace. Freedom. Slavery. Ignorance. Strength,” said the voice on the other end. I recognized the words. Orwell. 1984. Big Brother is watching you. And I followed them, followed them until I reached an office where I could walk through the screen and see the big eye that had been watching me, and I saw that eye sprout more eyes, and I watched it follow me as I climbed stairs supported by nothing, and I saw three doors leading nowhere, and another phone, and I answered it, and someone, a woman, told me that she was sorry, that none of this was supposed to happen. And I entered the door in front of me, and something came after me, something I barely glimpsed but that horrified me all the same, and I fell. And then Daniel woke up, and I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Was it real? Had it happened? Had Daniel imagined it? Did it matter? Like him, I had experienced it and I will remember those images, real or not. We can be haunted by what seem like dreams, by the unreal, the uncanny, the wrong. It is where horror lives. In the mind. There was more to my demo past this, but terror is best experienced, so I will end here, and say Karma: The Dark World beckons you to come and see. And if developer Pollard Studio can deliver that feeling, that dread that compels, that horrifies, that you feel, for the rest of Karma: The Dark World’s runtime, then it is a journey that I will be happy to live through. My eyes are open.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

First, we shared our picks for the games we most want to see make their way to the Nintendo Switch 2. We also shared our impressions of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>after some recent hands-on time with the game, and look ahead to what seems to be a pretty promising year for Xbox Game Pass. Read on for these takes and more.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b0e671bb3cd9f65e797f21411cca6490" data-recommend-id="image://b0e671bb3cd9f65e797f21411cca6490" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lilith from Diablo is shown inside a Switch 2 screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lilith from Diablo is shown inside a Switch 2 screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment / Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0e671bb3cd9f65e797f21411cca6490" data-recommend-id="image://b0e671bb3cd9f65e797f21411cca6490" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lilith from Diablo is shown inside a Switch 2 screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original Switch was a trailblazing device that proved you could take console-quality games on the go, but it was demonstrably less powerful than its PlayStation and Xbox competitors. In the years since the Switch was released, that gap has only grown with the release of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. We still don’t have official specs for the Switch 2, but it will likely be a decent leap forward for Nintendo’s line of handheld/console hybrids. As such, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see some older games make their way to the device that couldn’t feasibly run on the original, so we got to thinking about some big games that we’d like to see ported to the Switch 2. Here are a few of our ideas.  - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6514a2accdf6c3bdbbb1c46b207217d0" data-recommend-id="image://6514a2accdf6c3bdbbb1c46b207217d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1150" data-height="647" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The image of the Four Cyclists of the Apocalypse in the final issue of AMIGA POWER." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The image of the Four Cyclists of the Apocalypse in the final issue of AMIGA POWER." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amiga Power</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6514a2accdf6c3bdbbb1c46b207217d0" data-recommend-id="image://6514a2accdf6c3bdbbb1c46b207217d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1150" data-height="647" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The image of the Four Cyclists of the Apocalypse in the final issue of AMIGA POWER." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a reasonable chance you have not heard of Jonathan Nash.

<p>Xbox CEO Phil Spencer denied that Starfield would be coming to PlayStation 5 last year, but after a new interview following the developer direct, his opinion has seemingly changed.</p>



<p>Speaking to Destin Legarie via his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patreon</a>, Spencer responded “No” after Legarie asked, “Can you solidify that Starfield is staying put for the time being?”</p>



<p>Spencer continued “There’s no specific game that I would… This goes back to my redline answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>“What we find is we’re able to drive a better business that allows us to invest in a great game lineup that you saw, and that’s our strategy. Game pass is an important component to playing games on our platform, but to keep games off other platforms, that’s not a path for us,” he said.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XboxEra reported</a> that Microsoft would be planning to release Starfield on the PlayStation 5, which is a claim that Xbox would later deny, but is now seemingly true (whether or not Starfield was planned back then remains to be seen).</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Ninja Gaiden 4 Announced At Xbox Developer Direct</a></strong></p>



<p>Regardless, following the interviews this week, Xbox has finally decided to just rip the Band-Aid off the whole Xbox exclusivity saga, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company now pretty much saying that there games will be on every platform</a>, which ultimately, is better for gamers.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mass Effect 2 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, January 26, 2025. Below, we look back at its unique episodic structure, and how other developers have not picked up its torch.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Most RPGs are like fantasy or science-fiction novels. The cross-continental journeys of Final Fantasy X or Dragon Age: Origins feel analogous to The Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time. Even sandboxes like Baldur's Gate 3 lean on a linear set of events, the disruption of routine key to fantasy fiction. Mass Effect 2 is a serious contrast, instead modeling itself after a season of television. I'm not <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-mass-effect-2-was-my-favorite-mass-effect-5898519" rel="nofollow ">the first person to make this comparison</a>, but even after a decade and a half of further RPG releases, ME2's structure remains striking. The format helped catapult ME2 to upper echelons of many greatest-games lists. It is still the most beloved entry of the franchise, beating out its incomplete and controversial siblings. However, without the novelty of experiencing it for the first time, ME2 feels more like a valiant first effort at something new, rather than the apex of the form.</p><p dir="ltr">To summarize, protagonist Shepard is tasked with recruiting 12 party members to accompany him on a "suicide mission." Outside of a few main quests, most of ME2's runtime concerns itself with recruiting those characters and helping them resolve their personal issues. ME2's main plot is ultimately inconsequential to the trilogy's broader machinations. Instead, the game's series of one-off missions steal the show, making ME2 more character-focused than its kin. One could argue that Baldur's Gate 3, with its three acts, or Dragon Age: Origins, with its hub areas, have episodic structures. But each mission in ME2 is essentially an episode of TV. Most are entirely self-contained, and few relate back to the main plot in any meaningful way. They act the way individual episodes in a television show might act. The game is a serious attempt to bring the long-term, routine-focused dynamics of classic Star Trek to a massive RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">In theory, this offers space for characters to relax, take up space, and show their complexities and shades. Sometimes it even succeeds. The assassin Thane is an obvious highlight--a clichéd character given weight and grace through careful writing and some beguiling alien touches.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1131917953"

in the ensemble. Mass Effect 2's focus on individual characters leads to some remarkable moments, but it also means there is little room for party members to get to know and react to each other. To be fair, this is a problem that many RPGs have. Because you often swap out companion characters, leaving the remainder "back at camp," means that you have little guaranteed time with any individual character and even less time with any pair or trio in your party. Intra-companion interactions are limited to banter or brief reactions. Conflict between party members cannot drive the plot because there is no guarantee that any individual party member will be present at any time. (Final Fantasy solved this problem years ago by assuming every party member is present for cutscenes, but restricting combat to a limited number).</p><p dir="ltr">Mass Effect 2 instantiated this problem in some novel ways. Each of the game's 12 party members are only guaranteed to be present for two missions. DLC characters like Kasumi Goto and Zaeed Massani only get one. This means that party members have to go broad, charismatic, and identifiable. The majority of the cast are recognizable archetypes that get little elaboration: the traumatized punk with a heart of gold (Jack), the neurotic, autistic-coded scientist (Mordin), the beleaguered self-sacrificing warrior (Samara). The returning companions Tali, Garrus, and especially Liara avoid this to some degree (the Liara-focused DLC Lair of the Shadow Broker is perhaps the single best Mass Effect story). But Tali's and Garrus's quests offer variations on their arcs from the first game. What is Tali's relationship to her culture and family? Should Garrus indulge his instincts of vengeance? Neither mission pushes either character beyond where they already were.</p><p dir="ltr">To give credit where it is due, ME2 does try to center character conflict. Opposing party members like Jack and Miranda (who works for the corp that experimented on Jack) get a moment of confrontation. However, these are isolated scenes that are easily defused with a persuasion check. ME2's structure can't allow these conflicts to boil over at a dramatic moment or become a pain point revisited during multiple missions. While individual characters can experience growth and change, the character of the ensemble itself must remain consistent. The only relationships that can develop, at least in a serious meaningful way, are between party members and the player. Even the suicide mission, in which all 12 party members participate, focuses on choices about individual characters. The growth of the ensemble, the development of it unto itself, is a defining element of most great television. ME2 can only manage a few gestures at it.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all my grousing, ME2 does sometimes capitalize on its format. The episodic structure allows for a wider diversity of settings than the first game's hub worlds and the third's military theatres. Though the game's overall plot is weak, its individual moments remain focused, allowing missions with high and low stakes, from rescuing a lost sister to saving a son from the sins of the father. This gives the game an emotional character, so that when the stakes get higher in the suicide mission, your heart is with the individual lives of your crew more than anything else.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite these strengths, no game has really taken Mass Effect 2's mantle. RPGs like Pentiment, Disco Elysium, and Citizen Sleeper have innovated on the format in entirely different ways. Dragon Age: The Veilguard borrows the ideal of the "suicide mission," concluding in a massive setpiece, but lets go of ME2's more episodic elements. Throwback isometric games like Pillars of Eternity and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous attempt to wrangle the sprawl of tabletop campaigns into video game form. Even literal episodic games like Life is Strange borrow more from the miniseries, rather than the sci-fi television epic. While Mass Effect 2 is beloved, it is not exactly influential.</p><p dir="ltr">Fifteen years later, what Mass Effect 2 best showcases is promise. While hardly an experimental game, it attempts something novel in its genre-space and succeeds, but the gaps it leaves behind are tantalizing. One wonders what a similar game with a smaller cast, a greater focus on character conflict, and an unflagging commitment to episodic storytelling might bring. Its potential is still unrealized.</p>

            <p>35 years after point and click horror game Last Half of Darkness first released it's coming back, remade from the ground up by the same solo dev who created it.</p>
<p>In honour of the 35th anniversary (well, technically 36th now) of the 1989 original, Bill Fisher has gone back to the start by remaking the first Last Half of Darkness with all-new graphics, a new soundtrack, "enhanced" story, and "even more" puzzles. You can check out the announcement teaser below:</p>

<p>"Your aunt sure was a strange one," the blurb teases. "She was some sort of witch or something. A good witch though, practicing only good spells and magic. In fact, she was working on a potion just before she was killed.</p>
<p>"Now the secret will go to the grave with her... unless you can find the missing ingredients."</p>
<p>"I made it on an XT PC 64k RAM system with a 10mb hard drive over a 9 month period, just working part-time on it," Fisher explained. "Was goofing around with some paint programs seeing if I could make some cool looking rooms and locations. It ended up turning out relatively good so I decided to actually package it. Hired an artist to do the package design and found a box manufacturer, etc. Got it in a couple retail stores locally, and sold a few at some conventions but wasn't really familiar or had the right contacts with the distribution side of things so it never was officially released commercially.</p>
<p>"However, right around that time, shareware was starting to really take off... and turned out to be very successful."</p>
<p>Last Half of Darkness is set to release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3096000/Last_Half_of_Darkness/">Steam</a> on 7th February 2025, although if you missed the original first time around, worry not - <a href="http://lasthalfofdarkness.com/">that's still available</a>, too.</p>

            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> said its brand identity is "evolving" now keeping first-party games exclusive to its own platform is no longer "a path for [Xbox]".</p>
<p>When asked by independent games journalist <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254">Dustin Legarie</a> if, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> would continue to have an "exclusivity window" on Xbox systems, Spencer replied with a strikingly simple: "No."</p>

<p>"There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," Spencer explained.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is to allow our games to be available.</p>
<p>"Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform, but to keep games off other platforms?" Spencer added."We don't think is the path… that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us."</p> <div>

<p>"What we're doing now we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world's best games. 'Cos the world's biggest games are available in multiple places, and more and more creators are asking us, how do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places, and we want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that.</p>
<p>"We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are single platform on single device, whether that's PC, whether that's mobile, whether it's a console.</p>
<p>And we want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on."</p>
<p>When pressed on whether Xbox's change in strategy means it may lose its identity, Spencer was firm about that, too.</p>
<p>"I hear them. I'm pretty active in our playerbase, and I'm active in the community. I listen. I think our identity will continue to evolve, which, frankly, it always has. But when I hear concerns, I hear concerns about is: my library of games safe. Am I still going to be able to play the games. And I think over the years, I'm proud of the commitment we've shown to respecting purchases on our platform through back compat, through cross entitlement, Xbox Play Anywhere, through crossplay. Things that we've done to enable people to continue to play, so I hear that.</p><p>"I see the investments we're making in platform and how we want Xbox to show up in multiple places, and your library to be available there. When I think about buy-to-stream - so when if I buy a game, I'll be able to stream it to devices - this is all about making sure that your library of games that you own on Xbox are playable in multiple places, so I'd say it's in evolution of our identity. But I believe it's an identity that this industry needs.</p>
<p>"When you think about where this industry is now and you see the challenges, the business challenges that are out there for many companies, I think us making games more accessible to more people has just gotta be front and centre for us as an industry so we continue to see great games that we've seen over the years."</p>
<p>The comments echo Spencer's position at the end of last year, when he said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">"no red lines" over any Xbox game coming to Nintendo Switch or PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I stopped buying most games for my Nintendo Switch the day I bought a Steam Deck. My Switch has been a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">Mario</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Zelda</a> machine ever since. It’s simple: the Steam Deck took the Switch’s best trick — pick-up-and-play portability — while offering more games that run better. I can easily resume the ones I started on my desktop PC, or continue to play portable titles on my desktop and marvel at improved graphics.&nbsp;</p><p>But the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, coming later this year, may change that value proposition. Not only will it continue to be <em>the</em> console that attracts families and kids with inventive, surprising, must-try exclusive Nintendo games that use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">its detachable Joy-Cons’ many tricks</a>, but it also has a real chance at convincing the enthusiasts who might otherwise buy a handheld gaming PC — or who were waiting for handheld PCs to become less of a wild west.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Switch 2’s newly magnetic Joy-Con.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The Switch 2 may meet or beat the Steam Deck in performance. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">If history’s any indication</a>, it should <em>easily</em> sell better than every handheld gaming PC combined. When the original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago, there was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">almost nothing to play but <em>Zelda</em></a>, and Nintendo held its game catalog in an iron grip — but now, the backwards-compatible Switch 2 will launch with one of the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/platform/?sort=games&amp;order=desc">largest and most welcoming libraries of all time</a>, rivaled only by smartphones and computers. The Switch could theoretically become the new baseline for game developers to target, and the most reliable place to find new handheld-friendly titles.</p><p>So: How can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">the budding handheld PC revolution</a> escape the shadow of the Switch 2? I won’t say I know for sure, but I <em>did</em> just check the industry’s temperature at CES 2025, the world’s biggest tech show — and I’m afraid PC handhelds may stay in that shadow unless the industry does more.&nbsp;</p><p>Handheld ergonomics was one bright spot going into 2025. While I still prefer the Deck’s overall feel, practically every PC handheld I touched had nicely sculpted grips that made them more comfortable to hold than their predecessors. From the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">8-inch MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> and Lenovo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Legion Go S</a>, to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342995/i-played-with-the-new-legion-go-2-too">the 8.8-inch Legion Go 2</a>, and the giant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">11-inch Tencent Sunday Dragon</a>, even the largest Windows handhelds didn’t feel as awkward as some of their first-gen predecessors.</p><p>There are four places I think the industry has to change — and maybe, band together — if these handhelds want a meaningful piece of the Switch.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>A year made a huge ergonomic difference to Lenovo’s handhelds in particular. (The new one’s on the left.)</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto</cite></p></div><p><h3>Operating system</h3></p><p>Buyers need to know that their game will be ready to <em>play </em>when they press the power button on a handheld. That’s the Nintendo Switch experience, and it’s similar to how the Steam Deck works once games are downloaded — but it’s far from what Windows handhelds currently offer.</p><p>That’s why the three biggest pieces of handheld gaming news at the show had little to do with the hardware itself. They were about ditching today’s version of handheld Windows.&nbsp;</p><p>First, Lenovo revealed it would produce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first authorized third-party handheld</a> to ship with Valve’s easy-to-use SteamOS instead of Windows — something only the Steam Deck has done so far. Second, Valve told us it would bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">a SteamOS beta to additional third-party handhelds</a> as soon as this April. Third, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">a Microsoft executive told <em>The Verge</em></a> that the company would finally do something meaningful about its bloated Windows experience on handhelds later this year, combining “the best of Xbox and Windows together.”&nbsp;</p><p>These moves are heartening, as it’s a Wild West in handheld PC land. Most companies opt for a copy of Windows that doesn’t reliably launch games or sleep and wake properly, defeating some of the purpose of a pick-up-and-play handheld experience. They’re filled with difficult-to-navigate UI and unnecessary bloatware, too — to the point that today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">a community-created fork of Valve’s SteamOS UI is already a far better experience</a> than Windows.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also good for SteamOS fans: while the Steam Deck is a great platform for SteamOS, we’ve already seen the Deck can’t compete with the Switch by itself. Game publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">don’t see the raw sales numbers</a> to bring big multiplayer games like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Valorant</em> to SteamOS. (They say <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">cheaters are too big a risk</a>.)</p><p>But, while the CES moves are significant, Valve, Microsoft, and Lenovo are non-committal about how much things might improve. Microsoft would only give me the barest hints about making Windows feel more like an Xbox game console at some point later this year. Lenovo is hedging its SteamOS bet <em>hard —</em> not only will the Legion Go S ship in both Windows and SteamOS varieties, the Windows version will go on sale months earlier, and Lenovo won’t commit to SteamOS for its larger, later-in-2025 handheld.&nbsp;</p><p>No other company announced a SteamOS handheld at CES, either, save for PC maker GPD, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld">with a claim that was apparently false</a> or lost in translation. Valve told me it has no other partner devices currently in the works for SteamOS, though it’d be happy to work with more companies. I believe every handheld maker should give SteamOS a shot.</p><div><figcaption><em>CES 2025 brought huge handhelds like this 11-inch Acer, and they’re </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment"><em>not necessarily a bad idea</em></a><em>!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>Screen</h3></p><p>This one’s easy: to maximize performance, battery life, economies of scale, and offer a closer-to-game-console experience, handheld PC makers should <em>universally adopt</em> a 1080p-or-lower-resolution HDR OLED screen with variable refresh rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Many PC manufacturers are wasting what little performance they can muster from a handheld chip and battery on a screen with far too many pixels for the task, artificially constraining performance and battery life in exchange for 1600p or 1200p sharpness that most gamers won’t miss on a 7-inch to 8-inch panel. Additionally, every handheld <em>without</em> a variable refresh rate screen is likely wasting a good chunk of the frames that their handheld can serve because their screen is artificially limiting their framerate — VRR was the Asus ROG Ally’s secret weapon, letting it play games more smoothly than competing handhelds even if rivals’ chips offered the same FPS.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review#:~:text=in%20HDR%2C%20your%20games%20finally%20have%20real%20light">HDR is a revelation on the Steam Deck OLED’s screen</a>, letting both native titles and the HDR games I stream from my PS5 feel like they’re filled with real light that explodes out of the screen. It’s something Windows desktops and laptops have never consistently offered the way today’s consoles do, but handhelds could be the gateway to changing that.</p><p>Is a screen like the one I’m describing expensive or hard to find? Band together, PC companies, and surely a display maker can change that for you.</p><p><h3>Chips and battery</h3></p><p>Unless you count the Nvidia Tegra at the heart of the Nintendo Switch, AMD is the leader in handheld chips. But its semi-custom <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/1/24021717/speaking-of-handheld-pc-gaming-chips-heres-an-incredible-look-at-the-steam-decks-apu">Aerith and Sephiroth parts</a> for the Steam Deck feel like the <em>only </em>ones proactively designed with power-sipping handhelds in mind, leaving everyone else at a portability disadvantage. And it sounds like AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">new Z2 line</a> might not be all that different.</p><p>AMD’s Z1 batch of chips in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally wasn’t originally for handheld; they’re mildly tweaked laptop processors that need 17 or 18 watts to begin to hit their stride, enough for a complete handheld to drain a typical 50Wh battery pack in well under three hours with mildly intensive games.</p><p>The Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips, and while AMD told me some may offer more performance at the same power and add improved efficiency tweaks, the total consumed power may not decrease. Lenovo product manager Alex Zhu told me it’s looking at running its Legion Go S’s Z2 Go chip at around 20 watts, which might give it worse battery life than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck even if its GPU is more capable. AMD also confirmed the Z2 Go is less powerful than the prior-gen Z1 Extreme.</p><p>AMD senior fellow Mahesh Subramony told me the company’s flagship Z2 Extreme chip, on TSMC’s shrunk-down N4P process node with a mix of newer Zen 5, Zen 5c and RDNA 3.5 cores, should be both more efficient and much more capable than the Z2 Go, and quite a bit better than the Z1 Extreme as well, but it’s not a leap forward. That may require AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025">even newer RDNA 4 graphics</a>, and it may require bespoke processors.</p><div><figcaption><em>The MSI Claw 8 AI Plus uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Don’t hold your breath if you’re hoping Intel might provide meaningful competition in the handheld chip realm. While early reviews of the Intel Lunar Lake chip in the revised MSI Claw 8 AI Plus are quite promising, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu">its pricey Lunar Lake chip may be a bit of a one-off</a>, with future Intel parts steering away from the power-saving on-die memory that Intel experimentally added. I’m curious if that’s why <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-claw-8-ai-faces-launch-with-limited-availability-first-units-already-in-gamers-hands">MSI hasn’t fully launched the Claw</a> as expected.</p><p>Meanwhile, Intel certainly has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311594/intel-under-pat-gelsinger">bigger fish to fry right now</a> than making custom handheld chips. “It’s not a market that we’re actively pursuing, but it’s a market we’re happy to enable,” Intel VP of technical marketing Robert Hallock tells me of handheld gaming. “It is somewhat extracurricular,” he added, explaining that it’s a fun and exciting but small market and that Intel has to pick its battles. “We’re coming off admittedly, about five, six years of strife and we have to decide where we want to invest.”.</p><p>Some manufacturers have been able to improve the battery life disadvantage of today’s off-the-shelf AMD chips by including a much larger battery pack — the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a> doubled the size of its predecessor’s pack to 80 watt-hours, and it’s no longer the only 80Wh handheld you can buy. But that comes with size and weight tradeoffs that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">only be partially engineered away</a>.</p><p>We need handheld makers to join together and make a case for better chips.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Steam Deck still starts at $399, even if the $529 OLED model is superior.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>Price</h3></p><p>The PC industry also needs to cut prices if it wants a chance to eat Nintendo’s lunch.&nbsp;</p><p>The Nintendo Switch debuted at $299 in 2017 — around $380 in today’s money — and the OLED version arrived at $349 in 2021. A year later, Valve’s Steam Deck debuted at $399. But today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the only Windows handheld gaming PC I can recommend</a> costs $799, roughly twice the price of an entry-level Deck, and most Windows handhelds have started at $600 and up. High-end options are great, but the space may remain niche without low-end options, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Only the least expensive model of Lenovo’s SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">will lower that bar to $499</a> this May. And all of those prices are still more than Sony or Microsoft charges for a TV console with far more performance, and likely more than Nintendo will charge for the Switch 2.</p><p>I’m not sure what <em>exactly</em> PC makers would need to do to challenge the Switch on price, but it’s likely not simple. Valve CEO Gabe Newell <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-price-valve-gabe-newell-400-dollars-painful-but-critical">said it was “painful” but “critical”</a> to launch the Steam Deck at $399, hinting that the company may have followed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model">razor-and-blades business model</a> where console makers initially sell hardware at a loss, then make the money back as people buy games. If so, that’s a tough act to follow, as no other PC maker controls the world’s largest PC games store and can afford to subsidize a handheld that way.</p><p>But not every console has been a loss leader: Nintendo reportedly never sold the Switch at a loss, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609150/sony-playstation-5-ps5-loss-profit">Sony stopped selling the PS5 at a loss</a> less than a year after its debut. So it’s possible to cut prices with the right bill of materials and economies of scale. Lenovo explicitly told me it worked with AMD on the Z2 Go chip to help lower the Legion Go S’s price, for example.</p><p>To compete with Nintendo, a company like Microsoft or Valve or even Sony needs to lead the charge, securing the components and offering the right operating system for dozens of true Switch competitors Imagine dozens of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">portable Xboxes</a> or PlayStations or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">Steam Machines</a>, instead of each PC maker marching to the beat of their own drum.</p><p>I think it’s time for an industry-wide push on handheld gaming. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23948529/nintendo-switch-steam-deck-handheld-consoles-gaming">It might be the future of gaming, period</a>. There’s too much at stake to tackle it one half-baked Windows handheld at a time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ubisoft's President reportedly agreed to greenlight a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-enhanced-for-ps5-pro-runs-at-4k60-with-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC, which would be funded by Savvy Games Group from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>The Streets of Baghdad May Expand to New Content as Ubisoft Reportedly Agrees on DLC Development for Assassin's Creed Mirage</h2>
<p>Ubisoft's new installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise might not be the only thing fans will be receiving this year, as the company is rumored to expand the previous one. After more than a year since its launch, we are hearing that the <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> is getting its first-ever DLC.</p>
<p>This might be a bit surprising since <em>Assassin's Creed Shadow</em>s is very close to its launch, and getting DLC for the Mirage edition is a report that nobody saw coming. The Shadows will be launching on 20th March 2025, which is roughly two months from now, and the supposed DLC for the Mirage Edition is also coming this year.</p>
<p>The report comes from the French publication Les Echos via prominent AC leaker '<a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">j0nathan</a>'. The report suggests that after the visit to Saudi Arabia, Ubisoft's president, Yves Guillemot,&nbsp;<span>agreed to the DLC development for&nbsp;<em>AC: Mirage</em>, which Ubisoft wasn't initially </span>interested in. Ubisoft has partnered with Savvy Games, which will be a major contributor to this project.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Assassins-Creed-Mirage-Ray-Tracing-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The game was initially designed to be a DLC itself and was supposed to continue the Valhalla storyline, but eventually made it to the game market as an individual installment. The game launched in October 2023 but hasn't got a single DLC since that time. Therefore, it's quite a surprise since the launch of Shadows is pretty close.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it is still a rumor, and we still need official confirmation from Ubisoft about this matter. However, considering Odyssey got its crossover three years after its release, which was after the launch of Valhalla, the Mirage DLC doesn't look unfeasible. Still, there are not enough reports to confirm the news, and we have yet to hear about its exact launch date. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty esports scene isn’t in the best place, that much is for certain. In the last year or two, Activision has tried to shape up the ecosystem a little and has made some positive changes, but prize pools are getting lower, viewership has taken some hits, and Black Ops 6 is currently in the gutter – just a little bit.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, some of the most prolific OpTic personalities, including Scump, Methodz, and Crimsix, sat around the fireplace to talk about the state of COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-can-actually-make-money">‘You Can Actually Make Money’</h2>



<p>Scump dropped a bombshell (admittedly a somewhat obvious one) by stressing that if <strong>he </strong>were trying to become an esports pro all over again right now, he wouldn’t pick Call of Duty as his game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I was an 18 year right now, or 16, or whatever age you’re starting in gaming and I was trying to pursue being a professional in a video game, Call of Duty would not even be on my radar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Methodz echoed Scump’s sentiment, stressing that the Call of Duty scene’s minimum age requirement is too much of a blocker that’s potentially preventing young superstars from finding a spot in the CDL.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been saying to go play Fortnite.</p>



<p>I’m saying, listen bro – unfortunately… This is crazy to me, the age limit…</p>



<p>The fact it’s still an 18 age limit – I was a pro at 14. Like, there’s a lot of 14 to 18 year olds that would probably turn some heads that just can’t play. But I’m like, dude, if you’re 15, why the f*** would you be grinding COD?</p>



<p>Go play Fortnite, you can actually make money in that.</p>
</blockquote>











<p>In the current system, pro players can’t enter the Call of Duty League until they’re 18 years old. It’s not mirrored in every other esports title, of course. For instance, Counter-Strike’s ‘donk’ just turned 18 this weekend and spent the last year becoming known as one of the best players in the business, racking up some mind-boggling achievements in his debut year.</p>



<p>The OpTic guys say that there are so many competing titles in the esports space that Call of Duty shouldn’t even be on your list of potential targets. Do you agree? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>On social media, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, a senior team member at Pocketpair, revealed how he has been inundated with messages and propositions since the firm announced a publishing endeavour. Bucky, who was recently promoted to the role of Communications Director and Publishing Manager, was transparent in a recent post on Twitter (X).</p>



<p>He wrote, ‘I think I might have underestimated how much interest there would be.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-whatever-you-want">‘Do Whatever You Want’</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Palworld’s developer, Pocketpair, revealed ‘Pocketpair Publishing’. At the same time, Surgent Studios, the creator of Tales of Kenzera, announced that it would be the first major partner of the publishing arm, working with the team to create a new horror game.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1882582384052457558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley revealed that within 15 hours of publishing the Pocketpair news, he’d received more than 1,600 connection requests, emails, and propositions from small developers wanting to work with the label.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Bucky shot up, pulling in several hundred followers just as the news broke.</p>



<p>In the comments under his post, Bucky was grilled on the nature of Pocketpair’s publishing initiatives, curious to know how involved the company would be with the developer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We give you money. You make game. </p>



<p>If you want help with marketing or something we’ll help out, but otherwise do whatever you want. </p>



<p>We’re giving devs the financial freedom to make games they want so they DON’T have to get wrapped up with stinky rule makers and bullies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed recently that Pocketpair Publishing is ‘100% self-funded’. In a statement, the company wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a completely independent publisher, we are uniquely positioned to help developers create the games they want, free from the complications of dealing with third parties who may not have their best interests at heart. </p>



<p>Pocketpair and Pocketpair Publishing are beholden to no one. </p>



<p>We remain dedicated to making fun games, and we’re so excited to now be able to help others bring their own fun games to life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want to work with Pocketpair Publishing, it’s as simple as <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">heading to the website</a> and selecting ‘Pitch Your Game’.</p>



<p>Is this a huge win from Pocketpair, or do you see them falling prey to the very thing they’re trying to avoid? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Avowed will be released worldwide on February 18, slotting into an already busy month for the RPG genre. For a while now, prospective fans have been eagerly scooping up any tidbits of information about the game, and most recently, the discussion turned to how the game is laid out.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Xbox Wire, Obsidian’s developers sat down to talk about the lack of an open-world environment in Avowed. It’s very much by design and is a deliberate, strategic decision to encourage players to have e better experience overall.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-can-do-whatever-you-want">‘You Can Do Whatever You Want’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/24/avowed-choose-your-own-adventure-incredible-freedom/" rel="nofollow">with Xbox Wire</a>, Obsidian’s Berto Ritger, Carrie Patel, and Kate Dollarhyde walked readers through the nature of the ‘zones’ in Avowed.</p>



<p>This ambitious RPG isn’t an open-world game, but instead, it relies on a series of ‘denser’ regions locked behind borders that keep the pacing consistent and manageable.</p>



<p>During the interview, Dollarhyde – who works as a narrative designer – explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Pacing is really tough in open-world games.</p>



<p>You never know where the player is and what they’re doing at any given time. So having these zones that happen in sequence means we always know what content you’ve just come from on the critical path. Maybe not what side quests you’ve done, but we always know you’ve just had this core experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That sentiment was echoed by Ritger, region director at Obsidian:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a good pacing mechanism.</p>



<p>We know roughly what you’ve done before you’ve gone to the next thing. It’s still a very open structure within those zones, where you can do whatever you want for the most part, but it’s not one contiguous area where you could be anywhere at any moment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Having smaller, more detailed regions or zones has enabled Obsidian to scope in and focus on delivering a more immersive, choice-driven experience for players. Even with the zones being scaled down from the open-world models we might be more used to in these grand RPG titles, we can still expect there to be plenty of meat on Avowed’s bones.</p>



<p>Do you plan on picking up Avowed when it’s released on February 18? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will follow that with their own releases in February, but some are already getting a sneak peek at the GPUs’ software benefits through DLSS 4.</p><p>Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the $1,999 RTX 5090 indicates it’s expectedly a powerhouse, but not quite the generational leap that the RTX 4090 was over its own predecessor. That didn’t stop <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister from being impressed with the two-slot RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPU when he stuffed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">into his aging small-form-factor PC</a>. </p><p>Along with the 50-series GPUs comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation</a>, a software trick that may be just as big a story as the hardware itself. This latest version of DLSS uses AI to predictively generate frames, making it possible to run games at higher resolutions without taking the same framerate hit they would without DLSS 4 turned on. Gamers who are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350558/nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation-cyberpunk-2077-transformer-graphics-update-patch">already trying DLSS 4 out</a> in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>using RTX 40-series GPUs report seeing huge improvements already.</p><p>We’ll be keeping up with all the news about Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs right here at <em>The Verge</em>.</p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-caa3630a-bcdb-467c-b368-1a677ad29fb9"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-91bd7a43-471e-47c8-89f2-39e7d6f43bba"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-5cd0eaef-1c6f-4ba4-b197-57c89fe8f67d"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: a new king of 4K is here</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></figure></div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 4090 was a beast of a graphics card. It was a huge GPU that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">delivered true 4K gaming</a> for those who really wanted it and a huge jump in performance over the previous-generation RTX 3090. Naturally, the company’s latest top-of-the-line GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, now has a lot of expectations riding on it when it arrives on January 30th.</p><p>But at $1,999, the RTX 5090 is steep — $400 more than the RTX 4090 Founders Edition at its launch. (It could run you even more in the form of a new power supply or higher electricity bills, especially if you want to run games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in 4K.) </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e35ff62d-24fc-46ff-b09f-4328dfb9ee93"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b2e686c1-44f6-4156-a308-5b38f054bd07"><div><p>The RTX 5090 might be in short supply.</p><p>Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 5090 launch on January 30th might be met with limited stock, according to some system builders and retailers.

Performance figures, benchmarks, and impressions beyond the hardware are coming later.</p><p>The first thing that’s notable about the RTX 5090 is the packaging design has totally changed since the Founders Edition RTX 40-series. Nvidia has switched to housing the RTX 5090 inside a smaller bone-shaped gray cardboard shell that sits inside a much larger brown cardboard box.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-809426f9-6ed6-4859-a840-6eafd15ecc03"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-5ab3ae1e-44d8-4375-bf8a-80be65493fd9"><div><p>We finally played with an RTX 5090.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean</a> has been scouring CES for an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">RTX 5090</a> demo with an actually playable game.

It’s a claim that’s been echoed on YouTube, TikTok, and social media networks and has generated a debate over the RTX 50 series and DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation. </p><p>So, can a $549 RTX 5070 really deliver the same level of performance as a $1,599 RTX 4090? The answer is yes and no, and it all comes down to a “fake frames” argument about DLSS Frame Generation that might not even be a big problem for a lot of PC gamers.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-854f6bad-66b8-48c6-a138-a8432971a01c"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-862bd3ec-0b20-4562-9f56-1e6b976fbbc8"><div><p>Nvidia’s China-only RTX 5090D slashes AI performance.</p><p>The China-only chip comes with 2,375 AI TOPS, compared to the 3,352&nbsp;on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">RTX 5090 that will launch elsewhere</a>, as pointed out by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921131/us-china-restrictions-ai-chip-sales-nvidia">US export rules</a> prevent chipmakers like Nvidia from selling high-powered chips to China.</p><p>Despite these requirements, it seems some of the company’s advanced chips have made their way into China through smuggling,<em> </em>according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/u-s-prompts-nvidia-supermicro-probe-into-how-chips-ended-up-in-china">to<em> The Information</em></a><em>.</em></p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-cf4049a3-cf26-4a8b-ae22-c996ba55f17d"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">Nvidia announces DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation</a></h2><p>Nvidia is revealing a big upgrade to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology today. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fdlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations%2F">DLSS 4</a> will include new neural rendering capabilities that, on systems with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">the new RTX 50 Series GPUs</a>, can do Multi Frame Generation, generating “up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering.”</p><p>According to Nvidia, that’s a big enough upgrade to make 4K 240fps, fully ray-traced gaming possible.

            <p>Avowed will not only let you customise your character's appearance but also the background "that will shape how the world perceives and responds to you", too.</p>
<p>In a series of posts on X/Twitter, Obsidian let fans in for an early peek at the fantasy RPG's Character Creation menu, where players can choose between an Arcade Scholar, Court Augur, Vanguard Scout, War Hero, and Noble Scion, all of which determine what dialogue options and starting weapons you'll have available to you when you kick off your adventure.</p>

<p>"You hail from the Aedyran Empir, but who exactly are you, Envoy?" Obsidian teased on social media (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1882518769563512842">TheGamer</a>). "Stranger still, you have never learned which god touched your soul.</p>
<p>"In the Character Creation menu, you'll have the opportunity to customize your Godlike character and choose a background that will shape how the world perceives and responds to you."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>For Noble Scion, we got to see exactly what's special about this background, too.</p>
<p>"You were born to a noble house of great influence, middling wealth, and questionable morals," the description said. "When scandals and succession disputes saw your family cast down, you threw yourself on the emperor's mercy, and he shielded you.</p>
<p>"Canny yet refined, you have become a formidable force at court and an invaluable ally to the emperor."</p>
<p>Don't worry about the character creation locking out any equipment and abilities you find in-game, though - Obsidian reassures us that "all equipment and abilities are available to you regardless of your background.</p>
<p>Avowed will released next month, 18th February, on PC (Steam and Battle.net) and Xbox Series X/S, with day-one access for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Those who pay £90 (or $90) for the game's Premium Edition, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-selling-five-days-early-access-if-you-pay-90">can play five days early</a>.</p><p>"'Your worlds, your way' isn't just a motto for Obsidian - it's how they design quests, regions, combat, and more," Xbox teased after this week's Developer Direct. "Learn how player freedom is at the heart of Avowed, making it a quintessential 'Obsidian RPG'."</p> <div>

            <p>Four studios are battling it out to once again reboot Capcom's Resident Evil movie franchise, only this time, PlayStation Productions is also on board.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Warners Bros. and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> are amongst a number of hopefuls looking to reboot Constantin Film's horror series alongside PlayStation's production company.</p>
<p>Writer and director of 2022's brilliant Barbarian, Zach Cregger, is attached to write and direct and is reportedly keen to keep his Resident Evil adaptation faithful to the games that spawned the multimillion-dollar - and multimedia - franchise.</p>

<p>Whilst little else is known about the project at this time, it's thought Shay Hatten (John Wick: Chapter 4, Army of the Dead) is on board to co-write the seventh major instalment of the horror movie series. The prior six movies all starred Milla Jovovich apart from the last attempted reboot which released in 2021.</p><p>There was also an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-resident-evil-show-has-already-been-cancelled">ill-fated Netflix show that was unceremoniously cancelled</a> within a month of its debut episode following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-resident-evil-series-is-going-down-badly-with-fans">disappointing reviews</a>, with one commenter stating: "Terrible; followed by more terrible; just when you lose all hope; it smacks you with even more terrible".</p>
<p>PlayStation Productions was established by Sony in 2019 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-opens-playstation-productions-to-develop-multiple-game-franchises-into-tv-and-movies">to convert its video game franchises into blockbuster films and television shows</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
