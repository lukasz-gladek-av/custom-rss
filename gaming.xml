            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/killing-floor-3-targets-march-2025-launch-closed-betas-incoming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> is set to release in March 2025 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC with full cross-play. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Game Awards Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NE0qVN3ua4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Killing Floor 3 will also have closed beta tests, with<a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup">&nbsp;sign-ups here</a> on the Killing Floor site.</p>
<p>The trailer takes us to Texas, where a zed outbreak has consumed a Horzine facility, and your of Nightfall characters will need to head in and clear things up.</p>
<p>It gives a first look at the Ninja, Medic and Sharpshooter character classes, as well as a glimpse of the Chimera boss.</p>

<p>These days, character classes also need to have, well, a character attached to them, and so we meet Luna as the Sharpshooter, whose rifles have high damage and penetration, with skills that can pivot her character from precision to run and gun marksman. Her gadget is the Death’s Hand, an explosive homing arrow.<i></i></p>
<p>Obi is the medic, who was fired from Horzine for being too ethical and not profitable enough. He keeps teammates alive with healing darts and grenades, pivoting character build from self preservation to healing allies. His gadget is Sanctum, a field projector that heals allies, while damaging and slowing enemies.&nbsp;<i></i></p>
<p>Finally there’s Nakata the ninja assassin, joining Nightfall to atone for his former sins. With swords and bows, he’s a melee specialist that can block and parry larger enemies, but can pivot from front line melee combat to more nimble hit and run tactics. His gadget is the Hebi-ken grappling hook, which can amp up attacks if you grapple to enemies.</p>
<p>There are six specialists with the game at launch, with the first three having been <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/news/nightfall-news-specialist-deep-dive/">revealed back in October</a>. These included Foster the Commando, Devlin the Firebug and Imran the Engineer.</p>
<p>In general, though, fans of horde more games and previous Killing Floor titles will know what to expect from Killing Floor 3. This is a wave-based zombie horde shooter that will keep you on your toes as enemies hound you, forcing you to get around the map, set traps, use the environment, and survive as long as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-system-requirements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after its announcement, Square Enix revealed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> PC system requirements, detailing what players will need to run the game at different resolutions, quality settings, and target framerate.</p>
<p>The minimum system requirements targeting 1080p resolution, Low quality preset, and 30 FPS are not particularly demanding, although the game won't run on really old GPUs such as NVIDIA GTX series cards and anything older than the Radeon RX 6600. Interestingly enough, for 1080p resolution, Medium quality preset, 60 FPS and 4K resolution, High quality preset and 60 FPS, Windows 11 is recommended as the OS alongside beefier CPUs and GPUs. To enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at the highest resolution, highest quality setting, and 60 FPS, players will need either an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or Intel i7-10700 CPU and either a Radeon RX 7900 XTX or NVIDIA RTX 4080.</p>
<p>You can find the full Final Fantasy VII Rebirth system requirements below.</p>

		<p>Obsidian Entertainment shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, with the not too surprising news that their RPG sequel is also coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, in 2025. Oh, and day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, of course.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: First Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the notion of Xbox exclusivity for this game has been vented out the airlock, though that’s fairly sensible in this case. Microsoft acquired the studio back in 2018, but chose not to buy out the publishing deal with Private Division, which allowed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a> to release cross-platform across PS4, Xbox One and PC. The Outer Worlds 2 is Xbox published, but…. well, Xbox is effectively giving up on platform exclusivity. It’s not clear if this will be a simultaneous release, but there’s nothing to suggest timed exclusivity in this instance.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>There’s various factions vying for power which you’ll have to navigate, balancing what amounts to the church, state and capitalism, and just as in the original, you’ll have a huge amount of sway over events. Well, depending on your chosen skills and how you do with skill checks and conversations, anyway.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to enlist a crew of companions to help you in your adventure, which will lean in on all of the party tropes of RPGs, with you making decisions and some of them dislike and then remembering that you did that.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will feature within the Secret Level anthology series on Amazon Prime Video this month, with an episode dedicated to this universe to debut on 17th December, featuring a short story that takes place between the events of&nbsp;The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only Obsidian game out next year, with the tongue being removed from cheek for their more serious fantasy RPG adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed, coming out in February</a>. The Outer Worlds 2 will be a nice tonal companion to that!</p>

			<p>Fumito Ueda, the man behind excellent games like Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian, is working on a new project with his team genDESIGN.</p>
<p>This project, which has yet to be named, was revealed yesterday with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNBSWSyk9Hg">trailer</a> shown during The Game Awards Show. Published by Epic Games, the yet-to-be-named project looks absolutely like what Fumito Ueda has done in the past, so we should probably expect creative gameplay and a really emotional story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Announcement Trailer For a New Upcoming Game From genDESIGN" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNBSWSyk9Hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fumito Ueda and genDESIGN's last game was the aforementioned The Last Guardian, which was released on PlayStation 4 in 2016 after being in development for over eight years. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-guardian-review/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last Guardian offers something I don’t think I’ve ever experienced in games before – a relationship that feels very, very tangible. Trico implies so many things with his animations, his glances, his whines, the way he stomps his feet – he drips with more personality and charisma than any other game character in recent memory, and all of this can be put down to the fact that he’s not just an NPC, not simply an AI model you must direct about a stage, he feels like a friend. A special friend who cries when you are hurt, nuzzles you when you can stand, and demands his belly rubbed if you want him to do some jumps.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-7-how-an-unlikely-hero-called-wilmot-spawned-a-sustainable-franchise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Hollow Ponds / Logo via Game Developer</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How do you build a franchise in a way that's sustainable ? It's a question the industry is grappling with from top to bottom, with the largest studios attempting to craft billion-dollar series capable of crossing the transmedia divide and smaller devs perhaps hoping to turn their indie darlings into household names.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">UK developer Hollow Ponds, the outfit behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hohokum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, might have found an answer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio, along with a team of frequent collaborators, has crafted a burgeoning franchise around an unlikely figure. Enter Wilmot, the beaming warehouse manager and star of organizational puzzler </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Five years after the title debuted, Wilmot has swapped the stock-taking for jigsaw-making in laid back sequel </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. At around the same time, Hollow Ponds also unveiled the Wilmot's Warehouse board game–a cooperative rollick developed with help from&nbsp;design studio and publisher CMYK and board game-focused outlet Shut Up &amp; Sit Down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how they transformed Wilmot from blue collar worker into an unassuming leading man, Hollow Ponds founder and creative director Ricky Haggett explains the studio initially benefited from a series of rather happy accidents–but a propensity for pragmatism also paid off. "We weren't like 'we're going to go big on Wilmot,'" explains Haggett, noting the board game and the video game sequel were "two completely different things."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although they eventually launched at a similar time, the board game actually coalesced during the pandemic. Before lockdown, Haggett would host regular board game hangouts with a few friends, including game designer, researcher, and lecturer David King. King has made a bunch of board games and would often bring concepts to those soirees–including a very roughshod morsel inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">King unveiled that particular concept during the very last meeting the group held before COVID-19 (and lockdowns) took hold. Yet, despite being in the primordial stages of development, Haggett was able to refine the idea, which riffs on the concept of the video game without replicating it directly, throughout the pandemic by continuing to host virtual game nights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We started figuring out what be a good size of grid. We started figuring out what a good cadence adding objects [would be]," he says. "For a while, we had things being added and taken away constantly. We had lots and lots of cards, which did lots of weird spatial things to the warehouse. We made lots of changes, and we just gradually whittled it down in a very unpressured way."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time and freedom. Two things most game developers crave, but can very rarely count on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says that by constantly tweaking the project during the pandemic, he was able to reach a point where it was 80 percent done by the time he approached CMYK. Shut Up &amp; Sit Down production and marketing manager Matt Lees also provided valuable feedback that "fixed the last weird problem" plaguing the project–which largely revolved around how to end the game by way of a frantic card-matching (or order fulfilment) phase. "The whole experience of designing that game was ego free," says Haggett. "People from all directions were suggesting things and having an open chat. [...] None of it generally felt stressful. It's actually a lovely antitheses to trying to fix all the bugs in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHa17b9fJAE?si=hSn7uEE_pFeS9TGk" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, where is the overlap between Wilmot's exploits in the digital and physical realms? Well, it's difficult to untangle. Haggett says Hollow Ponds has noticed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sales spikes that could be linked to the launch of the board game–although with the sequel also hitting shelves at a similar time, it's hard to separate the two. It has, however, visibly expanded the Wilmot footprint–a soaring achievement given the character's lack of feet. "We've definitely see people talk about the video game on board game-centric places saying 'hey, this is a video game as well,' and we've definitely seen people who just like the video game buying the board game, even though they're not necessarily board game people."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's cross-pollination, then, but what about the financial aspect? Haggett says Hollow Ponds hasn't quite made its money back on first quarter sales of the board game, but that it isn't far off. He notes that second quarter sales will include the holidays and retailers who've just ordered units, and feels the board game will be akin to a snowball gathering momentum. As we've already mentioned, it also landed at a fortuitous time, placing more eyes on Wilmot as Hollow Ponds prepared to debut a sequel in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett tells us that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is still pulling in thousands of pounds each quarter, but massively surpassed expectations when it launched in 2019 thanks in part to an Xbox Game Pass deal the studio secured. The company then received cash from Sony to deliver a PlayStation port. Haggett acknowledges those deals, however, are by no means guaranteed and advises caution when working on titles of that scale. "I think if you were making a Wilmot-sized game I would be scared of spending more than around £200,000," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains the budget for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was bigger but still in the "low hundreds of thousands of pounds." Hollow Ponds also secured financing from the UK Games Fund (£25,000) that allowed them to hire a programmer to create a prototype, which according to Haggett was "pretty much what the game ended up being." It helped that Haggett was able to kickstart the project by taking the source code from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and stripping out all of the warehouse jiggery-pokery to create a "little jigsaw prototype." Meanwhile, Wilmot co-creator Richard Hogg set about creating the artwork that would become the myriad of jigsaws featured in-game, taking on a huge amount of work in the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett estimates production took around 12 months in total, although that time was spread across years due to the need to support other projects. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot Works It Out</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched on Steam on October 23, 2024, for £12.79 (a similar price point to the first game) and sold twice as well as its predecessor during its first month on shelves. It marks the second title the studio has released in 2024 after multiplayer adventure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was a much larger and more complex undertaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hasn't sold "incredibly well" but again highlights that Hollow Ponds was able to sign an Xbox Game Pass deal, presumably mitigating some financial risk. He remains "very happy" with the game itself, and notes the reception and feedback from players has been "great." Still, cashflow is important–and therein lies the balancing act.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Making big things is useful," says Haggett, explaining how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enabled the company to secure larger amounts of funding and work with influential publishers such as Annapurna Interactive. "But you can't guarantee you're going to be able to find publishers to fund your video games, and if you can't do that then it's helpful if you have smaller projects to fill in the cash flow at times," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, we're not a studio that has all of our employees working on a game. We don't really have many employees at all–we're a husband and wife team with one producer as a full-time employee. So when we finished </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we didn't have 20 people to support between projects. If we did we'd be screwed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Nonetheless, there are gaps between [projects]. Even in the best case scenario there are naturally gaps. And its nice to be able to fill those with the smaller projects that bring in money that bumps the cashflow. Every little thing you have out there in the world is a little revenue stream, and it's a lot easier to get lots of little trickles of revenue from smaller, low-risk projects than massive mega projects."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an era when phrases like 'survive to 2025' have (perhaps rather naively) been tossed around, perhaps there's something to be said for tempering blockbuster ambitions and championing reliable stalwarts like Wilmot.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The Headlines that matter">Status Report: The Headlines that matter</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/itch-io-taken-down-by-collectible-maker-funko-and-ai-tool-brand-shield">Report: Itch.io taken down by collectible maker Funko and AI tool Brand Shield</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // Indie game marketplace itch.io was briefly taken down last weekend and co-founder Leaf Corcoran said the culprit was none other than collectible maker Funko. He claimed Funko is leveraging AI-powered brand protection technology called Brand Shield that sent a "bogus phishing report" to itch's registrar, which proceeded to disable the domain. The storefront was eventually restored, but the ordeal looks to have kickstarted a feud between Corcoran and the Funko Pop! maker. This might become the most bizarre beef in the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/future-publishing-signs-content-partnership-with-openai">Future Publishing signs content partnership with OpenAI</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> // UK media company Future Publishing has signed a deal with OpenAI that will enable the ChatGPT maker to access content from its 200-plus brands.

Don't worry, though, because the French publisher also confirmed the games-as-as-service model will remain "central" to its business strategy moving forward.

		<p>It was a very late night if you were watching The Game Awards in the UK, but it wasn’t too hard to stay awake this year as the exciting announcements kept coming all the way to 4AM. What am I most excited about? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/">Virtua Fighter</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-ciri-as-the-protagonist/">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/split-fiction-is-the-new-co-op-game-from-josef-fares-and-he-only-used-a-few-rude-words-to-announce-it/">Split Fiction</a>, with at least one of them appearing next year. That’s all in the future though, and we’re here to talk about what we’ve been playing this week.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more time with Infinity Nikki, which is really just a very good open world platformer, whether you’re also keen on being a super helpful fashionista or not. I’ve also been playing through Indiana Jones and The Great Circle which captures the character unbelievably well. Besides that, it’s been some nostalgic Need for Speed Rivals, a spot of Snow Bros. Wonderland for review and Season 14 of Overwatch 2, where things have so far been looking up for Moira. I did dabble with Marvel Rivals too, but it didn’t hold my attention for too long, despite being a massive Marvel and Overwatch fan.</p>

<p>Before he stayed up right to the very end of The Game Awards, Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2 and a super scary new VR game that he can’t say anything about. He also played Marvel Rivals for precisely 7 minutes but said, “After that I couldn’t stand the ultra perky teenage girl who walks you through the mandatory tutorials.” Meanwhile, Gamoc has been playing The Thaumaturge for review, while squeezing in exactly one hour of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>Jim spent most of his time playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-review/">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</a> which he says, “I was initially excited for though ran into crashes that ultimately killed my hunger for that Nosgoth nostalgia hit. Hopefully the games are patched with a quick save feature or better checkpointing.” besides that he also jumped in two footed to the Warhammer 40,000 universe, playing more Darktide and Space Marine 2.</p>


<p>Aran has been playing Edge of Allegoria for review. He says, “It looks like a classic RPG from the Game Boy era, and plays like one. I wouldn’t have your kids play it though as it is very raunchy and full of adult themes. My full review should hopefully be up next week. I have also played some Marvel Rivals, and have found it pretty fun. I’ll see if I stick with it long-term though.”</p>
<p>Nic B has been playing the hell out of Pokémon TCG Pocket, telling us, “It’s good fun, but frustrating at times.”</p>
<p>Ade and his partner Laura have been playing the old-school styled RPG Sea of Stars on local co-op. He says, “It’s absolutely brilliant, you can play through the entire game together, solving puzzles and teaming up to take down enemies. It’s up there with It Takes Two for a local co-op experience, highly recommended! Other than that, a spot of Helldivers 2. I’ve been experimenting with Extreme mode, it’s ridiculous!</p>
<p>“Oh, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review/">Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</a> for review, sadly, despite the early promise, it’s not very good!”</p>

<p>Steve told us, “I’ve been living out my dreams of academia by travelling around the world and punching various flavours of fascist on the nose in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The rest of my time has been taken by the rather less glamorous reality of marking undergraduate essays… I also found time to finish Mario and Luigi Brothership which is a solid 7 but nowhere near the levels of earlier games in the series. Finally, I’ve started Nine Sols and enjoying it aside from getting lost; determined to persevere with the default difficulty but there are a fabulous range of accessibility options.”</p>
<p>And finally, Tef also stayed up all the way through The Game Awards, but before that, he’s made a start on Space Marine 2 and like how stompy the Space Marines are when walking.</p>
<p>And what about you? Did you stay up for The Game Awards? Or have you been playing that little Indy game as well?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the leaked ad that <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-early-ad-shows-gorgeous-visuals-summer-2025-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the launch window of Mafia: The Old Country ahead of The Game Awards 2024, during the actual show we actually got to see the full trailer and learn more about the game. By far the most important tidbit is that, unlike all of its predecessors, Mafia: The Old Country won't be an open-world game. Hangar 13 describes it as a linear, narrative-driven title.</p>
<p>Nick Baynes, President of Hangar 13, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country is a love letter to old-style, gritty Mafia stories where players can uncover the origins of organized crime. Everyone at Hangar 13 is committed to creating the most authentic and intense story of the franchise, and we can’t wait for players to experience the journey with Enzo.</em></p>
<p>The press release from publisher 2K explains that it will be a 'focused package' with a 'graphically stunning cinematic experience'. Its story, set in the fictional Sicilian town of San Celeste, is rooted in the brutal world of organized crime that aims to immerse players in dangerous combat systems with high-stakes, grounded stealth and gunplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Enzo is the game's main character. He survived a childhood of forced labor in Sicily's hellish sulphur mines. Eventually, through a twist of fate, he gets the opportunity to join Don Torrisi's crime family and will do whatever it takes to make a better life for himself. By swearing an oath, Enzo has committed himself to the Torrisi family code of honor, with all the power and hardship that entails. He must never forget this simple truth: family requires sacrifice. To reach his next destination or make a hasty getaway, Enzo will need to gallop across cobbled streets and open fields on horseback or speed along dirt roads in authentic turn-of-the-century cars.</p>

<p>We also learned that Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, marking yet another triple-A studio that switches away from its proprietary engine. The game will be available in Summer 2025 on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9p834n9s4ll0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>.</p>

			<p>Finally, during last night's busy The Game Awards 2024 show, Pearl Abyss announced the release window for Crimson Desert. We first&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard </a>about the game at G-Star 2019, when it was presented as a spiritual sequel to the studio's Black Desert featuring similar MMO elements.</p>
<p>The following year, the South Korean developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a switch from MMO to open world action/adventure while also sharing a preliminary Winter 2021 target window. Needless to say, that did not pan out, and Pearl Abyss actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> Crimson Desert indefinitely. It wasn't until Gamescom 2023 that the game re-<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerged</a> with a new trailer. In late 2023, Korean media <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a new Q2 2025 launch window.</p>
<p>That prediction wasn't far off, as Crimson Desert is now officially set to launch in Fall 2025 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/CRIMSON_DESERT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> (including Mac, according to the press release), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/crimson-desert/9ng592g0w474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is now available on all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn1igh_q0Wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pearl Abyss also shared a bit more about the game's features. Players take the role of Kliff, leader of the Greymanes, a band of battle-hardened mercenaries who fight to save the land of Pywel from impending disaster. As they explore the vast landscapes, players will engage in intense battles, defeat formidable monsters, collect valuable loot, and follow the story of the Greymanes' journey.</p>
<p>The developers are promising a strategically rich combat experience, whether you're fighting an intense one-on-one duel or battling through massive hordes of foes. Crimson Desert will feature 'monumental boss fights' that, once complete, unlock unique weapons and armor or even new abilities. Kliff can also soar through the skies by commanding, riding, and controlling wyverns for thrilling aerial combat.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert is powered by the next-generation BlackSpace Engine, featuring dynamic weather, time, and environmental changes. From a gameplay standpoint, players will be able to enjoy rock climbing, gliding, fishing, cooking, and so much more. They will encounter mechanized villages, intricate puzzles, and interactive aerial Abysses that promise 'endless discovery'.</p>
<p>The Steam page also listed the minimum and recommended system requirements, which we've added below.</p>

The player takes on the role of Arrisa, a powerful entity called Blader, equipped with incredible regeneration ability. In her quest, she will explore the ruins of ancient cities teeming with enemies, aiming to unveil the truth behind the apocalypse and sow the seeds of hope for a new world.</p><p>Facing a myriad of mighty foes and vicious monsters, Arrisa went through countless deaths and rebirths. She is good at finding opportunities in the onslaught and gives it her all to turn the tide. After a near-impossible battle, she will continue her journey on the wasteland as if it were just another day.</p><p>Arrisa wields a wide variety of weapons, allowing her to execute flashy combos by utilizing each weapon’s unique moves and sets, aiming to seize the initiative in battle.</p><p>Moreover, the weapon skills system gives Arrisa more attack choices. Her left-hand mechanism can use dozens of spells to enrich her fighting style.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In addition to its intense fighting and <a title="Genres > Action [2,365 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> elements, the world of <em>AI LIMIT</em> offers a rich environment to explore. Bizarre and magnificent city ruins hide various weapons and clothes, guarded either by powerful monsters or tucked away in deep alleys.

Using Blader’s ability, Arrisa can extract information from old-world artifacts scattered throughout the city. Players can uncover a lot of knowledge while exploring.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Preview</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="AI Limit - Official Gameplay Preview | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ChLfDR-V4tg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The War has changed.</p><p>These are dark times for freedom loving citizens everywhere. Our galaxy grows cold from the embrace of old enemies returning and darkens with the threat of new <a title="Genres > Horror [539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s emerging.</p><p>We must now stand together in Super Earth’s light and oppose these sinister tidings. These Omens of Tyranny.</p><p><strong>The Illuminate Return</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Missing for almost a century, the Illuminate will challenge our recruits more than the other factions they have faced. They are advanced, highly-intelligent beings wielding powerful technology that appears to average citizens like a kind of dark magic.</p><p>At the end of the First Galactic War, the Helldivers worked together to eradicate the Illuminate. We believed we were successful, and for nearly 100 years, we have lived in relative peace, holding the Terminid and Automaton threats at bay. Thanks to our continued recruitment and training of new Helldivers, we have held these two fronts with complete, unmitigated success.</p><p>But now the Illuminate have emerged seemingly out of nowhere. Even though we don’t know the true origin of the invasion, we have no choice now but to suppress three factions in the Galactic War.</p><p>The Illuminate are spreading through mind control, abducting citizens of weaker dedication to democratic ideals and brainwashing them for a dark purpose which is still yet unknown to us. These mind-controlled citizens have been twisted and corrupted into a menace we call The Voteless—Super Earth’s own people turned against the principles of Democracy and fair elections, losing their ability to vote entirely.</p><p>The intentions behind the Illuminate invasion are still unclear. Right now, they remain as smaller bands of insurgents, staging attacks, building mysterious structures, and abducting citizens before disappearing again.</p><p>It’s up to us to stop them from getting their totalitarian tentacles any deeper into Super Earth’s domain.</p><p><strong>The Fight at Our Doorstep</strong></p><p>Omens of Tyranny is bringing the fight into the streets, with new mission areas inside Super Earth’s many colonies.</p><p>View and download image<br>Our colonies are being ravaged by these invaders, turning our once bright and sunny streets filled with smiling citizens into dark ruins, overrun by Voteless and Illuminate. Arm yourselves with your trusted tools of destruction and rid our colonies of this scum.</p><p>But it won’t be easy. Gone are the wide-open spaces that Helldivers are accustomed to fighting in. Cities mean closer quarters, dark alleys, and forked paths where one wrong turn means meeting a horde of Voteless to liberate. You’ll need your best and brightest squad to navigate them carefully.</p><p><strong>Go Easy on the Gun, Chief</strong></p><p>With all these new developments, there won’t be time to take driver’s ed. courses, Helldiver. A Fast Recon Vehicle “FRV” will now appear in the colonies, ready to plow through the Illuminate at high speed.</p><p>Keep following the Major Orders issued by Super Earth High Command and you will get the keys to your very own FRV–a brand new, top-of-the-line manual transmission reconnaissance and combat vehicle. The whole squad can ride together, and your passengers can even lean out of the windows to lay down some suppressive fire as you shift gears and speed to your next destination. Just one question left: Who’s driving?</p><p>There’s more to discover yet, and we can’t wait to get you back into the fight.</p><p>The newest major update for <em>Helldivers II,</em> “Omens of Tyranny,” featuring the return of the Illuminate faction, is now live! High Command has ordered all Helldivers to report to their Super Destroyers—it’s time to give these squids hell.</p><p><strong>Introducing DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition</strong></p><p>Eliminate bugs, bots and squids with the Super Earth Ministry of Defense’s sleek new DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition, sporting the iconic yellow and black armor paint scheme.</p><p>The DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Helldivers II</em> Limited Edition will be available in limited quantities for $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99. Pre-orders start on December 20, 2024 at participating retailers, with launch on February 6, 2025.

This initial alien force brings with it a number of new enemies to fight against as well as brand new Super Earth colonies to fight on. These colonies introduce Helldivers 2’s first urban environments, with city streets packed with innocent civilians who are mind-controlled by the Illuminate. The Voteless, as they’re called by Super Earth, are little more than zombies who want nothing more than to team players limb from limb.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, game director Mikael Eriksson said this initial invasion involves the Illuminate Vanguard Fleet and does not appear to be the full faction. Initially, the Illuminate won’t capture planets, rather they are using guerrilla tactics. Eriksson wouldn’t say what they’re up to, but did tease that players will get the chance to influence the ongoing Illuminate invasion as part of a new story set to take place over the course of several months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eriksson also discussed the main differences between fighting the Illuminate and the bots and bugs. One is that the Illuminate are “more difficult,” and fighting against them in urban environments feels constrained compared to fighting the Automatons and the Terminids in open, more naturalistic environments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate themselves are like demi-gods, with huge walking trip-pod enemies called Harvesters that can one-shot you. On top of that, there’s horde-style gameplay with the mind-controlled civilians to contend with. However, players have a number of new toys to help defend against the Illuminate threat, chief among them Helldivers 2’s first vehicle, the Fast Recon Vehicle (FRV).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The FRV, which initially can only be found at various spots on the map, houses a full squad of players: one driving (manual by default but automatic via accessibility settings), two in passenger seats with lean out and shoot functionality, and one manning the rear turret. The FRV will only be fully unlocked as a stratagem you can call in if and when the Helldivers 2 community completes a new major order, thus making it available to buy in the traditional fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eriksson recommended players bring anti-tank stratagems to help take down the Illuminate spawn ships, encounter ships, and the Harvester enemies, all of which have shields (the new Anti-Tank Emplacement defensive stratagem will prove useful). You’ll need support weapons good against the horde; Eriksson suggested an assault rifle. And it’s a good idea to use the FRV to zip around the maps, particularly on city roads.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers II: Omens of Tyranny Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate join the bugs and bots as Helldivers 2’s third enemy faction, and are set to breathe new life into the explosive third-person co-op action game. Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks following its February launch. Arrowhead has endured a number of controversies in the 10 months since, including a review bomb campaign over publisher Sony’s decision to force Steam gamers to log in to a PSN account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s continued to update the game, adding new content and issuing balance changes that have seen recent Steam user reviews hit ‘overwhelmingly positive.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's round-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2024</a> for more on what's coming to the world of gaming in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's Naughty Dog's first new franchise in over a decade, and is currently in development for the PlayStation 5. No release window was mentioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Druckmann revealed that Naughty Dog has been working on Intergalactic since 2020, and confirmed the main character is played by Tati Gabrielle (Jo Braddock in the 2022 Uncharted movie).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," Druckmann explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps – at least for now. What we can tell you is that this game lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey. Our narrative goals are rivaled only by our gameplay ambitions. This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jordan is played by the talented Tati Gabrielle, who leads a stellar cast (pun intended!). Eagle-eyed players might spot some of the other cast members in the trailer. We’ll reveal more of our ensemble down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our incredible voyage into the cosmos also needs an equally incredible soundtrack. As tremendous fans of their work, I’m excited to announce our collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who’ll be scoring Intergalactic! The guys are cooking, and the trailer is just a small tease of their work for the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We know you’re eager for more – and trust us, we’re very eager to share more with you. For now, though, it’s time to put our heads back down and keep cranking away on Jordan’s adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's round-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2024</a> for more on what's coming to the world of gaming in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While it occupies a place within the existing Mafia universe, Mafia: The Old Country tells a brand new story with a new cast of characters about the origin of the mafia itself. You play a new, original protagonist called Enzo, who survived a childhood of indentured labor in Sicily’s sulfur mines to join Don Torrisi's crime family.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Structurally, Mafia: The Old Country is a “focused package”, a “cinematic experience” set in an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily. Expect “grounded” stealth and gunplay mechanics. Structurally, Mafia: The Old Country is more aligned to Mafia 1 and Mafia 2 than Mafia 3, which was more open-world oriented).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a summer 2025 release window, Mafia: The Old Country is potentially running up close against the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6, a prospect IGN asked about in a new interview with Hangar 13.

            <p>For the 10th year running, The Game Awards 2024 was packed with tons of game reveals this evening, and we've got the complete run-down of everything announced right here. Below, you'll find all the new Game Award trailers shown tonight, as well as a quick rundown of what was actually announced. </p>
<p>A quick note: we're keeping this list focused on proper new announcements and game reveals this year, so you won't find any three-second advert-style trailers saying 'Hey, remember this game exists? Go and buy it now!'. Rather, we're here for the real stuff - all the Game Awards trailers and reveals for the big new blockbusters coming out in 2025 and beyond. So sit back and enjoy every announcement from The Game Awards in order, as they were revealed during the show, because we've got everything from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s next game and loads more besides right here for your viewing pleasure.   </p>

<p>Well, that's certainly one way to kick off The Game Awards pre-show. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> is back with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. Made by The Game Kitchen, the studio behind the rock-hard Soulsy metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, and Dotemu, the publishers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, Ragebound looks set to follow in Blasphemous' 2D pixel art footsteps for an agile, slice and dice adventure that's almost certainly going to kick our collective asses when it arrives in summer 2025.</p>

<p>We've all done it at one point or another. It's carboot Tetris time with One Move Away, which is coming in 2025 to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Think Unpacking but with cars, and you're pretty much there with this one, as it looks like we'll be packing up the same car across several different years at key points in our character's life - and it looks absolutely delightful.</p>
<h2>Slay The Spire 2 gets a new gameplay trailer</h2>

<p>Slay the Spire 2 is already a known quantity, but this latest trailer gives us our best look yet at the sequel to everyone's favourite deckbuilding roguelike obsession. There are hints of four character types down, and lots of nifty looking battles. You'll also be pleased to hear that it's still coming to early access in 2025.</p>

<p>Only the briefest of teases for this one, but everyone's favourite diver Dave is seemingly heading to the jungle for his next adventure. At time of writing, it's unclear whether this is an expansion or a full-blown sequel (likely the former), but whatever it is, it's coming in late 2025.</p>

<p>Warren Spector's studio Otherside Entertainment has unveiled its first game: Thick as Thieves, a multiplayer Thief 'em up that blends heist-based stealth with frantic action as you work to beat other would-be hustlers to the punch as you steal high-value treasures from fancy mansions. It's coming out in 2026, to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>Riffing on the just-released Pac-Man episode of Amazon's Secret Level TV anthology series, this new take on Pac-Man looks to be an intriguing dark fantasy metroidvania, where old Pac (or Puck, as it's known in the TV show) guides a homegrown creature to the end of a maze-like world. In the episode, Puck manipulates the creature to try and escape, but it looks like you'll have greater control of Puck's monstrous jaw powers here. Still, I'm quietly intrigued by this one.</p>
<h2>Steel Paws is a new mobile game from Yu Suzuki</h2>

<p>Coming to Netflix Games in 2025, Steel Paws is Yu Suzuki's latest - quite a departure from the likes of Shenmue and his more recent Air Twister, but this anime-infused adventure looks to feature a Mega Man-like heroine and her robot buddy as they tackle a Tower of Babel-like structure. No more details as of yet, though.</p>

<p>From the creators of Core Keeper comes new pixel colony sandbox Kyora. It looks delightful in all 30 seconds we're shown of it, but its Steam page reveals it will have a proc-gen world and up to eight player online co-op. </p>

<p>Well, I don't know about you, but I wasn't necessarily expecting the next game from Sifu studio Sloclap to be a footie game. I can hear Taps squealing from here, lemme tell you. Rematch is an online multiplayer game that's primarily built for 5v5 matches, but other modes will be coming post-launch, as well as other seasonal bits and pieces as well. Rematch is set to launch on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC next year.</p>

<p>Solasta: Crown of the Magister is an enormous RPG, and now its sequel has been confirmed for an early access release in 2025, with a demo coming very soon, according to its new Game Awards trailer. Set decades after the events of the first game, this sequel will take players to the high fantasy world of Neokos, where they'll roll dice using the D20 system to guide their party through all sorts of fantastical adventures. And wouldn't you know it? They've even got Baldur's Gate 3's narrator Amelia Tyler on board, too.</p>

<p>If the tub didn't give it away, the white braid certainly did. The Witcher 4 looks absolutely gorgeous in this (albeit cinematic) reveal, and a grown-up Ciri sure is a dab hand with that sword and magic fire chain, isn't she? Yes please and thank you, CD Projekt Red. Tech heads will no doubt have clocked that the trailer was put together on an unannounced Nvidia RTX GPU as well. Time to upgrade your rig for this? Almost certainly. Luckily, there's no release date yet, so hopefully we'll have plenty of time to save up.</p>

<p>Despite FromSoftware saying Elden RIng 2 wasn't in development mere weeks ago, it sure looks like the studio is making more Elden Ring. This time, with multiplayer. But don't call it a sequel, whatever you do. Described as a standalone game by Geoff Keighley in his pre-amble, and then as a co-op action survival game after the trailer aired, this is Elden Ring: Nightreign, and it's coming in 2025.</p>

<p>So much for getting a PS5 Pro to play FF7 Rebirth with fancier graphics again… It's coming to PC on January 23rd 2025. That's, like… really soon! Weeks away, in fact! What a treat! The trailer touts improved lighting, enhanced textures and modelling, as well as DLSS and VRR and more, and I'm sure Digital Foundry will be delivering their expert verdict on all of that lovely stuff very soon.</p>

<p>Move over Stray, this photo-realistic fantasy cat adventure is here to steal your milk. The thing that really bemuses me about this is that it's coming to PC, Apple Watches and Nintendo Switch of all places, and I'm pretty sure only one of those platforms will be able to do its fluffy furballs justice on the graphics front. Still. No release date yet, but more info is promised next year.</p>

<p>Cor, it's been a hot minute, hasn't it Fumito Ueda? Here's our next early glimpse at the next game from Gen Design, the maker of Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian. It's just a teeny look, admittedly, showing a young boy climbing up a large robot and then taking off inside… its head(?) as we see the body being overtaken by a nasty looking shockwave of some kind. It's currently untitled, but the eagle-eyed among you will have spotted 'Project Robot' as a codename in the credits screen. Consider my curiosity piqued.</p>

<p>Can you sense Obsidian is maybe just a teeny bit aware of the shortcomings of the first Outer Worlds? In this new trailer, it boasts "more action, more weapons, and more graphics?" with a bemused eyebrow raise. But hey, it looks to be shaping up quite nicely i you ask me - and we got a release year too. It's coming in 2025 to Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass, PC and, curiously, PS5. No word yet if that PS5 release will be delayed like Indiana Jones, but watch this space.</p>

<p>From the studio behind It Takes Two comes another co-op action adventure. This time, you take control of two writers who get trapped in a simulation of their respective fantasy and sci-fi novels. Just like It Takes Two, each character will have their own special weapons and items that evolve over time and complement each other when it comes to solving puzzles - dragons with different abilities, for example, or special exo suits that let you Morph Ball around. It's coming in quite soon, too, in March 2025.</p>

<p>The latest game from World of Tanks studio Wargaming, Steel Hunters is an enormous mech fest with lots of robots and big explosions. Think Apex Legends but everyone's in a giant mech suit and that's pretty much Steel Hunters in a nutshell. You'll play as one of seven units in teams of two, and you'll be stomping and flying around lush green worlds - which will presumably be a muddy shade of brown by the time you're done with it. If you'd like to try this free-to-play shooter for yourself, a ten-day beta will begin on PC later this evening.</p>

We get to see all four of the main characters in action, as well as fountains of multi-coloured loot. Oh what fun. It's coming in 2025.</p>

<p>New from Saber and featuring a lot of dinos, Turok is back. I last played Turok on the N64 where the frame rate was so low, and the draw distance so near that I almost always got munched by said dinos within seconds of trying to play it. Luckily, Turok Origins doesn't look to be plagued by any of those issues whatsoever, with lots of silky smooth frame rates and powerful weaponry to take those clever dinos down. Yes please, mates.</p>

We only got a very small look at the kind of splitscreen antics we'll be getting up to, but I'm well and truly here for it.</p>

<p>Well, here's a thing. Netmarble is making a new Game of Thrones game featuring all your favourite actors from HBO's TV show, including yer man Jon Snow Kit Harrington. Well, everyone apart from <em>one</em> Game of Thrones character, as it looks like you'll be playing an infinitely more generic Northman who could be literally any gruff hulk fantasy man. Still, an intriguing proposition for Game of Thrones fans. It's coming in 2025.</p>

<p>Tensions are high in the new trailer for Mafia: The Old Country, which are only likely to get even hotter as it gears up for its just-announced release window of summer 2025. Cor, next summer is going to be pretty stacked at this rate, isn't it?</p>

Curiously, the trailer says it's from the studio behind The Wolf Among Us and Tales From The Borderlands, but before you go gooey-eyed about Telltale, the studio behind this one is Adhoc. No release date yet, but consider me quietly intrigued by this one.</p>

<p>Well, there you have it, Naughty Dog heads. The next game from director Neil Druckmann is something quite a bit different from what's come before, featuring a bounty hunter in space who also has a rad laser sword to take down huge beasties. It looks pretty cool! As cinematic trailers go, at least. But hey, you can't fault a trailer with The Pet Shop Boys. Let's take a look one more time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Venn diagram of people who like tanks and people who like giant mechs might not just be one circle, but it’s probably close enough that it will feel like you’re looking at one of those red and blue 3D pictures without the glasses on. So, having already covered the land, sea and air battles of World of Tanks, Warplanes and Warships, it makes perfect sense that Wargaming’s next game would go all mecha. Enter the Steel Hunters.</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set in a post-cataclysm world, in which Starfall has polluted the world (because we clearly weren’t doing a quick enough job of it) and forced mankind to evacuate and live in space stations, you’ll play as a Hunter sent back down to the planet to try and harvest Starfall for all the energy and resource it can provide the orbital populace.</p>


<p>It’s a pretty generic premise, and don’t expect to be too surprised by the genres that Wargaming is targeting here, either. This is a blend of hero shooter, battle royale and extraction shooter. But… mechs are pretty dang cool.</p>
<p>Six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, their gigantic mechs keeping them safe from the elements, and handily helping you absolutely massive as you stomp around the world and come across towns, bridges, cars and other manmade structures that have now been left abandoned.</p>


<p>At launch there’s seven hunters to choose from, with the very standard Razorside an all-rounder with frag grenades and a shield recharge ability. Much cooler are the two quadrupeds Ursus and Fenris, who have missiles and greater mobility as their advantages. Heartbreaker is then a sniper stealth assassin, Prophet a glass cannon who’s best staying away from the fight and summoning drones, while Trenchwalker is the combat medic with a grenade launcher.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better than two or four legs? How about eight! Weaver is an arachnid that’s all about territorial control, deploying one-way shields and being able to switch to a minigun mode that slows movement but allows you to put down a lot of firepower.</p>
<p>There’s a good, solid mixture of different archetypes here, and Wargaming will have plenty of ideas of new mechs to add down the line. What’s also important is how they work together. You’ll always drop and fight as a pair, so having Trenchwalker, Prophet or Weaver could be great for their various forms of second line support abilities alongside a faster-moving Fenris to quickly show force to enemy teams.</p>

<p>Still on the planet are drones that you will want to attack to gain loot from them, whether that’s a boost to shields, energy cells (which feed an in-match experience system), repair kits and more. Each mech has unlockable abilities as you gain experience and work up through five levels –&nbsp;level 3 unlocks the second ability. There’s some potential here for different builds to emerge that can add to the player synergies and tactical choices as well.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of your tactics will be determined by the game mode. Starfall Harvest has you heading to try and capture and hold towers that will give bonuses to radar, buffs and the like. Mid-game events will also spice things up with a Tag Hunt, where you need to collect the tags of fallen Hunters, and this can lead to unlocking the Colossus if you collect enough –&nbsp;this will transforms you into an even bigger mech for a short amount of time, which can be a powerful bonus.</p>

<p>It will all come to a head with a final extraction phase, as you need to reach the extraction point and hold the position until time runs out or you defeat all the remaining teams. A tiny bit disappointing, only one pair can extract and win, so there’s none of the social mind games of The Division’s Dark Zone, though it will still build up to a natural fever pitch at the end.</p>
<p>In contracts to their empire of historical wargames, Steel Hunters will be quite the change of pace. From tanks with tracks to big stompy mechs, and from pitched battles to a PvPvE game mode that latches onto all the buzzword multiplayer genres currently dominating gaming, will this start a bold new era for the company?</p>
<p>Well, the proof will be in the playing, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">a playtest is now on from 12th to 22nd December</a>, ahead of a wider launch next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Every edition of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> needs a headliner announcement, and this year, it was Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Don’t recognize that name? You shouldn’t, it’s a new IP, but you will recognize the developer – <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naughty Dog</a>.</p>
<p>The first teaser trailer for Intergalactic is light on details, but we are introduced to Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who’s tracking a quarry to the dangerous planet of Sempiria. Most of the trailer is focused on showing off Jordan and Naughty Dog’s always-cutting-edge facial animation tech, but we do get a hint of what gameplay might be like at the end of the video as we see our hero taking on a robotic enemy with a laser sword. So, it looks like the focus is on melee combat and the inhospitable planet hints at perhaps survival elements. But enough of my preamble, take a look at Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Consider me intrigued! We’ve known for a while that The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann’s next thing would be a new sci-fi IP, and this is obviously it. We don’t know yet if Druckmann is actually writing and/or directing Intergalactic but his name is attached to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a> that reveals a bit more info about the game…</p>
<p><em>“Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps – at least for now. What we can tell you is that this game lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey. Our narrative goals are rivaled only by our gameplay ambitions. This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.</em></p>
<p><em>Jordan is played by the talented Tati Gabrielle, who leads a stellar cast (pun intended!). Eagle-eyed players might spot some of the other cast members in the trailer. We’ll reveal more of our ensemble down the line. Our incredible voyage into the cosmos also needs an equally incredible soundtrack. As tremendous fans of their work, I’m excited to announce our collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who’ll be scoring Intergalactic! The guys are cooking, and the trailer is just a small tease of their work for the game.”</em></p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet has been announced for PS5. A release window has yet to be revealed.</p>

Capcom are working on a sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/okami">Okami</a>, the wonderful 2006 Zelda-like in which you play a sun goddess in a wolf's body, roaming a world of ink and parchment. It’s being co-developed by M-TWO Inc, Machine Head Works Inc and CLOVERS Inc, and directed by original Okami game director Hideki Kamiya. I am tickled pink, I tell you. Find a trailer below.

<p>
There’s not much to share at this stage - the game doesn't even have a formal title - but we do have a little blurb from Capcom. Here it be: “Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion.”</p>
<p>The trailer is a departure from the sumi-e-inspired visuals of the original game – it’s gaudier and, er, hairier. Perhaps a bit too busy for comfort, next to the crowded but crisp scrollwork of the first one. But there are plenty of familiar sights: the goddess Amaterasu herself, galloping through verdant fields, the spinning Reflector dish on her back, and the Celestial Brush dropping cheekily into view at the end.
</p><p>
I was not expecting a new Okami game in this, the year 2024. (I wasn’t expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-the-capcom-action-rpgs-first-new-instalment-in-almost-20-years">a new Onimusha</a>, either. Nice work, Capcom.) The first one is perhaps less amazing in hindsight – it’s messy in a way Zelda isn’t, with some stodgy action-RPG elements and some repetitive fights. But my goodness, it has vision and heart and imagination in spades. I still play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMLXfwUJrk">the intro movie</a> now and then to perk myself up. I never did get round to playing Ōkamiden, the Nintendo DS spin-off. Time to change that, perhaps.
</p>
<p>It's something of a homecoming for Kamiya, who left Capcom to co-found PlatinumGames back in 2006. Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-is-leaving-platinum-to-work-on-new-projects">he left Platinum to go independent</a>, commenting that he would "continue to create in my Hideki Kamiya way". He's been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/06/17/hideki-kamiya-hints-at-okami-2-and-bayonetta-3-5950079/">hinting about ideas for an Okami sequel</a> for years.</p>
