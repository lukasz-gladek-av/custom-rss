		<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 hardcore mode is now available, with this mode adding new features to the game along with upping the difficulty. In the first game, things like the compass were removed to make navigation more immersive but in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s hardcore mode Warhorse Studios has gone further.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ynJN-HejlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We only kept a couple of the first game’s perks, and then we made new ones to provide a completely new challenge. It’s not just about making the game harder either, it’s about making it more immersive too. “</em><em>In the first game’s Hardcore Mode, we did things like disabling your map position and removing the compass, but we’ve gone further this time. We’ve added the option to ask different NPCs about your location in the world, which is something more immersive. You can run into travellers on the road and ask for directions,”&nbsp;</em>said Karel Kolmann, the senior game designer at Warhorse Studios.</p>
<p>Additionally, players will have to select at least three permanent negative traits at the start of the game, with some of those including Bad Back, Somnambulant, and Hangry Henry. Bad Back reduces the amount of weight you can carry, Somnanbulant makes you sleep walk and wake up in random locations, and Hangry Henry makes you want more food than usual.</p>


<p>In our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, Gareth said, <em>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues to fulfil the uncompromising vision of the first game. It weaves together a world of lords, knights, peasants and bandits in medieval Europe, with poor Henry of Skalitz caught somewhere in the middle just trying to cope. It’s grand in scale whilst being full of fine details and it sometimes gets in its own way a little bit, but if this is your kind of game it’ll be one that you don’t want to end because there’s nothing else quite like it.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/tales-of-valiant-starter-set-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most roleplaying starter sets offer players, and those who run them, known as Game Masters or Dungeon Masters, an introduction to the system the starter set is for, with tips and tricks for playing and running games. Rarely do these sets start from the extreme basics for players or a group of players who are entirely new to the roleplaying experience, and this is where Steamforged Games and Kobold Press have stepped up and produced the <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Starter Set. In this article, we'll have a look at who this set is for, what it contains, and what it's like.</p>

<p>While this is our first foray into Kobold Press' <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> system, we've been covering Steamforged Games' roleplaying boxed sets for a while, from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/epic-encounters-preview" rel="nofollow">very first Epic Encounters boxed sets</a>, up to the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-local-legends-review-legendary-bar-stories" rel="nofollow">Local Legends</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of" rel="nofollow">Palace of the Drow Queen</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-2.jpg?itok=zlMcdGPt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-2.jpg?itok=QxF4is57 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>For Starters!</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Starter Set takes you from zero understanding of rolepalying games, up to and through your first few adventures, building up your confidence as a player, or Games Master (depending on which role you see yourself playing), along with introducing you to the <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> system and setting.</p>

<p>This introductory journey takes place across 4 books that delightfully draw you in and explain step by step how to play. Most beginner roleplayers usually start their journey by joining a group with an experienced GM, who guides them through their first few adventures, but it's easy to forget how daunting it can be for a new player joining an established group, or take for granted with the abundance of digitals tool there are for running games now that it's not always possible or appealing for new players. But this boxed set allows a group of entirely new players to take the journey together, with the GM working through the books first before the players join in (this is also good practice for the person taking on the GM role, as they will always have to do preparation before running the adventure).</p>

<p>The first book in the box, Welcome to Roleplaying Games, is a primer for roleplaying games in general, taking players through the basics of terms, giving an example of a roleplaying game, and some great tips on how to be a good player and GM. Players then move on to the second book, Introductory Adventures, which takes a solo gamer through their first adventure, allowing the GM to play through an adventure, familiarise themselves with the introductory rules, and the flow of a game, before moving on to the 2 adventures they'll run for players.</p>

<p>While working through the Introductory Adventures, GMs have access to the Rules Reference Book, which acts like a mini Players Guide (a book you can pick up later to expand your games) and builds upon the details in clear terms, those introduced in the adventures, so if something comes up that players want to do, you can easily find the rule that covers it and continue the flow of the game. Finally, the Advanced Adventures book contains 2 further adventures that add extra elements the GM will need to manage and more advanced rules for the players.</p>

<p>The books in the starter set are just part of the experience. The <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Starter Set also includes other components to make your first games much easier. The set includes 4 pre-generated character sheets (5 if you include the one used for the solo adventure), with all the stats required to play them, and level them up after each of the adventures. 3 of these characters are actually available for free on the <a href="https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/the-valiant-six-pregen-character-sheets-pdf/" rel="nofollow">Kobold Press site</a> (along with 3 others) and Cannit Cragwalker, the Beastkin, is brand new for this set.</p>

<p>These 4 characters offer a great introduction for first-time players and include a fighter, barbarian, wizard, and warlock, a nice balance of magic and combat prowess. For those who might have some experience with roleplaying, it's noticeably lacking a healer or a rogue, but this seems like a conscious choice because of the complexity of those types of characters (in play-style and motivations).</p>

<p>Each of the characters also has a miniature to use on the included game maps, of which there are 2 double-sided maps (1 for each adventure), a set of dice, and tokens for the monsters. It's all kept in a tidy, compact box that makes transporting it convenient.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-4.jpg?itok=Rfy6Y00p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-4.jpg?itok=bptEzh9E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Start Of The Beginning</h2>

<p>The rules system that <em>Tales of the Valinant</em> uses is the <a href="https://koboldpress.com/black-flag-roleplaying/" rel="nofollow">Black Flag Roleplaying</a> system, which works seamlessly with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition</a> system. The starter set works as the perfect jumping on point for any roleplay system (although you may have to learn some new rules and mechanics for a different system), and I think it speaks volumes that SFG and Kobold Press haven't used this to push their own system. There's a leaflet for the 3 <em>Tales of the Valiant </em>books (Player's Guide, Game Master's Guide and Monster Vault) to show you where you can go next, but nothing is pushed on players. The adventure isn't left on a hook (although some continuation ideas are provided), but it feels like a standalone box, and a powerful one at that.</p>

<p>I really hope that this box is a huge success, and following SFG's <em>Epic Encounters</em> style boxes, we get adds ons for it with new characters and new adventures.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Tales Of The Valiant Starter Set?</h2>

<p>The T<em>ales of the Valiant</em> Starter Set is the perfect combination of roleplaying introduction, great adventure (which we didn't go into too much detail on to avoid spoilers), and solid components, all in an awesome compact box. The set works extremely well for players who are brand new to roleplaying or those who want to try being a Game Master for the first time. If everyone in your group is super experienced, then it's still a nice set to play through, but the adventure might not be challenging for experienced players. I really hope SFG picks this up as part of their <em>Epic Encounters</em> style boxes and expands further.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/g-rebels-is-a-sci-fi-flight-combat-game-where-you-feel-like-youre-flying-a-nissan-versa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been patrolling the skies and shooting down hostile aircraft in flight sims since the 1980s, all the way back to blazing away at single green pixels in the original Sublogic Flight Simulator for Apple II. Since then, I’ve whipped the Kilrathi aboard the Tiger Claw, crushed the Rebellion in TIE Fighter, gunned down the Red Baron in, well, The Red Baron, and buzzed my own apartment in Microsoft Flight Simulator. So I was pretty tickled by the opportunity to spend several hours with G-Rebels, an in-development game that combines several things I dearly love: aviation, Blade Runner, and open-ended approaches to gameplay. This amalgam of design influences produces something that is curious, ambitious, and dripping with potential, but which I’m not sure has yet been tuned enough to find its footing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">G-Rebels is set after a climate disaster wipes out most of the world. You’re now a member of one of many factions piloting armed aircraft called Skyblades between the skyscrapers of what appears to be off-brand Blade Runner LA. You search the air for enemies, traffickers, and rogue replicants. Yes, they’re actually called replicants... I’m no expert on copyright law so don’t ask me how. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">G-Rebels Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, vehicle-oriented games have to fulfill a very specific requirement to succeed: the vehicle has to be fun to pilot through the environments provided. And that’s where the problems begin for G-Rebels: flying around is more often a chore than a thrill. Sometimes, it’s even a bore.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">G-Rebels refers to your Skyblade as a glider, but that description isn’t really accurate. Its closest real-world analog is a helicopter, as you have the ability to hover in place practically anywhere. But unlike a real chopper, there’s no constant dance of hands and feet necessary on the part of the pilot to keep things stable most of the time. Only cornering or changing altitude rapidly puts much strain on the pilot. Instead, your Skyblade effortlessly hovers, scoots, and strafes up, down, and side to side like some flying first-person shooter avatar. If you’ve ever played the ancient FPS Descent, things will feel eerily familiar.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your Skyblade has the handling characteristics of a sci-fi Nissan Versa.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet it takes a long time to get a real hang of the X-Type Skyblade, weirdly because it is such a forgiving vehicle. Compared to a flight sim or even an arcade shooter like Star Wars Squadrons, there’s very little sense of momentum or gravity at work. You can stop and shift your velocity from forward to straight upward in a second, but everything feels weirdly underpowered. Your Skyblade has the handling characteristics of a sci-fi Nissan Versa: slow, reliable, predictable, anemic, and utterly boring. I already drive a Nissan Versa in real life, and I don’t need to carry its steady, value-conscious banality into my fantasy worlds. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upgrades help somewhat, especially in regard to the punch of your guns and your straight line speed, though I still felt like I was merely updating my flying sedan into a flying minivan. In the end, the problem with G-Rebels is that while the vehicle style fits the Blade Runner aesthetic, the controls and capabilities are a bad match for the near-constant canyon flying. More consideration needs to be given to proximity warnings and spatial awareness, a problem compounded by the mission design. The campaign is quite simply front-loaded with escort duties and timed waypoint challenges, anachronistic designs that sap much of the richness from the environment.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">G-Rebels takes place above a flooded world where skyscrapers rise from synthetic islands and inhabit the narrow space between thundering waves and near-persistent clouds. Within that space hover other Skyblades – some benign, others piloted by nefarious foes. Mission design is pretty straightforward: go to waypoints, look around, find targets, and blow them up without dying yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a story, a plot, characters and such, but not a lot that I cared about. Voice acting was hammily scripted and badly delivered, and the tones of other pilots had a soulless ring to them that led me to believe they were likely AI generated... which a look at the Steam page appeared to confirm. That’s deeply disappointing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I shouldn’t go much further talking about G-Rebels without pointing out its greatest sin: the presence of tightly-timed waypoint-to-waypoint-to-waypoint dashes. I thought that we as a species had collectively agreed to discontinue these terrible sections in games after Superman 64, but apparently G-Rebels’s developers disagreed. Why anyone thinks sprinting to five waypoints over and over in a fairly graceless vehicle that I’m just learning to fly is a good gameplay experience is beyond me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What doesn’t disappoint is the gunplay, which feels like one of the most-realized aspects of G-Rebels. Fans of flight sims and arcade flight shooters are going to be pretty familiar with the base modes available: a short range gun mode useful for dogfighting, and a much longer range guided missile system capable of hitting targets from vast distances with an electronic lock-on. Both are thoughtfully designed. I found that following my brain’s now near-instinctual flight-sim programming worked very well. Slightly leading turning targets at close range usually ended in solid hits. and adjusting my lead at distance worked just as it should. The missiles were potent, but the guns were so much fun I largely stuck to them, poking in and out from behind the megalithic buildings to snipe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your control panels and HUD are a triumph of form over function. Dashboard screens can make the relative positions and altitudes confusing, and seem to alternate between providing too little or too much information. Instrumentation feels like it was designed more to create pretty preview captures than to quickly provide the info a pilot might need when flying an antigravity tank between tall buildings in a thunderstorm. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What doesn’t disappoint is the gunplay, which feels like one of the most-realized aspects of G-Rebels. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't get a lot of the conventional dogtails and energy tactics you’d expect from a flight game set inside a planetary atmosphere. Gravity really isn’t much of a factor, so dogfights are less chases and jousts than shootouts between flying tanks. There are strategies to learn and employ, but most of what you’ve learnt in other flying games doesn’t really apply here. Usually, shooting first and fastest is the best guarantee of victory.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The city itself has potential, but in its present form largely fails to deliver anything especially characteristic. The buildings are decently-rendered enough, but very little of what you see really feels distinct, much less lived-in or real. It feels more like a set or a stage made for a video game than any real living, breathing world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">G-Rebels might become something really entertaining, but right now it's still very much a work in progress. It’s cool, but it’s not yet consistently fun. Missions and aircraft handling design have a long way to go before it hits that. You can see the potential for something enjoyable, but the parts haven’t quite come together yet into a compelling formula. I haven’t yet seen an official release date for G-Rebels, but I’m hoping it’s far enough out that the team has time to refine its ambitions and create the carefully-tuned flight combat experience they’re so obviously lovingly laboring to realize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

                <p dir="ltr">For some, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II set a surprisingly high difficulty bar right from the start of the game. However, Warhorse Studio clearly had more tricks up its sleeve, as today's Patch 1.2.4 update brings a new Hardcore mode to the table for the most dedicated of KCD2 players.</p><p dir="ltr">Hardcore Mode, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-hardcore-mode-arrives-next-week/1100-6530705/">revealed earlier this month</a>, adds multiple new obstacles to Henry of Skalitz's adventure, including the removal of fast travel and a list of negative perks that must be selected before the game begins. Among the negative effects are Sweaty, which makes Henry smell worse when he goes without showering, Bashful, which removes the ability to ask villagers for directions, and Somnambulant, which turns Henry into a sleepwalker--whenever he lays down to rest, he can wake up in a completely different place.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4477030-kcd-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477030" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4477030-kcd-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477030"></a><figcaption>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4477030-kcd-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.4.2 also adds multiple fixes and rebalances to the non-Hardcore experience as well, including rebalanced prices on herbs, a new hairstyle for Henry, and fixed save-file issues for Xbox players specifically. The full Patch 1.4.2 notes are below.</p><p dir="ltr">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launched February 4 to critical acclaim, as it currently <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">averages an 88 overall</a> on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/">GameSpot's 9/10 review</a> called it "utterly enticing," and described it as "a rich and sprawling adventure that effortlessly oscillates between medieval drama and slice-of-life hijinks in a world that feels distinctly alive."</p><p dir="ltr">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Patch 1.4.2 notes</h2><h3 dir="ltr">New</h3><h4 dir="ltr">Hardcore Mode</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">Introduced the option to start a new playthrough in hardcore mode.

<p>Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Offworld Industries' <a href="https://wccftech.com/squad-44-is-post-scriptums-new-name-update-adds-greek-faction-new-map-and-weapons/">SQUAD</a>, Misultin Studios and MicroProse Software's EXFIL and Torn Banner Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-update-in-2025-for-no-more-room-in-hell-2-released-adding-firefighter-zombies/">No More Room In Hell 2</a> join the ranks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-in-warhammer-40k-darktide-enlisted-and-karma-the-dark-world/">games</a> like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/">Control</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> in supporting DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-black-myth-wukong/">blog post</a> from NVIDIA, each game enjoys a performance boost, but the biggest headway seems to be made in Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>Players pushing 4K, with everything maxed out, while utilizing an RTX 50 series GPU "<em>can multiply performance up to 10X thanks to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution,</em>" NVIDIA claims.</p>
<p>"<em>At 4K, with full ray tracing enabled and every other setting maxed out, DLSS Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution multiply frame rates by an average of 10X. This massive performance boost enables GeForce RTX 5070 gamers to play at over 110 FPS, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti users to play at over 130 FPS, GeForce RTX 5080 owners to play at over 150 FPS, and GeForce RTX 5090 buyers to play at over 240 FPS, maxing out the capabilities of the latest 4K OLED G-SYNC compatible DisplayPort 2.1 displays.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, the performance boost you're able to see will always depend on the hardware you have in your system, but even considering that, it's still an impressive bump for what many players find challenging to run.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was one of the biggest titles in 2024, winning its fair share of awards, including the game of the year for both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-award-winners-2024-announced-black-myth-wukong-is-game-of-the-year/">Steam Awards</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/">Golden Joysticks</a>. It's also one of the sleekest-looking games in recent years if you've got the hardware for it. Now that it supports DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation, more players will be able to enjoy its wonderful visuals without losing frames as they would have before.</p>

Dear reader, allow me, if you will, a moment of honesty. I truly, wholly did not know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> was still going. Not only is it still going, but yesterday <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> shared a look at the game's impending second year of updates, so I really missed the boat on this one - pun intended, of course. The first season of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">pirate</a> game's second year has already kicked off, introducing a few new features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters there's new world tiers, which are basically just optional difficult levels you can choose for certain challenges. Pick a higher tier, get better rewards, simple! There's item ascension now too, which lets you improve your gear with things like randomized buffs and "modifiable slots." Season 1 will be getting a mid-season update too that'll bring in a new PvP feature called Death Tides, essentially a capture and control kind of mode.

<p>
Season 2, which will arrive sometime this summer, will be bringing in playable large ships, but more notably, there'll be factions to choose from each of which have their own boons. Other factions will be hostile to you though, so take that into consideration. After that there's season 3 in the fall, with its biggest addition being land combat. Feels like something you'd think would be there from day one, but we all know how rocky a development period Skull and Bones has had.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, there's season 4, which is quite literally adding in a kraken. It's a pirate game! Of course you have to have a kraken. Outside of that there's the addition of the Hunters Guild, you won't be surprised to hear that it focuses on hunting sea creatures, and there'll be a new large ship to be acquired too.
</p>
<p>
If the fact that Skull and Bones is continuing to receive updates has convinced you to give it a go, perhaps hold off on buying it, as the game is getting a free weekend this week, from April 17th-21st. Can't say I saw this game lasting longer than a year, so kudos to the devs for keeping things ship shape - pun intended, of course.

What’s tricky is that they’re earned from side quests that won’t be available until you unlock High Rank. <strong>You can get the Armorcharm first by completing the “Secure Wounded Hollow” optional quest from Cobb in the Suja location.</strong> He’ll either be at your tent or right next to it with Gemma.</p><p>This quest involves hunting two Hirabami monsters inside the Wounded Hollow area. Bringing a ranged weapon like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wild-heavy-light-bowgun-differences-best-1851773364">Bowguns</a></span> will serve you well in hitting these typically flying monsters. Having something that can trigger an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">offset attack</a></span> can also be useful for occasionally knocking it down to the ground. The two most important things I recommend doing are taking advantage of their elemental weaknesses (Fire and Thunder) and using the levers on the sides of the arena to trigger a large fence that divides the area in half. With the right timing, this can separate the monsters for a little bit and let you focus on them one at a time.</p><p>Return to Suja and talk to Cobb once you’re done looting the Hirabami. He’ll give you the Armorcharm, which will go into your item box. If you completed this quest before Title Update 1 and encountered a glitch where you didn’t receive the item, you can properly earn it by finishing any Arena Quest at the Grand Hub.</p><h2 id="h807"><a id=""></a>How to Get Powercharm</h2><p>Your chance to get the Powercharm will come a little bit later. You’ll need to have completed the quest mentioned above and raised your hunter rank further. <strong>The Powercharm is available as a reward for completing the “As Gatekeeper” quest from Rex in Suja.</strong> He’ll be in the same areas that Cobb patrols.</p><p>This is another hunt involving two monsters in Wounded Hollow. But this time, it’s against two Ajarakan. These things can be super aggressive and might be easier if you team up with another player for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-co-op-lobby-link-party-id-1851771071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-co-op-lobby-link-party-id-1851771071">multiplayer hunt</a></span>. Aside from bringing something that can inflict Water Element damage, separating them with the large fence is still a must. Between their huge attacks and power-up state, taking on both at the same time is a recipe for disaster. Consider bringing a weapon you can guard with to ease up on the constant dodging and potentially trigger a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-power-clash-explained-guarding-1851775741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-power-clash-explained-guarding-1851775741">power clash</a></span>.</p><p>Return to Rex once you’re finished to receive the Powercharm. Just like its armor counterpart, this will go straight into your item box. Another similarity is that on the off chance that a glitch prevented you from unlocking it, finishing any Arena quest will give it to you.</p><h2 id="h808"><a id=""></a>How to Use the Armorcharm and Powercharm</h2><figure id="" data-id="c6922733690ebf12c6d916319793c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c6922733690ebf12c6d916319793c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Transfer Items screen, with the Powercharm highlighted in the Item Box.

Thankfully, they’re listed on the first page of your item box alongside most of your healing items.</p><p>Losing out on one or two spots in your pouch is a small price to pay for some additional buffs.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-nudges-mainstream-gaming-pcs-forward-with-rtx-5060-series-starting-at-299.1164978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-nudges-mainstream-gaming-pcs-forward-with-rtx-5060-series-starting-at-299/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>As with its other 50-series announcements, Nvidia is leaning on its DLSS Multi-Frame Generation technology to make lofty performance claims—the GPUs can insert up to three AI-interpolated frames in between each pair of frames that the GPU actually renders. The 40 series could only generate a single frame, and 30-series and older GPUs don't support DLSS Frame Generation at all. This makes apples-to-apples performance comparisons difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, the company says the 5060 Ti and 5060 offer double the performance of the 4060 Ti and 4060, but all of its benchmarks are made using the "max Frame Gen level supported by each GPU." The small snippets of native performance information we do have<em>—Hogwarts Legacy</em> runs on a 5060 Ti at 61 FPS 1440p, compared to 34 FPS for the 3060 Ti—suggests that it's slightly less than twice as fast as that two-generation-old card. This would still be reasonably impressive, given the underwhelming 4060 Ti refresh. But we'll need to wait for third-party testing before we really have a good idea of how performance will stack up without Frame Generation enabled.</p>


<p>As we and others have observed since the launch of the 40-series a few years ago, Frame Generation gives the best results when your base frame rate is already reasonably high; the technology is best used to make a good frame rate better and is less useful if you're trying to make a bad frame rate good. That's even more relevant for the slower 50-series than for the other GPUs in the lineup, which makes Nvidia's reticence to provide native performance comparisons especially frustrating.</p>
<p>Rumors from earlier this year that correctly reported the specs of the 5060 series also indicated that Nvidia was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/leaked-geforce-rtx-5060-and-5050-specs-suggest-nvidia-will-keep-playing-it-safe/">planning to launch a low-end RTX 5050 GPU</a> at some point, its first new entry-level GPU since launching the RTX 3050 in January 2022. The 5050 could still be coming, but if it is, it wasn't part of Nvidia's announcements today.</p>

Focus Interactive recently announced that a threequel is in development. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-now-in-development/1100-6530114/">Details

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-didnt-need-to-sell-4-million-units-to-be-a-success-but-it-did-anyway/1100-6527262/">Space Marine 2 has sold over four million copies</a> to date, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-will-get-several-substantial-updates-in-2025/1100-6529135/">more-substantial updates</a> are on the way throughout 2025. Elsewhere in the Warhammer 40,000 galaxy, other games are also currently in development based on the popular tabletop wargaming IP. Fans can look forward to a digital collectible card game in the form of Warpforge, a vehicular combat game called Speed Freeks, and more turn-based tactics in a sequel to Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.</p>

It will also include new weapon upgrades as well as long-unobtainable preorder and territory-specific weapons and pets that will be added back to the game in the form of rare drops from the game's high-level enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475902-gw20thanniversaryheroimage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475902" data-ratio="0.60052083333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475902-gw20thanniversaryheroimage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475902"></a><figcaption>Guild Wars: The 20th Anniversary Masterpiece Collection includes the game's three campaigns and expansion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475902-gw20thanniversaryheroimage.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the newly added weapon upgrades, they will sport the "of the Profession" modifier and will also be added to the game's rare-drop loot tables. The upgrades will let players gain access to attributes they normally wouldn't be able to, enabling new builds. The upgrades will also add a cosmetic glowing streak effect to weapons in the color associated with the given profession.</p><p dir="ltr">To sweeten the birthday bash, Guild Wars: The 20th Anniversary Masterpiece Collection will be 80% off and cost just $8 from April 15-29 via the <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/en-us/guild-wars-masterpiece-collection" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guild Wars 2 website</a>, with in-game items discounted 60%. Other editions of Guild Wars, including Guild Wars Trilogy, the Eye of the North expansion, and each individual campaign, will also be 80% off on Steam and other storefronts for the duration of the sale.</p><p dir="ltr">Guild Wars made a name for itself 20 years ago as one of the first MMORPGs in the wake of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> to not require a monthly subscription fee. It received new content in the form of additional, standalone campaigns that added new quests, regions, and classes, with a more traditional expansion, 2007's Eye of the North, setting the stage for its 2012 sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/guild-wars-2/" data-ref-id="5000-30218">Guild Wars 2</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">In November 2022, social deduction indie darling Among Us saw an evolution with Among Us VR, which brought the game's small spacemen from 2D to 3D in a new first-person experience. Among Us VR recently rebranded to Among Us 3D in anticipation of the non-VR version's imminent launch, and today Innersloth and Schell Games have confirmed the new version will drop on Steam May 6 for $10.</p><p dir="ltr">Among Us 3D takes the three-dimensional look of the game formerly known as Among Us VR and removes the need for VR goggles, allowing players to complete tasks and betray their fellow space beans in full 3D. The non-VR version will support cross-play with its VR counterparts on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO, but Among Us 3D will not be compatible with the original Among Us release.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxnw01582Bk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uxnw01582Bk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The new 3D version of Among Us transforms the chaos of the multiplayer social-deduction game to a first-person perspective, along with all of the task-themed minigames the innocent crewmates must complete to win. It will also introduce native proximity chat--which may or may not give a player's position away to an approaching impostor--as well as a new class, The Infected, which turns a killed Crewmate into another Infected impostor instead of the usual ghost.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate Among Us 3D's impending release, Schell Games has also announced the <a href="https://schellgames.com/blog/powered-by-wishlists-challenge-among-us-3d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Powered by Wishlists Challenge</a>. This will add "exclusive in-game cosmetics" to all Among Us 3D owners based on Steam Wishlist milestones the community can achieve between now and May 6. Rewards will be earned at the following milestones:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">333,333 wishlists - A new hat</li><li dir="ltr">444,444 wishlists - A second new hat</li><li dir="ltr">555,555 wishlists - A "cosmetic surprise"</li><li dir="ltr">777,777 wishlists - "Suspiciously exciting new cosmetic(s)"</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Among Us 3D launches May 6 for PC via Steam.

Canadian <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> pre-orders - which were originally set to go live on 9th April before Nintendo announced a last-minute delay - will reportedly now begin next week.
</p>

Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">slammed on the brakes last Tuesday</a>, just a day before Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders were set to begin, saying it was making the move "in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US". That followed the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">unprecedented decision to indefinitely delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the US</a> while the company looked to "assess the potential impact" of US president Donald Trump sweeping trade tariffs.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, Billbill-kun - who has a strong track-record when it comes to retail leaks - says Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders will begin soon. "From what I can see through some Canadian retailers," they <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1912167208140108026">wrote on social media</a>, "Nintendo Switch 2 console &amp; bundle pre-orders should start from 23rd April, 2025. Date subject to change. Can't confirm if it's the same for US."

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">previously admitted</a> the US administration's trade tariffs - which had heavily impacted some of the company's key manufacturing locations around the world - were a "challenge" and "something we're going to have to address." And despite a temporary pause on some tariffs since then, the situation has remained uncertain amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-appears-to-backtrack-on-us-electronics-tariff-exceptions-but-no-one-seems-to-know-exactly-whats-going-on">confusing messaging around potential electronics exceptions</a>.
</p>
<p>
One prominent analytics firm has said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst">expects Nintendo to stick with its previously announced $450 launch price</a> for Switch 2 in the US despite the tariffs, but believes their effect could lead to a 20 percent price increase for the console over the next two years. And it's not just Nintendo. Earlier this month, US trade group the Entertainment Software Association <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">said the tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a> as a whole.

            <p>The Completely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/normal-fishing">Normal Fishing</a> subgenre continues to flourish with the announcement of Dreadmoor, a jolly little tugboat enterprise set in a world of island-sized ribcages and heightened background radiation. My goodness, so normal! Normality readings off the scale. I am confident that nothing foetid and otherworldly waits in the darkness, far below your rudder. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The obvious parallel here is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>, the top-down cosmic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> trawling sim from Black Salt Games. Our previous captain Katharine Castle (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dredge-review">was a big fan</a>. At the risk of yet again sounding like Dr Contrarian S. Hype-Puncturer, I thought it was a bit mid. I loved the concept of reeling tetromino-shaped Cthulhaddock from the abyss while reckoning with a day-night cycle, but in practice, it just felt like a load of fetchquests revolving around a not especially gratifying mystery. </p>
<p>Dreadmoor resembles Dredge so closely in places that I'm tempted to refer to it as Dredgemore. It, too, obliges you to cram asymmetrical bottom-feeders into a grid-based inventory, rotating them to make optimal use of space. It, too, asks you to be careful after sundown. It, too, favours warm, flat colours and cartoon contours, to the point that the giant angler fish that emerge to swallow your boat seem almost pettable. It, too, follows a loop of selling bizarre ocean fauna to swivel-eyed weirdos, then using the proceeds to upgrade your ship and craft new gear.</p>
<p>But Dreadmoor cribs just as much from Rare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, with the ability to roam inside your boat, cast lines and even venture ashore in first-person view. The boat can be steered in third-person, the better to avoid any tentacles grasping at your timbers. I imagine all that's very attractive to people who are hankering for a Dredge 2.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm most enticed by the idea of crafting my own fishing lures, which puts me nicely in mind of China Mieville's The Scar. Remember the hook they used to reel in the Avanc? I'm not sure Dreadmoor's doughty steamship has the buoyancy or ballast for that kind of prey, but I live in hope/terror. There are apparently about 100 species of aquatic organism to yank rudely from the depths. You probably won't want to keep the stranger breeds aboard your vessel for long.</p>
<p>Dreadmoor has no release date as yet - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3629430/DREADMOOR/">read more on Steam</a>.
