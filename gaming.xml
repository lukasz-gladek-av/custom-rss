It’s the story of four high school friends reuniting after 27 years without contact. Why they’re getting back together now is, apparently, part of the plot you create with your decisions, but there’s word of a terrible secret they all shared coming back to haunt them.</p><p>Each part is being released as a “tape,” because ‘90s references I guess, the first next week on February 18, and the second (currently) set for April 15. And, both will be included for PS+ subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers.</p><p>But that’s not all that was revealed. Intriguing puzzle game&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.blueprincegame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blue Prince</em></a></span>, that calls itself an “atmospheric architectural adventure,” and looks absolutely fascinating. It’s seemingly first-person exploration, but in buildings where the rooms rearrange themselves, and all sorts of secrets are hidden within. It’s an indie piece, published by Raw Fury, and it will be coming straight onto PlayStation Plus this spring.</p><p>Then, in the summer, early access Steam hit <em>Abiotic Factor</em> will arrive on PS+ too. This is an FPS combined with survival sim, for one to six players, set across a bonkers mix of biomes and realms. It’s absolutely <em>adored</em> on PC, so makes for an excellent addition to Sony’s catalogue, especially given it works best when played in groups. If you’ve tried to convince friends to pay for an obscure indie title on console so you can play together, you’ll already know why everyone just have automatic access makes it far more likely to happen.</p><p>Sony is clearly testing the waters here, given its previous defiant refusal to sacrifice those day-one $70 sales for the ongoing income of a subscriber. While these are obviously not games that’d fetch such sums, and the latter two would be harder sells outside of Steam’s more esoteric ecosystem, it’s still a pretty big deal—<em>Lost Records</em> especially, given Don’t Nod’s string of previous mid-price successes.</p><p>Let’s hope it proves popular, enough that PlayStation broadens the day-one options, such that those who can’t afford to pay for multiple $70 games a year might have a cheaper path to entertainment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-split-fiction-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-or-ea-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hazelight Studios is looking to gatecrash all the Game of the Year parties again. Split Fiction is the studio’s newest co-op project, and Xbox Game Pass and EA Play members are curious to see if the title is coming to either subscription service.</p>



<p>It Takes Two to Tango, which is why the 2021 predecessor was so revered and successful. It shined a spotlight on tandem tale-telling and showed co-op games still have so much potential. I’ve already discussed our most anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op games of 2025</a>, and comfortably topping the list has to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>Split Fiction on Game Pass would be smart, and it’s an EA game, so EA Play access is logical. However, the cookie doesn’t always crumble this way.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-split-fiction-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Split Fiction on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you choose? Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Split Fiction isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass at launch, and all the evidence would suggest it is staying this way.</strong></p>



<p>It’s common for new game announcement trailers to mention Game Pass. Split Fiction was announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and came with a full trailer. Unfortunately for Game Pass subscribers, there was zero mention of it coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction Xbox Store Page</a> also neglects to mention Game Pass eligibility. There’s still time before release, meaning it could change. If it does, we’ll update this page and let you know.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-split-fiction-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Split Fiction Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but Split Fiction could come to Xbox Game Pass if It Takes Two is anything to go by.</strong></p>



<p>It Takes Two released in March 2021. <strong>The co-op title was on Xbox Game Pass a few months later in November 2021</strong>. There’s no guarantee history repeats itself with Split Fiction. But there is a precedent here, so stay tuned for a change in its status.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-split-fiction-on-ea-play">Can You Play Split Fiction on EA Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction is not available as a day-one title on EA Play.</strong></p>



<p>EA rarely (if ever) makes new EA titles free on EA Play straightaway. You can grab a Split Fiction discount if you have EA Play though. But like Game Pass, it’ll likely be a while before Hazelight’s newest co-op adventure is free-to-play on EA Play.</p>



<hr>



<p>Can another Josef Fares game catch lightning in a bottle and win Game of the Year again? Or is Split Fiction destined to split opinions and fall short of It Takes Two? Let us know based on what you’ve seen so far.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s February State of Play</a> showcase rightfully gave Split Fiction more exposure. You can check out the exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-received-a-new-trailer-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> showing off the litany of new ideas the release brings.</p>

            <p>The Minecraft Movie team has released another trailer for the upcoming film, which intends to whet appetites and put emphasis on the idea that creativity is key to survival. But, that's not what everyone is talking about.</p>
<p>Rather, it is our first look at the film's depiction of Minecraft's villagers that has caused quite the stir among, well, anyone who has had to look at them.</p>
<p>These chaps are rather unusual looking. "God has abandoned us," <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1889776013724283175">one social media commentator said</a> under a screenshot of the Minecraft Movie villagers. Another added: "They look like square cousins of the dad from Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."</p>

<p>And, just for posterity because it is one of those images I can't actually bring myself to look away from even though I do want to, here they are again in a screengrab from the trailer.</p>
<p>So,  what do you think?</p>

<p>"Four misfits," explains the official blurb if you're looking for more context on the upcoming film, "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve.</p>
<p>"Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p>
<p>The Minecraft Movie is set to release this April. It stars Jack Black as Steve (which right now appears to be Jack Black but in a blue T-shirt) and Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for Netflix back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-in-season-15.1108185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-season-15<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has announced that loot boxes will be making a return to&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>in the game's upcoming fifteenth season, so if you're nostalgic for that particular aspect of the game's bygone days (for some reason), then you're in luck.</p>

<p>According to senior systems designer Gavin Winter, the goal for the return of loot boxes is "keeping it fun while being transparent about what's inside and the rate of various drops from opening each box".</p>

<p>In <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> summarizing yesterday's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>Spotlight presentation, Blizzard says loot boxes will contain "a variety of cosmetics". That'll include skins, voice lines, and more, just like it used to be back in the early days of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-coming-back.jpg?itok=3wUHmTrd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-coming-back.jpg?itok=3VftSz8G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Loot boxes are making a comeback in&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Lest you think this means&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>'s battle passes are going away, think again. Blizzard says you'll be able to earn loot boxes "from weekly and event rewards", as well as via the battle pass.</p>

<p>One Legendary-level loot box will be available via the free track on the battle pass, while two further boxes will be earnable via the Premium track. It doesn't sound like you'll be able to directly buy loot boxes from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>'s in-game shop.</p>

<p>Perhaps to stave off some of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-uk-loot-box-guidelines" rel="nofollow">criticism</a> that's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/proposed-australia-loot-box-law-would-ban-them-for-minors" rel="nofollow">aimed</a> at the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-uk-research-draws-robust-link-between-loot-boxes-and-gambling" rel="nofollow">nature of loot boxes</a> over the years, Blizzard says it's aiming to be "transparent" about what chances you'll have to obtain certain levels of cosmetics.</p>

<p>Each loot box is guaranteed to contain one Rare or better item, while an Epic item will definitely drop within five boxes and a Legendary item will drop within twenty.</p>




<p>Specifically, you've got a 5.1% chance of a Legendary item in a regular loot box and a 100% chance of one in a Legendary box. Epic items stand at 21.93% and Rare items at 96.26% across all boxes, with common items sitting at a rarity of 97.97%.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>Spotlight also offered a look at some of the other things coming to the game as part of Season 15, including new crossbow-wielding hero Freja, the new Stadium game mode, and the introduction of a Perk system to let you customize heroes.</p>

<p>Loot boxes will be reintroduced to&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>when its fifteenth season begins on February 18th. The game is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2357570/Overwatch_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/overwatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/overwatch-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/overwatch-2-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo and the Pokémon Company recently received a new patent in the United States, which could help their lawsuit against Palworld.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/yesterday-nintendo-received-a-u-s-version-of-another-anti-palworld-patent-and-asked-the-u-s-patent-office-for-an-interview-to-get-a-third-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Fray</a> (via <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patents-uspto-infringement-lawsuit-implications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>), Nintendo and the Pokemon Company recently acquired U.S. Patent No. 12,220,638, which helps them fight Palworld in different countries. Players must first learn about a previous patent published on December 31, 2024, to understand the new patent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On December 31, 2024, U.S. Patent No. 12,179,111 was acquired by Nintendo, where the company outlined a “first mode and a second mode”. In the former, players would use a “catching item” to procure a “field character”, and in the latter, a “fighting character” is released to engage in battle with the “field character”. It was speculated that Palworld changed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-has-changed-how-pal-spheres-work-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Pal Spheres worked in the game</a> when Nintendo was in the process of publishing this patent, as all parties were informed about it a month before it was published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo acquired the new U.S. Patent No. 12,220,638 on February 11, 2025, and it was very similar to the one they published at the end of last year. However, some different terms were used in this patent, where “field character” has been replaced by “virtual character” and “catching items” with “obtaining items.” A display indicator for “likelihood of success” for obtaining a virtual character was mentioned, too. Lastly, any mentions of the first and second modes were removed.</p>



<p>So, how does Nintendo’s new patent help their lawsuit against Palworld? The report reveals that with the first patent, Pocketpair argued that there wasn’t a clear separation between a “first mode and second mode” in Palworld. With the new patent, Nintendo removed the distinction between these first and second modes and added new terms like “virtual character” and “obtaining items” to increase their chances in the patent infringement lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Nintendo and the Pokemon Company are not slowing down in their battle against Palworld. To help with the rejected claims, their attorney has requested an interview with the patent examiner on February 8, 2025. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-pocketpair-publishing-interest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocketpair Publishing</a> is now live. Palworld received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-spring-festival-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five new skins</a> for the Spring Festival. Do you think Nintendo’s new patent help them in their lawsuit against Palworld?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Embracer said Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 did particularly well on Steam, where it saw over 250,000 peak concurrent players. For context, the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance hit a peak Steam concurrent player count of 96,069 seven years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s actual peak concurrent player count will be bigger, given the game launched on console as well as PC. However, neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer, which owns Warhorse Studios via its subsidiary, Plaion, said Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 “has been initially successful, not only in terms of player and critic reception, but also in terms of performance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This reflects the dedication and hard work of our development studio, Warhorse Studios, and our publisher, Deep Silver,” Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is our strong belief that the game will continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years, highlighting the exceptional quality, immersion and appeal of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Warhorse Studios has a robust roadmap, including updates and new content over the next 12 months, ensuring an engaging and continuously evolving experience for the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are immensely proud of the teams involved in the successful release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which has significantly outperformed our expectations so far,” Wingefors added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Embracer has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> due out later this quarter (January to March 2025). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer said it has more than 5,000 game developers working on its upcoming games, with 10 triple-A games due out over the next three financial years (FY 2025/26, FY 2026/27, and FY 2027/28). Eight of these are from internal studios, two from external studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In FY 2025/26, Embracer has two triple-A games scheduled to be released towards the end of the financial year. Mid-size releases include Gothic 1 Remake, REANIMAL, Fellowship, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Titan Quest II, Screamer, Echoes of the End (working title), Tides of Tomorrow, Satisfactory (console) and the full release of Wreckfest 2, alongside a similar number of mid-sized games yet to be announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer has endured a tough time in recent years, laying off thousands of staff and selling a number of its studios, including Borderlands maker Gearbox and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive. It still owns Metro developer 4A Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-developer-makes-clear-playstation-vr2-game-awakening-isnt-next-mainline-metro-game"><u>which is working on a brand new game in the series</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has shut down the iOS version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a> due to an ongoing bug.</p>
<p>Players had reported they were unable to access additional content purchased for the iOS game, which the publisher has stated was due to changes made to the in-app purchases model.</p>
<p>"Further investigation revealed that we are unable to completely fix the bug and implement the new changes, making it unlikely to resume service for the game," a <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/news/2719">notice from Square Enix</a> reads. "Thus, we must regretfully announce that we will end support for the iOS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles."</p>

<p>Players who made in-app purchases in January 2024 or later will be able to request a refund via Apple Support.</p>
<p>The game is no longer available to download. Though free-to-play, it included in-app purchases for the full version of the game ($24.99) and individual DLCs.</p>
<p>Crystal Chronicles was first released for the GameCube in 2003, but sales suffered due to the need for a complex Game Boy Advance setup to fully enjoy. The game was then remastered for Switch, PS4, Android and iOS in 2020.</p>
<p>Square Enix has confirmed the other versions of the game remain unaffected.</p>
<p>The news follows other mobile games shut down by Square Enix in the past couple of years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-will-shut-next-year">Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> battle royale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-mobile-battle-royale-the-first-soldier-shuts-down-next-year">The First Soldier</a>.</p>
<p>These were all shut down due to declining player numbers. While Crystal Chronicles has suffered from this purchase bug, Square Enix clearly did not deem it worthy of fully fixing, perhaps due to similarly low player numbers.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">latest financial report</a>, Square Enix revealed net sales of its mobile games had plummeted by over 32 percent, owing to the closure of these games.</p>
<p>However, profits from mobile games remain higher than its HD games (console and PC), and are further dwarfed by MMO profits.</p>
<p>That's a key reason the company is developing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">mobile version of Final Fantasy 14</a>, though it's set to be free-to-play and won't include gacha mechanics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The first look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> gameplay has finally arrived with a new trailer shown during the latest State of Play presentation.</p>
<p>The trailer, which can be watched below, introduces the new main character, the renowned Miyamoto Musashi, as he fights his way through some zombie samurai using his sword and taking advantage of the environment. The grounded combat system, in particular, feels like a welcome change over the vast majority of modern action games featuring over-the-top elements and looks markedly Onimusha. Hopefully, during the course of the adventure, we will be able to employ the Niten Ichi-ryū combat style that Musashi created and perfected during his life that was absent from this initial gameplay showcase.</p>

<p>Besides featuring a new Onimusha: Way of the Sword trailer, yesterday's State of Play presentation also featured a new Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny trailer which provided another look at the recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-spotlights-new-monster-hunter-wilds-trailer-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-release-window/"> announced</a> remaster of the second entry in the CAPCOM series.

I had Hell Is Us vaguely pegged as an "arty" game, but then I watched the new release date trailer, which begins with Adam Jensen('s voice actor) grizzly-grunting that "when the fury of emotions sparks the wildfire of violence, it dissolves our illusions and exposes the fragile structure of reality". And I realised that, no, this is some glorious nonsense. Maximum ham. High-concept cheeseville. Pseudostravaganza. I mean all these phrases as compliments. Come now - let your illusions dissolve as the fragile structure of your reality is exposed by the wildfire violence of this furious trailer!

<p>
In less excitable language, Hell Is Us is a third-person action-adventure with a mix of melee combat featuring lightsabers and drones, exploration featuring a mix of rundown military and otherworldly architecture, and narrative sequences featuring fellahs with flappy double chins.</p>
<p>You play Rémi, who is voiced by the afore-referenced Elias Toufexis, and is on "a quest to find his origins in a country" both "ravaged by civil war" and full of "supernatural creatures reminiscent of ancient headstones and monuments". The game is the work of Rogue Factor with Nacon publishing, and its creative and artistic director is no less a lofty luminary than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête. 
</p>
<p>
It looks a bit like a weaponised <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, with notes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and Tom Clancy. It's also got something called "player-plattering", which I don't entirely understand.
</p>
<p>
"Through its Player-Plattering approach incentivizing players to follow their instincts rather than markers, the title aims to return to the roots of adventure games," the press release explains. "It encourages reflection and observation by eliminating all forms of intrusive assistance." Is this some kind of minimal-output HUD mode, perhaps? The term "plattering" makes me feel like I'm going to be eating other players for dinner. Which I guess would be an intriguing mechanic.</p>
<p>Oh hang on, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hell-is-us-wants-to-make-its-action-adventuring-more-old-school-than-elden-ring">spoke to Jacques-Belletête about player-plattering in 2022</a>. And yes, it appears to be about allowing players to navigate and explore with reference to things and people within the world, rather than forcing you to use a magic mapping tool or follow a breadcrumb trail.
</p>
<p>
We'll find out for sure on 4th September 2025. Always happy to see Eliax Toufexis in a starring role, simply because he has such overt Main Character Voice that it confuses and alarms me when I find him playing a side character in other games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>.

			<p>Over a year after its debut on PC, Shift Up's Stellar Blade will finally release on PC in a few months, alongside new DLC.</p>
<p>During yesterday's State of Play presentation, the Korean studio confirmed that the action game will launch on PC this June. Following the announcement, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/">Steam store page</a> also went live, but it sadly did not reveal any additional information on the PC version or the system requirements.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the PC version of Stellar Blade will be accompanied by the launch of a new GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE DLC, which, much like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-photo-mode/">NieR Automata DLC</a> released last year, will bring two different franchises together in an explosive collaboration. You can check out the new DLC in action in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade x Goddess of Victory - Nikke DLC Trailer | PS5 and PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2uKLuMd4S4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PlayStation 5 and will launch on PC this June. You can learn more about the excellent action game by Shift Up in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title, and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-has-sold-75-million-units-death-stranding-2-ghost-of-yotei-are-still-scheduled-for-a-2025-release.1108131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-sold-75-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 is doing great on the market and has sold an impressive number of units in the past quarter, bringing its total units sold well past the 60 million units point.</p>
<p>In Sony's latest financial report covering the third quarter of the current fiscal year, it has been confirmed that the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter to date in terms of sales, having sold 9.5 million units, bringing the total of units sold to 75 million. In terms of software sales, Sony reported 96 million units sold, a solid increase over the 89.7 million units sold during the third quarter of the previous fiscal year. Both hardware and software sales contributed to the record operating profits in the third quarter of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of user engagement, the PlayStation 5 is also doing quite well. 42% of new console purchases have come from new users, bringing the total number of active users to 129 million users, which Sony is looking to increase further by diversifying its lineup with family and live service games. Regarding new releases, it was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-q3-ond-fy3-2025-financial-results-hw-9-5m-sw-95m-ltd-75m.1107987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that both Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are still scheduled for a 2025 release, which is definitely reassuring, considering both did not make an appearance during yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">State of Play presentation.</a></p>
<p>The full detailed report, which goes over other Sony business segments besides PlayStation, can be found <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf">here.</a></p>

            <p>Ex Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-blasts-fake-lawsuits-against-us-and-riot-games-claiming-union-workers-used-harassment-claims-to-drum-up-members">recent comments on the Grit podcast</a> regarding "fake lawsuits" brought against Activision Blizzard around 2021 are "false", "insulting" to alleged victims, and "unsurprising", a spokesperson for the Communication Workers Of America (CWA) has told RPS.</p>
<p>Kotick appeared on venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins podcast earlier this week, alongside former EA CEO and current Kleiner Perkins advisor Bing Gordon. Discussing the above legal cases alongside petitions to remove him as CEO, Kotick spoke of "fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren't true," claiming his former company was "targeted" by the CWA in a bid to increase union membership.</p>

<p>"The claims Bobby Kotick presents in the podcast regarding the “fake lawsuits” are false," the CWA spokesperson told RPS in an emailed statement that includes links to past correspondence and reporting. "In 2021, Activision agreed to an $18 million dollar settlement with the EEOC following a lawsuit that Activision had sexually harassed and discriminated against its workforce. <a href="https://investor.activision.com/node/34481/pdf">Bobby Kotick himself apologized in his own press release</a> for the inappropriate conduct that happened under his watch."</p>
<p>"Alongside the settlement money, Activision also agreed to provide anti-harassment and anti-discrimination trainings, expand mental health counseling services to its workers, and provide victim-specific relief, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/court-approves-eeocs-18-million-settlement-activision-blizzard">EEOC’s release</a> on March 3, 2022."</p>
<p>"Subsequently, in 2023, <a href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/2023/12/15/civil-rights-department-announces-settlement-agreement-to-resolve-employment-discrimination-and-equal-pay-lawsuit-against-activision-blizzard/">Activision reached a $54 million dollar settlement</a> with the California Civil Rights Department (which was formerly known as the California State Department of Fair Employment and Housing, as Kotick references in the podcast) for discriminating against women in the workplace and for pay inequities."</p>
<p>For additional context: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-55m-to-settle-sex-discrimination-lawsuit">following the settlement</a>, the state department said that "no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations [of] systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard". In a comment made to RPS at the time, Activision Blizzard spokesperson added that "the CRD (previously DFEH) has acknowledged that no court or independent investigation substantiated any allegations that 'Activision Blizzard’s Board of Directors, including its Chief Executive Officer, Robert Kotick, acted improperly with regard to the handling of any instances of workplace misconduct.'” Kotick himself has denied any personal wrongdoing.</p>
<p>"Bobby Kotick’s comments on a podcast uplifting billionaires are both insulting to the Activision workers who <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-after-allegations-of-rampant-sexism/">spoke out about the harassment they faced</a> and unsurprising," the CWA say in their statement about Kotick's claims this week. "Fortunately for workers, Kotick is gone and thousands of workers have organized unions with CWA without intimidation or interference and now have a voice at work."</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">our interview on how the CWA helps developers unionise</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the CWA's comment to RPS, the ABK Worker's Alliance - a union made up of Activision Blizzard King employees - has <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1889787591056052523">responded publicly to Kotick's podcast allegations via social media</a>. "The trauma, discrimination, and abuse that our coworkers and former coworkers endured is not fake or a 'plan to drive union membership'," reads a tweet from last night. "Our unions were born from the very real and harmful way executives reacted when made aware of these situations."</p>
<p>"The executives of our company did not protect us, and often made the situation worse or directly perpetuated the harm," they continue. "That is why we decided to stand up for ourselves and make our company better, a place where we truly lived by our core values and looked out for one another."</p>
<p>"A common misinformation tactic used by companies during a union campaign is to assert that a union is a third party that comes in and makes changes," the ABK union statement goes on. "This is not true. The workers are the union."</p>
<p>"We are not a third party looking for companies to prey on. We are workers with a vested interest in making our company the best it can be."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/francesca-orsi-the-white-lotus-season-3-season-4-2025-drama-slate-1236285269/">Deadline</a>, HBO exec Francesca Orsi said the service doesn't currently have "a complete or final plan" when it comes to The Last of Us' duration, but said "it's looking like four seasons" for the adaption.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't want to confirm that, but it's looking like this season and then two more seasons after this and we're done," Orsi told the publication.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is in line with what showrunners Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have previously suggested.</p>
<p>In August 2023, Mazin confirmed the team would need more than one season to tell The Last of Us Part 2's narrative. When asked about how many seasons of The Last of Us he expected at that time, Mazin said: "It can end up being three or five. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">second season of The Last of Us is set to debut in April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>"The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you," Mazin said in June.</p>
<p>It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, however we do know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">it will feature a lot more infected than the first season</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of season two's debut, a The Last of Us panel has been confirmed for SXSW 2025. Panelists include Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmann, Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, Gabriel Luna, Kaitlyn Dever, Isabela Merced, and Young Mazino.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the showrunners revealed why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-isnt-as-muscular-as-part-2s-because-it-doesnt-play-as-big-of-a-role-in-this-version">actor Kaityln Dever did not have to bulk up for her role as Abby in the upcoming second season of The Last of Us</a>, despite her counterpart in Part 2 being known for her muscular physique.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/the-knightling-is-set-to-be-a-fantastical-shield-bearing-indie-hit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re looking for a cute, classic action-adventure, then going off the game’s demo, The Knightling should be high up on your list. Coming from developer Twirlbound, The Knightling sees you taking on the role of a rookie knight who, while waiting the return of his master Sir Lionstone, decides to try and do some good. Set in the realm of Clessia, which is bereft of a lead knight, it’s up to you to look after the populace. The only problem is that nobody takes you seriously because, well, you’re just a kid, and you don’t even have a sword. What kind of a knight doesn’t have a sword?</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling - Steam Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjOWFtKNGV4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Knightling has definitely taken a leaf out of Captain America’s comic book though, and he’s equipped with a massive shield that’s as good at offense as it is for defence. There’s the expected throwing and bouncing off things that Steve Rogers loves, but the Knightling can also use his shield as a makeshift sledge, hopping inside it and sliding down from great heights.</p>


<p>Captain America’s shield also doesn’t talk to you, or have a name. Magnustego – Magnus for short – is a legendary magical shield who gives you tips and hints as you go along, or berates you for using him in an unshield-ly way, and he’s a constant companion through The Knightlings adventure. You can upgrade him along the way, increasing the strength of your attacks or adding new moves to your repertoire.</p>


<p>The Knightling is a cheery soul, if a little perturbed that no one thinks they’re going to be able to do much, at least here in the demo. He’s thoughtful though, and keen to help, ingratiating himself with the townsfolk by helping them out with small-scale issues. There’s definitely echoes of Ocarina of Time here, just in the cheerful, colourful do-gooding and the playful music that bops along in the background.</p>
<p>Combat is fast and cute, smashing monsters with your shield before unleashing a huge special attack when you’ve charged the gauge. Healing is performed by snacking on whatever food you’ve been able to nab, pulling up carrots from the ground being the first of these, restocking the healing gauge, which you can then use when you’re in need. It feels pretty generous – this is not a Soulslike – but there’s still danger lurking from the monsters that roam the land.</p>
<p>You earn praise for everything you do, including, it seems, jumping to the top of houses and high vantage points. If anyone has played the Crackdown series they’ll know how satisfying and strangely moreish this, so I’m hoping it’s something that continues to appear throughout, pushing you to climb and jump higher and higher. There are some pretty tricky platforming sections just in this early section, and I can see things ramping up as you progress further and further into the game’s open world.</p>

<p>I love the look of The Knightling. It’s clear, it’s characterful and there’s just something adorable about the Knightling’s big eyes and the chunky world. The audio definitely helps with the atmosphere too, from the mumbled words everyone utters to the ebbs and peaks of the orchestral soundtrack. It creates a fantastical world with an economy of design that’s refreshing, but it’s nonetheless utterly beguiling, despite the simplicity.</p>
<p>I am massively excited to play more of The Knightling – it’s light-hearted, action packed, and full of character, and a change in pace to the glossy Unreal Engine 5 open worlds elsewhere. This gorgeous landscape is also yours to explore, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">a demo available on Steam right now</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one, as it looks like it could be one of this year’s sleeper hits when it comes to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>

But where does that leave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Rockstar parent company Take-Two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">reiterated GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window</a>, but now we know Borderlands 4 is out in September, there’s no chance GTA 6 will be out the same month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when? October? November? December 2025? All seem up for grabs now for GTA 6. The risk of course is that Take-Two ends up cannibalizing its big 2025 games by releasing them too close together. And let’s not forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think">Mafia: The Old Country launches at some point summer 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Take-Two’s big games, and by that we really mean GTA 6, end up doing more harm to each other than good by releasing too close to each other? That’s a question we put to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in an interview ahead of the company's third quarter financial results. As you’d expect, Zelnick said Take-Two is planning its releases to avoid a risk of cannibalization, insisting the timing is driven by a desire to “respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, I think we will plan the releases so as not to have that be a problem,” Zelnick said. “And what we found is when you're giving consumers hits, they tend to be interested in pursuing other hits. In other words, I've said this many times, even when the hits aren't ours, they're a good thing for the industry. In this case, we hope that the hits will largely be ours. So we feel really good about it and I think that we will time our releases so as to respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the context of Borderlands 4’s just-announced September release date, when might GTA 6 come out? If Take-Two wants Borderlands 4 fans to spent “a lot of time” playing before moving on to, say, GTA 6, how long is a lot of time? One month? Two months? Three?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this speculation is of course the prospect that GTA 6 will be delayed either into early winter, or at some point in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar would hit fall 2025 for GTA 6. "So we feel really good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Borderlands 4, Zelnick insisted the brand remains “really strong” despite the disastrous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/borderlands-the-movie">Borderlands movie</a>, which bombed at the box office and was mauled by critics and fans alike. In fact, Zelnick said that the movie’s failure won’t impact the potential success of Borderlands 4 at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's no secret that the movie was a disappointment, but interestingly, it really benefited our catalog sales,” Zelnick explained. “So actually the effect was quite positive. It would've assumed been more positive if the movie had been better received. But the brand is really strong. We feel great about Borderlands 4.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach may not have featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>, but news on the game is expected soon.</p>
<p>On 9th March, director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> will speak at a special panel event on the game at South by Southwest (SXSW), sharing new details. Could we finally get a release date?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1WtK_6q2P4">YouTube stream</a> for the event is already published, with the description stating the game will arrive "exclusively on PlayStation 5 later this year". That mirrors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">Sony's latest financial report</a>, which also confirms a 2025 release.</p>

<p>SXSW "celebrates the convergence of tech, film, music, education, and culture", so is a fitting setting for Kojima's next game.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kojima's brand and that of his games is enough to star in a standalone panel event, away from Sony's own State of Play.</p>
<p>Footage of the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">first shared at a Sony event</a>, though, back in January last year. This was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">Death Stranding 2 panel at the Tokyo Game Show</a> in September.</p>
<p>Since then, further details are eagerly anticipated - especially the release date.</p>
<p>Kojima has certainly been very active recently on social media, sharing posts suggesting he's busy working on a trailer for... something.</p>
<p>He also admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">Kojima Productions has entered "crunch time"</a>, as Death Stranding 2 nears completion.</p>
<p>"At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", he wrote. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life, but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock."</p>
<p>After Death Stranding 2, Kojima has the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Microsoft-backed OD</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">Metal Gear Solid spiritual successor Physint</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Tides of Annihilation was another new game announced during the State of Play, and it is an action title set in a ruined London. In this reality, London was destroyed by an invasion originating from another world, taking out everyone except main character Gwendolyn. She is on a mission to find and save her family, using the power of spectral knights to take on foes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ3fDz_xCio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Tides of Annihilation, the spectral knights and enemies are all based off of Arthurian mythology. Each of the ten knights have their own unique powers that Gwendolyn can use to in her battles. London will also undergo changes as you explore, switching between Medieval and modern timelines, looking for grail shards to figure out how this invasion occurred. As you wander, you will see Colossal Knights walking around too, and they are not just part scenery but an additional challenge to take on. Developer Eclipse Game Studio also confirmed that those with a PS5 Pro will have access to an exclusive Enhanced mode that adds <em>“higher resolution, ray tracing, improved image fidelity, and smoother 60fps gameplay.”</em></p>
<p>A release date for Tides of Annihilation is yet to be confirmed, but it will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>During today’s earnings call, Sony revealed that the PS5 has sold over 75 units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> today, the gaming and network services segment was the highlight of the show. PS5 crossed the 75 million milestone by selling 9.5 million units in Q4. PlayStation Networks’ monthly active users were up, too, increasing from 118 million in FY23 Q3 to 129 million in FY24 Q3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s not all; PS5 and PS4 topped 95.9 million units sold in software, gaining a 6.2 million increase from last year’s 89.7 million. During this time, 11.6 million units of first-party games were sold, which decreased from 12.3 million last year. Moreover, out of the 95.9 million, 74% were full-game digital software downloads, down from last year’s 77%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to PlayStation 5’s growing sales, the current-generation console is just 1.5 million units behind the PS4 in outselling it during the same period. The console manufacturer believes that this number will only increase with the release of first-party games like Ghost of Yotei and third-party games like GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> is coming to PlayStation 5 with Pro and VRR support on April 25. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here’s everything that was announced</a> during PlayStation’s State of Play event yesterday. What are your thoughts on the PS5 selling over 75 million units?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

We interrupt our regular schedule of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-developers-warn-fans-to-watch-out-for-a-fraudulent-playtest">fish puns</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-is-powerwash-simulator-for-holes">naughty jokes about holes</a> to warn you that a huge chunk of celestial debris <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/2025/02/07/nasa-continues-to-monitor-orbit-of-near-earth-asteroid-2024-yr4/">has a 2.3% chance of impacting Earth in December 2032</a> and wiping out the city of Bradford. I name Bradford because it’s the first city that occurs to me and also, because several of my ancient enemies live there, but the asteroid could hit anywhere. Where do you live? Maybe wear a hard hat when you go Xmas shopping in 2032. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_YR4">Asteroid 2024 YR4</a> loiters somewhere along our planet’s orbital trajectory, like a rake in the grass.
</p>
<p>
If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool <a href="https://neal.fun/asteroid-launcher/">Asteroid Launcher</a>, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
YR24 is said to be 130-300 feet across, and is made of stone. Let’s split the difference and say it’s 215 feet across, or a few short of 70 metres. According to Asteroid Launcher, if a 70 metre wide stone asteroid were to explode in the atmosphere 2.4 kilometres above my flat*, while travelling at 17 kilometres a second, the devastation would be catastrophic. The resulting 211 decibel shockwave would totally obliterate my favourite chippie down the road. My local Cafe Neros at the bottom of the hill would experience winds faster than the storms on Jupiter. My favourite curry shop in London would likely be levelled, which I guess is fine because I think they’re planning to move anyway. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds unbearable, but it could be worse. My favourite London takeaway joint would fall slightly outside the blast radius, and people eating in my favourite vegan pizza place might not even glance up from their Pepper-no-nis. Curiously, if the asteroid were 30 metres bigger, big enough to make landfall, the area-of-effect would apparently be smaller and the casualties, fewer, give or take a few extra from earthquakes. I can’t remotely speak to the accuracy of whatever science Asteroid Launcher runs on. I’m fairly sure it’s not a standard reporting tool at any major space agency. If it is, we have more immediate problems to worry about than YR24.
</p>
<p>
What drives somebody to read about an extremely unlikely asteroid impact and immediately load up a free browser game in order to simulate their own destruction? I don’t know, but it’s an instinct that informs a lot of video games. Patient zero could be the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>. We’ve all had that moment in SimCity, right, when the infrastructure is humming and all your residential, industrial and commercial zones are in perfect equilibrium, and a rasping voice in your ear says “Screw it – die, you pack of filthy little law-abiding conformists”, and you push the Godzilla button.</p>
<p>It’s the same nihilism that flowers within my spleen when I read the label on a bottle of shower gel made by a company that whimsically declares its boss to be “Nature”. Video games are great at venting such feelings, which is perhaps less constructive when it means, say, dissipating pent-up anguish about climate change, but surely forgiveable enough when it comes to the fickle motions of marauding space rocks.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you need a pick-me-up after reading all that, I recommend sumptuous planet-nurser <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reus-2">Reus 2</a>. Oh look, it was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1875060/view/499436070246548643?l=english">recently updated</a>! With a selection of… natural disasters.

            <p>The flash flood of marketing that poured forth from PlayStation's State Of Play last night splashes wetly upon we PC players too. Among the teasers and crossover announcements, 2K revealed the release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in a short 'n' shooty trailer. I'm not a big fan of this long-running looter shooter. But in showing us its release date Take-Two have given us an indication of when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will <em>not</em> release. And that's mildly interesting.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 is coming out September 23rd, as celebrated by the maniacally cackling mascot at the end of the trailer. The lootsy shootsy was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-looks-ready-to-drop-the-hottest-memes-of-2011-in-first-look-trailer">announced shortly before Christmas</a> last year, and will have the usual 4-player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, random weapons, and sense of "humour". This time your team of lootbox addicts will be battling "the oppressive Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high."</p>
<p>So, Borderlands again. Still, there's a fun bit of obvious deduction to glean here. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick reassured shareholders in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">an earnings call</a> last week that the company was confident they were giving enough space to their big releases. That's to be expected, publishers like to space out their games for maximum sales. All of which suggests GTA 6 probably won't hit the shelves in September. Or at least the weeks around Borderlands 4 will be a big buffer zone. Zelnick himself has twice confirmed the open world crim sim is on-target for an autumn 2025 release. </p>
<p>It's fun to speculate that the other big games of the season are playing "release date chicken" because of Grand Theft Auto 6, which still hasn't announced when it will arrive to nuke all the other games released that week from orbit. But studios can always reschedule once they see it coming, and some game buyers don't care about GTA at all. Still, it feels like Take-Two has eliminated at least a couple of possible weeks from the guessing game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Activision Blizzard staff have hit back at the eyebrow-raising claim made this week by former boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bobby-kotick-says-activision-blizzard-fake-lawsuits-were-simply-a-union-plan-to-drive-up-membership">the company's harassment lawsuits - and an employee petition seeking the CEO's removal - were "fake"</a>.
</p>
<p>
The high-profile ABetterABK workers group, which spearheaded much of the company's employee activism at the time, <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1889787591056052523">responded to Eurogamer's coverage of Kotick's comments via social media last night</a> and stated that "the executives of our company did not protect us, and often made the situation worse or directly perpetuated the harm".
</p>
<p>
"The trauma, discrimination, and abuse that our coworkers and former coworkers endured is not fake or a 'plan to drive union membership'," the group stated. "Our unions were born from the very real and harmful way executives reacted when made aware of these situations."
</p>
<p>
Speaking via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo&amp;ab_channel=KleinerPerkins">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick had suggested the legal action Activision Blizzard had faced under his tenure, from multiple US government agencies, had been a "plan" by the Communication Workers of America (CWA) union to drive up membership.
</p>
<p>
"A common misinformation tactic used by companies during a union campaign is to assert that a union is a third party that comes in and makes changes," ABetterABK's statement continued. "This is not true. The workers are the union.
</p>
<p>
"We are not a third party looking for companies to prey on. We are workers with a vested interest in making our company the best it can be."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/judge-prepared-to-approve-activision-blizzards-usd18m-sexual-harassment-settlement-with-eeoc">Activision Blizzard ultimately settled</a> all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-settles-sex-discrimination-lawsuit-for-44m">of the legal action</a> - meaning payouts to staff who faced harassment at the company, and no evidence of systemic patterns of employee abuse ever proven in court.
</p>
<p>
Valentine Powell, a former senior UI engineer who led several employee walkouts, additionally responded with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/valentineirl.bsky.social/post/3lhziyzv2oo2j">lengthy social media thread</a> commenting on Kotick's comments, and sharing their perspective on life at the company.
</p>
<p>
"During my time at Blizzard I was loud and I was vocal about the issues facing our company, I helped spearhead multiple initiatives to remove systemic tools of harm, and I worked with the newly hired DE&amp;I crew to help form several ERGs, set up our first attendance at Pride, and the Inclusion Nexus," Powell wrote.
</p>
<p>
"There were money barriers, there were political barriers, there were bad actors, basically we were only allowed to make small changes, and most of us knew we needed large ones. One of my first forrays into collective bargaining at Blizzard was the salary spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
"This was years before unionisation was ever discussed," Powell continued. "We gathered a list of about 50 ways people wanted to improve salary and promotions, and refined that list down to 10 bullets with the help of over 100 employees across Blizzard. We presented our list, and were told by leadership 'no'.
</p>
<p>
"We didn't discuss unionisation as a team until months after our first walkouts. We wanted to try to bring light to what was happening and try to fix it ourselves if we could. The first two walkouts were entirely employee run. It was terrifying and amazing and beautiful.
</p>
<p>
"After a couple months of us being loud, Activision Blizzard stopped being nice about it, especially Kotick. I was The One who started the petition to remove Bobby Kotick as CEO. I was the first name on the list, and that petition had nothing to do with CWA."
</p>
<p>
Powell concluded by noting that the CWA had offered support regardless of whether staff were part of the union or not - or whether they would ever join.
</p>
<p>
"Bobby Kotick is trying to paint a false narrative, but its unsurprising," Powell wrote, "he refused to listen to us for years when we tried to handle this stuff without unionisation, and only listened once we actually started unionising."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Kotick claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-activision-blizzard-takeover-sparked-by-both-companies-failing-to-buy-tiktok-kotick-says">Microsoft's Activision Blizzard takeover was sparked by both companies failing to buy TikTok</a>.

            <p>Sales of Sony's PS5 console have now reached 75m units, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>
<p>By the end of the previous quarter, PS5 sales had passed 65m. Now, in the latest quarter (ending 31st December 2024), Sony has sold a further 9.5m consoles - the console's best ever quarter.</p>
<p>Overall sales of games and consoles have increased by 16 percent year-on-year, with profits similarly increasing by 37 percent.</p>

<p>Sony attributes these increases to an increase in available units, a boost in non-first-party games (and DLC), and an increase in sales from network services.</p>
<p>The number of monthly active users on PlayStation Network was 129m in the last quarter - that's a record high, and a 43 percent increase from December 2017.</p>
<p>What's more, 42 percent of PS5 purchasers in the last quarter were new PlayStation Network users, thereby showing an increase in the overall userbase.</p>
<p>PS Plus revenue also increased by 20 percent year-on-year, which the company attributed to users moving to higher tiers. Digital game sales have also increased: 74 percent of game sales this year, compared with 66 percent last year.</p>
<p>Sony also released the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in this last quarter, and while it hasn't separated console sales in this report, this has likely contributed to the boost in hardware sales.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> was a strong release for Sony in this last quarter - it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">previously stated 1.5m sales in its first month</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has also been an ongoing success for Sony in 2024. That compares to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> in 2023's equivalent period as the company's most prominent release.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sony confirmed that both Ghost of Yotei and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On the Beach are still on schedule to release this year. Neither game showed up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
