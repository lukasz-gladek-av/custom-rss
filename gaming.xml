            <p>
THQ Nordic have announced The Eternal Life Of Goldman, a new hand-drawn platformer from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/this-is-the-police">This Is The Police</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollywood-animal">Hollywood Animal</a> devs Weappy. I caught a brief presentation earlier in the week and yeah, this seems promising. On the one hand, it reminds me of cheery 16-bit hop 'n' boppers like, say, the Mega Drive adaptation of Disney's Aladdin. On the other, it makes me think of side-scrolling Soulslikes (Scroulslikes?) such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> and the frantic worldbuilding of Rick &amp; Morty.

<p>
The Eternal Life Of Goldman takes place in a sickly colonial fantasy world, made up of layer upon layer of beautiful/awful animated backdrop and foreground, all of it painstakingly drawn frame by frame (the devs have explicitly ruled out using generative AI). The setting and menagerie borrow from ancient Greek, Jewish and Mesopotamian folklore, while the narrative is sort of one big meditation on mortality, which certainly takes many forms in the game.
</p>
<p>
You play the Goldman of the title, a tenacious old adventurer with a cane. The cane can be upgraded with Metroid-esque gadgets such as a laser pointer, and Goldman has some kind of AOE singing ability that reminds me of chanting in Abe's Odyssey. It's a precision platformer, though less fiddly than the likes of Super Meat Boy, and Weappy hope to reward exploration of the world without relying on backtracking.
</p>
<p>
There's a sense of winning nastiness to the moving parts. For example, there are screeching apes in cages you can drag around to serve as platforms. There are possibly-organic, grinning balloons you can latch onto during platforming sequences, yanking their faces downward into a frown. The balloons remind me of Mega Drive Aladdin's Cave Of Wonders, where you'd climb and scamper over bits of free-floating Genie anatomy. There are also accordion structures of wood and cloth that can be pulled out to create routes. This last flourish isn't all that nasty, on paper - it ought to be charming, a piece of whimsical stagecraft. But it feels somewhat grisly in the context of so much brutality, like you're tugging on a flap of skin. 
</p>
<p>
From the looks of the trailer, the further you go, the more openly dreadful the landscape becomes. There are steampunk cities with clanking robot enforcers, and a boss that consists of a three-headed, screaming gargoyle woman with serrated fangs and a lungful of fireballs. Speaking as a critic who is obstinately prone to detecting horror themes in the cosiest of games, I am enthused. There's no release date yet, but you can learn more about The Eternal Life Of Goldman on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/">Steam</a>.

Yet, here we are, a full trip around the sun since the RPG left early access and was finally unleashed on the world. For the studio and RPG fans looking for something to scratch that nagging BioWare itch, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>could not have gone better. Let’s look back at the last year and recount our journey through Faerûn.</p><p>It’s ironic that <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, which has been largely considered one of the most important games of last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-pc-release-date-ps5-delay-starfield-1850588759&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-pc-release-date-ps5-delay-starfield-1850588759">got its August 3 release date</a></span> because it was trying to avoid other, presumably “bigger” games.

Microsoft typically requires games on Xbox Series X and S to have feature parity, which means games have to support all the same features between systems.. But it made an exception for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, as the weaker console doesn’t include split-screen co-op, which kept the Xbox version in development longer than other systems as Larian attempted to circumvent technical limitations. It’s not often that a game leads the zeitgeist to the point that it gets to be the exception to a longstanding rule.<br></p><p>And while those awards are a testament to what Larian was able to accomplish with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, its characters will outlive all the sales and glamorous awards in the hearts of its fans.

Because it’s a mix between an RPG and an immersive sim in an attempt = to recreate the improvisation of a tabletop game, players were finding creative ways to break it and accomplish things they’re not supposed to do. One example is a patch that allowed players to recruit party member Minthara, who was originally only available to those who played an evil run and contributed to the eradication of an encampment of Tieflings. While some fans managed to recruit her on good playthroughs, Larian <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-minthara-patch-5-update-1851061745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-minthara-patch-5-update-1851061745">patched in an official way to pull this off</a></span>. Sure, fans were grateful to get to see one of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s most compelling characters without having to do morally reprehensible things, but does that not undermine the whole choice and consequence of it all?</p><figure id="" data-id="9bfb017ee18580b1a67fd58794657683" data-recommend-id="image://9bfb017ee18580b1a67fd58794657683" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Baldur's Gate 3 cast raises a toast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Baldur's Gate 3 cast raises a toast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9bfb017ee18580b1a67fd58794657683" data-recommend-id="image://9bfb017ee18580b1a67fd58794657683" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Baldur's Gate 3 cast raises a toast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The new epilogue, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-new-ending-epilogue-patch-5-1851063292&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-new-ending-epilogue-patch-5-1851063292">which I did enjoy</a></span>, is another example of this. While it recognizes choices you’ve made, it also can feel like it coddles the player and assures them that everything turned out okay no matter what they did. There are some devastating choices you can make for the game’s party, and the new epilogue does its damndest to make you feel good about what you’ve done. It’s the same trap <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><em>Mass Effect 3 </em>fell into in 2012</a></span> when its <em>Extended Cut </em>DLC added new clarity and exposition to the game’s ending, while also bending over backwards to make sure players felt unambiguously good about the galaxy-altering decisions they made.<br></p><p>At times, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>felt beholden to its audience’s love for it, and as such it backed down from hard decisions in favor of fandom gimmes.

As such, it will no doubt be a comparison point for RPGs in terms of reactivity, writing, and polish. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-baldurs-gate-3-comparison-better-1851535955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-baldurs-gate-3-comparison-better-1851535955">It’s already happening</a></span> as BioWare nears the launch of the next <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206"><em>Dragon Age</em></a></span>, and now a series that undoubtedly influenced <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>is going to be compared to a game that lit the world on fire only a short year prior.</p><p>It would be easy for Larian Studios to rest on its laurels and churn out another <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> game, but the studio seems <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964">well and done with Faerûn</a></span>. Hasbro, who owns the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> brand, is apparently looking for a new partner to bank on the name, and Larian has its sights set elsewhere.

One of the projects is still so early that Larian CEO Swen Vincke described it as “ideas” and “fragments,” and promised that the studio is making a concerted effort not to fall into a rut of producing only sequels for a big franchise, which is more than many other studios can claim.</p><figure id="" data-id="42d49477b78de2bf2352b9357e1b1401" data-recommend-id="image://42d49477b78de2bf2352b9357e1b1401" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gale proposes to Shep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gale proposes to Shep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42d49477b78de2bf2352b9357e1b1401" data-recommend-id="image://42d49477b78de2bf2352b9357e1b1401" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gale proposes to Shep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When it launched, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>was the centerpiece in conversations about how the games industry had forgotten how to package a single-player game. It harkens back to a time when games weren’t riddled with microtransactions and battle passes, while also illustrating why developers stuck in established publisher and shareholder relationships aren’t able to deliver this kind of game in the modern market. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>was a seismic shift for the genre, and for the industry, and Larian is walking away from it to do something different is a bolder step than most of the video game industry is willing to make. Here’s hoping its success and lasting legacy is a harbinger of what’s to come, rather than a flash in the pan for us to ponder as we think of better days.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, Bungie is no longer planning to release  “regular paid expansions” for the game. Sales of each expansion have continued to fall year over year, leading to a change in approach. Instead of the larger expansions, Bungie will do more smaller-scale updates. These updates, Schreier said, will be released for free and  coming with “overhauls to activities that it hopes will appeal to hardcore players.”</p>



<p>“Other vague plans for the future include a storyline that will feature characters and worlds that&nbsp;Destiny&nbsp;has not yet explored,” the report adds.</p>



<p>As far as another Destiny game, namely Destiny 3, that’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/project-payback-cancelled-destiny-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still not in the works</a>. The game is not, nor has it ever, been in development.  Instead of a new Destiny, Bungie wants to make Destiny 2 a more attractive game for players.</p>



<p>“Bungie is instead looking to create a smoother onboarding process for&nbsp;Destiny 2, such as a rebranding, to attract new players who might be turned off by a game that can now feel impenetrable to those unfamiliar with its ample proper nouns.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out Bungie for comment on the report, but that request was not answered.</p>

It takes the genre at an unusual angle and offers something unexpected at every turn.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You arrive at the Archipelago on a strange mission: to kill the Deity, a mystical creature that everyone talks about, but no one has seen. To find the Deity, you will have to delve deep into the many secrets these islands keep. You will discover a place marked by tragedy, and filled with eccentric characters and remarkable contrasts.</p><p>Upgrade your cane with new parts and unlock new abilities, to explore the hidden corners of the Archipelago and face incredible creatures.</p><p><strong>Hand Crafted to the Smallest Detail</strong></p><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> is the result of years of work by people who love and appreciate the same cartoons, comics and games that you do. We wanted to make an uncompromising 2D game of amazing beauty, so we went back to the genre’s roots and took the most difficult path possible – meticulously drawn, colored and animated by hand using classic frame-by-frame techniques. We didn’t cut any corners, and the results are worth it. In <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em>, no two rooms or landscapes are alike. Every place, every object, every character, every visual effect — everything is carefully planned and executed to the finest detail.</p><p>Remember how, when you were a child, you first saw your first 16-bit platformer and couldn’t believe your eyes? We want you to experience those feelings again—or maybe for the first time.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_902566"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Tapping the Best of the Genre</strong></p><p>Far from mindlessly relying on cliché and formula, <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> turns the genre on its head. The game carefully includes everything we all love most about side-scrollers, across the various styles, trends and eras. And it leaves out all the frustrating stuff that doesn’t make sense and wastes time.</p><p>It’s a challenging platformer that demands precision, but it never devolves into a grueling exercise where you have to memorize and methodically execute an exact sequence of <a title="Genres > Action [2,046 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. The key to success is improvisation and ingenuity.</p><p>It’s a game that encourages exploration and will give you a sense of discovery—but it won’t have you backtracking in confusion after you gain each new ability or artifact. It’s impossible to spend much time wandering around in <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> without doing anything interesting.</p><p>Finally, it’s a game with complex scenes, robust characters and a multi-layered story—but it never gets bogged down in thoughtful poses and feigned pretension. All the elements work to create an adventure that takes your breath away and breaks your heart.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p>NZXT, which sells gaming PCs, components, and peripherals, has a subscription <a href="https://nzxt.com/collection/flex">program</a> that charges a monthly fee to rent one of its gaming desktops. Subscribers don't own the computers and receive an upgraded rental system every two years.</p>
<p>NZXT's Flex program subscription prices range from $49 to $169 per month, depending on the specs of the system, as you can see below:</p>

<p>There's also a one-time setup and shipping fee for the rentals that totals $50. NZXT says it will "likely" charge subscribers a separate fee if they return the rental without the original box and packaging (NZXT hasn't disclosed how much).</p>
<p>The systems received, per NZXT's website, will be "new or like-new." Users may get refurbished systems and should check their rental for any defects, per <a href="https://fragile.co/legal/subscription-agreement">subscription agreement</a> terms from Fragile, which helps manage the subscription service.</p>
<p>NZXT says subscribers get 24/7 customer support with their subscription. The Irvine, California-headquartered company also says that there are no cancellation fees, and subscribers get a prepaid return label with their rental system. As noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211490/nzxt-flex-desktop-gaming-pc-rental-service-subscription-nvidia-gpu-games">The Verge</a>, NZXT started promoting Flex as early as February; it's unclear how much interest it has garnered.</p>
<p>Per the subscription agreement, users can be charged the full retail value of the system if it's returned damaged or altered (self-upgrades/repairs have limits) and monthly interest rates of 8 percent if they stop paying the monthly fee for over 60 days.</p>
<h2>Who’s this for?</h2>
<p>In an announcement Wednesday, NZXT looked to frame Flex as a way to make PC gaming more accessible and highlighted&nbsp;use cases where it thinks rental PCs make sense.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>In a shared statement, the CEO of esports team FlyQuest suggested there’s a place for rental PCs in esports, which often relies on expensive gear delivered through sponsorships. In a statement, Brian Anderson said: "New hardware is being released frequently, and having access to industry-leading products is vital to staying competitive. NZXT Flex provides us with the confidence that we’ll always have access to the top-of-the-line builds so that we can create content and play at our highest level for our fans.”</p>
<p>The announcement also highlights a supposed customer who said the program let them immediately get a gaming PC that they can't afford. The program also targets people who only need a high-end PC for a short period or who want easy biennial upgrades.</p>
<p>But for most, rental PCs don't make much fiscal sense long-term, as monthly fees add up over time. For example, the cheapest plan would cost $758 the first year (including the setup/shipping fee), which is more than various prebuilt gaming PCs and DIY builds.</p>
<p>Subscribers also don't own the computer. They can get an upgraded system after two years, but in that time, they will have spent $1,466 to $4,106 for hardware that they don't own. Meanwhile, $1,466 to $4,106 could fetch a quality PC that you could own and continue getting value from beyond two years.</p>
<p>Flex also competes with PC rental programs from companies like Rent-A-Center and Aaron's that let people rent to own.&nbsp;A few months ago, an NZXT representative <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NZXT/comments/18igfsz/comment/ks8jj3a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">confirmed</a> via Reddit that Flex isn't a rent-to-own program. The rep said&nbsp;that computer buyouts could be allowed but that only a portion of rental payments would apply to the purchase.</p>
<p>Those seeking immediate PC gaming gratification with limited funds also have options in payment plans/financing, used systems, and cloud gaming—all of which have drawbacks but let you compute and play games with hardware that you own.</p>
<p>Recently, more tech brands have been showing interest in trying to draw subscription dollars from consumer gadgets that typically only net a one-time profit. HP, for example, has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/hp-wants-you-to-pay-up-to-36-month-to-rent-a-printer-that-it-monitors/">printer rental program</a> where you pay to use a printer that you don't own and that HP tracks. Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber also recently discussed interest in selling a<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/logitech-has-an-idea-for-a-forever-mouse-thatrequires-a-subscription/"> "forever mouse"</a> that people would own but requires a subscription to receive ongoing software updates.</p>

                <p>During today's THQ Showcase, Wreckfest 2 was officially confirmed with a stylish new trailer that was light on details but heavy on road rage. Surprisingly, it mixed in a few tender moments between bouts of vehicular carnage, as a driver lamented about the state his car was in after he'd taken it out for a quick destruction-derby ride and "overreacted" a bit on the track.</p><p>Wreckfest was a smashing success for THQ Nordic when it first came out several years ago, with the game being hailed as a spiritual successor to the FlatOut and Burnout series of games. Wreckfest spent four years in early access on PC before it received a full release in 2018, with PS4 and Xbox One versions arriving a year later.</p>

<p>The original game featured a fine balance of precision driving, strategy, and treating your car like a battering ram when all other options had been exhausted, and it looks like those elements will be present in Wreckfest 2 as well. Platforms and a release date have not yet been confirmed for Wreckfest 2.</p><p>The THQ Showcase was a short-but-sweet look at several upcoming games from the publisher, </p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Payback was canceled two months ago, according to the report, and the majority of Bungie is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>, a reboot of an old Bungie IP from the 90s reimagined as an extraction shooter. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-revival-of-pre-halo-sci-fi-series-marathon/1100-6514533/" data-ref-id="1100-6514533">Marathon reboot was officially announced last year</a> and is now said to be aiming for a 2025 release. As noted by Bloomberg, Payback was not Destiny 3, which has never been in development.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the studio is still working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> as well, though Bungie is said to be moving away from annual expansion releases. Instead, it will focus on free content updates while also attempting to create a smoother onboarding process for new players, as well as a possible rebranding.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the second round of layoffs to hit Bungie recently following Sony's acquisition of the studio in 2022. Late last year, around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-marathon-reportedly-delayed-as-bungie-lays-off-staff/1100-6518763/" data-ref-id="1100-6518763">100 Bungie developers were let go and Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion and Marathon were both delayed</a> as a result. Bungie CEO Pete Parsons at the time said the company had missed its revenue targets by 45% and was losing money.</p><p dir="ltr">He said much the same in a blog post announcing the most recent round of layoffs, stating the developer was "overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red." The layoffs were already in the works, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, prior to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">positive critical reception and release of The Final Shape</a> in June.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the layoffs, multiple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/" data-ref-id="1100-6525488">Bungie veterans, including Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy</a>, have departed Bungie this week, parted ways with the developer this week. Around 155 other Bungie developers will be absorbed into Sony Interactive Entertainment, while yet another group of Bungie employees will be spun out to create an entirely new studio under Sony.</p>

The action game is an on-rails shooter in which you take on the role of the titular <em>Killer7</em>, seven assassins working for the U.S. government. All seven killers are different personas of the main character, an old man in a wheelchair, that are physically manifested from his mind. If that sounds weird, well, it isn’t even the beginning.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/get-early-access-to-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-with-ee<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Pre-orders are available now.</h2></div><section><p>The next instalment in the long-running Call of Duty series has been revealed — Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The June Xbox Showcase and Black Ops 6 Direct gave us a deeper look into the upcoming title, with new details on the story and gameplay features never before seen in the series.</p><p>One of the most talked about features is Omnimovement, Black Ops 6’s new movement system which allows players to sprint, dive, and slide in any direction and chain together combat moves. Omnimovement will be present in multiplayer, campaign, and zombies, fundamentally changing gameplay across all modes.</p><p>The campaign takes place in the early ’90s, around the time of the Gulf War and the fall of the Soviet Union. It will see the return of some familiar faces with several new characters added to the crew. During the Black Ops 6 Direct, developers voiced how they focused on mixing things up with a wide range of mission types, varying from storming a palace to planning a bank heist. So, fans can expect locations and mission requirements to keep them on their toes.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will release on October 25, but you can experience the game early by playing the Open Beta. The early access to the beta will be taking place August 30⁠–September 4, and you can get involved in one of three ways: 1) By pre-ordering the game, 2) With a qualifying Game Pass subscription, or 3) Through a special offer from EE.</p><p>EE recently announced a partnership with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 that will allow 150,000 fans to access the Open Beta without needing to pre-order or have a Game Pass subscription. It’s available to any EE customer, including new customers who sign up. All you need to do is log in to the EE website or create a new EE ID before August 29, then go to <a href="https://ee.co.uk/gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>https://ee.co.uk/gaming</u></a> to register your details.</p><p>EE also has <a href="https://store.ee.co.uk/gaming/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6?ReferrerID=EE01&amp;utm_source=eecouk&amp;utm_medium=online&amp;utm_campaign=codbo6_eecouk&amp;utm_content=EE01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pre-orders available now</u></a> for physical versions on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and offer the ability to pay in three interest-free payments. If you pre-order a physical version, you’ll get an email with a code that will grant you access to the beta once it’s live.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/02/ee-cod-black-ops-6-post-helen-project-2-07-24-final-1722615368373.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Alternatively, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members will automatically have access to the beta, as well as the full release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on day one. They can also pre-install the game, and seeing that it is lining up to be a hefty download requiring a lot of hard drive space, this can help you get into the action as soon as possible.</p><p>If you’re looking to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you can get it for £12, cheaper than anywhere else, with the EE app. You don’t have to be an existing customer — all you need to do is download the app and sign up for an EE ID, with no other purchase or contract required. </p><p>The Xbox Showcase also revealed new flavours of digital-only consoles — including 1TB Robot White versions of the Series S and Series X. EE will have both available when they launch this holiday season, and pre-orders will open soon.</p><p>To stay up to date on pre-order info and upcoming releases, you can<a href="https://ee.co.uk/new-at-ee#register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> sign-up to receive updates </u></a>from EE. You can curate your notifications to focus on particular consoles or brands, so you only get info related to things you care about. All it takes is a few moments, and you won’t have to worry about missing any big game launches again.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The first issue of Game Informer launched in 1991 during the 16-bit era, and it has been one of the longest-running video game magazines. But now, its time has come to an end as Game Informer's parent company, GameStop, has shut down the magazine after 33 years. The outlet's official account on X quickly shared the news with a farewell message to readers.</p><p>"After 33 thrilling years of bringing you the latest news, reviews, and insights from the ever-evolving world of gaming, it is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of Game Informer...

The employees were informed that they were being laid off immediately with severance pay. Former Game Informer content director (and former GameSpot editor) Kyle Hilliard also shared the news on X and noted that the final issue was unfinished when the order to stop came down.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/KyleMHilliard/status/1819403288980132298" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Game Informer has been closed down by GameStop and the entire, incredibly talented staff (including myself) have all been laid off.

			<p>It's shaping up to be a busy year for Dead by Daylight, as they have plenty of updates to share over the coming months. Behavior Interactive has shared its 2024 roadmap for <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight in a new post on X</a>, covering all updates players can expect to see throughout the year. This roadmap takes players up to November 2024</p>
<p>August is looking to be the busiest month of the year for the dev team. Dead by Daylight will receive ten new updates this month, including quality-of-life updates, perk tweaks, and killer tweaks.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent quality-of-life updates for Dead by Daylight coming in August is the change to scratch marks. For those who have color blindness, the scratch marks were quite difficult to see. As a result, they've made them more vibrant and plentiful so killers can track their targets accordingly.</p>
<p>As seen on their roadmap, The Doctor, The Nemesis, and The Dredge will all receive tweaks that may make them more powerful or dull their abilities to make it easier for survivors. In addition to killers getting tweaked in August, five perks will also receive some tweaks to balance them out.</p>
<p>These perks include Dance With Me, Deception, Diversion, Chemical Trap, and Mirrored Illusion.</p>
<p>According to the Dead by Daylight roadmap, September and October are shaping up to be busy months. Finisher Moris will receive a quality-of-life update, and more of the killers will be balanced out.</p>
<p>Between September and October, players can expect to see killers such as The Skull Merchant, The Unknown, The Hillbilly and The Twins. In addition, perks such as Leverage, Hex: Crowd Control, Distortion, and Blood Rush are all expected to be tweaked.</p>
<p>Finally, in November, major quality-of-life updates will be made to the Pharmacy, Scene Partner, Weave Attunement, and Shadowborn. According to the roadmap, there will be no perk tweaks; instead, The Cenobite and The Plague will be tweaked.</p>
<p>This year, Dead by Daylight has received many major content updates, such as the 2v8 game mode and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-2v8-game-mode-and-cross-progression-date-reveal/">cross-progression</a>. The game also introduced Lara Croft. Outside of Dead by Daylight, Behavior Interactive has been working on a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe alongside Supermassive Games titled The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>As with any updates, the Dead by Daylight team added, "timelines may change, but we'll keep you updated as we progress." This means that there may be more tweaks to come, or some may be removed from the upcoming roadmap.</p>

<p>After more than 33 years of operations, Game Informer has announced today that it’s shutting down, effectively immediately. If you try to access the Game Informer site, you will be met with a holding page explaining that the brand no longer exists. In a post on social media, the team lamented the closure of the platform, which has been one of the most pivotal sources of gaming news and coverage for more than three decades.</p>



<p>While the Game Informer team didn’t delve into the reasons for the closure, Geoff Keighley explained in <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1819408173133910500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a follow-up post</a> that the label has been shut down because the staff have been laid off by GameStop, GI’s parent company.</p>

<h2 id="h-so-many-memories">So Many Memories</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter, the Game Informer team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After 33 thrilling years of bringing you the latest news, reviews, and insights from the ever-evolving world of gaming, it is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of Game Informer.</p>



<p>From the early days of pixelated adventures to today’s immersive virtual realms, we’ve been honored to share this incredible journey with you, our loyal readers. While our presses may stop, the passion for gaming that we’ve cultivated together will continue to live on.</p>



<p>Thank you for being a part of our epic quest, and may your own gaming adventures never end.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game Informer was one of the top paper-based publications on the market, offering an unforgettable print media circulation that ran from August 1991 to June of this year. When the rise of digital journalism came about, Game Informer was front and centre for the gaming industry, and for more than a decade, the team maintained a site that was, in many ways, a spearhead for the wider business.</p>



<p>GameStop has yet to make a statement confirming why it has so suddenly shut down the Game Informer brand, but we’ve reached out for comment.</p>
