Sure, during the weekend we got a chance to see the upcoming sequel’s impressive photo mode, modeled by the Hollywood actors who Kojima has scanned and placed into the highly anticipated game. But we didn’t just get that: we also got a chance to look at (and definitely not buy) an incredible <em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://acrnm.com/J91-WSDB_NA#a-image_27918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://acrnm.com/J91-WSDB_NA#a-image_27918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> jacket collaboration between Kojima Productions and high-end outerwear company Acronym</a></span>.<br></p><p>I say “definitely not buy” because the entire collection sold out within minutes of its announcement (which came midday Sunday), and also because you are very likely not to be the kind of person who would spend more than $1,700 on a jacket. (However, I would be remiss if I didn’t point out that Acronym is like the Cadillac of drippy outerwear.) The jacket, known as the J91-WSDB, is modular, which means it can be modified (it’s got a removable hood and a strap that allows you to take it off and carry it like a bag) , so you’re getting a few jackets for the price of one very expensive one. The jacket is also shown being worn under and over different Acronym designs, like a spiked outer layer and a sheer paneled bodysuit. Kojima is the model in some of these pictures, which is such a G move. </p><p>The jacket comes in black with orange details or orange with black details, and there are several nods to<em> Death Stranding </em>hidden in the admittedly very cool design. There’s “DOOMS only” text written in low-profile font near the wrist of one of the sleeves, a massive Drawbridge logo (the company Sam Porter Bridges will work for in the sequel), and what looks to be a little cryptobiote keychain hanging off one of the straps.</p><p>Both colorways sold out not too long after they were announced, which is a bummer. I’m a huge fan of video game clothing collaborations being actually cool and fashionable rather than dorky and overly simplistic, like screenprinted tees or garishly patterned blazers. <span><a

Productions collaboration is another great example of how games can be mined for sick fits.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="32e83eb942b23e351dfb55f19a5854bc"

So perhaps it’s no surprise that he currently has plans to expand his work into film and television. But that’s all happening while he also helms a sequel to the Norman Reedus-led <em>Death Stranding</em>, and has two other original games on the horizon. It’s a lot to keep track of, which is why we’re putting it all in one place for your easy reference. Here’s everything we know about Hideo Kojima’s upcoming work.<br></p></div><div><p>Easily the most high-profile thing we know coming out of Kojima Productions right now is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760"><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em></a></span>. The sequel sees the return of both Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges and Léa Seydoux as Fragile, but also has several other big names joining the cast this time around, with Elle Fanning, Shioli Kutsuna, <em>Mad Max</em> director George Miller, and filmmaker Fatih Akin all set to play new characters. <em>On The Beach </em>will follow Sam after he is recruited to help “build bridges” to bring the rest of the world together as he did for America in the original game. Much of that will involve the same traversal, shooting, and online infrastructure-building as the first <em>Death Stranding</em>, though Kojima may well through players a few curve balls, too. The game will launch on PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p></div><div><p>While <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is a known quantity at this point, Kojima Productions is working on two other games that we only know through teases. The first of these enigmas is <em>OD</em>, a horror game published by Xbox Game Studios. Whether that means it will only come to Xbox and Windows, we don’t yet know, as Microsoft has been releasing games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-game-pass-ps5-exclusive-1851626140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-game-pass-ps5-exclusive-1851626140">on other platforms of late</a></span>. We <em>do </em>know that the game will star Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, and will be co-written by <em>Get Out</em> writer-director Jordan Peele. Some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-od-xbox-metal-gear-1851095794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-od-xbox-metal-gear-1851095794">footage of the game leaked</a></span> last year that implied there might be a multiplayer component.</p></div><div><p>The most recent game announcement out of Kojima Productions is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/physint-hideo-kojima-new-game-state-play-1851214597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/physint-hideo-kojima-new-game-state-play-1851214597"><em>Physint </em>(working title)</a></span>. We haven’t seen any footage or even concept art of the game, but Kojima says it will be a return to the espionage genre that made him famous. He described it as “the culmination of [his] work” during the January 31 State of Play presentation, and said that it is both a game and “also a movie at the same time in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound.” We don’t know what that entails yet, but the game is likely a long way away. </p></div><div><p>Those are the video game projects Kojima is working on, but he’s also making moves in film. This includes a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-a24-1851099101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-a24-1851099101">movie set in the <em>Death Stranding </em>universe</a></span>, though it won’t be a direct adaptation of the 2019 game. In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span>, Kojima said he only ever thought of the original <em>Death Stranding </em>“as a game,” thus has no plans to look back on it for the film. He will be supervising the plot but not directing the movie, which is being made in partnership with A24 and Hammerstone Studios, as he can’t dedicate himself to that with three games in development.</p></div><div><p>While the movie is the highest-profile adaptation we know about, Kojima told <em>Variety</em> there are “several” <em>Death Stranding </em>projects in the works. He didn’t go into specifics, so now we get to speculate about whether there might be<em> Death Stranding</em> television shows, anime, books, comics, audio dramas, or other works in our future. </p></div><div><p>In the same <em>Variety</em> interview, Kojima said he is moving through three “phases” within his studio’s lifetime. The first phase was to create the original <em>Death Stranding</em>, the second is the one it’s in now, which is to create movies, anime, TV dramas, and more based on the IP. The third phase, he says, will begin with <em>Physint</em>, and could include internal film and TV plans that are not directly tied to a video game IP.</p></div><div><p>Kojima has signed with Hollywood agency WME, which created a team to work with him. He told <em>Variety</em> that he feels the agency understands him and that having a team would help him better juggle his projects and his work with actors.</p><p>“Well, there are many big agencies out there,” Kojima told <em>Variety</em>. “I’ve met many people over the years, but it’s important to me that I work with people who understand games and understand me. I also need people who can basically traffic control all that I do. Until now, I’ve been personally handling exchanges with all the actors that wanted to work together, but it has become difficult to manage on my own. And with all the offers I receive, the most important thing is knowing who to trust. WME created a whole team for me, and they understand me the most. I feel a lot of love from them. They are very powerful within the industry as well, of course. I don’t intend to make myself 10 times busier than I am already. I just want to be able to do everything that I want to do in my remaining lifetime without wasting time. I can also learn more about what the world is demanding, so it’s really great.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ve never played the OG game. Yet, it’s one of those PS1 games that is fundamental to the console and the PlayStation brand.

The survival horror franchise debuted on PlayStation in 1999, got a well-received sequel in 2000, a mostly-forgotten light gun spin-off in 2002, and then a third sequel in 2003. That last entry was exclusive to the OG Xbox and took the series into space. It wasn’t a fan favorite. Since then <em>Dino Crisis</em> and its red-headed star Regina have been mostly left to gather dust by Capcom. A cameo bot in A<em>stro Bot</em> wouldn’t have satisfied fans wanting more <em>Dino Crisis</em>, sure, but it would have at least been a nice way of Capcom going “Hey, Regina is still around.”</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf1b21e7d0da40f495ba6bf422960dd1" data-recommend-id="image://cf1b21e7d0da40f495ba6bf422960dd1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf1b21e7d0da40f495ba6bf422960dd1" data-recommend-id="image://cf1b21e7d0da40f495ba6bf422960dd1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>“Do y’know where we are?” NYPD officer Aya Brea asks the mutant blob pursuing her through the bowels of a freighter on the Hudson River, right after she overloads the ship’s boiler to blow the monstrosity to smithereens. “We’re in Hell’s Kitchen!”<br></p><p>I love a good one-liner, and this one, from the climax of 1998’s <em>Parasite Eve</em>, has always stuck with me.

<p>Last week, Ubisoft announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows would be delayed from its intended November release date to February 2025. While the announcement was somewhat of a shock publically, internally, it was expected and desperately needed.</p>



<p><span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft announced</a>&nbsp;that the game was delayed “to polish and refine the experience. “</span> In its earnings update, the company further claimed that the delay was due to “the learning from the Star Wars Outlaws release.” Both claims are true, but beyond a few short words, internally, the developers have been pushing for a delay for the best part of a few months, which had fallen on deaf ears until the release of Outlaws.</p>



<div><p><span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yves Guillemot pointed out in an internal memo</a>&nbsp;that Star Wars Outlaws’ initial sales “proved softer than expected,” with Guillemot pointing out that critics rated the game 76 out of 100 on Metacritic (I think it’s important to note that the user score is far lower at a 5.4 out of 10, too).</span> Although I wasn’t given the figure on what Ubisoft anticipated Outlaws to sell within its first month, the game has just surpassed 1 million units sold at the time of writing. Its performance has seemingly caused alarm bells to ring at HQ, which not only led to the approval of Assassin’s Creed Shadows being delayed to Q1 2025 but to finally putting games back on Steam (a request that every Ubisoft team has been pushing for years). </p><p>So why was Shadows delayed? It’s a complicated question without a single answer, but it boils down to a strict development timeline, polishing, and addressing the Japanese community’s cultural and historical accuracy concerns.</p></div>



<p>But first, let me address some of the wild rumors about Yasuke—he’s not going to be removed. However, sources have said that the team has been actively addressing many of the historical and cultural concerns, which started before the game’s reveal following external playtests and were accelerated further following the game’s initial reveal and mass feedback. This includes changing some of Yasuke’s story and how he’s portrayed in the game, fixing architectural details, and ensuring that the game is historically grounded while fitting into the Assassin’s Creed universe. </p>



<div><p>Fundamentally, though, these are issues that should have been caught internally before the game’s reveal, especially given Ubisoft’s strict asset-approval process. As for how these issues fell through the cracks, I’m told that historical experts were brought onto the project much later than usual for a project of this magnitude and that miscommunication between teams and cutting corners when it came to the approval process of assets to meet deadlines were also at play.</p><p>As for the game’s polish and issues with bugs, it’s pretty self-explanatory. The game is currently not at the stage it needs to be for release, and I’m told that there have been some tweaks to some gameplay mechanics and elements that are going to take time to incorporate. While some of these issues were highlighted in recent playtests and mock reviews, these are end-of-development issues that will take a little longer.</p></div>



<div><p>Of course, these are not new issues for the team. Seven developers working on the project said that they have been pushing for a delay for some time, and their situation had even been heard at other studios in the company. Ultimately, though, the delay comes down to a strict development timeline and the need to address issues caused by the set timeline. As for why Ubisoft HQ continues to ignore the developers on almost every level, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s Executive Committee and Board of Directors will decide in their review</a> – although 80% of 40 Ubisoft developers think this ends in no change or layoffs – but that’s another story on the internal issues for another time.</p><p>For now, though, Ubisoft Quebec will release Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14, 2025, and while the game isn’t matching Valhalla in pre-order numbers (which launched on past-generation consoles to a wider market), the numbers are solid and are likely to rise further given its Steam release announcement.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nekojima-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Nekokima is a Japanese term that translates as “cat island”, which is potentially something of a problem if you’re trying to wire up an electricity network in the area. That’s the premise for this curious and spectacular-looking dexterity board game from the wonderfully named Unfriendly Games in which you’ve not only got to stack up a crisscross of wires without them touching, but deal with an infestation of frisky felines who want to hang from the cat’s cradle you’ve inadvertently created.</p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><div catalogid="82b1d311-1ea1-49a6-b6f7-7535a9f09273" id="207880"><div id="207880" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nekojima</h3></p></div><p>Dexterity games often come packed with all sorts of unexpected objects, and Nekojima is no exception. The bulk of the box space is filled up with thick wooden dowels of various lengths, paired together with stiff bits of cord, from one of three different potential colors. Each color has two or three possible pairings of different-length dowels. They’re meant to represent pylons, with the cords as power cables.</p><p>The remainder of the contents are circumspect in comparison. There’s a thick, circular plastic board, divided into four quadrants, and a sheet of counters which include some sinuous, chunky cardboard cats. There are also two custom wooden dice and a collection of wooden cubes in the same three colors as the cords plus black, to match the cats. The cubes go into a supplied linen draw bag.</p><p>It’s not the most attractive game at first glance – the only art is on the board and it, alongside the dice icons, are more about function than form. But, as is often the case, the visual kicks in Nekokima come from what you do with the components rather than the pieces themselves.</p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><p>Again, like many of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games">best dexterity games</a>, this is a pretty simple affair. On your turn you’ll roll the two dice which will indicate two quadrants of the board. Sometimes you might get to choose, sometimes an opponent will get to pick instead. You then draw a cube from the bag, pick a pair of dowels - they’re called Denchuu, which is Japanese for “power pole” – and you place one dowel in one of the specified board quadrants, and the other in the other. Occasionally, both poles need to go in the same quadrant. Simple!</p><p>Except of course, it isn’t. The poles have a specific orientation with the cords at the top and, once placed, the cords are not allowed to touch any poles, or any other cords, nor to hang over the board edge. The first couple of placements are very straightforward, but very soon a web of cords will be threading across the board, necessitating much more imaginative and nimble placements. To make matters worse, you’re not allowed to tweak the cord position with your fingers: you can only adjust it by manipulating the two poles themselves. The cord is stiff, but still has a tendency to misbehave just when you think you’ve wrangled it into position.</p><p>If you finish placing the poles and the cords break this rule, you have to extract them and try again, which a sweaty-palmed ordeal in and of itself. But even when you succeed, your job may not be done. If you were unlucky enough to draw any black cubes on your turn, you have to keep drawing until you get a color, and then hang black cats on matching cords without, again, the cats or cords touching each other, the poles or the ground. There are a selection of such death-defying feline shapes, some of which are much easier to hang than others.</p><p>Naturally, the ground space on the board fills up very quickly, and players must then start to stack the poles atop one another. This is where the different heights of the poles on each denchuu become interesting, as, with a bit of thought, they allow you to make both easier and more interesting placements. You have no way of knowing what your opponents are going to roll, but you can certainly try to cramp their style by throwing a cord across an open area. This opens up all sorts of interesting risk versus reward decisions as regards how hard you want to make life for yourself in the quest to make life harder for your opponents, which all contributes toward forcing the tower higher.</p><p>As it turns out, the poles are thick enough to stack with a fairly high degree of stability, which is kind of both a blessing and a curse. The problem is that it can make the early game feel too easy as you pile poles atop each other and up into the stratosphere. The upsides are that it both makes the game look spectacular on the table as your man-made forest ascends to head-height, festooned with cats and bright-colored wires, and that it ensures an exciting endgame as the foundations finally begin to wobble. Hanging cats also has the potential to cause instant chaos, even on a relatively low tower.</p><p>If piling the poles competitively isn’t your thing, the game plays well both cooperatively and solitaire with a very simple rules change. Drawn cubes all slot into a level board that runs up to level seven, with four cubes per level. Your challenge, either solo or working in a group, is simply to beat the highest level you can. The interesting thing about playing this way is that it reverses the calculations needed to rope off areas and block them from other players: rather, you want to stack and twist in places that will make it easier to follow on. There are also a number of variants included to try, extending the game’s replay value by doing things like limiting the stack height, or playing in pairs with each player taking one of a denchuu.</p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4b25A?object_uuid=16bc6fef-7fdf-47f9-91c6-f329c0e7e375&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/znOVK4?object_uuid=16bc6fef-7fdf-47f9-91c6-f329c0e7e375&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Hatchette</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6rjv?object_uuid=16bc6fef-7fdf-47f9-91c6-f329c0e7e375&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">best RPG board games</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a> to play now.</p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 30, 2024 8:12 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Nekojima is a fun stacking game with a cool twist that isn’t quite cool enough to make it stand out strongly from the pack. Nevertheless, it looks great on the table, has an unusual theme and has a wide range of variants suitable for different ages and play styles, all of which make it adaptable to a smorgasbord of tastes and situations. A lot of its peers try to make their mark by adding additional layers of complexity which sometimes obscure the raw fun of stacking things in big, wobbly piles, and if it’s that elemental joy that you’re after, Nekojima delivers it handsomely.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-heres-how-to-prepare/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-here%E2%80%99s-how-to-prepare.996795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-goes-live-october-8-heres-how-to-prepare/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred is officially set to release on October 8, where players will get to utilize the new class named <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-spiritborn-class-revealed-in-blizzard-livestream/">the Spiritborn</a>, while also working to cleanse the jungle of Mephisto's minions in an attempt to help Neyrelle. Vessel of Hatred follows directly from the campaign of the base game, and players have to track down Neyrelle and assist the people of Nahantu while fighting off the machinations of Mephisto. Vessel of Hatred officially launches globally on October 8, with some timezones accessing it on October 7.</p>
<p>Diablo IV's new expansion releases on October 7 at 7 PM EDT / 4 PM PDT / 8 PM BRT, with the rest of the world being able to access the content in the expansion on October 8. Below is a picture of all of the launch times that players need to be aware of.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're preparing for Vessel of Hatred, this is officially your last chance to get the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140359/what-you-need-to-know-for-vessel-of-hatred-s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-purchase rewards</a>, which include a Snow Leopard Pet, 1 Month of Game Pass Ultimate, and Mother's Lament Legendary Gem for Diablo Immortal.</p>
<p>Additionally, for those who have purchased Vessel of Hatred ahead of launch, the expansion will be available for pre-download on Battle.net as of September 30 at 4 PM PDT / 7 PM EDT / 12 AM BST, with the pre-download on console being available on October 5 at 4 PM PDT / 7 PM EDT and 12 AM BST.</p>
<p>You'll have to create a new character in either the Eternal or Seasonal realm to get stuck into the campaign. While you do have the option to level through the base game campaign, you can skip to the Vessel of Hatred campaign simply by pressing "Skip Campaign." Although you don't need to have completed the base game campaign to be able to start the DLC, it is thoroughly recommended, as it will provide essential information for the story to make complete sense. However, if you prefer to just skip ahead to the expansion, you just need to have completed the prologue on one character to be able to skip the campaign fully.</p>
<p>Along with a new story to complete, Vessel of Hatred adds a lot of new updates to Diablo IV. Plenty of the content added to the game will be available to those who don't own the expansion, including the systemic changes to leveling, difficulty tiers, and the Paragon System. There is now a new max level of 60 and a new Paragon max level of 300.</p>
<p>Those who log in from October 8 to November 8 and complete the Dark Citadel can get the Reins of the Longfur Beast, a cat mount you can obtain. There will also be three weapon cosmetics to obtain once you log into Diablo IV when the expansion drops.</p>

Based on its graphically intensive nature, it’s more a follow-up to Monster Hunter Worlds than Rise. And as such, it won’t be available on Nintendo systems.</p><p>Once again, you play as a Hunter in a world filled with dangerous beasts. Your job is to pick a weapon type/play style and use it to hunt sizable monsters roaming the land. Then you use their various parts to create better gear that lets you go out and hunt bigger and more dangerous monsters. This time around, you have the mobility of Monster Hunter Rise, with the gorgeous beasts and environments of World, creating what just might be the best of both worlds.</p><p>PC gamers can check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-system-requirements-revealed">recommended specs</a> for playing the game.

<p>PlayStation 5 owners are reporting advertisements on the device’s home screen. Frustratingly, the ads seem to be rather difficult to disable, and some are also outdated ads and/or confusing content.</p>
<p>The ads, visible on users' home screens when they hover over a game title, can only be removed if you disconnect from the Internet, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-homescreen-now-replaces-unique-video-game-art-with-annoying-ads-you-cant-turn-off">IGN</a> reported today. However, that would block a lot of the console’s functionality. The PS5 dashboard previously had ads but not on the home screen.</p>
<p>Before this recent development, people would see game art if they hovered over a game icon on the PS5’s home screen. Now, doing so reportedly brings up dated advertisements. For example, IGN reported seeing <a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/img-5026-1727699908609.JPG">an ad for <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em></a> “coming soon exclusively in cinemas” when hovering over the <em>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> game. Webheads will of course recall that the Spider-Verse movie came out in June 2023.</p>
<p>Similarly, going to<em> NBA 2K25</em> reportedly shows an <a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/img-5030-1727704091595.JPG">ad for gaining early access</a>. But the game came out early this month.</p>
<p>Per IGN, it seems that the console is “pulling in the latest news for each game, whether it be a YouTube video, patch notes, or even the announcement of a different game entirely.” That means that not all games are showing advertisements. Instead, some show an image for a <a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/20240930125222-1727699095185.jpg">YouTube video about the game</a> or a note about patch notes or updates for the game.</p>
<p>There also seem to be some mix-ups, with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ps5-new-ui-update-also-brought-unwanted-forced-news-feed-and-ads-to-select-titles">MP1st</a> reporting seeing an <a href="https://mp1st.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ps5-welcome-hub-ad.webp">ad for the <em>LEGO Horizon Adventures</em> game</a> when hovering over the icon for<em> Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. The publication wrote: “The ad also make[s it] confusing a bit, as... it looks like you’re playing LEGO Horizon Adventures and not the <em>actual</em>&nbsp;Horizon game we’re on.”</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Some games, like<em> Astro Bot</em>, however, don’t seem to be affected by the changes, per IGN.</p>
<h2>Annoyed and confused</h2>
<p>Gamers noticing the change have taken to the web to share their annoyance, disappointment, and, at times, confusion about the content suddenly forced into the PS5's home screen.</p>
<p>“As someone playing through the Spiderman series now, this confused the hell out of me,” Crack_an_ag said via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsgy7j/comment/lpna0k6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit.</a></p>
<p>Others are urging Sony to either remove the feature or fix it so that it can be helpful, while others argue that the feature <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsgy7j/comment/lpnb9le/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">couldn’t be helpful regardless.</a></p>
<p>“Forcing every single game to make its latest news story its dashboard art is SO stupid as no one game uses the news feature consistently," Reddit user jackcos <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/comment/lpnqxim/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Sam88FPS, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/comment/lpn3bev/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">noted</a> that ads drove them from Xbox to PlayStation:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the main reasons I moved away from Xbox was the fact they started to build the Xbox UI around ads and pushing [Game Pass]. Hopefully Sony listens more because Xbox absolutely refused to, in fact, they even added full screen startup ads lmao.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s unclear what exactly prompted this change. Some suspect it’s related to firmware update 24.06-10.00.00. But that update came out on September 12, and, as IGN noted, its patch notes don’t say anything about this. Considering the obvious problems and mix of content being populated, it’s possible that Sony is working out some kinks and that eventually the content shown on users' home screens will become more relevant or consistent. The change has also come a few days after a developer claimed that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/21/new-report-says-sonys-concord-cost-400-million-to-make/">Sony lost $400 million </a>after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/two-weeks-after-launch-sony-shooter-concord-goes-offline-and-offers-refunds/">pulling the <em>Concord</em> online game</a> after just two weeks, prompting digs at Sony and unconfirmed theories that Sony is trying to make up for financial losses with ads.</p>
<p>Ars Technica has reached out to Sony about why it decided to add non-removable ads to the PS5 home screen and about the outdated and otherwise perplexing content being displayed. We’ll let you know if we hear back.</p>

            <p>
Pokémon Unite, the hugely popular free-to-play MOBA from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s TiMi Studios, is being yanked offline in Belgium and Netherlands from November next year, amid the countries' ongoing crackdown on loot boxes in games.
</p>
<p>
All versions of Pokémon Unite - that is, on Android, iOS, and Switch - will be pulled from digital stores on 30th November 2025, but subscriptions and in-game items will cease to be available much earlier. They'll no longer be purchasable from 31st October this year.
</p>
<p>
"We'd like to thank our players in Belgium and Netherlands for their support," The Pokémon Company wrote in an <a href="https://unite.pokemon.com/en-gb/news/notice-of-termination/">announcement on its website</a>, "and we apologise for any inconvenience."

<p>
While no reason for the game's termination was provided in The Pokémon Company's statement, the decision is almost certainly related to loot box restrictions in Belgium and Netherlands. Loot boxes have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-belgium-declares-loot-boxes-gambling-and-therefore-illegal">illegal</a> under Belgium's gambling laws since 2018 (although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-study-claims-belgiums-loot-box-law-isnt-being-enforced">enforcement has reportedly been patchy</a>), while the Netherlands government <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dutch-political-parties-back-gaming-loot-box-ban">continues to pursue a loot box ban</a> and close a loophole that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-10m-dutch-fifa-loot-box-fine-has-been-overturned">let EA off the hook</a> in 2022.
</p>

Pokémon Unite - which features a loot box-style mechanic known as the Prize Machine - wouldn't be the only game to wave goodbye to Belgium and Netherlands thanks to their loot box laws. In 2022, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lootbox-laws-reportedly-block-diablo-immortal-launches">scrapped Diablo Immortal's launch</a> as a result of "the current operating environment for games in those countries", while other titles - such as the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> - have had their loot boxes removed in response to the restrictions.
</p>
<p>
In the UK, the previous Conservative government was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-government-demands-changes-to-better-protect-young-people-from-loot-boxes">less inclined to draft legislation</a> concerning loot boxes, but warned the UK games industry that laws would be drafted if it didn't protect young people from them. In response, UKIE (the UK industry's trade association) last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-games-industry-to-restrict-access-to-loot-boxes-for-children">announced 11 Principles</a> as part of "improved protections for children, young people and adults following concerns raised about loot boxes".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-absolutely-rocks-says-no-mans-sky-developer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>So far, we haven't heard much about the PS5 Pro straight from developers with the notable exception of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-games-get-detailed-specs-and-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments gathered by Sony</a> for the official PlayStation Blog last week. However, No Man's Sky Engine Programmer Martin Griffiths <a href="https://x.com/Griff_/status/1840090665570467889" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to Twitter (X)</a> to share all his excitement about the upcoming hardware in a very spontaneous capacity.</p>
<p><em>This beautifully staged screenshot is a fair summary of how I feel tonight. Many of you have noticed that No Man's Sky is now marked as a PS5 Pro enhanced title on the PlayStation store - the only thing I’d like to say, as an engine programmer who has been through all the PS iterations since PS1, is that this console absolutely rocks. </em></p>
<p><em>I want to add that this week, I virtually stood in the queue to order my home PS5 Pro - there is something really special about the journey from working on prototype hardware to it becoming a real thing with the immense intellectual and human effort it takes from thousands of people to ship a console like this with more than 50 launch titles. I’ve never lost that child-like excitement I get when coding on a new dev kit or that same excitement when the real console arrives at home and you boot up a game you’ve worked on for the first time. The brilliant tranquil image I linked off summed up the launch milestone perfectly for everyone at Hello who has worked hard to reach this point - we can quietly breathe again and take pride that our tiny team is part of this.</em></p>
<p>It is high praise from such an experienced industry veteran. Griffiths has worked on games as diverse as Populous: The Beginning and Dungeon Keeper 2 to Quake III, Need for Speed: Shift, Syndicate, and Project CARS before joining Hello Games to work on No Man's Sky, which is currently one of 56 games confirmed to be enhanced for the PS5 Pro console.</p>
<p>The UK studio has not shared any details yet on how it plans to take advantage of the increased power. Interestingly, No Man's Sky already runs at 4K and 60 frames per second on PS5 (and Xbox Series X). As such, the only meaningful way to enhance the game further would be to allow it to run at 4K@120FPS or, more likely, to push the graphics settings. One great way to do so would be to add ray tracing effects, which, however, are currently missing even on the PC version.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro launches on November 7 for $699.</p>

Because of this, a lot of the objects you can wield are joke items, there for the goofs, and don’t offer any true value. But amongst what you can pick up, there are a handful of weapons that stand out from the bunch.</p><p>We’ve picked out our top 11 weapons you’ll want to seek out while hunting psychos and zombies in the Willamette Parkview Mall.</p><p>Click Next to see the items you’ll want to grab.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0fa2e658d0c0c632811f0e85782ffffd" data-recommend-id="image://0fa2e658d0c0c632811f0e85782ffffd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Metal Pipe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Metal Pipe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fa2e658d0c0c632811f0e85782ffffd" data-recommend-id="image://0fa2e658d0c0c632811f0e85782ffffd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Metal Pipe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finding a Metal Pipe shouldn’t be too hard, because large portions of the mall are still under construction, even 20 years later. If you want to be certain, they can be commonly found in the elevator room that takes you to the security center. During the day, you can easily one-shot a zombie using the Metal Pipe.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d8fbd97039e15e26ea907fa557e380ed" data-recommend-id="image://d8fbd97039e15e26ea907fa557e380ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sledge hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sledge hammer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d8fbd97039e15e26ea907fa557e380ed" data-recommend-id="image://d8fbd97039e15e26ea907fa557e380ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sledge hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Knowing why the Sledge Hammer is the ideal zombie-killing weapon shouldn’t take too much explaining. Especially if you’ve ever hit a zombie around the head with your own sledge hammer. Across the board, it does significant damage to zombies and humans alike. Plus, it has two attacks, one focusing on a single target and the other great for crowd control.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="78addad5936bacad972147d2e04723ac" data-recommend-id="image://78addad5936bacad972147d2e04723ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shotgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shotgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="78addad5936bacad972147d2e04723ac" data-recommend-id="image://78addad5936bacad972147d2e04723ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shotgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shotguns and zombies go together like peanut butter and jelly. There are a couple of spots where you can be sure to find the gun: One will spawn next to the mall’s entrance at the beginning of the game, or you can visit the Huntin’ Shack in the North Plaza.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6486ba2cd004d26fb01c7a9c19d903b9" data-recommend-id="image://6486ba2cd004d26fb01c7a9c19d903b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chainsaw." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chainsaw." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6486ba2cd004d26fb01c7a9c19d903b9" data-recommend-id="image://6486ba2cd004d26fb01c7a9c19d903b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chainsaw." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Chainsaw is another great weapon to use. It’s great for clearing out hordes of zombies, and inflicts a lot of damage across the board. The only downside is that you can’t keep it in your inventory, so make sure not to leave it behind when switching between items. You can always find a chainsaw if you visit McHandy’s Hardware in the Al Fresca Plaza.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f0ea05bb1b0d7c6293a1d06ead4deac" data-recommend-id="image://2f0ea05bb1b0d7c6293a1d06ead4deac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Queen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Queen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f0ea05bb1b0d7c6293a1d06ead4deac" data-recommend-id="image://2f0ea05bb1b0d7c6293a1d06ead4deac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Queen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not her late majesty of the United Kingdom, who during her life was a formidable weapon against zombies, but rather a special zombie variant. You’ll be able to easily spot her by looking for the zombie in the crowd who is ignoring you and looking at the sky. After you kill them, the Queen will be exposed, and you’ll be able to catch her. And now she’s a weapon. Whenever you throw the Queen at a horde of zombies, it’ll immediately kill them all.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="126f48262613873f207d572a9365c66a" data-recommend-id="image://126f48262613873f207d572a9365c66a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baseball bat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Baseball bat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="126f48262613873f207d572a9365c66a" data-recommend-id="image://126f48262613873f207d572a9365c66a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baseball bat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Baseball bats are great because they’re the ideal weapon in almost every situation. (<em>The same is true in Dead Rising—Ed</em>) They don’t do too much damage, but inflict just enough to be useful, while sporting a decent lifespan. You won’t have to worry about it breaking down immediately. Baseball bats can be commonly found throughout the mall, especially in sporting goods stores, so you shouldn’t have too much trouble hunting one down.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="30f289fe1d3fd9936f569d68d882afe7" data-recommend-id="image://30f289fe1d3fd9936f569d68d882afe7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Machete" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Machete" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30f289fe1d3fd9936f569d68d882afe7" data-recommend-id="image://30f289fe1d3fd9936f569d68d882afe7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Machete" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The only way to get the Machete is by killing Cliff in Crislip’s Home Saloon. After he dies, you can farm this weapon (head off through a loading screen, then return, and it’ll have respawned where he died) and have as many as you’d like. This will hit nearly all zombies, and inflict as much damage at night. Plus, this weapon is excellent against other humans.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="902b7567963d882a6abbb91f6a7646ff" data-recommend-id="image://902b7567963d882a6abbb91f6a7646ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pistol." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pistol." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="902b7567963d882a6abbb91f6a7646ff" data-recommend-id="image://902b7567963d882a6abbb91f6a7646ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pistol." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can never go wrong with a Pistol whenever you need to kill a few zombies, and makes a good option for ranged fights. If you’re having trouble finding a pistol, you can always get one from the zombie cops by heading to the park plaza in Paradise Plaza.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="257d7d708e8c8a91a984056e3dab5980" data-recommend-id="image://257d7d708e8c8a91a984056e3dab5980" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Katana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Katana" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="257d7d708e8c8a91a984056e3dab5980" data-recommend-id="image://257d7d708e8c8a91a984056e3dab5980" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Katana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Katana is a faster, weaker version of the Machete. Even though it’s not as strong, it still excels in almost every situation. You’ll be able to find Katana at Ripper’s Blades in the North Plaza, and Ned’s Knicknackery in the entrance plaza.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6eaa3af110fe48580ff431d2f5edcff6" data-recommend-id="image://6eaa3af110fe48580ff431d2f5edcff6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two by four." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two by four." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6eaa3af110fe48580ff431d2f5edcff6" data-recommend-id="image://6eaa3af110fe48580ff431d2f5edcff6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two by four." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two by four is reliable. When in doubt, look for a simple piece of wood and go crazy with it. Just like the bat, it’s a good starter weapon that inflicts a decent amount of damage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-takes-over-commander-format-following-abuse-to-rules-committee<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week, the Commander Rules Committee updated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-update-enrages-fanbase" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the ban list</a> for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering's</em></a> Commander format. It was a contentious change to the meta that enraged fans so much that Wizards of the Coast will take over the committee's duties.</p>
<h2>The Future of Magic: The Gathering Commander Format</h2>
<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/on-the-future-of-commander">blog post</a>, WIzards of the Coast explained their plans for curating the Commander format for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. The post starts with commending the Commander Rules Committee, a small group of five passionate talented individuals. Individuals that contribute to the committee while working full-time jobs and raising families.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-dockside-extortionist-artwork.jpg?itok=LJYZJSw0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-dockside-extortionist-artwork.jpg?itok=2gYZ8O2_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Critically, the post calls out bad actors that have been harrassing the CRC recently. Due to the escalating outrage of recent events, personal threats have been sent to committee members, Wizards of the Coast expressly states a zero tolerance policy on this front.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;This is something we will not tolerate. No matter how you feel about something in Magic, it is never appropriate to threaten somebody. Everyone at Wizards of the Coast is united on this front—we will not hesitate to take action against individuals who threaten to harm community members or employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CRC corroborated WIzards of the Coast's official statement. In a thread of <a href="https://x.com/mtgcommander/status/1840783614294069286">social media posts</a> on X (formerly known as Twitter), the CRC stated that they could no longer operate as an independent entity as a result of these threats.

<p>According to the post, both the CRC and the design team are still in preliminary conversations about the future of Commander. This includes a new approach to deck power level and more guidance for players looking for a format that suits their style of play.</p>

According to the developer, <em>Neva </em>will follow the growing relationship between the two, who start as unlikely allies before becoming inseparable companions.</p><p>I’ve been excited for <em>Neva </em>for a while now and it looks like an improvement in so many ways from Nomada’s stunning debut. <em>Neva </em>maintains the platforming of <em>Gris</em>, but builds upon it with way more mechanics, which are incredibly welcome! For instance, this time around <em>Neva </em>will feature combat and Alba will make use of her sword when fighting off monsters rather than in <em>Gris</em>, where the protagonist avoids conflict at all costs. It seems like when Alba and the wolf first find one another, Alba must work to protect it, but as the wolf grows, it might become an ally in combat, and can maybe even be directed.</p><p><em>Neva</em>, much like <em>Gris </em>before it, is absolutely gorgeous. Ever since its debut trailer, I’ve been in awe of its style, which feels much looser than <em>Gris</em>’ sharp linework, and consequently more expressive. It is also more naturalistic than Nomada’s previous game, seemingly placing an emphasis on the collapsing world in an effort to reflect the real life consequences of climate change on our ecosystems. If that’s the case, <em>Neva </em>appears to be a beautiful tragedy, and I wouldn’t be surprised if just like <em>Gris</em>, it’s a hell of a tearjerker. </p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Neva:</em></strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fneva%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fneva%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6efc55c7aff1f5c4a47b98c50f559098" data-recommend-id="image://6efc55c7aff1f5c4a47b98c50f559098" data-format="png" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Some Neva concepgt art.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Rumors of a Final Fantasy IX remake have been echoing around RPG circles for at least year now, with series fans hopeful that they may soon get to revisit one of the most beloved entries in the series. But if a Final Fantasy IX remake does materialize, it may face some big challenges.</p><p>Speaking with the website <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/final-fantasy-14-naoki-yoshida-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Games</a>, Final Fantasy XIV producer Naoki Yoshida talked a bit about what a remake might look like. He warns that it may not all fit in one game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Top 10 Final Fantasy Bosses</h3></div></output><p>"Of course, I do know there  are requests for Final Fantasy IX to be made, but when you think about Final Fantasy IX, it’s a game with huge volume," Yoshida says. "When you think about all of that volume, I wonder if it’s possible to remake that as a single title. It’s a difficult one. It is a tough question."</p><p>Yoshida seems to be suggesting that a potential remake could go the direction of Final Fantasy VII Remake, which is in the middle of a planned trilogy. Fans have long had mixed feelings about splitting it into multiple parts, which offers the opportunity to add plenty of new elements, but also slows the pacing. As it stands, the third part of the trilogy doesn't figure to be out until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p>Yoshida is right about Final Fantasy IX being a big game. It's absolutely loaded with sidequests, minigames, and other content, and it's set in a very large world. Reproducing all of that material won't be easy for any development team that takes on a remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for Yoshida himself, he's interested in remaking a different game in the series. "The one that I would like to make myself would be Final Fantasy III, I think."</p><p>For longtime fans of the series, Yoshida is referring to the version released on the Famicom, not the Americanized Final Fantasy VI. It's a deep cut as Final Fantasy releases go, but very much in keeping with Yoshida's attitude as Final Fantasy XIV's producer.</p><p>Yoshida touches on a handful of other details in the interview, including his favorite Final Fantasy VII minigame (snowboarding), an Xbox release of Final Fantasy XVI ("we do want to release it on Xbox"), and more. In the meantime, the wait for a Final Fantasy IX remake continues.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

                <p>The first State of Decay game came out all the way back in 2013, and the franchise is still growing. Following 2018's sequel, State of Decay 2, a third game is now in the works for Xbox and PC.</p><p>The biggest piece of news of late on State of Decay 3 is that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/state-of-decay-2-new-content-updates-are-ending-as-dev-prioritizes-state-of-decay-3/1100-6526276/" data-ref-id="1100-6526276">ramping up production</a>, as developer Undead Labs winds down development on State of Decay 2 and shifts to the third game. Here in this post, we're rounding up everything we know about State of Decay 3.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_State_of_Decay_3_release_">When will State of Decay 3 release?</h2><p>State of Decay 3 was announced back in 2020 but still does not have a release date. In fact, Undead Labs and Microsoft have not said much at all about the game.</p><h2 id="State_of_Decay_3_trailer">State of Decay 3 trailer</h2><p>The first state of State of Decay 3 trailer was released in 2020. The cinematic trailer showed a character tracking an animal's blood trail through the snow, only to discover a zombified deer. Pretty scary stuff! A second trailer, which debuted in 2024, showed off more of the game's world, but was again only a (very impressive-looking!) cinematic trailer and did not contain any gameplay footage.</p><p>You can

That's largely remained the status quo since, but a major development came in September 2024 when Undead Labs said it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/state-of-decay-2-new-content-updates-are-ending-as-dev-prioritizes-state-of-decay-3/1100-6526276/" data-ref-id="1100-6526276">winding down development on State of Decay 2</a> so its team members could shift to State of Decay 3.</p><p>"Our ambition is to make the greatest zombie survival sim in the franchise, and to do so, we'll be shifting our focus and resources to making the upcoming third installment, State of Decay 3," Undead Labs said.</p><p>Many are naturally wondering when State of Decay 3 will come out, but Undead Labs isn't ready to say just yet, saying more information will come "at a later time."</p><p>"Thank you for your continued support and for being the greatest gaming community there is. We’re excited to devote ourselves to making the next game even better," the studio said.</p><p>In 2022, <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-decay-3-xbox-series-x-s-sexism-microsoft-undea-1848728682" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku published a report</a> detailing alleged controversies within the studio, including allegations of sexism, bullying, and burnout. The report detailed how Microsoft's acquisition of Undead Labs was reportedly "hampered by toxic workplace conditions and lack of direction." In response, Xbox's Matt Booty said, "Undead Labs has seen a number of positive changes and we are confident in the direction the team is taking State of Decay 3, one of our most ambitious open-world games in development."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/ps5-firmware-update-ads-welcome-hub-custom-widgets-1851661075<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month, Sony <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-system-update-features-charging-3d-audio-1851646881&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-system-update-features-charging-3d-audio-1851646881">rolled out a new firmware update that</a></span>, among other things, added a customizable welcome hub to the PlayStation 5 home screen. It’s lowkey one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1836798946095538399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1836798946095538399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best new features</a></span> the console has gotten in years, but it’s being overshadowed by an equally frustrating change that’s resulted in a bunch of random junk, including ads, getting splashed across players’ screens whether they want it or not. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The welcome hub is the new starting tile on the PS5's main menu and it lets players choose what’s displayed, from controller battery life to discounted games on their PlayStation Store wishlist. It also lets players turn off an optional news feed widget that pulls random announcements for all of the games they follow. Unfortunately, that news feed is now infecting the rest of the console’s home screen. </p><p>Tiles for installed games used to display background art or activity cards when you scrolled over them, but following a recent change they now pull from whatever the latest item is in that game’s news feed. Sometimes the results are harmless, but other times it means anything from YouTube thumbnails to marketing for other games takes over the screen when selecting specific games to play. </p><p>“So it turns out that the recent PS5 UI update that let you disable all the advertisements on the dashboard was too good to be true,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alfredobofa/status/1840189326883262655&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alfredobofa/status/1840189326883262655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> user Earl Turlet over the weekend. “Now EVERY SINGLE GAME on your homescreen shows you an advertisement in the background with no way to remove them lol.” YouTuber Mystic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ9wgBHuEP0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ9wgBHuEP0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also put together a thorough video</a></span> walking players through the changes. </p><p>The most egregious examples include a “what is Warhammer” video for <em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em>, the <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> page showing a promotional image from <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse </em>which came out over a year ago, and accolade posts that plaster the art of a game with review scores and testimonials. Sometimes the newsfeed shows another game entirely, like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition </em>on PS4 whose background art now shows <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> instead. “It’s a huge downgrade for the UI,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player on Reddit</a></span> calling for others to protest the changes. “<em>Elden Ring</em> is advertising a mousepad FFS.”</p><p>Hopefully, Sony reverts the change. Ideally, players would be allowed to customize the backgrounds for games just like they can on the welcome hub, choosing from official art or even their own screenshots. And if some players do want quick access to the newsfeeds for the corresponding games, maybe Sony can do a better job of displaying what they curate. In a lot of cases a simple list of the latest official headlines from the PlayStation Blog or social media accounts for those games would be a lot more useful than how the feeds are currently constructed.</p><p><strong> Update 9/30/2024 4:41 p.m. ET: </strong>The news feed issues <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dshiatt/status/1840822267737162237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dshiatt/status/1840822267737162237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are a bug</a></span> according to PlayStation senior product manager Daniel Hiatt. It sounds like it will be fixed soon. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
