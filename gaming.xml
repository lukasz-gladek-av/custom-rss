<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160059/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The beat ‘em up genre has experienced something of a renaissance in the last generation, with original titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fightn_rage1">Fight’n Rage</a> (2019) and more recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> (2025) finding new ways to move the genre forward, while releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a> (2020) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> (2022) show how effectively classics can be modernised. It makes sense, then, that Arc System Works wanted to find a way to bring back Technōs Japan's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/double_dragon">Double Dragon</a>, one of the progenitors of the whole genre.</p>
<p>Yet after the middling response of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden</a> (2023), the company decided to go back to the drawing board when it tried again with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a>. This release is a much more straightforward entry in the long-running series. Despite having some interesting ideas going for it, Double Dragon Revive unfortunately lacks polish and comes across as a very ‘okay’ experience.</p>
<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160055/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Surprisingly enough, it is very story-driven, complete with fully voiced and partially animated anime cutscenes. The narrative here is set (rather oddly) several years after the conclusion of a nuclear war, with society breaking down into a collection of warring city-states ruled by various groups that have managed to seize power. In Billy and Jimmy Lee’s hometown, a nasty group of thugs called the Shadow Gang run the show, and the plot kicks off with them kidnapping (again) the boys’ childhood friend Marian, leading to the famed duo hitting the streets to get her back.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don’t usually play a beat ‘em up for a riveting and emotional story, but the narrative here actually feels pretty interesting and goes a step beyond the typical basic setup most entries in this genre will go for. Those cutscenes go a long way towards setting up a moderately interesting world and characters, even if it does sometimes come off as a bit cheesy and over-the-top.</p>
<p>As far as gameplay is concerned, this entry plays genre conventions relatively straight, with the addition of the key gimmick that the action plays out on more of a 3D plane than strictly 2D. Otherwise, you still move from screen to screen, comboing waves of baddies and occasionally picking up a knife or sledgehammer to dole out intense street justice. Another new gimmick here is that you can use your environment to your advantage, such as knocking enemies into cars for quick kills that net you lots of points.</p>
<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160054/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Double Dragon Revive has all the basics and even has some cool ideas in how it implements them, but the actual execution of these mechanics falters. Movement consistently feels rigid and janky, while the level design is sometimes lacking. One stage involves a forced platforming challenge that the controls <em>definitely</em> aren’t designed for, and there are many encounters where annoying enemy placement can lead to things like getting ganked from firebomb-wielding foes attacking you from off-screen. It’s the kind of game that feels frustrating, and not in the <em>good</em> way that many <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-soulslikes-games-to-play-if-you-like-dark-souls">soulslikes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-roguelikes-roguelites-and-run-based-games">roguelikes</a> manage to hit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things are saved somewhat by the moderate depth of your character’s moveset, which helps make things feel a bit more dynamic. Alongside the lead brothers, there are two unlockable characters whose unique movesets have their pros and cons that give the moment-to-moment gameplay variety. Carefully determining when and where to make certain moves, such as a screen-clearing special attack that builds up as you combo enemies, makes combat encounters more than a simple button-mashing fest.</p>
<p>And of course, in classic beat ‘em up fashion, you can be joined by another player in either couch or online co-op sessions (no drop-in, though) for some good ‘ol multiplayer fun. In my experience, the online environment on Switch is already a total ghost town, but the local co-op is just as engaging as you’d imagine and it tends to amplify the fun factor when you're beating up screens of foes in a friendly ‘co-opetition’. Capping the multiplayer at just two players feels like a bit of a weird decision, but then again it is called <em>Double</em> Dragon, and not <em>Multiple</em> Dragon.</p>
<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160056/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as replayability is concerned, there’s a decent amount of content here to justify the price tag. You’re given a ranking at the end of each stage based on score and overall performance, and this, paired with the selection of playable characters, means there’s fair reason for repeat playthroughs to try mastering every stage with every character.</p>
<p>Once you’ve tired out the main campaign, you can then turn to the ‘Extra’ mode where you can do a series of bite-sized missions that also add little vignettes that flesh out the story a bit more. As long as the core gameplay clicks for you, there’s plenty to do here.</p>
<p>Visually, Double Dragon Revive leaves a lot to be desired, mostly sticking to a lifeless and generic-looking 3D art style that immediately makes the game look cheap. Environments have detailed but ultimately forgettable designs, while the 3D models of all the characters on screen are stiffly animated and tend to lack charm. Nothing explicitly looks <em>bad,</em> but the visuals don’t leave much of an impression.</p>
<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160068/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the anime-styled cutscenes are more interesting, but they only serve to further contrast how middling the rest of the game looks when you’re actually playing it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the soundtrack does a better job of supporting the action, mixing together a collection of house, drum and bass, rock, and pop tracks to make for an energetic soundscape. It can be a bit easy to overlook the music amid all the howls and sound effects of a fight, but I thought this music was a pretty solid companion to the action and does a good job of contributing to the scrappy atmosphere the developers are clearly going for here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Double Dragon Revive is the sort of game that’s just damningly mediocre. It doesn’t fumble the ball too hard in any significant way, but neither does it really excel at offering a fun and engaging beat ‘em up. Interesting gameplay ideas are held back by uneven execution, and the uninspired graphical style kind of takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>This will have its fans, and it’s worth purchasing on a deep sale someday, but it’s definitely nowhere close to the list of games I’d recommend to someone wanting to expand their beat-‘em-up collection. Perhaps Billy and Jimmy will wow us with their inevitable next outing, but this one is just 'alright'.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the most anticipated releases remaining this year, with millions of players pre-registering for launch, and we’ve got all the details on the title’s free-to-play status.</p>



<p>Launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> as a PlayStation console exclusive and also on PC, Where Winds Meet has seen over seven million pre-registrations ahead of its global launch, having achieved vast success in China, where it was released in December 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how much you will need to splash out to play Where Winds Meet or whether it is free to play, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-where-winds-meet-free-to-play">Is Where Winds Meet Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to do. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet is completely free to play, with optional monetization coming in the form of cosmetics for your character and in-game currencies.</strong></p>



<p>While there are bonuses that can be purchased ahead of launch, including PlayStation’s $14.99 pre-order edition that includes an outfit set, Player Name Card, in-game common currency, and two in-game draw items, that approach is entirely optional. It does not provide any major gameplay boosts.</p>



<p>Additionally, cosmetics and in-game currency can also be purchased separately inside the game, though, again, it’s entirely optional and won’t lock you out of any major content if you decide not to splash out.</p>



<p>Instead, you can enjoy Where Winds Meet without spending a single dollar, as the game is available in its entirety for free.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-where-winds-meet-for-free">How to Play Where Winds Meet For Free</h2>



<p><strong>There are two big steps to playing Where Winds Meet for free, as it requires downloading the game and creating an account.</strong></p>



<p>While Where Winds Meet can be played entirely in single player, a constant internet connection is required, and you also need a dedicated account with the game in order to play. The bonus of this is regular benefits, including pre-registration rewards, being distributed into your account.</p>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to jump into Where Winds Meet without spending a single dollar.</p>



<ol>
<li>Sign in to your Steam or PlayStation account.</li>



<li>Search for ‘Where Winds Meet’.</li>



<li>Download the title.</li>



<li>Launch the game.</li>



<li>Create an account.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian has said it’s well aware that whenever it announces a new game, people ask where Fallout: New Vegas 2 is, but it loves how it’s been able to create new IP and even release sequels to them — and its owner Microsoft sounds like it supports that approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Season 2 is set to hit Prime Video this December, and while Bethesda has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced-on-fallout-day-here-are-the-contents">a new Fallout: New Vegas bundle</a> up its sleeve, there’s no word yet on a Fallout remaster or a Fallout: New Vegas 2 to capitalize on the surge of interest in the franchise. Obsidian is of course the developer of the much-loved 2010 RPG Fallout: New Vegas, so fans often wonder whether it will return to the setting for a sequel, especially given it’s owned by Bethesda parent company Microsoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian, though, has focused on making brand new games, and it is prolific in doing so. It’s released Grounded (Grounded 2 came out this year), fantasy RPG Avowed (which came out this year), and sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds (The Outer Worlds 2 came out this year). Pentiment, which came out last year, was another brand new game, although I wouldn’t expect a sequel to that any time soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/of-course-working-at-obsidian-is" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Obsidian’s VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of production Justin Britch touched on the fan calls for a New Vegas follow-up, but pointed to its work establishing new franchises as a “joy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know everyone on the internet, on every game we ever announce, will constantly reference back to, ‘When’s the next New Vegas? Or when’s the next whatever?” Morgan said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But this year, in addition to it being a celebration of shipping three games, all three of those games are IP that we’ve created, that are Obsidian IP. Our history, prior to the Microsoft acquisition, really was surrounding around working on others’ IP. And this is the joy that we get of… how do we start to define our own and how do we build our own IP? And we’ve got to the part where we have sequels to all of them. All of them are sequels to the IP we created.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like Microsoft has supported Obsidian’s desire to do just that, even though you’d think the mega corp might have gone hard on Fallout, especially with the hugely popular Fallout TV show breaking through into the mainstream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Xbox has been pretty supportive of the stuff we want to do,” Britch insisted. “It’s been great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention made during the recent Fallout Day broadcast of a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, which some (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remaster-new-vegas-boss-danny-trejo-calls-on-bethesda-to-give-fallout-fans-what-they-really-want"><u>including Danny Trejo!</u></a>) have called on Bethesda to develop. Indeed, there were no new Fallout games announced at all. Find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-2025-everything-announced-live"><u>everything announced during the Fallout Day broadcast here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Happy Bday Fallout: New Vegas</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG over time (and after a rocky launch), it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, The Outer Worlds 2 has strong New Vegas vibes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve has added a feature to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> that you might be surprised wasn’t there all along: Display-Off Downloads. Now, the console can download games with the screen off, entering a new low-power download mode before going to sleep upon completion.</p>
<p>This new mode is now in the Beta and Preview channels of SteamOS, and will be rolled out to all users eventually. At that point, it will be the default mode when the Steam Deck is plugged in to power, and can be enabled when on battery power manually under Settings &gt; Power.</p>


<p>If you’re downloading a game or updates at the time that you press the power button to turn off the Steam Deck, it will prompt if you’d like to continue downloading with the screen off. It will also enter this mode automatically after being idle for some time. While downloading, you’ll be able to check on downloads by waking the screen, and can fully wake or let it continue.</p>
<p>When using this with battery power, the Steam Deck will halt downloads and go to full sleep if the battery drops below 20%.</p>

<p>Display-off downloads are similar in concept to the standby mode downloads and updates that are possible on Xbox, PS5 and Switch, but with SteamOS being built on a branch of Linux, it’s much more like a PC in some of its workings. This is a good step closer to the console experience, when compared to needing to manually enable and enter more basic screen-off modes as with Windows-based handhelds, laptops and PCs.</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is going to offer something even for returning players who have completed the original PSX release or the Nintendo 3DS remake released back in 2016, a new ending that's never been seen before in any other version of the game.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Reimagined follows the narrative of the original story, but depending on some of the [...] player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before in previous iterations,"</em>  game producer Takeshi Ichikawa told Game Informer during the publication's recent visit to Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So, even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined."</em></p>



<p>While Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will follow the original narrative and add a new ending, the new version of the seventh entry in the series will<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"> feature significant gameplay changes that are set to improve the experience considerably</a>. Among these changes is a renewed battle system that will power more dynamic enemy encounters, evolved party members and enemy movesets and behaviours, the ability to skip combat against weak foes by attacking them on the field, a redesigned UI with a tab-based menu system for easy navigation, and more.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, which launches on February 5, 2026, is the next series' remake to launch on PC and consoles in recent times, following the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake and Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. The latter was released last week on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, introducing new features to the first two entries in the series that update the experience without taking away their classic feel. You can learn more about the latest series' remake by checking out <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">my review.</a></p>

            <p>Like an asteroid touching down in a freshly shaken martini, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> is now available on Steam, and some players have been having trouble playing it. I don't mean the people who don't understand inflation or why they can't make friends with Greenland. I mean the people who can't even get the new 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> to launch, because their PCs are too pitifully puny for this behemoth of history. Don't fret, those people. The hardware Popes at Paradox are blessing your meagre graphics cards with a sneaky workaround.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"We´ve noticed that many players crash the game due to the hardware being too weak," explains <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3450310/discussions/0/652585529159908400/">a launch-day Steam post</a>. "There is a way to force the game into a very low preset." To do that, you'll want to right-click EU5 in your Steam library, go to the General and add "-graphic_preset=very_low" to the launch options.
</p>
<p>The post also notes some other problems with the game becoming unresponsive and going all black-screeny when launching from Steam. Apparently, this has to do with the Vulkan renderer, and the solution again is to right-click EU5 in your library and add "-dx12" to the launch options. You can combine this move with the forced very low graphics preset.
</p>
<p>If none of that works, well, here's the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/europa-universalis-v-bug-reports.1190/">official Paradox bug report forum</a>.
</p>
<p>Our Brendy (RPS in peace) deemed Europa Universalis 5 to be a honking good time and also an atrocious burden on his mental resources that is sometimes better beheld in mild horror than played. "When the game is understandable, it is hugely gratifying," he wrote in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-5-review">Europa Universalis 5 review</a>. "But it also feels a bit 'you cannot press this button until you press that other button'. And that other button is obscured in a warren of menus you must spend nights coming to understand. It's a hugely deep pool of wonderful tricks to get lost in, but a pool still sweaty from all the confused forum posters who dived in before you."
</p><p>How are you getting on, if you're playing? A few years ago I reached the conclusion that Europa Universalis is not for me, but I quite like the idea of founding Iceland, getting really obsessive about lumber, and just sitting out most of the second millennium.</p>
<p>Nobody's going to bother Iceland much, right? AFAIK it's all volcano and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> servers. Seriously, how many spreadsheets does it take to manage a country the size of Iceland. If you are from Iceland, please let me know. I'm pretty sure you live within shouting distance of the Treasury. Also please don't get offended by my characterisation and go viking again - England has little to plunder besides branches of Gail's right now.</p>

		<p>I genuinely punched the air and whooped at my laptop screen when YoghurtDaddy's header pinged off the crossbar and into the net.&nbsp;</p><p>My <em>Rematch</em> team – all strangers – had conceded an early goal and then weathered a five-minute onslaught.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>At one point in </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>, the game’s protagonist Atsu finds herself within the torchlit courtyard of a fortress where one of her enemies is preparing to stage a play. This production is meant to recreate the worst moment of Atsu’s life, when her family was brutally murdered in front of her as a child and she was left for dead. Throughout the game, Atsu has trekked across an early 17</span><span>th</span><span>-century Hokkaido, part of a region then known as Ezo, in search of the Yotei Six, the group of killers responsible for the slaughter. Her hunt has led her to find one of them now planning to relive her tragedy in the form of a night’s entertainment. A backdrop is painted with the image of her family’s ginkgo tree, where she was left for dead. Soldiers mill around, waiting for the show to begin. Their leader, one of the masked killers from her past, orders his underlings to get the details of the massacre correct. He shouts for more fire, louder music, to capture the excitement of the night.</span></p> <p><span>Seeing her past reimagined in this way sends Atsu into a blind rage, expressed in-game as a new ability that drenches the screen in a dark, bloody red, and drives her into a violent frenzy. She slices through enemy after enemy, leaving the would-be stage strewn with corpses and fallen weapons. How her history is represented matters deeply to her. Its distortion makes her furious.</span></p>

 <h2>Imperfect Fictions And Partial Realities</h2> <p><span>Alongside </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>, a number of this year’s other highest-profile games have taken place in the past. </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</span></i><span>, sequel to a 2018 action RPG, is set in 1403 Bohemia, amidst the turmoil of wars fought between forces loyal to King Wenceslas IV and King Sigismund. </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span> brings the long-running series to late 16</span><span>th</span><span>-century Japan, during the latter part of the country’s Sengoku period—an era defined by decades of civil war. </span><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>, for its part, follows fledgling mafioso Enzo Favara as he enters the world of Sicilian organized crime in the first decade of the 20</span><span>th </span><span>century.</span></p>

 <p><span>Each of these games takes a different approach to design and storytelling, but they have a lot in common beneath the surface. All of them are about characters seeking some form of revenge against those who have wronged them in their youth, from the mine bosses who controlled young Enzo’s life in </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, to the leaders who have ripped apart the lives of the protagonists in </span><i><span>Deliverance 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>. Apart from </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, they all feature real figures from history as allies and enemies. Most importantly, they all invite a modern audience to enter virtual versions of history by setting their action in lavishly imagined depictions of a bygone world, each using advanced technology to make the past seem alive on-screen.</span></p>

  <p><span>Historical video games typically gesture toward realism, with “realism” used as a catch-all term for the reproduction of detail. As in a period movie, TV show, play, or novel, these details often involve recreating the look and sound of a previous era by using primary sources, like contemporary writing, art, and preserved artifacts, as reference. The design of a soldier’s armor, the architecture of a Japanese or Bohemian castle, or the make of guns and cars available in 1900s Sicily—video games are often very good at capturing these kinds of details. In storytelling, too, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Deliverance 2</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span> all place their protagonists in narratives punctuated by actual historical events, like wars and peace agreements, the development of new governments and technologies. How these details are used in portraying a recreation of the past, though, is just as important to a game’s outcome as the narrow accuracy of its set dressing.</span></p>

 <p><span>The telling of history—and the creation of historical fiction—is always a process of interpretation. As much as we like to imagine history as a clear record of what’s come before us, our knowledge of the past develops through an imperfect process guided by what evidence is available to us, and how that evidence is understood by the perspectives of the people studying it.</span></p>

 <p><span>The late Hilary Mantel, a British author best known for her trilogy of novels centered on Thomas Cromwell, spoke about her approach to historical fiction in 2017 for the </span><i><span>BBC</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Reith Lecture</span></i><span> series. It’s an essential listen (</span><a href="https://medium.com/@bbcradiofour/hilary-mantel-bbc-reith-lectures-2017-aeff8935ab33"><span>or, transcribed here, read</span></a><span>) for anyone interested in Mantel’s work, historical fiction, and the study of history in general. One selection from it in particular is worth quoting at length here.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Evidence is always partial,” Mantel says. “Facts are not truth, though they are part of it—information is not knowledge. And history is not the past—it is the method we have evolved of organizing our ignorance of the past. It’s the record of what’s left on the record. It’s the plan of the positions taken, when we stop the dance to note them down. It’s what’s left in the sieve when the centuries have run through it—a few stones, scraps of writing, scraps of cloth. It’s no more ‘the past’ than a birth certificate is a birth, or a script is a performance, or a map is a journey. It’s the multiplication of the evidence of fallible and biased witnesses, combined with incomplete accounts of actions not fully understood by the people who performed them. It’s no more than the best we can do, and often it falls short of that.”</span></p> <p><span>Given the added layer of remove that historical </span><i><span>fiction</span></i><span> involves, the genre requires something like an interpretation of an interpretation to function. “Historical accuracy” is only possible in a pretty slight sense, in games like </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</span></i><span>. Because of this, it’s usually more worthwhile to consider what a game’s interpretation of history tells us about its artistic and dramatic priorities, rather than to get mired in examinations of whether a game is “realistic” or not. There’s more value in figuring out what, consciously or not, a game says about the time period it’s set within—and what that might mean for how we imagine our present-day reality.</span></p> <p><span>When you take this approach, one aspect of this year’s historical video games that sticks out is how much they’re invested in nature. Though built and played on computers, each of the above games is obsessed with translating the experience of inhabiting the natural landscape of the past.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641214"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641214">©Deep Silver</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Deliverance 2</span></i><span>, for instance, involves a lot of walking and riding around storybook Central European landscapes, from densely wooded forests and rolling green fields, to pleasantly burbling brooks. </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>both take a kind of maximalist approach to their landscapes, cramming as much Japanese iconography as possible into their sprawling maps. In their visions of the 16</span><span>th</span><span> and 17</span><span>th</span><span> centuries, bamboo forests grow thick just a few minutes’ horse ride away from snow-covered cliffs or stands of trees dropping fiery red, orange, and yellow autumn leaves. Cherry blossoms twirl on the wind in one part of the map, while winter arrives with gusts of freezing wind and iced-over ponds a stone’s throw away. In </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, the sun bakes grassy fields, with purple flowers blossoming in punctuation, and valleys dip down into riverbeds, all with Mount Etna smouldering on the horizon.</span></p> <p><span>There’s a sense, in each game, that the past is a place of greater beauty than the present — that the Kingdom of Bohemia, Japan, and Sicily were better, in some fundamental sense, during a time long before us. This is true, in some senses. Before industrialization, the landscapes of every one of the regions featured in these games would have been more vibrant. </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, taking place in the early 20</span><span>th</span><span> century, shows this in alternating vistas of unspoiled rural landscapes and those blighted by the growth of factories, their smokestacks and machinery cutting across what might have been a picturesque canyon. There are also, of course, battlefields in each game. </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>’s are smaller in scale, consisting of burning warehouses and ancient ruins strewn with newly killed bodies, but the others are grander. </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Deliverance 2</span></i><span> feature castle sieges and swordfights, with dozens of soldiers rushing at one another to struggle and die on ramparts and in fields, leaving their corpses to fill ditches or lie unburied in courtyards.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641215"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641215">©2K</figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span> aside, the ugliness of these battlefields still possesses a romantic element, as if the dead bodies and breached fortresses are tapestries and paintings showing a time when war was waged with something like dignity. The guns and explosions are primitive, their effect nothing like the city-annihilating rockets and automatic fire of latter eras. Their battles, like their natural world, seems better than ours. There’s a romance to their brutality, a heroism to their killing.</span></p> <h2>The Kinds Of Stories We Tell Ourselves</h2> <p><span>The downside of this romanticism is that it has a way of obscuring our picture of the past — of its fantasies overtaking reality to present something easier to imagine. In the 19</span><span>th</span><span> and 20</span><span>th</span><span> centuries, an idealized historical image gave rise to the romantic nationalism of regions across the world, pulling from old epics and folk traditions to create newly narrowed visions of ethnic belonging. It’s not hard for the cultural imagination to move from praising the beauty of a region’s landscapes and the valor of its ancestors to applying an exclusionary outlook to its possible citizenry or promoting a vision of ethnic supremacy within and outside of its borders. A version of this thinking led to the fascist governments of countries like the Second World War’s Axis Powers: Italy, Germany, and Japan. It lives on today, in the national romance of countries across the world whose governments appeal to an ethnically or religiously homogenous past in order to justify discriminatory or violent policies at home and abroad.</span></p> <p><span>Because a people’s history plays such an essential part in this process, historical fiction, like all historical art, can be a fraught genre. The first </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> revolves around what’s depicted as a foreign invasion, resisted by its virtuous Czech characters. Along with its creator’s insistence on an all-white cast of characters, it presents a version of the past with unsavory implications for the present. (I wrote about this more back when the game came out, in a piece I’m</span><a href="https://unwinnable.com/2018/03/02/deliverance-myth-making-and-historical-accuracy/"> <span>linking here</span></a><span> to avoid repeating myself). Its sequel maintains certain issues from the first game, but it also complicates its portrayal with a greater emphasis on the prejudices of its era and the universal horrors faced by those living at the whims of their society’s upper classes. </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span> has problems similar to those of </span><i><span>Deliverance</span></i><span>. Like the sequel, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>, its late 13</span><span>th</span><span>-century Japan is an idealized abstraction of cultural iconography, its contortions of another foreign invasion presenting a story of honor-obsessed, movie-influenced samurai fending off Mongol conquest. (At the time of </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>’s release, Kazuma Hashimoto</span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21333631/ghost-of-tsushima-kurosawa-films-samurai-japan-abe-politics/"> <span>dug into this issue</span></a><span>, as did</span><a href="https://bulletpointsmonthly.com/2020/08/06/spectre-of-fascism-ghost-of-tsushima"> <span>Andrew Kiya</span></a><span>, and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/08/14/like-ghost-tsushima-heres-what-you-may-not-know-about-samurai/"> <span>me, too</span></a><span>.)</span></p>

 <p><span>By moving the setting from an era of nationalist mythmaking to the beginning of the Edo or Tokugawa period, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> sidesteps some of the thornier issues that its still-romantic vision of Japan presents. The main conflict in the game is between Japanese characters, with Atsu’s hunt for the Yotei Six focused on personal tragedies borne not of foreign interference but of civil war. Like </span><i><span>Deliverance 2 </span></i><span>and, in a much weaker plot, </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> is mostly concerned with the ways in which ordinary people’s lives are torn apart by wars waged by the rulers of feudal societies. Atsu and the villains who killed her family are all driven to further violence by the aftereffects of the civil wars that wracked Japan until the consolidation of power under the Tokugawa shogunate, which takes place shortly before the events of the game begin. The Yotei Six’s leader, Saito, controls Hokkaido as the informal, fictional “Shogun of the North” at the time the plot starts, but his massacre of Atsu’s family takes place while he was a bandit leader, living in desperation as an exile who fought on the losing side of the Battle of Nagashino. Rather than portray its main characters as people possessing some intrinsic cultural heroism or villainy, </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>brings its drama down to a more human level.</span></p> <p><span>This choice goes a long way toward sidestepping the implications of </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>’s romantic view of history. But the game’s setting, in early 17</span><span>th</span><span>-century Hokkaido, introduces other wrinkles. Though the Ainu, a people indigenous to Hokkaido and nearby islands, are represented in-game, they’re largely ancillary to the plotline—a bit of local culture to spot between the greater focus on mainland Japanese characters, like the real-world Matsumae clan, who are represented in </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> as fighting to emancipate Hokkaido of Saito’s rule. In the real world, the Matsumae were instrumental in the early process of colonizing the Ainu, which would continue for centuries until the 19</span><span>th</span><span>-century formation of Imperial Japan increased the brutality of the project, emulating the horrific European model to</span><a href="https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/ainu-beyond-politics-cultural-coexistence"> <span>subjugate and assimilate</span></a><span> the Ainu people.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>’s representation of Ainu characters is, in some ways, commendable for the fact that it exists at all. The presence of characters like a saddle maker, bemoaning the arrival of immigrants who bring new violence to his land, or traders selling crafts and clothes, is important because it offers a corrective to the usual erasure of the Ainu people in popular depictions of Japan. But their marginal participation in the game’s main plotline makes the Hokkaido of </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> too similar to the first game’s Tsushima. It creates a romantic </span><i><span>feeling</span></i><span> of Japan based on a gloss of history that’s not always inaccurate, in the sense of detail, but misses the complicated texture that a less mythologically inclined story might have embraced.</span></p> <p><span>Embracing these complications, as all of 2025’s historical fiction games show, often results in the most compelling narratives, too.</span></p>

 <p><span>The inclusion of Yasuke, an African samurai, as one of </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span>’ two main characters offers one example of these complications. </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> isn’t a great game, and its storytelling is largely too flat to make good on either of its protagonists’ plotlines, but Yasuke’s personal story arc is more engaging than the otherwise thin revenge story that takes more precedence. Rather than the totally isolated country depicted in so many games set in a similar time period, </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> reminds its players that Japan, a country whose samurai stories often take place within the isolationism of the Tokugawa era, was always part of a larger world. Just as </span><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span> couples Sicily’s pastoral beauty with the bloodshed of organized crime and industrialism, factories like engorged ticks feasting on the landscape, </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> features Portuguese slave traders disrupting a romantic vision of Japan with the intrusion of the global politics of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in her </span><i><span>Reith Lecture</span></i><span>, Mantel states that “readers are touchingly loyal to the first history they learn—and if you challenge it, it’s as if you’re taking away their childhoods.” She could as easily be talking about the</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511"> <span>aggrieved internet reaction</span></a><span> to Yasuke’s inclusion in </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> as any other work of historical fiction that challenges a culturally dominant vision of the past. Some audiences might be comforted by samurai stories that deny the influence of the outside world on a bygone Japan, just as the inclusion of the same broader scope</span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-discuss-woke-diversity-complaints-culture-war/"> <span>prompted backlash</span></a><span> to </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span>’s sequel. Others might find themselves intrigued to discover new dimensions to their understanding of an historical era. Or, as Mantel puts it: “For a person who seeks safety and authority, history is the wrong place to look. Any worthwhile history is a constant state of self-questioning, just as any worthwhile fiction is.”</span></p>

 <p><span>At its best, historical fiction is able to capture just how alien the world before us might have looked to our eyes while reminding us, too, that even the most unfamiliar stories from our past are part of a universal human narrative, interconnected and complex. History, in all its forms, isn’t simple, because humanity isn’t simple. The Middle Ages and early modern period weren’t stage plays. They, too, were times when people were perpetrators and victims of violence and dislocation, the recipients and providers of courageous and kind acts. How the past looks varies from person to person, culture to culture, nation to nation. It’s a vast expanse, with known and unknown territory alike to explore. It is, essentially, a story we tell about ourselves, sometimes through the plots of video games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> and the other games mentioned above are entertainment, but they’re also recitals of these stories. They’re one of the many stages on which we make sense of everything that’s led to our present day. It’s worthwhile to want what happens in them to reflect the complexity of the lives that have come before our own.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-mafia-old-country-ac-shadows-kingdom-come-deliverance-historical-fiction-games-2000641188]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a>, the first-person soulslike action game set in an alt-history Napoleonic era, is out next year. And with developer One More Level especially pushing the “Soulslike”-ness of the whole thing, it seems only natural that at some point before or after launch there’s going to be a discussion about the game’s difficulty - is it too hard? Is it hard enough? Should it have an easy mode, or something else?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty discussion, of course, is one that crops up every time a new Souls game is released. What makes difficulty fun, and what makes it obnoxious? Should games have easy modes? What sorts of accessibility features are helpful to ensure everyone can play the game and experience its design friction as intended, without experiencing other, undesirable friction due to controls or other functions?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played Valor Mortis at the Game Industry Conference in Poznań, Wielkopolska, and while I’m only of middling Soulslike skills, I can confirm it’s pretty tough! I also spoke with game director Radosław Ratusznik, who says that the team is still in discussions as to how they will approach all this. For now, he says, Valor Mortis just has one difficulty setting. But that may change in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we decide at one point to change it, I think we will change it for easy mode and normal mode, just two of them. Because I think that players should have similar experiences when they're playing these kinds of games. So personally, I'm fine with the easy mode, if someone wants to just experience the story, learn a little bit about how the game works. But if we have a lot of options, like there are like tens of difficulty options, then each person can play a totally different game. I think what connects Soulslike players is that they are all struggling in these games. If they manage to succeed in this game, they can share this experience with other players. And this is something that has a huge value I think for them, for this community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s nuance here, because while Ratusznik may be against having ten difficulty options ranging from Story Mode to Ultra Hard Giga Death Difficulty, he agrees that discussions around difficulty often don’t take into account the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/05/sekiro-accessibility-in-games-is-about-far-more-than-difficulty"><u>nuance of accessibility</u></a>. He’s not a fan, for instance, of games that let you turn on and off certain mechanics (such as parries), because he thinks that players “lose something from this experience.” But he also adds that, as far as accessibility goes, “we can have a lot of things that can assist you without lowering the difficulty of the game.” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-difficulty-accessibility-easy-mode-debate"><u>Accessibility isn’t solved with an easy mode</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Soulslikes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ratusznik isn’t alone in this belief. FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/hidetaka-miyazaki-sees-death-as-a-feature-not-a-bug" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said similar of Elden Ring</u></a>, “We are always looking to improve, but, in our games specifically, hardship is what gives meaning to the experience. So it’s not something we’re willing to abandon at the moment. It’s our identity.” But also notably, Elden Ring was far more flexible than FromSoftware’s past games in the ways in which it allowed players to eventually conquer challenges. You could outlevel bosses to make them trivially easy if you wandered off and defeated enough weaker enemies, there are some builds that turn certain bosses into jokes, and there’s so much to do in the game and so many paths to victory that if you’re struggling with something, Elden Ring encourages you to leave and do something else. Another recent Soulslike, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is similar in this structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How Valor Mortis will ultimately handle its difficulty remains to be seen, as Ratusznik himself says that the team is still working out what they want to do. We won’t know til next year when the game launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also spoke to Ratusznik at GIC about Valor Mortis’ soulslike credentials, and why it’s challenging to make a game in that tradition in the first-person. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valor-mortis-dev-dares-fans-to-question-the-games-soulslike-credentials-if-you-are-not-sure-about-it-challenge-us">You can read our conversation right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Fan response to the new season and its highly-detailed map has been positive, and Epic Games seems pleased with player numbers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In 48 hours, we welcomed the biggest number of new and returning <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players since last holiday season," the developer wrote in a social media <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1985776844571107624" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. "The first Fortnite | The Simpsons short popped to #1 on Disney+ today in the US. Move over Shelbyville..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite's player numbers have dipped somewhat this year, amid tough competition from Roblox and a string of battle royale seasons that feel like they haven't landed with fans quite as expected. In September, during the game's alien bug season, the game's average daily numbers briefly sagged to around half a million players, though player counts then rallied as Fortnite began its annual Halloween celebrations.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build the LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While 2.6 million players this past weekend is impressive, Fortnite has recorded several higher player spikes this year for other events. A peak of 5.7 million players logged in on June 7 for Death Star Sabotage, the game's live event that served as the finale of its Star Wars mini-season. Fortnite also saw a spike to 3.9 million players on August 2 for its superhero season finale, and 3.3 million players for the launch of its Daft Punk Experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What remains to be seen is how many of those new and returning players stick around over the rest of this month, as Fortnite's The Simpsons season culminates in a big live event on November 29. This is expected to usher in the game's next big era — Chapter Seven — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting">that looks set to feature a crossover with Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and, potentially, the return of Fortnite's heroic Seven faction</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/05/nintendo-makes-the-switch-2-its-primary-development-focus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-makes-the-switch-2-its-%E2%80%9Cprimary-development-focus%E2%80%9D-as-though-it-wasn%E2%80%99t-already.1344199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has confirmed that they are shifting to have the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> be their “primary development focus” going forward, indicating that cross-gen game releases will become far from the norm after 2026.</p>
<p>The company plainly states that “Going forward, we will shift our primary development focus to Nintendo Switch 2 and expand our business around this new platform.”</p>


<p>It’s a small statement from Nintendo’s latest quarterly financial report, which saw the company announce that the Switch 2 has continued its record-setting launch and has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/the-switch-2-sold-over-10-million-consoles-in-just-4-months/">already sold more than 10 million consoles after just four months</a> – selling faster than the original Switch, PS5 and PS4 through the same time span. With such rapid early momentum, it absolutely makes sense that Nintendo can focus more directly on the new generation of console.</p>
<p>This means that cross-gen games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-preview-worth-the-wait/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> will remain rare and fleeting. Metroid Prime 4 has been in development for so long (and is a relative niche for Nintendo) that it makes sense for it still to receive a cross-gen release when it arrives in December, while Pokémon always needs to try and reach as large an audience as possible… but then enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-hit-5-8-million-sales-and-half-of-them-are-on-switch-2/">around 50% of its launch sales on the newer system</a>.</p>
<p>2025 has already shown that Nintendo is all-in on the Nintendo Switch 2, launching with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> following shortly afterwards. Through the rest of this year, we still have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> to release as well.</p>

<p>For 2026, it’s also very heavy on the Switch 2 exclusives, with Pokémon Pokopia, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-announced-for-switch-2/">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/splatoon-raiders-is-a-fresh-switch-2-exclusive-spinoff-and-theres-a-big-update-for-splatoon-3-too/">Splatoon Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/mario-tennis-fever-swings-onto-switch-2-in-february/">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</a> all announced for next year. They’re also continuing to announce and release Switch 2 Edition upgrades for Switch games, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-revealed/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-is-coming-next-year/">Super Mario Wonder</a> both enhancing and expanding two big hits for the newer hardware.</p>
<p>That said, there are still some titles coming to original Switch, including Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, Rhythm Heaven Groove, and Pokémon Champions – all games that benefit from as large a potential audience as possible.</p>

			<p>A Steam Deck highly-requested feature has finally arrived with a new Beta Client update that went live a few hours ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/eventcomments/725769023703421533">The official November 4 Beta Client update notes</a> confirm that the system now features display-off low power downloads. This feature allows the Steam Deck to complete all active downloads in a new display-off mode before going to sleep. This feature is enabled by default when the system is plugged in to power, and can be toggled on and off by going into Settings and then Power.</p>



<p>The new Steam Deck Beta Client update also fixes a couple of additional issues, swuch as SteamOS updates failing to respect HTTP proxy configuration and regression where the performance graph wouldn't display while streaming.</p>



<p>The new Steam Deck display-off low-power downloads feature was further detailed in a dedicated blog post, which outlined the two ways to access the feature. The first way is to press the power button while the system is downloading content, which will bring up a new dialog box asking the user if they wish to continue downloading with the display off.</p>



<p>The second way is automatic, as the system will go into this mode after an idle timeout. Pressing a button after this happens will bring up a new status screen with the download progress, from where the user can either wake the system up completely or let it continue downloading in the new low power mode.</p>



<p>The new feature introduced in the latest Steam Deck Beta Client update is just one of the many improvements that have been added to the system launched in 2022, which helped kick-start the handheld PC gaming market. You can learn more about the portable system by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Kai Tatsumoto's review</a>. If you already own the system and want to make the most out of it, you should also consider the Chizha Mount Ling Dock, which&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-chizha-mount-ling-dock-review/">we reviewed last month.</a></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Awooga, awooga, the bomb's about to be dropped. Well, the anniversary edition update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s about to arrive at any rate. As with its next-gen predecessor, the question is how it might affect whatever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fallout-4-mods-2">established mod load order</a> you've got in place. Helpfully, Bethesda have now specified any mods which change the game's home screen as ones you'll certainly want to disable ahead of the update's arrival.</p>
<p>That's right, time to kiss farewell to the image of Paladin Danse in a risque pose you've had lurking behind the start new game button. At least temporarily.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ahead of the update launching and bringing with it a revamp of Fallout 4's creation club menu, Bethesda have announced that their official in-game modding structure via Bethesda.net "will undergo maintenance from November 6th through 10th".</p>
<p>"During this time, Fallout 4 Mods and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creation-club">Creation Club</a> will be offline. And while you won't be able to download or upload any new content, you will still have access to change your mod load order and play the game," the studio continued. "The Fallout 4 update on November 10th will require adjustments to the main menu screen. So, prior to November 10th, please disable any mods which change the main menu, as these may break with the patch."</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>While you might end up being able to get away with certain mods, my view as a frequent mod user is that you're likely best off temporarily disabling all of your mods if you're desperate to jump into the game right after the update drops and are able to do so. It's frustrating, but if there's one thing you can set your watch by, it's that updates to games always have the potential to result in mods requiring updates of their own to keep working as intended. It sucks, as we saw with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4-gets-some-further-tweaks-to-its-mod-destroying-next-gen-update">Fallout 4's next-gen update</a>, but it's a fact of life that comes with the territory and - trying to look at the glass as half full - an excuse to totally refresh your mod setup for a game if you want to.</p>
<p>You can, of course, also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-is-out-today-and-might-break-your-mods-heres-how-to-stop-it">disable the game's ability to auto-update</a> and keep on playing the pre-anniversary update version of it. Instructions as to how to do that on Steam, Epic, and GOG can be found <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13480381-how-to-stop-fallout-4-from-updating-steamgogxbox/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Fallout 4's next-gen update, this anniversary one also sees Bethesda finally deal with some lingering issues which, at least in one case, have been milling around for a year and a bit. "VATS hit chances are now consistent across platforms and no longer drop to 0% or show incorrect values," reads one of these fixes. "Targeting enemies through walls without the Penetrator perk is no longer possible." While the only instance I've found <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-2-texture-fix-vats-issues">showing this happening</a> is from an Xbox player, so I'm not sure if it was as pesky a problem in the PC realm, it's nice to see Bethesda finally sort it.</p>
<p>You can read the full notes in the update post I've embedded. If you want a full rundown of what Fallout 4's anniversary version includes and the couple of other bits Bethesda announced in their Fallout day broadcast this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-fallout-4-and-new-vegas-again-say-bethesda-and-also-a-release-date-for-fallout-76s-burning-springs">here you go</a>. Now, excuse me while I purge <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/80650">many instances of Walton Goggins' face</a> from The Commonwealth ahead of this update.</p>

<p>We could finally be getting PS5 &amp; PC cross-buy capabilities as the symbol has been discovered in PlayStation Store data. While it’s not official, the new report means that PlayStation is testing the waters with PS5 &amp; cross-buy, and owners of both platforms could be in for dual-entitlement sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>For the longest time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-games-for-november-2025-wave-1-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-insomniacs-spider-man-will-be-playable-on-next-xbox-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> owners have been able to enjoy cross-buy purchases. Meaning, you can buy a game on Xbox and also play the title on PC, and vice versa. If a new report is accurate, PC players might be about to get the best of both worlds.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-could-be-getting-ps5-amp-pc-cross-buy">We Could Be Getting PS5 &amp; PC Cross-Buy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This would be big. Credit to PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p>News first broke on November 4 that new symbols had been discovered in the PlayStation Store’s files. The initial findings came from X account <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amethxst</a>.</p>



<p>They said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>New Symbols will be added soon (website &amp; tool), but here some nice new features from PlayStation (yes, some are old, other are unseen): A kind of “echo mode,” “PS5/PC games,” and “Cross-Buy.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The message also showed the symbols, what they look like, and it all seemed very real.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Symbols will be added soon (website &amp; tool), but here some nice new features from PlayStation (yes, some are old, other are unseen):<br>– A kind of "echo mode"<br>– PS5/PC games<br>– "Cross-Buy" <a href="https://t.co/YxIAXp750g">pic.twitter.com/YxIAXp750g</a></p>— Amethxst (@yAmethxst) <a href="https://twitter.com/yAmethxst/status/1985788815030861860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>It was a big, yet confident statement, but there has been a fair amount of trepidation about the potential claim. However, reliable outlet <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-cross-buy-ps5-pc-en-preparation-chez-playstation-voici-les-resultats-de-notre-enquete-60757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> has done some testing into the matter: “We decided to conduct our own investigation on the new symbols discovered, but especially on their date of addition to determine if they are not really old symbols.”</p>



<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun described how they were “<strong>Inserting special characters in the “About” section of our PlayStation Network account. And the result does indeed show that these symbols actually exist.</strong>“</p>



<p>More evidence was found on top of this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Before the addition of these symbols, other clues were present through the PlayStation Store data. In some of the site’s CSS files, we also discovered&nbsp;the mention of “<strong>crossbuy-tag</strong>”&nbsp;in some properties of the file.</p>



<p>We tried to reproduce this CSS style on text and the result corresponds exactly to the symbol found on consoles. The result is shown in the image below. You can also do the test by yourself through this&nbsp;<a href="https://codepen.io/billbil-kun/pen/ByjEXZw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">template created by us on CodePen</a>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reef Entertainment has confirmed that Terminator 2D: No Fate has been delayed to December 12, 2025. </p>



<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate has been delayed multiple times since its release date announcement. The game’s release was initially pushed back to October 2025 due to issues with the physical edition. It was then moved to November 2025 due to global trade and tariff changes. Now it has been delayed again due to more physical edition hurdles. </p>

The devs have sincerely apologized for the repeated delays. </p>

            <p>It's never too late to release your game on console, apparently. Nearly 30 years later, Namco's Tokyo Wars is getting a PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and Xbox release. It's almost as old as me! (Keep a straight face, Bertie, keep a straight face.)</p>
<p>Tokyo Wars is a tank-battling game that first arrived in arcades in 1996, complete with racing car-like cabinets for you to sit in and steer your tank from. The idea of the game was simple: drive around downtown Tokyo, in a tank, and blow things up - either computer-controlled enemies or tanks controlled by other players. You could rumble over cars and even collapse tunnels. It was impressive at the time!</p>

<p>The console release, which happens tomorrow - 6th November - arrives courtesy of a company called Hamster and its Arcade Archives range. This revival of Tokyo Wars comes in two variations, the biggest difference between the two being the addition of four-player split-screen multiplayer. You cannot access this on Switch 1 and PlayStation 4, but you can on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PlayStation 5, and the Xbox Series consoles.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://www.arcadearchives.com/en/title/aca-385/">more detailed Tokyo Wars information on the Arcade Archives website</a>, should you want it. The game costs $15 or $17 depending on which version you want.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco produced a spiritual successor to Tokyo Wars in 2009, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tank-tank-tank-review">Tank! Tank! Tank!, which Donlan reviewed and sadly didn't think was very good</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hardware-rivals-review">Sony's online multiplayer game Hardware Rivals</a> clearly took a hefty does of inspiration from the game, too, in 2016.</p>
<p>Arcade Archives has brought back games like the original Ridge Racer, King of Fighters '98, Splatter House, Galaga and many, many more. There are pages of games listed on its website.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you're a fan of old games coming back to life, make sure you also check Digital Eclipse's peerless recent documentary-slash-restoration work for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration">Atari</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat</a>, <a href="http://r/">Jeff Minter</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-making-of-the-making-of-karateka">Karateka</a> and more.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/generation-exile">Generation Exile</a> is the new eco-conscious turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy sim</a> from Sonderlust Studios, a Canada-based independent developer whose members include Nels Anderson (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark of the Ninja</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>), Karla Zimonja (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tacoma">Tacoma</a>), and Marri Knadle (Far Cry 5 &amp; 6). A talented gang indeed. The game puts you in charge of a scrappy band of humans living on a colony ship so huge it can harbour mountain ranges and lakes. 
</p>
<p>
The ship puts me heavily in mind of the grandest and most luxurious vessels from Iain M. Banks's Culture novels, except that it's a polluted and treacherous hexagonal wilderness that is closer in vibe to Scavenger's Reign. Your job is to emerge from below decks, bolt together an outpost, and restore each sprawling biome before the colony ship completes its journey. Along the way, you'll have to reckon with personality dynamics and branching dialogue quests redolent of 11-Bit's management sims, and deal with some kind of marauding "entity" from the Earth you left behind.

<p>
I had a quick go of Generation Exile's early access build yesterday, and have bleary, late-night Thoughts that are very much not a proper review. I really like the premise, though I've seen it before in the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ixion">Ixion</a>, and the glowing, bacterial aesthetics. The game operates according to the principle of a circular economy. Some of the resources at your disposal are finite, requiring you to dismantle structures (and reduce those tiles to unbuildable rubble) everytime you build something else. One mechanic I'm especially keen on so far is power. Rather than building nuclear reactors and suchlike, this sees you retiring the atmosphere scrubbers that surround your emergence hole to free up juice. The trade-off is that the surrounding habitat will grow less stable.
</p><p>
As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-nil">Terra Nil</a>, the habitat restoration stuff is heavily shaded by real-world environmental clean-up strategies. When you encounter a body of water, for example, it's advisable to install an algal bioreactor to purge excess nitrates. Then you'll want to invest in a granulizer to process and store the resulting sludge. We're a far cry from building Orc huts in Warcraft, aren't we. Rather than there being a research component, you get new techs and building types once certain conditions are fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
When building in regions that have gone a bit sickly, you'll have to complete a task check, which sees you assigning named, backstoried crewmates with relevant skills to offset a stack of crisis counters. The outcome of these task checks is to raise the odds of either a miraculous windfall of some kind - possibly an actual windfall - or a cataclysm, as illustrated by an icon of a meteor (I hope there won't be any actual meteors).</p>
<p>There are also pop-up quests that might see you, for example, deciding how to deal with a renegade lifeform that has snuck inside a silo. The game's writing is perhaps more New Weird than solarpunk, encouraging the player to embrace a certain level of hideous posthuman infestation rather than aiming to deck the landscape in squeaky clean windmills.
</p>
<p>
There's plenty of terminology to chew through. I can't work out if that abundance of terminology is why my opening playthrough ran out of steam, though it's perhaps a question of overall presentation. There are icons for building states, and arching lines to indicate relationships, but I struggled to work out how to, for example, feed my habitats to produce adequate crew for technician training in order to run my vertical gardens, which I need to feed my habitats.</p>
<p>I think some of this confusion is due to end-of-day brain, mind. Again, this ain't a review! I'm keen to play more and see if something clicks. Or squelches. Or stridulates. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963240/Generation_Exile/">You can find Generation Exile on Steam</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> players on PC are editing their game files to force crossplay off, in an attempt to avoid console players.</p>
<p>By going into Battlefield 6's Steam files, specifically the PROFSAVE profile, people can add a single line of code that turns off crossplay. <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1985715884455817538">This trick was posted on Twitter by Swedish competitive gamer Ottr</a>, who claims - at the moment - it'll place those who attempt it into bot lobbies due to a lack of players making use of this little tweak. However, they hope (if it catches on) they might be able to get "solid games".</p>
<p>As for why players are doing this? Well, console players almost entirely use standard controllers to play Battlefield 6 across Xbox Series and PS5 machines. These controllers offer less accuracy than a keyboard &amp; mouse, and as such Battlefield Studios (as well as the developers of many, many other games) offer a degree of aim assist to bridge the gap between hardware.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-lead-confirms-aim-assist-is-getting-nerfed-but-the-25-percent-recoil-reduction-is-staying-for-now-the-stickiness-straight-up-kills-you-if-theres-multiple-enemies/">It's worth noting that Battlefield 6's aim assist <em>is</em> getting nerfed in the near future</a>, though the 25 percent recoil reduction for controller users is going to stick around for a while longer at least. So those being burned by controller users should hopefully feel a little less frustration moving forward.</p><p>This aim assist, in the mind of a significant portion of PC FPS players, provides an unfair advantage. As such, tweaking the files to turn off crossplay provides matches free from 'console scrubs', as it were. This, however, would not prevent players on PC from just plugging in a controller and taking advantage of aim assist that way. This, in theory, shouldn't be a problem, though. The assumption being that those willing to take these steps to disable crossplay are specifically looking for a controller-less experience.</p>
<p>The gripes against aim assist are not solely a Battlefield thing. In fact, the more competitive-minded Call of Duty community often rage endlessly at the advantages granted to console players when it comes to aim assist. The same is true for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, which, to be fair, has perhaps laid on the aim assist a little strong in the past.</p>
<p>As easy as some find it to put anti aim-assist players in a box marked tryhard, it's worth asking, how would you feel if you were beaten by another player given advantages not available to you? Some aim assistance is obviously fine, in fact, it's probably necessary in this age of cross-platform play. But lather it on a touch too thick? You might find some of your better players feeling sour, and not without reason.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Nintendo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/">excellent quarterly and half-year results</a>, President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a 61-page document</a> with investors detailing the Japanese game and console manufacturer's strategy going forward.</p>



<p>Nintendo is mainly focused on keeping the momentum after the launch of the Switch 2 with a schedule filled with first-party releases, such as Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we just reviewed</a>), Kirby Air Riders, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, Pokémon Pokopia, and Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave. But Furukawa also boasted that the console offers the 'largest third-party software lineup for a new Nintendo hardware ever', increasing appeal for those gamers who aren't content with just first-party offerings.</p>



<p>Furukawa recognized that demand has exceeded the company's expectations in certain regions, resulting in ongoing shortages of Switch 2 systems. After apologizing for the inconvenience, he remarked that Nintendo will continue striving to deliver a stable supply of hardware.</p>



<p>With such a strong wind at their backs, it's no wonder Nintendo is now looking to reinvest in several key areas. One of those, according to the document, is the acquisition of game developers. This is not something that the Japanese company is particularly known for, although there have been a few exceptions, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-acquires-luigis-mansion-3-and-metroid-prime-federation-force-developer-next-level-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021's acquisition of Next Level Games</a>. </p>



<p>That studio had already partnered with Nintendo to make games like Luigi's Mansion 3. Should the same criteria be maintained in future acquisitions, possible targets could include Game Freak, HAL Laboratory, and Intelligent Systems, which have often worked on Nintendo IPs. When it comes to Western studios, the most likely option is MercurySteam, the Spanish developer that worked on two Metroid 2D games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-points-to-mandated-crunch-at-mercurysteam-metroid-dread-blades-of-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Its troubled financial situation</a> may prompt MercurySteam to accept such an offer.</p>



<ul>
<li><em>First is strengthening game development. We will work to strengthen the internal game development organization within the Nintendo group. This includes initiatives such as acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries and augmenting our development facilities, and the construction of Corporate Headquarters Development Center, Building No. 2 (tentative name).</em></li>



<li><em>Second is building software assets in non-game entertainment. Taking into account the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we will allocate funds to more actively pursue business opportunities that have an affinity with our game business, including but not limited to movies.</em></li>



<li><em>Third is the foundation for maintaining and expanding our relationships with consumers. We will utilize funds to maintain and expand our touchpoints with consumers, centered on the Nintendo Account system.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Furukawa also stated that funds will be dedicated to pursuing additional business opportunities to expand the company's assets beyond videogames. There's The Super Mario Galaxy Movie <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in April 2026</a>, not to mention the Zelda live action film scheduled to air <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-live-action-movie-slated-for-march-26-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 26, 2027</a>. Lastly, the Nintendo president aims to utilize the Nintendo Account, which has been created by more than 400 million people to date, to connect Nintendo with consumers and foster long-term relationships with them. </p>



<p>This multi-sided strategy appears to be the best approach to engage with both existing and new fans, although, of course, only time will tell whether it pans out as the company hopes.</p>

            <p>In 'Yeahhh, probably should have had that already' news, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> are getting a new low-power mode that will let the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">handheld PCs</a> continue any active downloads with the display switched off. It’s part of a SteamOS update that’s available right now on the Beta and Preview channels, at last closing a longstanding feature gap that’s had us all downloading games to our Decks with the screens chewing up precious battery life. Like <em>savages</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984">Valve’s announcement post</a>, you’ll be prompted to continue with display-off downloads when pressing the power button while an installation or update is in progress. The Deck will also enter this low-power mode after an idle timeout. You can check the download progress by pressing any button or, thanks to the internal gyroscopes, giving the resting Steam Deck a little nudge. Once the downloads finish, it’ll go enter sleep mode proper.</p>
<p>And that’s about it. While this addition is unlikely to be the difference-maker for anyone choosing between a SteamOS handheld or a Windows machine like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, the absence of a low-power downloads mode has felt like an odd omission for the Steam Deck – a device that Valve have otherwise been very savvy about imbuing with the quality-of-life features enjoyed by, whisper it, consoles. Quick suspend/resume, simplified system and driver updates, a UI that isn’t hateful when navigating it with thumbsticks, all that good stuff.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that I, specifically, could have done with this update a few days earlier, after setting my own Deck to mass-update on glacial hotel Wi-Fi last week and having to leave the room convinced its humming display would either attract thieves or start a fire. It didn’t. But it could have. You don’t know.</p>

<p>Minecraft has received a Dragon Ball Z DLC out of nowhere, adding Goku, Vegeta, and more to the game with different battle game modes. </p>



<p>Minecraft has been receiving really extensive DLCs lately, which don’t just add cosmetics, but new worlds and gameplay elements to the title. We saw this with the Superman DLC in September, where players could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-players-can-use-supermans-abilities-in-new-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the Man of Steel’s abilities</a>. Now, the Dragon Ball Z DLC has arrived, and it is receiving a similar treatment. </p>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-s-dragon-ball-z-dlc-will-let-players-enter-solo-co-op-or-5v5-free-for-all-showdowns">Minecraft’s Dragon Ball Z DLC Will Let Players Enter Solo, Co-Op, or 5v5 Free For All Showdowns </h2>



<p>Minecraft’s Dragon Ball Z DLC is available now to purchase for 1,510 Minecoins on the Minecraft <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp/cyclone/dragon-ball-z/4730409a-ba78-416b-9589-6d089218047c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marketplace</a>. In this DLC, players will receive 11 new characters: Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Frieza, Trunks, Krillin, Android 18, Cell, Android 17, and Majin Buu. Some of these characters will also have Super Saiyan forms. Moreover, several iconic locations from the popular anime will make their way to the game, too, including Cell Games Arena, World Martial Arts Tournament Arena, Planet Namek, Capsule Corp, and more. </p>



<p>Furthermore, these are not just cosmetics; players will be able to bring out their inner Z warrior with the new Dragon Ball Z DLC for Minecraft. From the trailer, we could see that players will be able to use not only Ki Blasts, but special moves for different characters, including the Kamehameha for Goku, Gallick Gun for Vegeta, Special Beam Canon for Piccolo, and more. Each character brings their own moves, ultimate attacks, and custom VFX. </p>

<p>Two new freebies will be included as well, the first is ‘Become Saiyan’, where players can stay in character inside their “own Minecraft world with this skin pack that includes every famed combatant from Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo, to Vegeta, Bulma, and Frieza.” Second is the Scouter Character Creator item, which makes players look like a member of the Frieza Force. </p>

            <p>Arc Raiders players are waging a war of words online, in addition an actual war in-game. This war is focused on the matter of violence itself, or more specifically, is violence between players in Arc Raiders bad form?</p>
<p>As an extraction shooter, Arc Raiders is by its nature a high-risk, tense experience. When out completing quests, collecting resources, or grinding out points in your weekly trials, a single player shooting you can cause a loss of all your progress. This, as you can imagine, can be frustrating, leading a substantial number of players toward taking a friendlier approach.</p>
<p>So many players, in fact, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">Arc Raiders has struck some as quite a friendly game to play</a>. Many raiders have been opting to hash things out over voice comms rather than let their bullets do the talking. However, others who are staying true to the PvP portion of the experience feel otherwise, thriving in a game where proper aim and smart play can lead one to overflowing loot from knocked-out opponents.</p>

<p>Some players, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oohnf0/i_am_a_changed_man/">including IncompetentCat on Reddit</a>, have seen the value of kindness in Arc Raiders, noting how being revived or otherwise assisted by strangers are special moments in-game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ooqzo8/i_tried_being_the_shoot_on_sight_guy/">Others have felt intense guilt</a> with a "kill-on-site" approach to solo play, hearing verbal sadness flow freely from other players upon being knocked down.</p><p>There is, of course, the other side of the argument. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oncgsr/i_mean_this_in_the_most_respectful_way_possible/">User Garbaggiogreco</a> stated outright: "As long as there is PvP in this game it will never change. Stop complaining and come up with strategies to combat against it," courting lots of agreement from the community at large. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ons1ac/for_the_small_minority_of_people_who_didnt/">Others note that the game is explicitly marked as PvP</a>, and to get upset about that is a touch silly.</p>
<p>There's also a degree of "toxic anti-PvP" behaviour, with the moderator of the Arc Raiders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olgls0/toxic_anti_pvpers_not_welcome/">stating outright in a post that people who rail against those who engage in PvP are not welcome</a>. They wrote: "You are allowed to have an opinion that such players morals in game are not good or they are ‘Villain players’ or what not, that is fine for that is what they are but any time an outside insult is going to be used on people over gameplay you are getting the hammer of doom."</p>
<p>For what it's worth, it's clear at least to me that the friendlier moments in Arc Raiders are only as special as they are <em>because</em> there's a risk of betrayal. It takes a lot to put your life and loot in the hands of someone who'd gain a lot from taking you out. Villainising PvP-focused players would lessen the magic of such moments, making the entire game a little worse. It is perhaps better to cherish those who lend an open hand, rather than decry those who stick to their closed fists.</p>

			<p>Rise of Industry 2 is an industry management game – like if you just zoned your whole city in Cities: Skylines for industry and kicked residential and commercial to the kerb. You’ll be focusing on building infrastructure to harvest, process, and ship resources out and your only real interaction with the nearby town is accepting (or refusing) grants or other support and investing to increase the available workforce. It does all of this very well, and yet it manages to be an underwhelming experience simply because…that’s all there is here.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of Industry 2 | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axcZ96ZpvEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a handy tutorial to guide you through the initial setup for your business, focusing on plastic in this case. Without this tutorial I would have been completely lost as there is a lot of stuff involved here that you might not have anticipated. Obviously you need your lots to have power and probably water, you need relevant shipping and storage facilities, you need waste facilities, the main office building for a lot, and whatever production or harvesting building is relevant. You place all these in a meticulous layout that is hopefully pleasing to your eye because it’ll be there forever, and now you’re harvesting oil! You can sell some of that crude oil by setting up a contract and arranging deliveries, but if you actually want a profit in this riff on the 1980s, you’ll want to process it into plastic.</p>


<p>So now you need a facility to process oil into plastic. This facility needs another lot with power and water, relevant shipping and storage facilities, waste, facilities, main office, and the factory that does the actual processing. Now you’re making plastic! And you can sell this, but you’re better off processing it into an end product like – video cassettes for example. This needs another lot, with power and water, relevant shipping and storage… Do you see the problem here? It’s repetition to an extreme degree. That’s realistic, certainly, but it makes for a dull game.</p>


<p>There is a hell of a lot of detail in the systems of Rise of Industry 2, building your business up can feel satisfying, from picking a resource to start with all the way through to its logical end, but once you have built one lot, all you can do is build another one. Sure you can do a bit of networking, but it’s not like you go and actually play a golf mini-game while hobnobbing with other CEOs and politicians, you just select buttons on a menu and a number to track your relationship with this person and company goes up. The worst part is that, if you do immediately build another lot, you’re probably going to haemorrhage money and go bankrupt. Big profits in big business happen on big timescales, so you can either build your lots, establish their profits and wait until you’ve accrued funds for your rainy day fund, or you can race to build another as quickly as possible, lose too much money and go bankrupt.</p>
<p>It’s like there isn’t quite enough game here, that there’s something missing to keep you busy whilst your business actually makes the money it’s there to make. When you finish developing an area of your city in Cities: Skylines, you can move somewhere else whilst it does its thing, focus on something else that needs your attention. In Rise of Industry 2, you are laser focused on your business and there’s nowhere else to go to keep busy whilst your money slowly rises. It’s a real shame as well, because there is a tonne of depth here mechanically and the actual building of your business and setting up and fulfilling contracts is enjoyable, it just doesn’t feel rewarding after the fact.</p>

<p>There are also a few issues, such as certain problems in your supply chain not always being explained through the UI, leaving you to comb through the fine details of your operation to find the fault, but I suppose that’s part of business anyway. It also unreservedly backs big business in what seemed like it could be a satirical take. You can choose to pollute as little as possible, or you can just use PR to make the consequences go away, and it doesn’t seem to matter either way provided you do one or the other. Maybe there are longer term consequences for the latter that I haven’t seen, because I can only sit and watch a number go up slowly before thinking there must be something I can do to make it go up slightly quicker…and then, following a series of poor decisions, I go bankrupt.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Rise of Industry 2 isn't bad, really. It's actually rather good at what it does, it's just that what it does isn't that entertaining. The long periods of waiting for your businesses and decisions to bear fruit.&nbsp;If you're okay with waiting around for the money to come rolling in exchange for some really quite involved logistics and industry construction, then you'll likely enjoy this. If that doesn't sound too promising to you then you might want a broader city builder, where there's more stuff to focus on.	</p></div>

            <p>After a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mod-path-to-menzoberranzan-breaks-silence-with-update-on-development-re-think-and-character-reveal-tease">scope re-evalution over the summer</a>, the modders behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> custom campaign mod Path to Menzoberranzan have set a new target in terms of releasing the a first publicly playable taste of it. An alpha build made up of a Nautiold-sized tutorial level is now pencilled in to arrive during the first half of 2026.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon">covered previously</a>, the original pitch for the project was a custom adventure that'd see you and a party of fresh companions travel to Minthara's hometown via some locations from previous Baldur’s Gates. According to the team, over 130 people are now working on making that a reality on what's being teased as a larger scale than originally envisioned.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That detail comes from a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1293115909166075915/1336275209560522762/1434696201764081675">new project summary</a> added to the mod's Discord server this week, which has now been followed by another <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1293115909166075915/1293115909166075918/1435290048235831458">monthly progress update</a> from Path to Menzoberranzan community manager Andrew Simone. "The first playable alpha will include the prologue of our game, similar in scope to the Nautiloid of BG3," reads the new summary. "It's expected to be available in the first half of 2026.</p>
<p>"While the release date of the full mod is years away, we intend to release updates over time that include new locations and further the game's narrative. How extensive those updates will be depends on both alpha/beta feedback and implementation feasibility. We want our players to experience a satisfying portion of our game's story with each new update we release, which requires more development to occur between updates, since our game features many interconnected story lines."</p><p>Simone's update meshes with that plan, its main announcement being that production on that Nautiloid-sized "tutorial level" is underway. "Our team is working diligently on the concept art and level design of this first portion of the mod," the community manager wrote, adding that with lots of work to be done the modders won't be hosting any more voice acting auditions until next year.</p>
<p>"On the technical side of things, we're upgrading our backend infrastructure to handle the MASSIVE scope this project is growing into," they continued. "To put it simply, we're setting up the same kind of systems that AAA studios use for large RPGs." As if the word massive in capital letters didn't get your attention, Simone added that in terms of the mod's makeup, this'll allow for "more voice acting. Bigger maps. Cinematics. All the content you've been asking for". </p>
<p>"We're making sure our tech can handle it without causing PCs to burst into flames," the community manager summarised. "The infrastructure we're putting in place now will allow us to deliver on our promise of creating a full original campaign." Sounds great, assuming the group are being careful not to get too carried away and end up with a project that's ballooned to a level they end up struggling to deliver. That's always a delicate and unique balance to strike when it comes to these kinds of volunteer undertakings, though, and odds are it'll be tough to tell exactly whether these modders are biting off more than they can chew until they're a lot deeper into the weeds of it.</p>
<p>That said, other big mods have proven cutting back on <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">areas</a> and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/we-had-ridiculous-scenes-happening-fallout-londons-devs-had-to-ditch-rideable-horses-and-bikes-because-they-wouldnt-stop-flying-up-buildings">features</a> if they prove too tricky and leaving them as potential boxes to reopen if there's capacity to further down the line is always a viable option. At this stage, we'll just have to see what the modders can pull off for that initial alpha whenever it ends up arriving, since it should ideally set a foundation they can build on going forwards.</p>

<p>New data from Alinea Analytics reveals that Battlefield 6 has sold over 10 million copies across all platforms. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has taken the gaming world by storm, hitting new heights of player numbers on Steam with both the full release and the battle royale mode. We already knew that BF6 had become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch in series history</a>, selling over 7 million copies. Now, it seems that the game has reached a brand new sales milestone. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-10-million-copies-may-not-be-enough-to-overturn-call-of-duty-s-overall-market-dominance">Battlefield 6’s 10 Million Copies May Not Be Enough to “Overturn Call of Duty’s Overall Market Dominance”</h2>



<p>Rhys Elliot from Alinea Analystics revealed that Battlefield 6 has surpassed 10 million copies sold across all platforms during a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameIndustry.Biz</a>. However, he feels that this momentum is not enough to overtake “Call of Duty’s overall market dominance – this year, at least.” Elliot added that Battlefield 6 has gained a lot of popularity amongst the PC players; however, Call of Duty is a “multi-platform powerhouse” whose sales base “extends far beyond Steam and the PC market.”</p>



<p>Elliot explains that Battlefield 6 is experiencing “a huge amount of goodwill” from the community, thanks to all the improvements they have made from the previous title, Battlefield 2042. Call of Duty, on the other hand, is experiencing a “perception problem” due to the inclusion of “Fortnite-esque cosmetics” and excessive repetition within the series. However, these factors will not significantly impact COD’s sales. </p>



<p>The analyst elaborated that Call of Duty has established a massive audience across PC and consoles, with a vast number of casual players comprising this player base. These casual players end up purchasing the game “each year out of habit and brand loyalty.” Moreover, Call of Duty’s casual player base “dwarfs” Battlefield’s, and thanks to the integration with Warzone, “millions of players are constantly exposed to marketing, in-game promotions, and social tie-ins that convert attention into purchases.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 developers have confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-aim-assist-changes-are-coming-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aim assist changes</a> are coming shortly. Additionally, here are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-final-pc-specs-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final PC specs</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.

Creations (user created content) arrive in Fallout 4 via a brand new in-game Creations menu, which will make it easy for players to find and download the new content on PC and console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Bethesda has detailed Fallout 4’s Creation Menu update, due out on November 10 alongside the release of the Anniversary Edition, and it includes more than expected. However, Bethesda issued a warning to mod users. Fallout 4 mods will undergo maintenance November 6-10, and during this time, Fallout 4 mods and Creation Club will be offline. This means you won’t be able to download or upload any new content (you’ll still have access to change your mod load order and play the game).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda asked players to disable any mods that change the main menu before the November 10 update (which requires changes to the main menu screen). If you don’t, the mods may break with the patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for your patience as we work to roll these changes out and lay the groundwork for things like additional storage for Creations,” Bethesda said in a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/377160/announcements/detail/814714767715337534" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><div id="fallout-4-perks-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3><h3>Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Fallout 4 patch notes reveal some surprising but welcome gameplay and performance improvements. VATS Accuracy should now be fixed so hit chances are consistent across platforms and no longer drop to 0% or show incorrect values (this has been a problem for some time). Targeting enemies through walls without the Penetrator perk is no longer possible, too. There’s also improved Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide Support, and Resolution Detection (Autodetect now sets supported display resolutions, preventing crashes on launch).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition Creation Club content includes unique weapons, power armor, Pip Boy paint jobs, and more. During Fallout Day, Bethesda teased some of the Creations in the works, including one that will bring a "slice of the Mojave Desert" to the Commonwealth, an escape room experience, and even a mind's eye version of your spouse voiced by the original actors you can interact with. The six official expansions included are the Far Harbor, Automatron, and Nuka-World story add-ons, and the Contraptions, Vault-Tec, and Wasteland Workshop add-ons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition will be available on Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Steam and PC. It’s coming to Nintendo Switch 2 at some point in 2026, marking the first time Fallout 4 will be available on a Nintendo console.

            <title><![CDATA[Wreckreation Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wreckreation-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckreation-review.1344124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been 6,496 days since the original release of Burnout Paradise, not that I’m counting. With the Burnout series clearly consigned to the same storage cupboard EA has been hiding the corpses of Westwood, Black Box, Pandemic, and all the other studios it shut down over the years, I completely understand the motivation for developer Three Fields Entertainment to craft Wreckreation. It’s an unapologetic Burnout Paradise clone in a stack of very clear ways, built for a ravenous audience that's been starved of one of arcade racing’s heaviest hitters for too long. After all, if you want something done, sometimes you need to do it yourself. Unfortunately, the one core component of its spiritual ancestor that Wreckreation <em>couldn’t</em> recapture was its overall quality, and the result is a janky, unrefined, and often unsatisfying racer that I don’t have much desire to keep playing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wreckreation’s resemblance to Burnout Paradise runs surprisingly deep, even for an independent studio that’s spearheaded by former Criterion Games bigwigs – the home of the Burnout series. In fact, there are times when it borders on self-plagiarism, such are the similarities – from the digital information ticker at the base of the screen to the familiar tone of a successful takedown. As such, Wreckreation often seems more concerned with recreating entire segments of Burnout Paradise’s identity than establishing its own unique one. I’m conscious it’s trying to do this with a fraction of the budget and a sliver of the staff of Criterion’s classic, and that’s admirable in its own way, but comparisons are unavoidable when the parallels are this blatant. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Crashing Out</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">From the opening race it was evident things were awry, from the framerate stutters when I hooked into a drift to the actual sliding itself – which feels a little more cumbersome than I typically like. Arcade racers live and die on their handling, and Wreckreation’s driving dynamics aren’t the best by any stretch. Its brake-to-drift brand of handling is straightforward enough, but it’s not the type of drifting that lets you effectively alter your angle throughout a powerslide. It’s almost as if the throttle has no real impact on your drift angle once you’re sideways. I became accustomed to the handling, but I certainly can’t say I ever warmed to it. I especially dislike its idiosyncrasies, like the fact that cars will screech to a quick halt when braking in a straight line, but stomp on the brakes mid-drift and your car will simply continue to hurtle onwards – even if you’re completely off the accelerator. There are also occasional moments of severe understeer, but I can’t figure out what’s triggering it. It may well be a combination of road surface and car type, but there were times when I just craved more responsiveness and needed my cars to snap back into a drift, and they wouldn’t. There's definitely a lag to the steering that blunts that zippy, arcade feel.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's definitely a lag to the steering that blunts that zippy, arcade feel.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief race across Wreckreation’s elevated stunt tracks, the next event was a stunt challenge, where I was required to accumulate a certain amount of points within a very basic arena of jumps and loops. Unfortunately, while my car could easily make it around the skinny loops during free roam, the moment I tried to take them on during the stunt challenge my car was <em>instantly wrecked</em> for no apparent reason. This wasn’t a one-off thing; it was consistently repeatable and happened every time I tried to drive the loops during the challenge. That’s a bad bug to hit five minutes in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pivoting my approach, I stuck to the jumps in order to build up the points I needed to progress. It wasn’t particularly challenging – and the simplistic approach to auto-leveling cars in the air means the stunting is all rather superficial and shallow compared to something like Wreckfest or Hot Wheels Unleashed – but nonetheless I’d earnt more than six times the necessary score when the time limit expired. At this point I… failed the challenge. I had, in fact, scored <em>zero points</em> – because points don’t automatically bank at the end of the session if you’re still accumulating them in a combo. They just vanish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sort of thing leaves a terrible first impression, and nothing I subsequently encountered was strong enough to affect a course correction.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Wreck Yourself Before You Check Yourself</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After the stunt-centric opening minutes, Wreckreation quickly settles down into its largely Burnout-inspired groove. The bulk of what’s on offer here are standard races (where the goal is to finish first), ‘Takedown’ races (where the goal is to wreck a set number of vehicles), plus the occasional time trial and ‘Shutdown’ event (where you must perform a takedown on a special, marked car while exploring the open world, in order to add it to your garage – sound familiar?). You can progress through all this content however you see fit, hitting events in any order as you uncover new ones around the huge map. Unfortunately, this flexibility doesn’t disguise how familiar every race rapidly becomes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The size of Wreckreation’s massive map is almost certainly a major culprit in this. At a reported 450 square kilometres, it’s an environment larger than a lot of contemporary open-world racing games. It makes for a great bullet point, but the reality is that this huge size brings with it major caveats. Its primary problem is that it’s extremely generic. It’s a large, square island, with no towns or cities. It’s just ribbons of tarmac and dirt draped over vanilla countryside, where one side of the map feels no different than the other. There are no obstacle-filled alleys or bustling urban centres; it’s just a big green slab with a lot of trees and rocks. I haven’t encountered any memorable races, because there are no memorable areas. There’s very little to distinguish one race from another, so ticking them off became tedious pretty quickly. There’s also a bug I encountered semi-regularly when selecting “restart race” from the pause menu that removed most of the HUD and made it impossible to open the map. The only fix was to restart the game, which was equally tiresome.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s very little to distinguish one race from another, so ticking them off became tedious pretty quickly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Races occur against just five other opponents, which is low by modern standards, and rely on some pretty egregious catch-up AI to stay tense – but they’re better than the Takedown races and Shutdowns. Takedown races began as a <em>major </em>frustration, with awful AI spawns that placed fresh takedown victims too far ahead. Unlike Burnout’s Road Rage events, which effectively inject opposition around you at all times to smash and bash, Wreckreation messed up massively by making other cars a total chore to catch within the slim time limits. Hell, sometimes they were <em>impossible </em>to catch because they spawned on an adjacent road you couldn’t reach thanks to the guardrails. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A patch released this week addressed this, and now opponents quickly streak into the picture from behind – just as they do in Burnout (although they still occasionally spawn on nearby roads you can’t get to). But I have to wonder how it was released in its previous state at all? How thoroughly was this game tested? At any rate, I’ve always maintained that the Burnout series fumbled when it added time limits for Road Rage events in Burnout Revenge. Burnout 3: Takedown was better without them, with the limiting factor simply being how much damage your car could take. I wish Wreckreation had cribbed from the latter in this instance.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Greatest Racing Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wreckreation also introduces a new spin on its off-brand Road Rage mode, which adds cars you’re <em>not </em>supposed to take down, lest you receive a time penalty. I don’t find this is a fun twist, and I actively dislike competing in these. The penalty cars don’t just chop precious seconds off your time limit – they don’t even count as takedowns if you shunt one off the road accidentally. The worst penalty takedown events have <em>two </em>marked penalty cars you can’t crash into, meaning every batch of opponents will only have two cars to take down. It makes chasing some of the high takedown totals extremely frustrating, and doubly so when it’s being stingy with attributing them to you in the first place. I lost track of the times multiple AI cars crashed out during a slo-mo takedown clip, but I was only rewarded for one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chasing the unfairly overpowered AI during Shutdown attempts is also extremely frustrating. That is, being barely able to catch a pickup that was supernaturally staying out of my grasp by perfectly matching my top speed is a cheap trick. I know speed stats are a bit of a meaningless metric in arcade racers with rubberband AI, but discovering this truck was actually doing at least 40km/h more than what it’s literally listed as being capable of was pretty annoying after chasing it across the map for 10 minutes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Temu Trackmania</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As close as Wreckreation sticks to its Burnout family roots, it admittedly does bring a whole new pillar of play to the party in the form of its customisation and creation tools, dubbed Live Mix. This gives us the ability to do everything from renaming vehicles, to changing the weather and traffic density, to even plonking down massive track pieces to create huge, skybound stunt courses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The track creation suite <em>should </em>speak to me. 1990’s Stunts from Distinctive Software, with its pioneering track building tools, is one of the most formative racing games I’ve ever played and I’ve adored this sort of thing ever since. However, Wreckreation’s track builder has completely failed to inspire me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some elements here that I find quite neat. I admire how most of the track modules automatically generate the necessary support structures beneath them to secure them to the ground, regardless of their elevation. It gives the tracks a feeling of physical presence, like the skyscraper-sized feats of engineering something like this would be. There are some clever considerations baked in here too, like how the scaffolding will handily delete itself if you place new track pieces beneath established ones. However, after clipping together a whole bunch of track segments (and one complete game crash as I tried to add the last piece), the net result is that they’re nowhere near as thrilling to drive on as they look. It just feels significantly out of date compared to the incredible depth and fine tuning available via the track builder in, say, the Hot Wheels Unleashed series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live Mix ultimately proved handy on occasion for dropping down a jump or platform in the right place to reach a smashable billboard, although I’ve since wound back on that. Tracking down and crashing through the many collectables quickly became rather dull thanks to the fact the world just isn’t very interesting to explore. This is a non-insignificant hurdle considering a lot of these collectables are additional pieces and modules for the stunt tracks. It’s hard to argue the juice is worth the squeeze here. I’d say Wreckreation’s residents would be happy to see fewer obstacles strewn all over the roads, but they simply clip straight through them in a shower of sparks, anyway – like the props are invisible.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/wreckreation-review]]></content:encoded>

			<p>This morning, the official Nintendo Store app launched on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znej" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play</a>. The app allows Nintendo fans to browse Nintendo systems, accessories, games, and merchandise. </p>



<p>Chief among the potential use cases is the ability to shop on the My Nintendo Store, browsing Nintendo Switch systems and accessories, physical and digital games, and other Nintendo products.</p>



<p>Players can also use the Nintendo Store app to stay up-to-date with the latest news on Nintendo games and events, as well as receive notifications about sales. The app allows users to enable push notifications, alerting them when items on their wish list go on sale.</p>



<p>Signing in with an existing Nintendo Account also lets users review their Nintendo Switch 2 and/or Nintendo Switch play activity. Those who owned a Nintendo 3DS or Wii U system may even view play activity logged before February 2020. To do so, though, they must link their Nintendo Network ID (NNID) to the new Nintendo Account. Lastly, fans can use the Nintendo Store app to check in at official Nintendo stores and events, earning related rewards. Their check-in activity will also be accessible within the app.</p>



<p>In other Nintendo news, the Switch 2 console is outpacing all forecasts. After just four months on the market, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has already sold 10.36 million units</a>, and the Japanese manufacturer now estimates it will reach 19 million units sold by the end of the fiscal year, which is set in March 2026.</p>
