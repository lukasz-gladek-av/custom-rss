<p>Intel is one of the largest computer technology companies in the world. When it comes to consumer CPUs, it’s often in a neck-and-neck battle with competitor AMD for the processor market. </p>



<p>Because of that, Intel’s earnings reports are closely watched by investors, analysts, and consumers alike. That makes it important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into a company’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and general outlooks for the months ahead. </p>



<p>What is the health of Intel’s business? What are investors looking for in terms of revenue? Are there any concerns or roadblocks in various sectors? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-intel-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Intel Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its fourth quarter (Q4) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2024 on Thursday, January 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some companies run an April-March fiscal year, Intel’s fiscal year goes from January to December, and ends on the last Saturday of the month. That means its fiscal year ended on Saturday, December 28th. The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: January – March</li>



<li>Q2: April – June</li>



<li>Q3: July – September</li>



<li>Q4: October – December</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-intel-earnings-report-start-time">Next Intel Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next Intel earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5PM ET/2PM PT on January 30, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-intel-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To Intel’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to Intel’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via the company’s website. Simply do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Intel’s <a href="https://www.intc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Investor Relations webpage</a> </li>



<li>In the hero section, there will be an option to select “Webcast”</li>



<li>If you want specific financial results, hover over (or select if on mobile) “Financial Info” in the menu bar</li>



<li>Then select “Financial Results”</li>



<li>This will take you to a page with recent earnings calls, presentations, infographics, remarks, and more.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you want more than just the most recent earnings call and data, the “Financial Results” page will have a catalog of the reports from past years, going back—as of writing—as far as 2002.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-intel">What To Expect From Intel</h2>



<p>When Intel releases its latest earnings, it will provide a number of updates on the state of the overall business. Details such as where things stand with its restructuring efforts, early returns from the release of its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Ultra S CPUs</a>, the launch of its Intel Arc <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel-battlemage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlemage graphics cards</a>, its growth in the AI space, and more will be discussed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-intel-earnings-report">The Last Intel Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Intel announced its earnings for Q3 FY2024, it announced that it’s year-over-year net revenue fell by 6.17% to $13.28 billion from $14.16 billion. Intel said that the decline in revenue was due to restructuring costs after laying off 15% of its global workforce along with more investments into different areas of research and development.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-company-earnings-calls">What Are Company Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

                <p>Nvidia remains one of the world's largest companies by market cap, but the chip-maker is having a tough day on the stock market today. The company's share price slid by nearly 17% today, wiping out more than $500 billion in market cap. Should this hold through the end of the trading day, it would be far and away the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/01/27/biggest-market-loss-in-history-nvidia-stock-plunges-15-as-deepseek-shakes-ai-darling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">biggest single-day trading loss for a company in history</a>. Nvidia's previous $279 billion one-day dip is the existing record-holder.</p><p>Why is Nvidia stock tanking? The stock price had been surging for the past two years as investors felt bullish on the company's fortunes due to excitement in the market about artificial intelligence. Nvidia sells the necessary GPUs to train large-language models and for general AI use, after all.</p><p>But at the end of last week, Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek launched a new model, R1, that the company claims is far cheaper than other models out there, including Open AI's o1. The fear from investors, it seems, is that AI companies may not actually require as much computing power as it was once believed. This, in turn, could have spooked investors and sent Nvidia's stock price down.</p><p>Some of Nvidia's rivals in the AI space, including Arm and Broadcom, also saw their share prices slump on Monday. Stock prices regularly move, sometimes dramatically so, in response to relevant market announcements.</p><p>DeepSeek is not new, but instead was founded after a spin-out from hedge fund High-Flyer in 2023. <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-LLM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeepSeek's own paper</a> said its R1 model was trained for a cost of about $5.6 million, which is just a small percentage of what OpenAI and others are said to have spent on their systems. Because DeepSeek's systems have made strides in <em>software</em>, they could be less reliant on <em>hardware</em> like the GPUs that Nvidia sells, and some experts believe DeepSeek might signal a sea-change in the AI landscape.</p><p>The emergence of DeepSeek's new model comes not long after President Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure program, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stargate</a>, led by investments from OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. At least some of that appears to consist of existing investments that were previously announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/27/chinas-deepseek-ai-model-shocks-world-sell-nvidia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As Motley Fool points out</a>, there are some that believe DeepSeek is not being totally honest in explaining the true costs of its systems. AI researcher Nathan Lampert estimates DeepSeek's true training costs as being as high as $1 billion. Other AI experts, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, believe DeepSeek and others actually have more Nvidia chips than they may be allowed to disclose given export rules.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MorningBrew/status/1883901050010395123" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">From last week: Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang says that DeepSeek and other Chinese AI labs have more Nvidia chips than they can talk about because of current US export controls <a href="https://t.co/tPzmdEvvik" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/tPzmdEvvik</a></p>  — Morning Brew ☕️ (@MorningBrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/MorningBrew/status/1883901050010395123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The launch of DeepSeek hasn't gone totally smoothly for the company. <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/sign_in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeepSeek's own website</a> states that it's facing "large-scale malicious attacks" on its services just days after releasing.</p><p>Nvidia is the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 company worldwide based on market cap</a>, only trailing behind Apple and Microsoft.

		<p>Ubisoft has announced a round of layoffs, cutting 185 jobs from across its European studios, and closing one studio down completely.</p>
<p>UK-based Ubisoft Leamington is being shut down, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">Eurogamer reporting</a> that almost all of its 50 team members are being laid off. Beyond that, there’s also “targeted restructuring” that will affect Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections.</p>


<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-cuts-185-jobs-in-a-bid-to-prioritise-projects-and-reduce-costs">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, a Ubisoft spokesperson said:</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritise projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition.</p>

<p>The news comes less than two months after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">Ubisoft announced the closure of XDefiant</a>, laying off team members from San Francisco, Sydeny and Osaka.</p>
<p>There’s no end in sight, it seems, for the struggles being faced across the industry. Earlier this month a Transformers game was cancelled, affecting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/transformers-reactivate-has-been-cancelled-staff-to-be-laid-off/">Splash Damage</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">People Can Fly also laid off 120 in December</a> after a project cancellation.</p>
<p>As always, our thoughts are with those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they can find new work soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-pc-mod-support-launches-later-this-week-with-free-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games and Avalanche Software have confirmed plans to launch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a> mod support for PC, opening the floodgates for players to add whatever their hearts desire to the Harry Potter video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team announced the addition with a special video presentation, below, revealing a release date of January 30, 2025 for a free update that includes the highly requested feature. It’ll only be for PC for now, with the team sharing no news about when or if players can expect to see modding come to consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve made it easy for everyone. It’s all simplified with official tools provided by us,” Avalanche community manager Chandler Wood said. “For mod creators, you’ll be able to get the official Hogwarts Legacy creator kit, free on the Epic Games Store. The creator kit provides powerful tools right at your fingertips, allowing you to flex your inner developer like the ones here at Avalanche and conjure the magic with custom mods that other players can enjoy, too.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy mods will almost certainly devolve into chaos immediately as players rush to add Shrek, Thomas the Tank Engine, and more nonsense to the open-world Harry Potter game. Thankfully, Avalanche is here to help fans get a head start. The studio said it’s been working with members of the community to make a few mods available on day one, including creative broom options like dragons and a vacuum cleaner as well as unique cosmetics, an endless dungeon experience to test your combat skills, and a magical creature fetch quest. More community-generated content will no doubt appear in the months ahead, giving players more than enough content to keep them busy as Avalanche looks ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S in February 2023, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions following in May and the Nintendo Switch version following in November. That means it’ll celebrate its two-year anniversary next month with full-on mod support, but the free update is far from the only post-launch support the project has received since it arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year alone saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-will-soon-give-all-players-access-to-playstation-exclusive-content"><u>previously PlayStation-exclusive content coming to other platforms</u></a> as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-update-adds-photo-mode-hogsmeade-quest-and-more-next-week"><u>summer update</u></a> that also added photo mode, new cosmetics, and more. Hogwarts Legacy has sold an incredible 30 million units as of November 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for mod support to drop, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-video-game-sequel-hogwarts-legacy-2-one-of-the-biggest-priorities-at-warner-bros"><u>why Avalanche says Hogwarts Legacy 2 is one of its “biggest priorities.”</u></a> You can also see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>how the sequel may share a few elements with the upcoming Harry Potter TV show</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-issues-warning-against-cheating-ahead-of-trading-feature-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is warning players of the consequences for cheating, just ahead of the expected release of in-game trading later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an announcement pushed to the app yesterday, players were warned about violations of the Terms of Service that specifically relate to cheating:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are aware that some players have engaged in data tampering, real money trading, and other behaviors that violate the Terms of Use," reads the in-game notice. "If we confirm that a player has engaged in behavior that violates the Terms of Use, we will warn them, suspend their account, or take other action."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">No further details were offered as to what behaviors, specifically, are being targeted. Players on r/PTCGP have been speculating that this warning is related to a few different behaviors. One of these, referred to as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ib23b8/wonder_pick_farming_is_definitely_part_of_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder Pick Farming</a>, is a practice where individuals mass-create new accounts to take advantage of the many free packs available for new players, and try to roll a "god pack," or a super rare pack of cards with five very rare cards. Then, they offer their friend code to others for money, so that buyers can add them as friends and then see the "god pack" in the game's Wonder Pick function and be guaranteed a very rare card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another behavior speculated to be the target of a crackdown is a practice where players will grind accounts to level 50 with plenty of banked currency by participating in PvP battles over and over, using the game's timeout function to stall games until the opponent concedes so they can win repeatedly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, it's possible that the warning was simply published because of the game's upcoming trading feature release, which could potentially kickstart a new wave of inappropriate behavior, especially where "real money trading" is concerned. The trading feature, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">which was panned by fans upon announcement</a>, allows players to trade cards of one star rarity and below with friends. Players have expressed frustration with both the rarity limit on trading, as well as the need to spend some sort of currency to make the trade happen in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The feature is planned to go live later this week on January 29, alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pockets-next-set-is-a-diamond-and-pearl-themed-booster-called-space-time-smackdown">new expansion Space-Time Smackdown</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

		<p>Rockfish has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/everspace-2">Everspace 2</a>: Wrath of the Ancients, a major expansion to their space adventure that adds a new post-game story, more star systems, side quests and more when it launches for PlayStation, Xbox and PC this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVERSPACE 2 | Wrath of the Ancients — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jij3a23hx3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Apparently the community has bugged Rockfish about the Aethon system long enough – to be fair, Rockfish were the ones teasing it – but Aethon will be just one star system within this expansion, in which you’ll explore several star systems from the Okkar civilization.</p>
<p>But who are the Okkar? Well, they’re an emerging faction appearing just as attacks using weapons from the Ancients have sparked a fresh conflict in Cluster 34, using these attacks ostensibly by the Ancients as justification for their own possible hostilities. You and your crew have to head to the Okkar Homeworlds to try and defuse the situation.</p>
<p>This expansion will push the game’s lore ahead, but it will also bring new twists to the combat. You’ll be able to snag an Okkar Wraith ship and use it’s various new abilities against challenging new enemies. Existing ships will also be compatible with the new weapons and gear, including new upgradable Okkar equipment – more details on those at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Everspace 2 was a big change from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/18/everspace-stellar-edition-review/">the original game</a>. That had been a roguelike space adventure, but the sequel morphed into a more traditional narrative led space shooter. We loved the change, with Ade saying in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/27/everspace-2-review/">Everspace 2 review</a>, “I started Everspace 2 deeply unsure about a space looter shooter. Tens of hours later I don’t want to play anything else. Everspace 2 is a towering achievement of space-based thrills and spills. It absolutely deserves your attention.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-confirmed-for-this-summer-as-franchise-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-new-roadmap/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Techland <a href="https://youtu.be/CvqFjEILJao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> many announcements as part of its celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. Firstly, the numbers: over 45 million users have played either the first or the second game in the first-person open-world zombie series that originally debuted in 2015, an increase of 15 million since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-franchise-sold-30-million-copies-to-date-techland-busy-on-new-open-world-fantasy-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous announcement from two years ago</a>. During this decade, they have racked up 67 billion zombie kills and over 1 billion hours of total playtime.</p>
<p>To commemorate the tenth anniversary, the first and second games will feature a series of events over four weeks. In the first week, Dying Light will get HyperMode with a double XP bonus, while the sequel will enjoy the biggest discount ever (up to 67%, depending on the platform and region). In the following weeks, the original game will be refreshed with the Low Gravity, Super-Crane, and Viral Rush events, while Dying Light 2 players will be able to take advantage of new bounties via the Pilgrim Outpost website. In the fourth week, the sequel is also finally receiving the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Raid cooperative roguelike mode</a> as a permanent addition to the game, following several playtest rounds.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10th-Anniversary-celebration-roadmap-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg revealed today for the franchise. The first Dying Light will soon receive a new patch that improves visuals and adds a remastered soundtrack with new music from the original composer Paweł Błaszczak. Of course, most of the content is coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a>, which is roughly in the middle of its promised five-year post-launch support. The updated roadmap for 2025 shows co-op gameplay and matchmaking improvements, new playable Tower Raid characters, improved Community Maps support, new firearms and melee weapons, an entirely new weapon class, improvements to the Prologue, graphical and technical improvements, and, of course, free gear and outfits.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Dying-Light-2025-Roadmap-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That's still not everything Techland talked about today. The Polish developer confirmed they've got <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, which will mark the return of original game protagonist Kyle Crane, slated for the Summer season. Moreover, there are some unannounced Dying Light projects in the works, as well as new board games, exclusive merchandise, and an original webcomic series.</p>

			<p>Today, Hazelight released a new trailer for Split Fiction, a title that was announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-announced-at-the-game-awards-releases-march-6-2025/">The Game Awards</a>. This is the new game coming from the ambitious studio that made It Takes Two. This game is set to push the boundaries of a co-op adventure, where players can jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds while exploring their own side stories in a journey of discovery. If you want to see the new trailer for Split Fiction, you can find it down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Co-op Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you get glimpses into the story, Josef Fares, the founder of Hazelight walks you through the co-op scenarios that you can participate in and the varying gameplay that you'll get to experience. In addition to the co-op gameplay that you'll get to see in Split Fiction, the trailer also talks about a special feature called Side Stories. These are one-off adventures that you can do that are hidden throughout the main story levels, providing a shake-up to the mechanics and allowing you to learn more about the personalities and stories of Mio and Zoe.</p>
<p>As explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/an-introduction-to-side-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the EA website, Side Stories happen as a result of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation. The portals that appear are attempts to steal Mio and Zoe's unfinished stories from when they were younger. As a result, this leads to a lot of wacky situations that they will get to traverse together. These include riding Sandfish across a desert and performing tricks while under heavy fire. Others include becoming pigs and finding out how sausages are made. With these Side Stories, it's set to provide a lot of laughs and questionable moments as you get to explore the game.</p>
<p>Much like A Way Out and It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios' has promised that the Friend's Pass will be back for Split Fiction, too. This means that one player who owns the game can invite a friend to play the game for free. In addition, Hazelight also has plans to add crossplay, allowing friends to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 6, 2025. The game will be priced at $49.99.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Split Fiction when it releases? Let us know in the comments.</p>

In regular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/journey">Journey</a> for plague doctors, or possibly <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a>: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  
</p>
<p>
Over <em>here</em> is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over <em>there</em> is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

I spent around an hour with Kingdoms today ahead of launch, and while I'm not sure it'll rejuvenate your interest if you're absolutely sick of Darkest Dungeon 2, it feels well-wrought. Briefly, it's a turn-based digital boardgame with a worker placement element, in which you travel back and forth between upgradeable inns to stave off sieges and complete quest objectives in the face of an escalating threat. It begins with a choice of layouts and difficulty settings (see below). Then you compose a starting party at the Crossroads and set off through a relatively laidback borderlands region, as in vanilla Donkey's Dingdong 2.

<p>
Having reached and liberated the inn at the end of that trail, you're cut loose upon the full playing board. Pretty much every turn, at least one of the map's inns comes under siege from dark forces (that's the berserking Beastmen at first, with other factions to be unlocked). It'll fall in a handful of turns, depending on how much you've strengthened it using construction resources gathered on the road. You can rumble over to assist the inn, which means surviving any hazards enroute, or you can send one of the supporting heroes you've stationed at other inns to rally the defenders and drag out the siege. 
</p><p>
The trips between map nodes are similar to the regions of the main game - you steer your stagecoach with WASD according to a murky minimap, attempting to siphon loot from roadside nasties without stressing or damaging your heroes too much - but the paths between inns seem much shorter, with fewer branches, encounters and bosses. </p>
<p>This is compensated by the fact that you might have to string together a few regional runs to reach your destination. Some roads lead to campsites, which afford you rest but don't offer progression facilities or protection against nocturnal ambush. There's also what I think is a new fatigue mechanic that lowers hero max health based on how far they've travelled. As such, you'll want to shuffle people out of your hand now and then, stationing exhausted party members at inns to recuperate.</p>
<p>In amongst all this, you'll need to complete those quest objectives before all the inns fall and the map's threat level becomes unmanageable. During my opening game, this started with transporting a telescope to a watchtower so that I could map out the Beastfolk menace.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
The ability to leave heroes at the inn together with the campsites recalls the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>'s town/dungeon format, but this isn't just a DD1 mode within DD2, obviously. It reminds me more of the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armello">Armello</a>, in that you have some pervading strategic capacity but are fundamentally lost within a large, weird world.
</p><p>
The Kingdoms map has all of Red Hook's usual thickly etched floridity, but I could do with, dare I say, a bit more illumination. I'm not asking for Dirkest Dragon to suddenly come over all Wind Waker, but after hundreds of hours in this setting, I'm ready for some refreshed presentation. IDK. What would a Lightest Dungeon look like? How would you maintain the essential dungeoniness in a universe without shadow? It's a deeply perverse question, and one I will therefore be asking Red Hook as and when they fail to avoid encountering me at an expo.
</p>

<p>
I've enjoyed what I've played of Kingdoms. If you don't, the better news is that it's launching alongside a new regular (paid) Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC pack, Inhuman Bondage. This adds the underground Catacombs region and a new hero, the Abomination, whose air of self-loathing and Hulkish tendencies you may again recognise from Darkest Dungeon 1. The OG Abomination was one of my favourites. He's pretty reliable even in sulky human form, chain-whipping skulls and spewing gastric juices from the midline. Mind you, I would always overdo it with his monster transformations and cause another party member to freak out. I'm not sure how the DD2 incarnation differs.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Inhuman Bondage additions will also be available in Kingdoms. I haven't encountered them yet myself, but there are underground shortcuts to discover between certain inns, and I imagine that's where you'll get your fill of Catacombing.
</p>
<p>
What's next for Dankest Sturgeons? Anything and everything and nothing and something. "We've spent over a decade working on Darkest Dungeon," the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1940340/view/503940938959159876?l=english">write on Steam</a>. "We've delighted in our explorations and iterations, and we're nowhere near done."

		<p>First of all, congratulations to Austin's Eagles. </p><p><em>Please</em> go beat the damn Chiefs.</p><p>I am writing this wondering if danger is on the horizon. This morning, my four-year-old woke up with a sniffle. She seemed fine otherwise—but you never know. It's a dangerous time of year to be a parent, where those pesky germs are always afoot. I recently joked to my wife that we're due to get sick—we have dodged everything that's taken down our kids this winter season—but I'm crossing my fingers, folks!</p><p>-pk, who cannot believe how boring <em>Gladiator 2</em> was, what the heck</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Interview</em> — Ah, this one is a delight. I'm glad this game together, and hope we have Chris on in the future, as well. When Chris got on the call, he started by saying some version of "Ah, man, I'm sorry" and I was confused on why. Turns out I've tuned out so much of the early Trump bullshit that I wasn't even aware that I'd booked a recording time with the inauguration that was happening at the same time moment. I preferred this version of events, even if we were also talking about a lot of awful things here, too.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>New on Steam</em> – We'll probably change the title of this, but I experimented with this idea recently, where there is <em>so much stuff</em> added to Steam on a daily basis—and so much goes unnoticed. Yes, a lot of it isn't very good and <em>a shocking amount</em> is porn, but my hope is that we can find some diamonds hidden about. Join us as we scroll through Steam and find games!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Remap Recommends</em> – It's the end of the month, which means we'll run through some of the games that have stuck around our brains.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Motorsports Manager</em> – Once more, into the racing breach.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Yep, we're doing a third GOTY pod. My hope is that half of the podcast will also be a normal Remap Radio podcast. Stay tuned!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – There will be words exchanged between myself and Rob. I need to figure out what the idea is for this week. This is also...stay tuned!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Microsoft’s earnings reports are closely watched by investors, analysts, and consumers alike. So it’s important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live.</p>



<p>Quarterly updates provide insights into a company’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and growth outlooks for the months and years ahead. Microsoft is the second-largest company in the world in terms of market cap, but quarterly reviews can swiftly change the public and private perception of the company.</p>



<p>What is Microsoft’s focus? What are investors looking for? Are there any concerns or roadblocks? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-microsoft-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Microsoft Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p>Microsoft is currently scheduled to deliver its second quarter (Q2) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2025 on Wednesday, January 29.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to why the company is releasing its second quarter earnings in January, Microsoft’s fiscal year runs from July 1-June 30. The company’s second quarter runs from October 1 – December 31. The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: July 1 – September 30</li>



<li>Q2: October 1 – December 31</li>



<li>Q3: January 1 – March 31</li>



<li>Q4: April 1 – June 30</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-microsoft-earnings-report-start-time">Next Microsoft Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next Microsoft earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5:30PM ET/2:30PM PT on January 29, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-microsoft-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To Microsoft’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to Microsoft’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via Microsoft’s website. Simply do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Investor Relations page</a> on Microsoft’s website</li>



<li>In the menu bar, select “Earnings &amp; Financials”</li>



<li>Then select “Press Release &amp; Webcast”</li>



<li>This will take you to the most recent earnings report page with the press release. On the right-hand side will be options to read the transcript (after the call), listen to the webcast, view the earnings slides, read financial statements, see product releases for the quarter, and more.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you just want to listen to the call without any other information, you’ll want to scroll down on the Investor Relations page to the Upcoming/Past Events section. If it’s not listed in the most recent calls, click “More Past Events”. From there, scroll to the call you’d like to listen to and click the “Webcast” link to listen to the call.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-for-xbox">What To Expect For Xbox</h2>



<p>When Microsoft releases its latest earnings, it will provide a number of updates on the state of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox business</a>. Details such as general gaming revenue, Xbox content and services revenue, Xbox hardware revenue, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cloud gaming</a>, Xbox Game Pass growth, Activision Blizzard King’s impact, and more will be discussed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-microsoft-earnings-report">The Last Microsoft Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Microsoft announced its earnings for Q1 FY2025, it revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch in franchise history. Microsoft also said that the company set a record for the most Xbox Game Pass sign ups in a single day for the launch of the new game.</p>



<p>Regarding overall Xbox revenue, Microsoft said that it increased by 61% year-over-year with 53 points of net impact—53 of the 61%—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-responds-report-regarding-financial-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming from Activision Blizzard King</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-quarterly-earnings-calls">What Are Quarterly Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often release a full media deck and press release with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-next-era-of-dying-light%E2%80%99-revealed-as-techland-celebrates-10th-anniversary.1093026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland has lined up an impressive 2025 roadmap for Dying Light 2, and it all begins with a celebration event honouring the 10th anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. In 2015, this open-world epic of a zombie apocalypse title made its way onto our screens and into our hearts, and today, it remains one of the best zombie games to ever be released.</p>



<p>From today, the anniversary celebration commences, with Techland pushing out four weeks of entertainment across both Dying Light and Dying Light 2: Stay Human, which was released in February 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hard-at-work">‘Hard at Work’</h2>



<p>In a recent press release, Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the same time we’re celebrating the 10th anniversary of Dying Light, we are already hard at work on the next era of the franchise.</p>



<p>Our recent major rebrand aims to establish the franchise as the ultimate zombie experience across all future projects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This summer, the team will release Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone game that sees the return of Kyle Crane, the iconic protagonist from the first game. At Gamescom 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I caught up with Roger Craig Smith</a>, the legendary actor behind Kyle Crane, who returns to the Dying Light series after a ten-year break.</p>



<p>To kick off the celebrations, Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be discounted to the lowest price ever, per the Techland update. Those still playing Dying Light (2015) will get a free skin bundle and a special ‘hypermode’ event, too. After that, both Dying Light 2 and Dying Light will have special, in-game events unravel, including the return of fan-favourite modes like Low Gravity and Super Crane.</p>



<p>In the week starting February 19, Dying Light 2’s Tower Raid mode will be permanently released, and a special ‘Light up the Night’ stream will be held by Techland.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>But that’s not all!</p>



<p>Beyond that, the spring welcomes a major update in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and in the summer, a fresh event will be delivered. In the fall comes the ‘Fall Update’ which goes hand-in-hand with a limited-time Halloween event, and finally, Winter Tales returns at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Throughout all that, Dying Light 2 players will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op gameplay and matchmaking updates</li>



<li>New Tower Raid characters</li>



<li>New firearms and melee weapons</li>



<li>Community map support</li>



<li>Prologue improvements</li>



<li>Free outfits and gear</li>



<li>Technical and graphical improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a busy year for the team at Techland, and the press release finished with a promising statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our plans to grow the franchise don’t stop at Dying Light: The Beast. We’ll continue the series with multiple unannounced projects and will also go beyond video games with new board games, exclusive merchandise, original webcomic series and more on the horizon. Our goal is to bring the world of Dying Light to even more people.</p>
</blockquote>

In theory, nothing would stop players from creating a third-party marketplace on a subreddit or Discord server where people who have tons of duplicates sell them to the highest bidders. </p><p>That’s possibly one reason why the development team is restricting <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s trading feature to one-star cards and below. The rarest cards, like specific gold variants <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809">with only a .053 percent chance of dropping</a></span>, will remain locked to players accounts. They would still be able to sell entire accounts to one another, but that would sort of defeat the whole purpose of playing the game and collecting cards in the first place.</p><p>Of course, all of this is violates <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s rules, but that’s never been enough to completely stamp out cheating and other illicit practices in other economy-driven live-service games like <em>Diablo IV</em>. The proof will be in how many players <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> potentially ends up banning for this sort of thing, and if it publicizes those numbers as has become common across lots of other online games. </p><p>The <em>Pokémon Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>-inspired set Space-Time Smackdown arrives this week, alongside the new trading feature, but those cards will also be excluded from trades at launch. Creatures Inc. and DeNA have said exchanging cards with friends will only be available for existing the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island sets at the moment.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of life’s little joys is learning<strong> how many satchels for a sheet metal door</strong> in Rust. It’s a memorable moment, your first-ever raid against your neighbor, and likely to stick with you. In the early game, you likely won’t craft a metric ton of explosive ammo, and C4 is still a few workbenches away, but a satchel is easily accessible and open to most skill levels. Here’s how many it takes to get through your neighbor’s front door!</p>







<figure></figure>



<p>Assuming your raid target upgraded to a sheet metal door, which most Rust players should do immediately after building a base of any size, it will take a few satchels to blow through. In total, you need four satchels for a sheet metal door in Rust. That’s not many, and crafting satchels is not overly expensive. But hey, that’s just door number one!</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Door Type</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Satchels</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wooden Door</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sheet Metal Door</td><td data-align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Garage Door</td><td data-align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Armored Door</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A sheet metal door has 250 health points and is more damage-resistant. A single satchel will deal approximately 61 HP damage to the door. As such, it requires a minimum of four satchels, with 6 HP leftover on the door after the fourth explosion, so you could waste a fifth satchel or use explosive ammo to blast the last few HP. Basically, hit it with anything else. Don’t waste a fifth satchel!</p>



<p>If you’re playing in a group, which Rust genuinely promotes, try to farm for C4. It’s a much better tool for raiding in Rust.</p>

                <p>Few things in life are more terrifying than hearing Moon Knight announce his ultimate attack in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>. Widely considered to have one of the best ultimate abilities in the game, Hand of Khonshu opens up a portal above opposing players and bombards them with area-of-effect attacks. This attack might have gotten even <em>more</em> powerful recently, as according to some testing done by the Marvel Rivals community, it's reportedly dealing double the damage it's supposed to.</p><p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1iai2al/moon_knight_ult_is_bugged_does_2x_damage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sidewaysgts</a> (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-moon-knight-ultimate-ability-bug-glitch-1851748295" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>) posted a video on the game's subreddit, showing off some of the absurd power of this ultimate in its current state. According to Netease, each talon summoned by the ultimate is supposed to do 75 points of damage, but Sidewaysgts showed off instances where training bots in the practice level were being hit with 150 points of damage instead. This seems to happen less often to bots who are further outside the field of influence, but if you're wondering why your Hulk or Thor is being absolutely shredded by Moon Knight lately, this might be the reason why.</p><p>It's not clear yet if this is a bug or intentional, but it does make Moon Knight one of the biggest threats in the Marvel Rivals metagame right now. Even without reportedly increased lethality, Hand of Khonshu is still the bane of many players as it'll continue to inflict damage even if Moon Knight is stunned or eliminated.</p><p>Unlike other abilities, there's barely any wind-up time for the fast-charging ultimate once it has been activated and it has a massive circle of influence that reigns down talons for a long period of time. If you hear Moon Knight yelling about the moon haunting you, prepare to respawn because it's already too late for you. The only feasible counter right now is <em>more </em>Moon Knight, as Loki players can use the Asgardian's ultimate to transform into the Fist of Khonshu and use the powerful ability themselves.</p><p>In other Marvel Rivals, the game recently introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/">two members of the Fantastic Four to the roster</a>--Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman--as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/">Dracula-themed season</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-suit-is-swinging-into-marvel-rivals-soon/1100-6528834/">Spider-Man players can grab a new set of threads</a> soon that's based on Insomniac's Spidey costume, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-introduces-new-costumes-and-superhero-soccer/1100-6528913/">and a new Spring event has added superhero soccer to the game</a>.</p>
