			<p>It's seemingly confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-by-esrb-for-ps5-and-pc/">Horizon Zero Dawn is getting a remaster</a>, despite the fact it really doesn't need one. Sony is focusing on making the games look a bit cleaner and visually striking instead of rebooting or porting franchises that people actually care about. Although it hasn't been officially confirmed that a Horizon Zero Dawn remaster is coming, it's quite likely since the rumor has been floating around since 2022. People now believe this is happening because the supposed remastered version has been rated by the ESRB, listening to PC and PlayStation 5 as the platforms. In the latest Game Mess Morning, Jeff Grubb mentioned that there is a "less exciting" remaster to be announced at the State of Play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alleged Images of Nintendo's New Switch Have Surfaced | Game Mess Mornings 09/18/24" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_KSS0zxxn3w?start=1100&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's rumored that Horizon Zero Dawn will be getting a remaster to add more accessibility options. Both Lucy James and Jeff Grubb mentioned this in the conversation and said that while it would be good to see more accessibility options added, the game doesn't need a remaster to do so.</p>
<p>It wasn't particularly speculated on what the "less exciting" remaster could be, but <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-jeff-grubb-says-the-state-of-play-next-week-could-feature-another-less-exciting-remaster-besides-horizon-zero-dawn.984768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the comments</a> suggest games such as God of War and God of War Ragnarok, with a lot of jest comments suggesting another Last of Us remaster. When thinking about what games could possibly be remastered, it's hard to think of any that are in dire need of it from the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 category other than games like Bloodborne or even Demon's Souls onto PC.</p>
<p>The following State of Play is rumored to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-announced-state-of-play/">September 19-20, 2024</a>. However, Sony has not yet confirmed it. In this Game Mess Morning, they speculate that third-party partners will most likely present their games rather than giving players something that they want from first-party productions. Grubb goes on to say, "Prepare to be disappointed by the State of Play. They are marketing obligations more than they are anything else."</p>
<p>However, in the conversation, he mentioned that a game like Ghost of Tsushima needs to come out to make the PlayStation 5 Pro worthwhile, as it was a game that is well-loved by both PC and PlayStation players. It's even possible that this game could get a remaster, as it was released in 2020 for the PlayStation 4. Of course, there is the Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut that added an expansion and was released in 2021. However, it's possible that they could do what they did with The Last of Us and try to milk that game as much as possible by updating the graphics and adding more accessibility options.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-trading-card-game-among-12-finalists-to-be-inducted-into-national-toy-hall-of<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, the Strong National Museum of Play announced twelve National Toy Hall of Fame finalists. The winners will be inducted into the illustrious museum. Among those finalists are iconic tabletop games, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game</em></a>.</p>
<h2>The National Toy Hall of Fame Finalist Announcement</h2>
<p>According to National Museum of Play's <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/exhibits/toy-hall-of-fame/2024-finalists/">official website</a>, the twelve National Toy Hall of Fame finalists were selected as part of their annual Player's Choice ballot. A method where toy fans can submit thousands of potential inductees to the museum.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/national-toy-hall-of-fame-finalist-screenshot.jpg?itok=MiBChvLh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/national-toy-hall-of-fame-finalist-screenshot.jpg?itok=S5_qOLCc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Seven of these twelve finalists are ubiquitous parts of play. Balloons, hobbyhorses, trampolines, Hess Toy Trucks, and R/C cards. Two of them are even part of beloved toy franchises: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-roleplaying-game-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a>.</p>
<p>The other five National Toy Hall of Fame finalists are where things get interesting. They include the <em>Pokemon Trading Card Game</em>, Choose Your Own Adventure gamebooks, card games <em>Phase 10</em> and <em>Sequence</em>, and the board game <em>Apples to Apples</em>.</p>
<p>They are interesting since they aren't just toys; they are staples of tabletop gaming. Choose Your Own Adventure game books were pioneers in interactive narrative such as Dever's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/joe-devers-lone-wolf-series-returns-to-print" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Lone Wolf</em></a> series. <em>Apples to Apples</em> effectively set a template for the raunchier <em>Cards Against Humanity</em>.</p>

Second only to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, it is a game played by millions of people around the world with expansions <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-company-previews-pokemon-tcg-stellar-crown-and-two-premium-boxes-are-coming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">releasing to this day</a>. Considering it first launched in 1996, that is an impressive cultural impact.</p>
<p>Only three of these twelve National Toy Hall of Fame finalists will be inducted into the National Museum of Play. If you are a fan of any of these options, you can <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/players-choice-ballot/">vote for one</a> until September 25. The final three will be revealed this November.</p>

            <p>Farm life sim snowclone My Time At X is getting a third entry. My Time At Evershine looks to feature more sowing, reaping, kissing and combat, similar to the previous games My Time At Portia and My Time At Sandrock, but with a new art style, campaign co-op and citybuilding elements. You'll get a glimpse of the new art style in the announcement trailer below.

<p>The art style is still clearly anime-influenced, but the characters are more realistically proportioned than in the previous games. The overall effect seems specifically designed to make the boys hot, and fair play, they know their audience.
</p>
<p>All the systems seem to be getting amped up in some way, too. There's a new story campaign, with promises of "a more defined antagonist." The campaign is now playable in co-op, as well as solo. You can still build facilities and expand your town, but also now recruit and customise NPCs to handle day-to-day tasks around that town. You can befriend and smooch folks, but also recruit three followers to boss about.
</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-time-at-portia-review">My Time At Portia review</a> back in 2019 found a game that was ambitious and charming, but which perhaps stretched its ideas and resources too thinly. Our early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-time-at-sandrock-early-access-review">My Time At Sandrock review</a> meanwhile found a game that was similarly expansive but more polished even early in its development, "a compelling and lusciously detailed life simulator with an endlessly rewarding mine-and-build loop, and a set of diverse career paths so richly designed that it’s difficult to pursue them all." More of that seems a compelling prospect, then.
</p>
<p>Developers Pathea Games say they already have a substantial development budget for My Time At Evershine, but as per the previous games they're returning to Kickstarter to help expand the scope of development. You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale">sign up here to be notified when the crowdfunder goes live</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the first <em>Joker</em> was a new spin on the villain’s origin story fused with contemporary societal angst, the sequel will have to stand on its own two feet and potentially offer fans something more than just a deeper dive into the depraved psyche of its central character. Without a Batman to play off of, Gaga will have a lot to shoulder in terms of being a foil, rather than just a love interest or enabler, for the Joker. </p><p>The sequel hits theaters October 4 and continues a steady march of comic book movies this year, beginning with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/madame-web-movie-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-reaction-1851264337?_gl=1*mquhm5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjY2Njg5MS4xNTAuMS4xNzI2Njg5MDE4LjYuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/madame-web-movie-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-reaction-1851264337?_gl=1*mquhm5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjY2Njg5MS4xNTAuMS4xNzI2Njg5MDE4LjYuMC4w">much maligned <em>Madame Web</em></a></span>, peaking with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-credits-fox-marvel-goodbye-1851611168?_gl=1*1eg0atc*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjY4NjkxMy42My4xLjE3MjY2ODg3MDMuMy4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-credits-fox-marvel-goodbye-1851611168?_gl=1*1eg0atc*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjY4NjkxMy42My4xLjE3MjY2ODg3MDMuMy4wLjA.">box office juggernaut<em> Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em></a></span>, and continuing on now into the fall with <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kraven-hunter-spider-man-trailer-rhino-deadpool-1851621883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kraven-hunter-spider-man-trailer-rhino-deadpool-1851621883"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em></a></span>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-new-details-on-the-next-battlefield-game.984882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-details-on-the-next-battlefield-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s been a good week for Battlefield fans. To start, the head honcho of Battlefield, Vince Zempella, confirmed <span>many details on&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming’s past reporting</a>, including that Battlefield would return to 64-player matches, the classic four-class system, and&nbsp;</span>a more “back to basics approach.” Battlefield General Manager Bryon Beede also revealed that the game will have “large-scale community-driven testing” early next year, in addition to stating that the game has had nearly daily internal testing for over a year.</p>



<p>Zempella also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed a “new experience”</a> from Ripple Effect, which Insider Gaming has reported will be Battlefield’s take on a new free-to-play Battle Royale to tie in with the game’s premium release, akin to how Call of Duty found success with Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>So what’s new? Following our original report and the recent confirmation of those details, we wanted to dive into some of the nitty-gritty details that players might want to hear. To start, let’s focus on the core of the game. Insider Gaming understands that the game will take place somewhere between 2027 and 2030, with the campaign focused on a massive private military going up against NATO. The game will be set in various locations worldwide, including Gibraltar (as seen in the game’s first released concept art) and the USA, which is also believed to be the setting for the Battle Royale experience (tropical location).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EXCLUSIVE: Brand New Battlefield Features And Details" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4-UgSr8a-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But let’s cut to the chase and talk multiplayer. The aim is currently for 45 different weapons on launch, double that of what Battlefield 2042’s core multiplayer experience launched with. In addition, the goal is for around 10 multiplayer maps, putting it in line with the likes of Battlefield 1, 3, and 4.</p>



<p>The game will also see a significant overhaul to its destruction and while I couldn’t verify if this means the return of levolution, over half a dozen sources mentioned that the game would have caliber-based destruction, akin to Rainbow 6 Siege, with different calibers causing different amounts of destruction. It’s also understood that the game will see some changes to movement, with one example given by multiple sources the ability to pick up and move downed players. While this has almost certainly been incorporated for the Battle Royale experience, it’s been implied that this is all of the changes and is a part of the team’s “Battlefield moments” initiative to bring back the moments that made Battlefield… well… Battlefield. </p>



<p>I’ve also been told that the team is currently weighing up the name of the game. Over the past year or so, the team has been carrying out mass surveys (some of the biggest I’ve heard about), with participants voting on which game name they prefer: Battlefield or Battlefield 6. So, fingers crossed, we might not have to wait long until that is officially announced.</p>



<p>Finally, regarding “large-scale community-driven testing,” I am very much inclined to believe that this is more than just an open or closed beta but rather the return of the Battlefield CTE, which really helped the development of Battlefield 1 and 4.</p>



<p>Are you excited for Battlefield? Let us know in our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>, where I’ll also be doing a AMA later this week!</p>

            <p>
If you're a Minecraft fan with a penchant for playing while wearing Sony's PlayStation-branded VR goggles, prepare youself for some disappointing news: developer Mojang has announced it's ending Minecraft's PSVR support in March next year.
</p>
<p>
Minecraft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-gets-playstation-vr-support-this-month">originally gained PSVR support</a> in September 2020, as a free upgrade for the PS4 version (this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-for-ps5-is-finally-here">PS5 edition</a> doesn't include similar support for PSVR 2). However, the studio has now confirmed the feature's imminent demise in a <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/30220110283533-Minecraft-1-21-30-Bedrock">new post on its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Our ability to support PlayStation VR  has come to an end," the developer wrote, "and will no longer be supported in updates after March of 2025." But while PSVR functionality will cease, the game will remain playable outside of VR, and will continue to receive updates.

<p>
"From this point on," Mojang continued, "you can keep building in your worlds, and your Marketplace purchases (including Tokens) will continue to be available. You will no longer be able to use your PlayStation VR with Minecraft as it will no longer be supported in the latest updates."
</p>
<p>
Mojang's PSVR news was shared in release notes for Minecraft's latest Bedrock version, which introduces bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and a new experimental Bundles feature. Bundles - which must be enabled when creating a new world - are crafted using one String above one Leather, and let players stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot to save space.
</p>
<p>
Today's update follows Mojang's recent announcement it'll be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">ditching Minecraft's traditional single summer update</a> in favour of multiple content drops throughout the year.

            <p>I don't think I'm going out on a limb by saying that Ubisoft's best game of this year won't be Star Wars Outlaws or the as-yet unreleased Assassin's Creed Shadows, it'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>. The sidescrolling metroidvania is a rich, expansive, and surprisingly challenging take on a genre typically dominated by indies, and it's precisely the kind of game I wish mega-publishers produced more.
</p>
<p>It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

<p>Marsk Of Darkness adds a new chapter accessible in The Lost Crown's late game, which traps protagonist Sargon in the mind palace of Radjen, one of the Immortals you spend your time with in the original's runtime. She was the only one of the group that didn't come to a clear resolution, which was a big flashing bulb signalling an inevitable expansion.
</p>
<p>Since this is a late-game DLC, it's expected that players will have unlocked all of Prince Of Persia's powers before you tackle it, and that you've attained some mastery of its tricky jumps, dashes, and blocks. Ubisoft recommend you refresh your skills by first playing the Divine Trials, which are 22 expert-level challenges that were added in a free patch back in June. 
</p>
<p>Honestly, those Divine Trials are thumb-breakingly hard, and I'd expect the story DLC to be a cut below overall, at least bar the no-doubt inevitable boss fight. Either way, The Lost Crown is the rare game which I finished wanting more of, which puts me in the unusual position of being the hypothetical target audience for an expansion. Break my thumbs, then.
</p>
<p>Mask Of Darkness costs £4.29/€5/$5, which doesn't seem too bad to me, via Ubisoft Connect and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown--mask-of-darkness">the Epic Games Store</a>. It's also available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3102580/Prince_of_Persia_The_Lost_Crown__Mask_of_Darkness/">via Steam</a>, since the game joined Valve's storefront <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-is-coming-to-steam-in-august">back in August</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache miss 183:single/related:47a0000e81998b1f339882899d1fddda --><!-- empty -->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1934680/Age_of_Mythology_Retold/"><em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em></a> brings a lot of the usual advancements that you'd expect for a reboot of both <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/Ageofmythology/aom-1.html">the increasingly dated 2002 original game</a> and its <em>previous</em> reboot: 2014's Extended Edition, which is still perfectly playable and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/266840/Age_of_Mythology_Extended_Edition/">available on Steam</a>. The newest version of this real-time strategy classic comes with the requisite improvements in graphics and user interface, making the whole game much easier to look at and parse at a glance. And while the updated voice acting isn't going to win any awards, neither is the stilted, bare bones dialogue that those actors are working with (which seems faithful to the original game, for better or worse).</p>
<p>But <em>Retold</em> does add one thing that I wasn't really expecting in a modern real-time strategy game—full support for a handheld controller. Developers have been trying to make RTS games work without the traditional mouse and keyboard since the days of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1mbIXFV498">SNES <em>Populous</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2QAAWQMNuA"><em>Starcraft 64</em></a>, usually with limited success. Microsoft hasn't given up on the dream, though, fully integrating controller support for <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> into both the PC version (which we sampled) and, obviously, the Xbox Series X|S release.</p>
<p>The result is definitely the best version of an RTS controller interface that I've tried and proof that a modern controller can be a perfectly functional option for the genre. In the end, though, there are just a few too many annoyances associated with a handheld controller to make it the preferred way to play a game like this.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Too many functions, too few buttons</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/aomcontroller.jpg" data-height="766" data-width="1361" alt="A detailed map."></a><figcaption><div><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/aomcontroller.jpg" data-height="766" data-width="1361">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A detailed map.</p></div><p>Microsoft</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get a feel for what I mean, just look at the "Controls Popup" summarizing all the things a single controller needs to do in a game like <em>Age of Mythology</em>. The game makes full use of every single button and directional input on the Xbox gamepad for some function or other. Things are so crowded that commands like Stop and Delete need to be mapped to a combination of two shoulder buttons, with different functions for holding and tapping (and there are a few other multi-button menu toggles that aren't even listed here).</p>
<p>If anything, this diagram undersells the control complexity here. Tapping either trigger brings up context-sensitive radial menus full of general commands or construction options for the currently selected building. Finding the right option then often means scrolling through multiple pages of radial menus in this full-screen interface, an awkward solution to the problem of having too many options for too few buttons.</p>
<p>To the game's credit, it does its best to limit how much of this menu-based fumbling you have to do. Tapping the Y button when a building is selected, for instance, automatically starts construction on the most common unit you'd want to create with that building. And holding down the Y button maximizes the production queue for that building quickly, saving the need to spend a few seconds clicking through menus to do so.</p>

            <p>We don't write much about board and paper games around these parts, not since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/cardboard-children">Cardboard Children</a> was sent to the dissolving pits. I still feel that roleplay and strategy gaming has a home here on RPS even when it's not digital though, and doubly so when it's the work of our former comrades.
</p>
<p>Enter Gold Teeth, a tabletop RPG "of piracy &amp; occult horror" which just cleared <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/gold-teeth-the-tabletop-rpg-of-piracy-and-occult-horror">its Kickstarter funding goal</a>, and which is designed by Marsh Davies and Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Marsh produced excellent work for RPS during our post-pre-history adolescence, slinging alt text as chief of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/marsh-davies">Premature Evaluation</a> (also covered in lye in the RPS column latrine). He also led some of our earliest sorties into video territory with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MUwVsTVHIY&amp;list=PL8bDjLl3h2veC8dJ0Fv5mkOCsBbrxHsyD">Fail Forward</a>.
</p>
<p>Jim Rossignol, I don't really remember, but I think he wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/jim-rossignol">a post or two</a>?
</p>
<p>Gold Teeth, then. It's a 3-6 player tabletop roleplaying game in which players form a crew of gnarly sailors in 1781 and traverse land and sea in search of "some measure of salvation in a place doomed by colonial terror and supernatural catastrophe." It's adapted from Forged In The Dark's ruleset, is a standalone successor to the Marsh and Jim's own landlubbing original Teeth, and comes as a 350+ page hardback and full-colour book.
</p>
<p>The Kickstarter pitches it as "Sea Of Thieves meets Uzumaki", among other appealing comparisons. It's due to ship sometime in late 2025, but if that seems too long to wait, or if you need a greater taste of what Gold Teeth might offer, the Kickstarter page also suggests you try the free digital versions of Teeth one-shots which are <a href="https://teethrpg.itch.io/">available via Itch</a>. I'd find anything called <a href="https://teethrpg.itch.io/night-of-the-hogmen">Night Of The Hogmen</a> irresistible. 
</p>
<p>Obviously the disclosure here could be as long as the actual post. I have hired Marsh and I was hired by Jim. I have played D&amp;D with both of them. Marsh and I have been drunk on my many podcasts together, leading to only occasional disaster. These facts only strengthen my belief in their talent, and in the wisdom of supporting any project which permits Marsh to write and draw fucked up shit at sea. I'm also pretty sure some of you RPS readers might like to know that two of our good eggs are hatching new schemes, so here's the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/gold-teeth-the-tabletop-rpg-of-piracy-and-occult-horror">link to that Kickstarter again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Other perks include exclusive membership discounts, the ability to play your games across multiple devices with cloud gaming, free access to EA Play membership, as well as bonus in-game content and rewards.

Yet after reviews came out and people got the game in their hands, it turned out that <em>Lies of P</em> wasn’t just a discount <em>Bloodborne</em> (the 2015 masterpiece from FromSoftware), but rather it was actually…good. </p><p>That has a lot to do with the game’s iterations on ideas often considered core to the Soulslike genre. One example is in <em>Lies of P</em>’s guarding, which plays off of parrying in FromSoftware games. In <em>Lies of P</em>, guarding feels like an essential skill you must learn along your journey, but not one that’s absurdly difficult to master. It excels, though, in its innovation. That is best illustrated by the weapon crafting system. Sure, in a Souls game, you are likely to collect a number of weapons, some of which may even have multiple forms. But <em>Lies of P </em>takes that idea to the extreme. Every weapon in the game is made up of two parts: a handle and blade. The ability to mix and match your weapon components makes for a fascinating customizable gameplay loop with incredible depth.</p><p>But the greatest joy of <em>Lies of P</em> comes in its world, which is a shockingly impressive retelling of the Pinocchio story. The game transforms the familiar tale into a gothic horror story about identity and free will. Pinocchio is still a puppet, but in the world of <em>Lies of P</em>, this story investigates how the ability to choose our fate makes us human. Everything about the world, from its gritty takes on the Blue Fairy and Geppetto to its killer automatons, is extremely silly out of context. But <em>Lies of P</em> weaves a compelling narrative with all of these pieces. </p><p>It’s one of the reasons I can’t wait for the&nbsp;sequel which, as the game teases, will involve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-sequel-dlc-dorothy-oz-1850981029&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-sequel-dlc-dorothy-oz-1850981029"><em>The Wizard of Oz</em></a></span>.

The $999 Focus Vision is available for preorder from now until October 17th on HTC’s website.</p><p>The Focus Vision can be used either as a standalone device or tethered to your PC using USB-C. It’s essentially a beefed-up version of the Focus 3, which the company released in 2021 — it has the same 2448 x 2448 per-eye resolution and 120-degree field of view and also uses a Snapdragon XR2 chip. But it gains features like dual 16MP cameras with color passthrough, and it can now automatically adjust the lenses to compensate for the distance between your eyes. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->19</p><div><figcaption><em>The HTC Vive Focus Vision.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HTC</cite></p></div></div><p>HTC is going for gamers with this headset. Part of that is the inclusion of foveated rendering, meaning it can focus its graphical resources only where you’re looking instead of across your whole field of view at once. “Now, PC gamers can bring the same high-end headsets used in VR arcades into their homes,” Shen Ye, HTC Vive’s global head of product, said in a press release.</p><p>The Focus Vision also adds DisplayPort support via USB-C, which HTC says enables a lossless connection when tethered to your PC. And after an update later this year, DisplayPort tethering will allow the displays’ refresh rate to go from the normal 90Hz to 120Hz. The Focus Vision has 128GB of storage (with a microSD slot for up to 2TB more), and 12GB of RAM, up from the 8GB of its predecessor. The headset also supports all Focus 3 accessories.</p><p>A built-in battery can keep the Focus Vision going for 20 minutes, giving you time to swap out the main power pack if you burn through its about two-hour battery life. Additionally, the headset has a new fan that will pull 30 percent more air through for better cooling, according to the company.</p><p>The head strap got some love, too. “Users can be pretty abusive,” said Dan O’Brien, HTC president of Americas. But that showed the company where there were “weak points” in the Focus 3’s design, and as a result of that, HTC “improved the metal hook for the back, topside handling, as well as the side arms.” </p><p>The Vive Focus Vision aims right at the consumer market that HTC’s Focus 3, with its Quest 2-style controllers, seemed to flirt with. (Previous Focus headsets were heavily business-oriented.) Other headsets from HTC have also targeted consumers, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23539328/htc-vive-xr-elite-ar-vr-headset-pricing-launch-date-ces">last year’s Vive XR Elite</a>, a lighter, $1,099 headset that also has color passthrough video but uses lower resolution screens than the Vision.</p><p>Anyone who preorders before October 17th will get a free kit that includes a 5-meter USB-C cable with DP 1.4 alternate mode support, as well as multiple adapters for PC VR streaming. The company also says it’s tossing in a “choice of three popular game bundles.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game by Japanese studio Dimps, Inc. about criminals forced to fight giant robots in a post-apocalyptic future seemed destined to be stranded on Sony’s ill-fated handheld, but in a surprise twist it’s not only coming to modern platforms, it’s also getting an HD upgrade.</p><p>Bandai Namco announced the move overnight, confirming that <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> will come to PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Steam) on January 10, 2025. In addition to general graphical enhancements, the game will support 4K resolution and 60fps on PS5 and PC. There have also been some changes to the gameplay to improve balance, difficulty, weapon crafting, and upgrades. <br></p><p>The teaser trailer for the remaster conveys the general premise of <em>Freedom Wars,</em> which is that in the year 102014 the planet’s surface is largely destroyed and uninhabitable, forcing humanity to live in underground siloes that function as penal colony city-states. People are convicted as criminals at birth and forced to work off million-year life sentences by serving as mercenaries in intra-colony raids and skirmishes with giant robots called “abductors” that try to steal citizens. </p><p>The game plays similar to <em>God Eater</em> with missions consisting of big battles where players run around hacking away at smaller enemies and big bosses. Grinding missions and completing optional objectives net resources and XP that can be used to upgrade weapons and skills, unlocking tougher missions and new story beats. It’s grindy but fun, and the worldbuilding and anime style make it feel like a unique riff on violent dystopia storytelling. A mechanic called “thorns” lets characters use a giant red whip to set traps and decapitate enemy body parts. <br></p><p>“I’ve wanted to make a sequel since it was released 10 years ago, but the opportunity never came,” the director of the original game, Takashi Tsukamoto, said in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/09/18/20240918-freedomwars/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/09/18/20240918-freedomwars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview at the PlayStation Blog</a></span>. “This time, we were blessed with the opportunity to develop it and have Bandai Namco Entertainment produce it, and since it was also the turning point of the 10th anniversary, we decided to do it at this timing.” </p><p>Tetsunosuke Seki, director of the remaster, said the loot system will be much less luck-based this time around, hopefully leading to fewer pain points in the progression system. More buttons on the PS5 DualSense should also make the control scheme much less cumbersome. The only thing that would be better is if Sony secretly released a PS Vita 2 for long-time fans to play it on. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is still planned for a release date of Fall 2025. That’s what <a href="https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/874054/20240723/AR_582262.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Two Interactive reaffirmed</a> in its 2024 annual report released on Wednesday. </p>



<p>The statement came in a section of the report specifically highlighting Rockstar Games. </p>







<p>“Rockstar Games continues to invest in the franchise and plans to release Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall of calendar 2025,” the company says while stating that more details will be released over time. Take Two then repeats the same message later in its “Content Release Highlights” section.</p>



<p>There had been a lot of rumors — dating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-gta-6-delay-isnt-what-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back as early as March 2024</a> — suggesting that GTA 6 was going to be pushed to 2026. While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay is always possible</a>, the status of the game remains now what it was earlier this year. Everything currently sits on schedule with a planned release for next year.</p>



<p>The first trailer for GTA 6 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-releases-gta-6-trailer/">released last December</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking viewership</a>. Since then, however, no more information has been provided as the one-year anniversary of the trailer’s release approaches. If the game is going to come a year from now, it could be assumed that Rockstar is gearing up to start the marketing campaign for one of the most anticipated video games of all time.</p>



<p>Are you confident that GTA 6 sticks with its Fall 2025 release date? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo fans are frothing over freshly-posted images purporting to show the under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. The pictures include apparent 3D models of the console and its Joy-Con, as well as photos of the console's shell - including its circuit board.
</p>
<p>
In general, the images depict a console almost identical to the current Switch, albeit with a larger screen size and what look to be magnets on the sides of its Joy-Con.
</p>
<p>
These details match with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treat-yourself-with-eight-inches-of-lcd-on-switch-2-report-says">previous</a> publicly-reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-report-details-magnetic-joy-con">details of Switch 2</a>, but do little to verify the images themselves. Indeed, doubt has been poured over the pictures - originally <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/66ea3de80000000027006ccb">posted</a> to a Chinese social media site then shared more widely via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/photos_of_switch_2_factory_prototypes_have_leaked/">reddit</a> - since it was discovered the original poster was a 3D design and model enthusiast. 
</p>
<p>
The original post author has since deleted the images from their social media profile - which also includes detailed models of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> figurines and other creations, crafted by someone clearly capable of copying and recreating 3D designs.
</p>
<p>
Still, the two photographic images posted alongside the 3D models do warrant some closer inspection - and in particular, the photo that appears to show the Switch 2's PCB (printed circuit board).
</p>
<p>
The detail shown on this board is remarkable, and the PCB number printed on it lines up with leaked shipment data for parts used in Switch 2 prototypes last year. Could the photos show a real prototype from which the poster of these images was recreating their own 3D models? Perhaps, though even then this would come with the caveat that the model that has since been superseded, and shouldn't be expected to translate exactly to the final article. In other words, even if this is real, it's out of date.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is the most interesting/plausible Switch 2 leak image - looks like some rough prototype components. Why fake a mainboard? Pay attention to the small size of the battery chamber and keep expectations firmly in check on handheld performance. <a href="https://t.co/M3DKSFnt3C">pic.twitter.com/M3DKSFnt3C</a></p>— Digital Foundry (@digitalfoundry) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1836416430276784588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

Nintendo is yet to announce any details of its next console, other than to confirm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">it will announce Switch 2 properly before April 2025</a>, the end of its current financial year. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for comment on the images posted today. 
</p>
<p>
Previous reporting by Eurogamer has tracked Switch 2 on its path to release, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">briefings to developers in the summer of 2023</a>, to early word in February 2024 that the console was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">now set for a 2025 release</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The past few weeks have seen Switch 2 rumours and speculation reach fever pitch, as anticipation of an announcement from Nintendo spikes. Any reveal from Nintendo will need to fit around an already-busy calendar for the company, with the impending launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and other Switch games, as its current-gen console is supported for one final Christmas.
