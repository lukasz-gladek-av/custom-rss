<p>A leak for a game called Tomb Raider Catalyst has leaked online ahead of The Game Awards, where an announcement is expected.</p>



<p>The leak came courtesy of a Reddit post on the Tomb Raider subreddit, where images of both a remake, titled ‘Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis,’ and a new mainline game called ‘Tomb Raider Catalyst’ were posted from what appears to be Amazon Games listings. You can see both images below:</p>

<h2 id="h-2-new-tomb-raider-games">2 New Tomb Raider Games</h2>



<div><p>The first Tomb Raider game, Legacy of Atlantis, will be a remake of the 1996 game coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The description of the game reads,</p><p>“Experience a stunning reimagining of Lara Croft’s 1996 genre-defining game with jaw-dropping visuals, modern gameplay, and new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.”</p></div>



<div><p>The second game, titled Tomb Raider Catalyst, will be coming sometime in 202,7 and it is described,</p><p>“Set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that unleashed ancient secrets and awakened mysterious guardian forces, Tomb Raider: Catalyst follows Lara Croft on a new adventure across Northern India.</p></div>







<p>First announced in 2022, Tomb Raider has hardly seen the light of day since, with developer Crystal Dynamics going through a turbulent time with approximately 60 people being laid off this year alone.</p>



<p>What do you think of us getting two new Tomb Raider games by the end of 2027?

<p>The Rockstar Games firing controversy has been one of the biggest gaming stories of 2025. New developments have slowly trickled out about the firing of 34 Rockstar employees, but now the company itself has officially addressed the real reason that led to the action.</p>



<p>On November 24, Insider Gaming reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaked-discord-messages-reveal-why-rockstar-fired-34-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Discord messages revealing why Rockstar fired 34 employees</a>. Now, Rockstar Games has officially given its side of the story, and the reasons are very interesting.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-claims-employees-discussed-features-from-unannounced-games">Rockstar Games Claims Employees Discussed Features From Unannounced Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Does this change things? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>







<p>Rockstar Games has given <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> a statement, voicing its own take on the employee firings scandal, which led to protests:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The only official title in development (that everyone knows about) at Rockstar Games right now is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-reveal-trailer-is-already-two-years-old/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. This will inevitably raise speculation about other games being worked on behind the scenes. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-4-remaster-former-rockstar-dev-niko-bellic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 4 remaster</a> has been discussed for the longest time, and you’d have to think <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-3-is-likely-says-lead-role-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 3</a> is inevitable.</p>



<p>This statement comes less than 24 hours after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-will-be-investigated-uk-prime-minister-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar will be investigated</a> due to a breach of union rights.</p>



<p>The Rockstar Games firing controversy looks to be far from over. Rockstar was hit with a legal claim shortly after the firings, and UK government action will only push the controversy further under the microscope. As always, Insider Gaming will continue to report on new evidence and developments in the ongoing case.</p>

            <guid>1380178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Guns and blades.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, the great holiday shopping deals would end after Cyber Monday. That is apparently no longer true. Case in point: today only, Best Buy is offering the console versions of Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for under $40 each. Specifically, <strong>you can get the PS5 or Xbox</strong> version of <strong>AC Shadows </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPVL6j?object_uuid=5cde1036-b3aa-4021-86f6-ad86ad038773&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>for $34.99</strong></a>, and <strong>Black Ops 7 </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJLpo?object_uuid=5cde1036-b3aa-4021-86f6-ad86ad038773&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>for $39.99</strong></a>. Both deals go away at midnight, so grab them fast if you want them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Today's Best Game Deals</h2><div id="233605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="c826a57c-825a-4266-a8c1-bfbe6ffbfce2"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 SteelBook Cross-Gen Bundle Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="c826a57c-825a-4266-a8c1-bfbe6ffbfce2" id="233606"><div id="233606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Black Ops 7 deal is particularly good, because it’s on the steelbook cross-gen bundle editions of the game. That means you get a free steelbook case for the game with your purchase. And regardless of whether you buy the PS4 or PS5 version, it’ll work on both systems natively. The same is true of the Xbox version, with the Xbox One and Xbox Series X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike most similar sales we’ve seen recently, no other retailer is matching the prices, meaning they’re exclusive to Best Buy. These are by far the best deals we’ve seen so far on both of these 2025 games. In other words, I wouldn’t expect to see either game drop to a lower price this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real question, of course, is whether the games are any good. If we’re talking about Assassin’s Cree Shadows, the answer is yes, absolutely. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">8/10 review</a>, critic Jarrett Green wrote, “Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the answer is a little more complicated. While the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">campaign</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review">Zombies</a> modes are a little lackluster, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">multiplayer</a> remains strong. In our review of the latter mode, critic Seth Macy wrote, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s multiplayer is a great time. The first crop of maps are excellent, taking into consideration the new wall run and wall jump mechanics and how that extra dimension of movement adds so much to the fun. The weapons are all solid with the exception of the SMGs, and even though none have really captured my imagination, they're fun to use and fun to grind.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of these deals are absolutely killer for games this new, as emphasized by the fact that even Amazon isn’t price matching them. But the sale ends at midnight, so pick up whichever one you want (or both) before the deep discount goes away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <guid>1380175</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have issued a lengthy statement after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">the <u>Battlefield 6</u></a> Winter Offensive 1.1.3.0 update saw players reporting widespread issues related to the main menu UI, gameplay stuttering, Breakthrough, and much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message, posted both to Battlefield <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1999147496069628313?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>social media accounts</u></a> and the FPS franchise’s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-winter-offensive-launch-and-player-feedback" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>, functions both as an explanation and a game plan. BF Studios says hotfixes and updates will now roll out in the coming days as it attempts to iron out the numerous kinks that started making waves in the Battlefield 6 community earlier this week.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Surprise Attack</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— CAMIKAZE78 (@CAMIKAZE78) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAMIKAZE78/status/1998371829963280511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Winter Offensive was originally positioned to bring wintery new content hand-in-hand with audio fixes, more reliable hit registration, and balance tweaks as BF Studios continues to flesh out the new Battlefield game’s first season. However, as update 1.1.3.0 made its way to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S Tuesday, players were instead met with an army of technical hurdles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clunky main menu navigation and trouble registering hits on firing range targets were two of the more annoying issues being shared around online. One problem that actually impacted moment-to-moment multiplayer gameplay for many, though, involved micro stuttering that saw players freezing in place as they ran into battle. Another, more bizarre result of the new update had to do with what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pikb79/stealth_movement_nerf_with_todays_patch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many believed was a stealth nerf to movement</a>, which, despite being applauded by some, has since been reverted and labeled as “<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1998788825456226525?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>unexpected behavior</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It kind of feels like there's an absolute deadline schedule by which point stuff comes out no matter what," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1piepe5/comment/nt5mx3f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user commented</a> shortly after the update went live. "I know DICE always had this 'fix X, break Y' modus operandi that's amusingly consistent amongst generations of people who worked there but so far every update has been literally that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The occasional hiccup aside, BF Studios has been steadily moving through Battlefield 6 Season 1, but it feels like that momentum has come to a halt with Winter Offensive. Even if the stop is only temporary, the update’s launch marks a moment of uncertainty for fans as they await Season 2 and as the holidays rush in. Winter Offensive has proven to be so problematic, in fact, that Battlefield REDSEC, the Battlefield 6 battle royale offshoot experience, had its Elite Series <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1998882936569905156?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postponed</a> due to “unforeseen technical issues.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to be upfront: this is on us,” the Battlefield team said yesterday.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 is absolutely unplayable after the patch<br>Well done <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@battlefield</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/EA_DICE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@EA_DICE</a> <a href="https://t.co/U5rF4gaDWt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U5rF4gaDWt</a></p>— DANNYonPC (@DANNYonPC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DANNYonPC/status/1998441358604865699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Calling for Backup</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios wants Battlefield 6 players to rest easy knowing that, if these issues haven’t already been fixed, they will be fixed soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to give you a clear status update on the issues we are tracking, the work already completed, and our near-term and future plans,” today’s statement says. “The team has been reviewing all reports since the update, including items related to Breakthrough, the Firing Range, Portal, the Main Menu, and performance topics such as micro-stuttering on PC, along with several other issues raised by the community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technical difficulties related to incorrect ticket sizes for Conquest, daily challenge rewards, infantry momentum, and battle pass tier skipping have already been resolved. More thorough hotfixes are now scheduled to begin tomorrow, December 12, starting with fixes for micro stuttering, main menu navigation, and the firing range for PC via Steam players. PS5 and Xbox players will benefit from their own update come December 15, which should bring an end to issues for the main menu and firing range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stat tracking, especially pertaining to bot kills, is another issue that’s persisted through recent weeks that BF Studios plans to address soon, with rubber banding related to minimum spec PCs also set to be addressed. Perhaps the most heavily criticized aspects of Winter Offensive, though, were the changes to Breakthrough and vehicle placements announced via the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1130-patch-notes-detail-audio-improvements-and-map-changes-coming-with-season-1-winter-offensive"><u>update 1.1.3.0 patch notes</u></a> last week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios says it’s heard the complaints related to how the update may have made victory too easy for the attacking team, specifically calling attention to concerns about objective placement, vehicle spawns, and attacker momentum. The developers explain that some fixes in this regard, specifically pertaining to vehicle spawning, have already been published, but stops short of walking players through how or when it plans to address these concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Your feedback continues to guide the direction of our Breakthrough improvements, and we will share more as future adjustments take shape,” the message adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More tweaks to vehicles should help the overall Battlefield 6 experience, too, with BF Studios saying it’s implemented updated vehicle damage zones, fixed hit registration for vehicle-mounted machine guns, and adjusted some maps for better pacing during matches. Finally, those who enjoy flying jets should know that air-to-air combat is set to receive some adjustments, including reduced jet canon damage, early next year, with a dedicated air radar planned to launch after Season 1.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will continue validating the resolutions already in development, gathering additional data from your reports, and prioritizing remaining issues based on severity and player impact,” BF Studios adds. “Several items have already been resolved, or will be through our upcoming hotfixes. More improvements are planned in upcoming updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S. It’s been on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-leave-wicked-grin-skin-almost-unrecognizable-after-community-calls-out-bright-colors">a bit of a rollercoaster</a> ever since, as players have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-just-had-the-best-month-of-sales-in-the-us-of-any-game-in-the-last-three-years">logged on</a> to both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">praise</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rascals-battlefield-6-players-torn-as-323-pack-puts-a-high-price-on-grounded-skins">criticize</a> everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">map sizes</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-quickly-fixes-defibrillators-after-support-players-report-strict-revive-requirements">balance changes</a>.

                <p>The wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> has been long, and fans are eager for any sign of progress--and don't expect any sort of announcement this holiday season. However, that excitement only grew when Bethesda released a live-action comedy trailer to celebrate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-is-now-on-yet-another-platform-but-theres-a-way-to-upgrade-for-free/1100-6536793/1100-65360/" data-ref-id="1100-6536793">Skyrim's sudden launch on the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. The trailer features a mischievous Santa and two elves, and at first glance, it seems like simple holiday fun. But the numbers shown on the elves' character screen quickly caught the community's attention.</p><p>The reason: One elf's speech skill jumps to 27, while their overall level is shown moving toward 20. Some fans believe these numbers are a deliberate hint that The Elder Scrolls 6 is planned for 2027. Supporters of the theory argue that the numbers are too specific to be random, while others think people may be reading too much into a random number. Still, because Bethesda rarely shares direct updates about the game, even small details like this can spark big debates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHxhOQsSj6E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nHxhOQsSj6E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"This honestly might be the best piece of evidence we have for a release date," one fan said. "Those are very specific numbers, and I don't think they would use those numbers by accident."</p><p>There's good reason for both curiosity and caution. Bethesda leaders, including Todd Howard, have repeatedly said the game is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">"a long way off,"</a> even though it was first announced back in 2018. The studio has confirmed that early development began in 2023 and that playtesting is now underway, but no release window has been announced. Fans feel the long gap more sharply because Skyrim's re-releases kept the series in the spotlight while the next main entry remained out of reach.</p><p>Howard has admitted the wait has been unusually long, though he says the team needed a creative break and wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">build Starfield first</a>. He's also expressed interest in surprising fans with a sudden release, similar to the shadow-dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered in 2025</a>. Whether or not the numbers in the Switch 2 trailer actually point to 2027, anticipation for The Elder Scrolls 6 is only growing.</p><p>Bethesda might have its hands full going into 2026 with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrims-switch-2-port-has-a-bit-of-a-performance-issue/1100-6536879/" data-ref-id="1100-6536879">Switch 2 port marred with lag issues</a> and the Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition still awaiting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-gets-new-update-following-anniversary-edition-backlash/1100-6536446/" data-ref-id="1100-6536446">second bug-fix update slated to arrive this month as well</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233"><em>Fallout</em> season two on Amazon Prime</a> is nearly here, so it’s time to get ready. And what better way to get caught up on what happened in the popular adaptation of Bethesda’s RPG franchise than by watching Amazon’s official season one recap? I mean, it’s not like they would use AI tools to create it and fill it with inaccurate information. Right?</p> <p>Wrong. That’s exactly what Amazon did. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/the-official-fallout-season-1-recap-is-filled-with-ai-and-thinks-the-show-is-set-in-the-1950s/">As spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a>, a newly uploaded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Season-2/dp/B0FLSZBRZJ?tag=kotaku01-20" rel="false"><em>Fallout</em> recap on the show’s official Amazon Prime page</a> appears to use a monotone AI-generated voice to narrate over clips from the show’s inaugural season. It sounds horrible and makes it hard to actually consume the information being delivered. But that might be a good thing because some of what the robot voice spits out is completely bullshit. Just straight up inaccurate.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652683">©Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For example, at multiple points in the short recap, the AI-generated voice claims that the flashbacks seen in the show take place in the 1950s. That’s wrong. Those flashbacks featuring pre-ghoulified Cooper Howard take place around 2077. Specifically, the flashback showing the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Great_War">nukes falling on America takes place on October 23, 2077</a>.</p>

 <p>The recap also claims that Lucy goes with the Ghoul at the end of the <em>Fallout</em> season finale because she has to choose between life and death. Wrong again, you dumb robot. She actually goes because she wants to track down her father and learn the truth. Something the Ghoul is interested in, too.</p> <p>There are probably other inaccuracies in this horrible, shitty recap, but whatever, I’m going to waste as little time on this as possible, as it seems Amazon doesn’t care enough about one of its biggest TV shows to simply put out an accurate, human-created two-minute recap. <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-ai-generated-english-dub-banana-fish-reaction-2000649707">This isn’t the first time Amazon Prime has upset people by using generative AI</a> to produce worthless slop, and I doubt it will be the last, as every big tech company invests more and more into something very few people seem to want or like.</p> <p>Anyway,<em> Fallout</em> season two arrives exclusively on Amazon Prime on December 17.</p>

                <p>For the past two decades, the Call of Duty titles have almost always been the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/" data-ref-id="2900-5031">US's top-selling games of the year</a>. But it looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is experiencing a marked decline in sales from its predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-to-change-release-strategy-for-call-of-duty-franchise-as-new-data-suggests-player-count-has-halved-in-12-months" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Alinea Analytics' data indicates that Black Ops 7 sold 401,000 copies on Steam in the first 26 days after its launch. By comparison, Black Ops 6 sold 2.3 million copies in the same time period in 2024. Call of Duty games have historically sold fewer copies on Steam than on consoles, and Black Ops 6 and 7 were both included with PC Game Pass. But that doesn't account for why the latter had such a dramatic decline.</p><p>Video Game Insights also shared data that suggests Black Ops 7's daily active users dropped to 18 million in November 2025, down from 36 million DAU in December 2024. Going back to Modern Warfare in 2022, concurrent users on Steam had been on a steady decline from 500,000 in early 2023 before briefly rebounding to over 300,000 players for Black Ops 6. Currently, Black Ops 7 is estimated to have a concurrent count between 50,000 and 100,000 players on Steam.</p><p>"The data points to a foundational engagement challenge for Black Ops 7," reads a statement from Video Game Insights. "Whether the cause lies in franchise fatigue, shifting genre preferences, competition from other titles, or a misalignment with player expectations, the early indicators are clear: this is not a normal launch-cycle fluctuation. It is a significant departure from historical performance."</p><p>Earlier this week, Activision itself acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself</a>. That was soon followed by an announcement from Microsoft that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call Of Duty was 2025's top franchise on Game Pass</a>. Both of those things can be true, but it remains to be seen whether the decline in standalone sales is being made offset by Game Pass or other factors.</p><p>Microsoft and Activision haven't shared their Call of Duty plans for 2026 yet. The one thing we do know from <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's recent dispatch</a> is that there won't be any more Modern Warfare or Black Ops sequels dropping in consecutive years.</p>

            <guid>1380142</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Quitting Spotify might have almost beaten Luke, but I’ve fared a little better thanks to my brand new digital audio player</p><p>Before there was the iPod, there was the cheap MP3 player. I remember these devices from my teenagerhood. Small and with barely a UI to speak of, they had robust storage and could hold hundreds upon hundreds of songs. Of course, the design improvements of the iPod would put all these also-rans out of business—it turns out that being able to access any song on your device within three clicks of that scroll wheel was an incredible boon for those of us with huge music libraries. From there the chain of history is easy to link together. The iPod leads to the iPhone leading to no one ever needing to have a standalone music playing device because they’re all subscribing to services like Spotify.</p><p>Because I have a lot of friends who are working musicians, I have absolutely <a href="https://aftermath.site/cancel-spotify-wrapped-ai-ceo-apple-music/"><u>no love for Spotify</u></a>. They pay artists peanuts and they also make the music sound like shit due all the compression necessary for streaming audio to your device over the internet. I listen to tons of music, and have especially been interested in the <a href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-erang-tome-zero-fantasy/"><u>dungeon synth</u></a> scene, a very small scene of very small artists. While almost all the music I want is available streaming, I’d rather buy the music on Bandcamp, knowing that a higher percentage of my money goes to the artist—especially from artists who I know won’t make much money from streaming.</p><p>Up until I bought a Digital Audio Player, those Bandcamp purchases were largely theoretical. Sure, I’d bought the album, but I never downloaded the audio files, instead opting to listen to my music either on the Bandcamp app or on Tidal. Because Tidal also offers its listeners basically all music ever recorded in human history, that meant I wasn’t listening to the music I bought. A digital audio player forces my hand—and I’ve found that I genuinely enjoy this experience of listening to music a lot more.</p><p>While there is a fascinating world of people buying and refurbishing old iPods, when I looked at the broad price range and options for the wide variety of DAPs, I wanted to try something new. While I don’t think any device on the market holds a candle to the classic iPod, design-wise, I am extremely happy with my <a href="https://www.fiio.com/echomini?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Snowsky Fiio Echo Mini</a>.</p><figure></figure><p>What attracted me to the Echo Mini was that it doesn’t have any features I didn’t want and also that it is adorable. If you’re looking into the world of DAPs, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by choice. There are extremely expensive DAPs from <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/walkman-mp3-players/p/nwa306-b?ref=aftermath.site"><u>companies like Sony</u></a> that can also access the internet and download apps like the iPod Touch of yesteryear. But I don’t want any of that shit. I don’t even want Bluetooth. I want an object that plays MP3s that I listen to with my new wired in-ear monitors.</p><p>The Echo Mini is shaped like a tape deck and is even smaller than I expected when I grabbed it. For under a hundred dollars, this device can hold more music that I can reasonably listen to, even on my five hour Thanksgiving flight to Los Angeles. Because the Echo Mini has both onboard storage and a slot for a micro SD card, I have 256GB of storage and I’ve barely scratched the surface. The battery life is also remarkable, especially compared to my phone, which was previously my main music listening device. I haven’t had to charge it once since I bought it about a month ago.</p><p>Although the user experience leaves something to be desired—you’re forced to scroll through nested menus with multiple tiny buttons, reminding me of playing a Japanese RPG on the Playstation, complete menu hell—I love using this device. It slips right in my pocket and it frees me from the yoke of always looking for my phone when I’m out and about. Its clunky UI actually forces me to pick an album and stick with it, where having access to the entirety of all recorded music in history often gave me choice paralysis. It’s also revealed that if I make sure I have a couple of my comfort albums—<em>how i’m feeling now, The Downward Spiral</em>, a handful of Talking Heads albums—I don’t actually <em>need</em> to have access to every album ever. I appreciate the albums I have already bought so much more when I don’t have a choice but to listen to them.</p><p>But most of all—the music sounds amazing. I haven’t even dived into the alternate file formats like FLAC, and I’m already hearing new details in songs I’ve listened to over and over. Rosalia’s most recent album <em>LUX</em> sounds fantastic, surrounding me with the lushness of the orchestral compositions. Even pop music sounds a lot fuller. I was listening to the Dev Lemons album <em>Surface Tension</em>, and you can hear intonations from her deep in the mix that I simply cannot hear on streaming services.</p><p>After a month of using a DAP I can envision a future where I totally ditch streaming. Listening to albums purposefully, instead of just through the convenience of having literally everything available at all times, has allowed me to fall back in love with the music I have. I think there should be a little more friction in life, in general, but the friction of needing to actually buy an album was something I didn’t even realize I missed. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI developer Rockstar is currently being accused of <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">union-busting by the 34 workers (31 in UK, three in Canada) it fired and the IWGB (Independent Workers of Great Britain)</a>, and after the story reached UK parliament for a second time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">this time with Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaking on it</a>, Rockstar has released a statement reaffirming its previous claims that the fired employees were dismissed for distributing and discussing confidential information, not because they were part of the union.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">IGN</a>, Rockstar not only reaffirmed its previous claims but also specified the alleged confidential information more than it did before. When Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">initially claimed the employees were dismissed for gross misconduct regarding the alleged leak of confidential information</a>, it stated the employees were "<em>found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p>This time, the new statement specifies that the employees were distributing and discussing confidential information "<em>including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading</em>," the full statement reads.</p>



<p>After Rockstar first made its claim that the employees were leaking confidential information, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">IWGB</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">other union members</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">employees speaking up anonymously</a> have not only refuted these claims, but a recent report points to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">Rockstar allegedly trying to use employees discussing changing Slack policies in a union-members-only Discord server as the breach of confidential information</a> that got the 34 employees fired.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">IWGB has also filed legal claims against Rockstar</a> based on the evidence it is collecting and its accusations of union-busting, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed the government would be investigating the accusations in parliament yesterday, December 10, 2025. </p>



<p>It's also worth remembering that Chris Murray, the MP who brought the issue directly to Starmer during yesterday's parliament, also noted that he came to parliament after having spoken to Rockstar, saying that they "<em>failed to reassure me they are following employment law</em>,<em> and I share concerns about union-busting</em>."</p>



<p>IGN's report also includes further statements from Murray, who told IGN that upon his arrival at Rockstar, the studio attempted to force him and fellow MPs Tracy Gilbert and Scott Arthur to sign an NDA before they could enter the building to discuss the firings. All three MPs made it clear they would not sign, and Rockstar eventually gave way. </p>



<p>"<em>The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed</em>," Murray said. "<em>The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members, I was not assured their process paid  robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Remember Google Stadia? Steam finally made its gamepad worth rescuing]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/829631/save-google-stadia-gamepad-steam-deadline</link>
            <guid>1380124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>December 31st, 2025 is the deadline to <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/index_en_US.html">save the Google Stadia controller</a>. That’s less than three weeks from today — but there’s never been a better time. Last month, I discovered the controller is finally a first-class citizen in Steam and SteamOS.</p><p>The Stadia controller was originally designed to connect to your Wi-Fi network and remotely control games from Google’s cloud servers. But when Stadia shut down in January 2023, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561541/google-stadia-shutdown-precedent-editorial">did an amazing job shutting down the service</a>: it offered full hardware refunds and let you rescue the Stadia Controller by turning it into a generic Bluetooth gamepad instead.</p><p>When I flew to Valve headquarters in late October to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements">the Steam Machine</a>, I asked Pierre-Loup Griffais if Steam would ever fully support the Stadia controller the way it’s supported so many other gamepads, letting you turn each of its buttons and joysticks into fully customizable control schemes. At the time, he said he thought the Xbox One wireless adapter might be a higher priority than Google’s abandoned controller.</p><p>So you can imagine my surprise to find Steam not only supports the Stadia gamepad now, it’s made every button useful. That Google Assistant key is now a freely programmable M1 macro button! Google’s screenshot button takes screenshots in SteamOS! The Stadia button is now effectively an Xbox button, letting you activate many (not all) of the Steam Deck’s handiest shortcuts, including Stadia+A to pull up the quick access menu, Stadia+Right Stick to summon a mouse cursor, and Stadia+Left Stick to adjust the volume or brightness.</p><p>On a desktop, the Stadia button can additionally launch Steam’s Big Picture Mode.</p><p>It’s certainly not the best gamepad you can buy for Steam.

<p>If you’ve ever fancied adding a games cabinet to your house or a workplace as an attraction, chances are you’ve come across Arcade1Up. The company is quite possibly the biggest when it comes to gaming cabinet creations, but recent developments mean the end could be nigh.</p>



<p>A high-end PC or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ps5-games-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> Pro is all well and good, but an authentic, old-school gaming experience comes from a games cabinet you’d find in an arcade. This is where Arcade1Up has excelled since 2018, when it was started by CEO Scott Bachrach. The company has been doing well, but new evidence suggests it’s not enough.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-seems-like-the-end-for-arcade1up">It Seems Like The End For Arcade1Up</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many classics. Credit to Arcade1up</figcaption></figure>



<p>A post on the Arcade1Up subreddit has come to light, showing an alleged internal email exchange between Arcade1Up employees.</p>







<p>In the email, the sender is contacting the company’s Beta Team with an unfortunate message: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Beta Team, I come to you with news I wish I didn’t have to share. Arcade1Up is closing operations. For the majority of us, our last day is this coming Friday. I cannot speak to the future of the brand, it is not my place to share what might be next and and whom will be in charge of it. I do not know the plans for the arcade systems or the Infinity Tables. I believe they will continue to operate as they currently do, but I do not know for certain.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There will be many implications regarding online play used by certain machines, firmware updates, and much more if this is the end of Arcade1Up.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The names and emails have been redacted, and until we hear an official statement from the company, we have to take this with a pinch of salt for now.</p>



<p>If you’ve heard anything more about this development, contact anyone from the Insider Gaming team. Also, if this is the end, we encourage you to do your part and share your favorite memories of Arcade1Up via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

		<p>Aspyr Media have announced that the remaster of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deus-ex-remastered/"> Deus Ex </a>will no longer launch on February 5th 2026 and as usual, the delay is because they think the game needs more work.</p>
<p>The full statement reads:</p>


<p><em>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We’ve listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes. All existing preorders will be fully refunded. Thank you again for your patience and support.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Deus Ex Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1RdKezTYNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game was only revealed in September this year via a collaboration of Aspyr and Eidos-Montréal. They seemed to be taking the right approach to the game stating The mission: preserve the truth, modernize the tools, and prepare a new generation of agents for what lies ahead.”</p>

<p>“This remaster isn’t just a visual upgrade, but a preservation of Deus Ex’s DNA – carefully modernized without sacrificing the conspiratorial paranoia that made the original game so iconic,” he adds. “Each location has been overhauled with new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,” they added.</p>
<p>The title was scheduled for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The reception to the trailer was not exactly warm as the remaster adds new textures, upgrades the models and adds new lighting, but the levels are still very empty and sparse.&nbsp; However, the models are not exactly modern and it looks more like someone has put an Instagram filter over the original game.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670</link>
            <guid>1380076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>expansion</span></a><span> is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-research-shiny-charm-2000652209"><span>big ol’ grind</span></a><span>. It’s a fun one, and it paves the way to some really cool reveals and story moments, but it is a lot more time-consuming than fans probably expected. I’ve put about a dozen hours into the DLC’s new roguelike mode, so I’m practically an expert, right? If you’re getting tired of making donuts for the mysterious Pokémon Hoopa and heading into portals to an unknown world when you just want to see one of the new Mega Evolutions, I’ve got a handful of tips to help you make the most of these time-limited expeditions into Hyperspace.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Keep a flying Pokémon on your team</b></h2> <p><span>Now, I don’t mean you need a flying-type Pokémon on your team; I mean a Pokémon capable of flight or quickly moving through the air. Your biggest asset in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s Hyperspace zones is time, and it’s possible to miss out on an objective by literal seconds if you don’t have a Pokémon that can readily reach an object or target on high ground. This is especially important when you’re trying to reach the floating Poke Balls throughout the zone that you’ll often have to destroy as part of a Hyperspace run. If you’ve only got land-based monsters, it will take them longer to reach these objectives, which means precious seconds lost before you’re pulled back to reality. So keep someone on your belt who can fly to harder-to-reach places.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Find moves that don’t take long to cast</b></h2> <p><span>Speaking of saving time, one thing that will help you accomplish more in a Hyperspace run is to make sure your Pokémon have moves that don’t take long to execute. Moves that have to charge up or have phases might be strong, but you’re going to lose more time casting them than you will with a different attack. I tried using my Raichu, who knows the ground-type move Dig, against a long string of fire-type Pokemon weak to that move, but because it requires the mouse to dig into the ground and then sprout up underneath an opponent, I lost time using it that I could have saved by swapping to another monster who has a ground-type move that doesn’t take as long to use. Be mindful of your movesets before you head into Hyperspace so you can take out enemies more quickly.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652671"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652671">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Get to high ground while searching for the Bonus Ball</b></h2> <p><span>After you complete all the missions in a run, a golden Bonus Ball will spawn somewhere on the map. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t give you any guidance as to where, and you’ll have to find it in whatever time you have left before Hoopa pulls you off the stage with a hook. Your best chance at finding this spherical treasure chest is to get to high ground. Sometimes you’ll be able to get to the top of buildings with a Holovator; other times, you might have to climb scaffolding. This isn’t foolproof because the Bonus Ball might be tucked in a corner on the lower levels of a zone, but it’s a quick way to eliminate some possibilities so you’re not wasting time.</span></p>

 <h2><b>PSA: You can fast-travel to the exit if you’re not in battle, and you should</b></h2> <p><span>If you’ve caught every Pokémon you want in a zone, completed every objective, and found the Bonus Ball, keep in mind you can fast-travel back to the Hyperspace entrance, and this will get you out much faster so you can get to the next run. It’s a small thing, but when you’re grinding runs back to back, every second counts.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t worry about being at or too far above the raised level of a zone</b></h2> <p><span>One of the big changes Game Freak harped on in the lead-up to </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s release</span> <span>was that the roguelike segments would break the series’ level 100 cap. You meet these superpowered monsters where they’re at by feeding Hoopa berry-filled donuts, which it uses to boost your team’s level in the Hyperspace zones. While I understand the instinct to try and be at or above the projected levels of monsters in a zone, in my experience, even if you’re maybe 20 or so below you can reasonably accomplish what you need to on a run. Don’t be reckless, but don’t feel like you’ve gotta waste all your best berries each time you need to make a donut. Do try and have a team of six that is all at a base level of 100 so they can make the most of the donut-based upgrades, though.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652672"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652672">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>You don’t get experience from Hyperspace battles, so don’t come here to grind levels</b></h2> <p><span>As cool as the thought of fighting superpowered Pokémon and raking in experience sounds, you will not gain any of that in Hyperspace. The rewards you get for running through the bizarro Lumiose City are often very specific to the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> content, rather than something you can use to grind for other parts of the game. You’ll get a ton of berries and survey points, but not experience that will raise your monsters’ base levels. You might find Exp. Candies sometimes, which will give you experience, but it’s inconsistent.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Don’t haphazardly load up Donuts with whatever Berries you’ve got</b></h2> <p><span>Every Donut Hoopa eats is made up of various Berries you’ll come across throughout Lumiose City. You can mix any combination of them, which each will increase your level in a Hyperspace run, but they also have different perks like stat upgrades, resistance to certain attacks, and maybe even an upgraded Shiny spawn chance. As tempting as it is to just load your best Berries into one pastry, this will come back to bite you, especially in the later story segments when you need to create specific Donuts with a list of high-flavor requirements. You’ll wish you hadn’t wasted some of those rare Berries, and you’ll have to go on runs with your fingers crossed hoping they will spawn in Hyperspace. So bake your Donuts responsibly.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/theburntpeanut-tarkov-streamer-item/</link>
            <guid>1380070</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TheBurntPeanut, one of the most popular content creators in the world right now, has received an exclusive ‘streamer item’ from Battlestate Games for use in Escape from Tarkov. In the last couple of years, the Escape from Tarkov community and platform have been a foundation for TheBurntPeanut on his rise to fame, so this is a very appropriate move by Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>Fans of the energetic, hilarious streamer have been lobbying Battlestate Games for the longest time for an exclusive streamer item, and now it’s here. Check it out below.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-s-tarkov-streamer-item-is-exactly-what-you-d-expect">TheBurntPeanut’s Tarkov Streamer Item is Exactly What You’d Expect</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first new streamer item unveiled by Battlestate Games in recent days. Earlier this week, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-player-escape-tarkov-streamer-item/">a streamer item for Tigz</a>, the first person in the world to complete the Tarkov campaign in full. He received a special ‘splint’ item just days ago.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has now received the Escape from Tarkov streamer item treatment.</p>



<p>He joins a long line of popular creators who have used Escape from Tarkov to propel their content forward. At this point, there are a couple of dozen streamer items in the game, and they even feed into one of the game’s most aspirational tasks. To unlock the legendary ‘Kappa’ case, players must collect <strong>every streamer item</strong>, amongst other things.</p>



<p>There’s even a special ‘streamer item case’ that users can unlock to store these items in.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut’s item is at least practical, surfacing as a balaclava that perfectly resembles TheBurntPeanut’s own visage.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dmitri Ogorodnikov, the head of PR at Battlestate Games, followed up with a post dubbing the streamer item ‘well deserved’, a sentiment that was echoed by fans of the streamer, who are affectionately named ‘Bungulators’.</p>



<p>Do you think TheBurntPeanut’s streamer item is appropriate? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

But, based on further fan feedback, CI Games has put together one final offering that reworks enemy and boss behavior and adds a new Veteran Mode for those seeking the game's toughest challenge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've prided ourselves on being a players-first studio, and we mean that," CI Games' creative strategist Ryan Hill told IGN today. "Version 2.0 in April was a huge milestone, but we weren't finished... It became clear that players wanted a greater challenge from both enemies and bosses, so we went back in and pushed those systems further. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Version 2.5 brings significant enhancements to Legacy Mode - new behaviours, new movesets, more aggression across the board - and introduces an entirely new difficulty option, Veteran Mode, for players craving an even steeper climb. We're thrilled to offer this final major update free to all players as a genuine thank-you for their support, and as a small taste of what awaits them in Lords of the Fallen II next year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Familiar bosses now feature fresh behaviors, with even more difficult versions tuned for Veteran Mode. But with fresh challenges also come new rewards, including signature attack animations on boss weapons and a unique breastplate for those who take on Veteran Mode and conquer it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CI Games previously promised "big news" on Lords of the Fallen II would be featured in tonight's Game Awards 2025.
