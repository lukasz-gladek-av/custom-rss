<figure data-uuid="ef23178a376c2"><a title="Lego Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ef23178a376c2/lego-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released a short teaser video confirming a new <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> Lego set in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>There's not a whole lot to go on for now, but it seems to indicate that we'll be getting some sort of incarnation of Ganon. The shadow rising up from the bottom of the screen to confront Lego Link appears to be pretty large and takes the rough shape of the pig-like villain. We wouldn't be surprised to see Ganondorf either, though.</p>
<p>It's likely that the new set will be based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-new-zelda-lego-set-rumour-links-it-to-fan-favourite-entry">previous rumour pointing to a potential release in March 2026.</a> The video also showcases what looks to be Navi floating beside Link, and we can also see Zelda herself in the background.</p>

<p>Lego fans can already get their hands on the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set, which originally launched in 2024. We gave it a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/lego-the-legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-2-in-1-a-superb-debut-with-one-minor-irritation">8/10 in our review</a> and said that while "details and nods to the games are plentiful, but with no easy way to convert one to the other, you’re going to have your work cut out for you if you want to get the most out of this one".</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep an eye out for a proper reveal in the days and weeks to come, but for now, colour us excited!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lumines-arise-review-kraft-und-licht</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lumines-arise-review-kraft-und-licht.1350034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We need more puzzle games in the hands of the people. Forget the daily Wordle, or those insipid color sort games, you gotta say to yourself that "the day doesn’t start until I complete this <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baba-is-you" rel="nofollow"><em>Baba is You</em></a> level", or until you figure out what gets wetter as it dries. Thank goodness Enhance have got this in mind also, as <em>Lumines Arise</em> has, well, risen.</p>

<p>This is the latest game from Enhance Games, the Japan-based studio fronted by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who was also the director of the original <em>Lumines </em>in 2004. With Enhance, Mizuguchi and co. have been refining a certain transcendental experience that collides with almost menial puzzle gameplay, whether it’s <em>Rez Infinite</em>, the widely revered <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, or the bustling nature of <em>Humanity</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> sees itself neck-and-neck with the likes of <em>Tetris Effect</em>, not just because of its block-based gameplay, but the way it presents itself; almost hoity-toity in fashion. Let it be stated for the record that I personally don’t see what the gift is in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, as its aesthetic clashed way too much mechanically with what <em>Tetris </em>is, and indeed became. What was once 5 minutes on the john with a Game Boy was now lampooning as an artistic endeavor, embarrassed to provide flow.</p>



<p>By contrast, the gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is simplistic to the point of oversight. You are given two different tones of blocks that always come in the shape of 2x2, and it’s your job to create other 2x2 squares of one tone or the other. Sometimes they spawn in as such, a free point bonus if you will, but you also have to time your drops to the beat of the song playing. It's a very delicate dance, one that surprisingly punishes brute force quite often.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there is a lifeline in the form of a “linker”. Say you have a long 1x1 line of one tone that snakes across your messy board, and a linker of that tone is able to connect to it? That entire line is completely erased, leading to a major reset of the board's opportunities. Despite a much more stilted execution of combos, it's very similar to<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/puyo-puyo-tetris-2" rel="nofollow">Puyo Puyo</a></em> in that regard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a new power-up similar to the “Zone” bonus in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, in the form of “Burst”. Like with Zone, a square of one tone will form and expand, with each single 1x1 square added with the same tone, making it grow and eat any other squares. With that monstrous square formed, a new one spawns of the other tone, and boom, another major reset.</p>



<p>It’s an exceptionally powerful ability, one which seems almost negligible since the linkers work to the same effect, but it works with the visual design brilliantly. Each board blossoms with the progression, and with much broader strokes than the underspoken developments of <em>Tetris Effect</em>’s backgrounds and songs. Still, with time, <em>Lumines Arise</em> effectively evolves into something very different.</p>

<p>While the painting of <em>Arise </em>is similar to <em>Effect</em>, the painter in question is one much more indebted to how <em>Lumines </em>came to existence to begin with. This was always meant to be “transcendental”, to instill a purity through new-age affirmations, even back in 2004, when Mizuguchi’s Sega experience influenced every part of <em>Lumines</em>’ Y2K aesthetic. As it stands, <em>Lumines Arise</em> IS the game that should define Enhance as a studio.</p>

<p>The end result is absolutely magical. From the moment you begin to see yourself in the same shoes of holistic block-based puzzle gameplay, you begin to notice the songs are providing more influence on the board. It's not just that the background is thumping behind the actual action, but the blocks transform, they intertwine with those elements until it becomes what <em>Lumines </em>wanted to be from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll notice in the corner of gameplay that there’s a little individual reacting to your gameplay, and that’s your Loomii; a customizable avatar who adds a surprising amount of personality to proceedings. They’ll meditate, they’ll rave, they’ll float and interact with other Loomii’s you come across, and it’s nice to see that be the blueprint for <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s general connectivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with any <em>Lumines </em>game, the songs are a huge part of the core experience, and here, they're all earworms. The ones that are purely instrumental are the heaviest hitters, with legitimate structure throughout, and the right amount of dynamic co-operation with each square clear and combo chain. It's a huge upgrade on the underspoken and otherwise one-note house music that <em>Lumines </em>tended to pair itself with.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> also tries to expand how it plays with mission modes, which tries to extract the same amount of variety that <em>Tetris Effect</em> does with what it can do with its gameplay. In <em>Arise</em>’s case, it isn’t nearly to the same effect, largely choosing to test the player on timing, as opposed to gimmickry, but when it does provide a unique angle, <em>Lumines </em>Arise runs with it. The “Egg” challenge in particular is both humorous and invigorating to plow through.</p>



<p>With each level clear, you’re also subject to achieving points that can be used on the “Loomi-Pon”, a pseudo-gacha machine which can generate unlockables for your Loomii. These range from cosmetic heads and decorations for their body to different adjectives and titles for your profile. There’s a LOT to unlock, in what is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s biggest problem, which is with general UX.</p>

<p>For something so welcoming and desperate, it’s surprising to see the GUI of <em>Lumines Arise</em> be an absolute nightmare to navigate. Trying to customize your Loomii with new items is an excruciating effort of trying to find the one item that doesn’t have a tiny lock symbol next to it, and the titles? Forget about it, sifting through hundreds of words on each side? Just grating to get through.</p>

<p>Still, this is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s only true blemish, as the rest is a beautiful cacophony of particle effects of genuine awe-struck talent. Similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/once-upon-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri" rel="nofollow"><em>Katamari</em></a>’s blissful exercises of saccharine joy, Mizuguchi’s baby has grown into something that looks back on its history, the way it communicated to players, and now we have a statement of pure intent. That statement? Enjoy yourself.</p>

<h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Despite a heinous UX, <em>Lumines Arise</em> genuinely finds itself leaps and bounds above Enhance’s previous titles, in what should become a mainstay title. The gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is the pinnacle of the phrase “easy to learn, hard to master”, and nowhere is it better showcased than here. A beautiful sprawling entity of brilliant music, fantastic visual design, and worthwhile vibes.</p>

            <p>New browser game <a href="https://cxmi.itch.io/too-high">Too High</a> is about trying to form credible, humanlike sentences while absolutely whazzed on happy eggs at a party, but I think it also performs pretty well as a send-up of social anxiety at large.</p>
<p>Created by Christine Mi for the “Worst Nightmare” week of Itch gamejam <a href="https://itch.io/jam/prototype-studio-2025-week-9">Prototype Studio 2025</a>, it sees you ushering the words of a greeting together with your mouse, only for them to be knocked out of formation by other, rising and falling phrases such as “am I going to die” and “what did they just say”.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You’ve got to herd those kittenish letters into coherence before your “Awkwardness” bar fills up. I was too frightened to learn what happens when your “Awkwardness” bar fills up, so I’ve got the game paused at about 90%, having successfully completed the utterance “I’m Christine super”. I’ve certainly said worse things at parties. Oh no, now I’m remembering things I have said at parties. Get ye behind me, New Year 2015.</p>
<p>I can well imagine an audio-based version of this game, with players fumbling towards the echo of a "hello" or a "hey", against a screenful of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iABq4JdaRIs">context-free Bocchi the Rock scenes</a>. Please don’t make that game, Christine. You have done enough. Perhaps even less pleasantly, I'd love somebody to mod this into a first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that simulates either woozy incapacity or just the mortal fear of being asked your name and job title. Socially anxious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, now there's a concept.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-ledge-grab-exploit-is-bad-actually.1350025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back in the day when I used to main <i>Call of Duty</i>’s extraction mode, DMZ, any time my plans to play sniper boss on a tall tower went awry and I had to skedaddle, I’d just leap off of a building and, without much thought or concern, hit the ground and run and hide somewhere. It was cheap. But also, there was an infinite parachute on my back. It was a part of the game. Am I supposed to not use it?</p>

 <p>Well, as we’ve now seen for a little bit, you can kinda sorta do the same thing in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But instead of an infinite parachute, you can exploit how the game handles characters grabbing onto ledges to fall from incredible heights with basically no harm to your character. It’s not right. I don’t agree with it. You should stop doing it. Camp the extraction point? Fine. But if I see you do this ledge thing from somewhere ridiculous like the skyscraper-sized launch tower in Spaceport, I don’t care if you’re fighting a Leaper or are running from a Rocketeer. I’m hopping on the mic to have a conversation with you about unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Sickest, Silliest, And Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>I first caught sight of this little exploit back when I wrote up a montage of all the hijinks that <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">unfolded during <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend</a>. I’d hoped that, amusing as it was to watch, it would be a little too tricky to pull off reliably. Well, no. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-players-crack-its-movement-tech-wide-open-by-mastering-the-ledge-grab/">Morgan Park over at <i>PC Gamer</i></a> has documented, folks have figured out how to do this reliably. But unlike my colleague, I don’t find it amusing.</p>

   <p>It essentially works like this: Fall from a great height but be sure there’s a ledge to grab waiting far below. Hold down the jump key or button while you’re falling and you’ll grab the ledge, your character’s arm sockets apparently absorbing the impact of falling from terminal velocity to cancel out all of the fall damage you right earned.</p>

 <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Embark Studios for comment on this “movement tech.”</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong. I do enjoy a good movement exploit when it feels like it requires a bit of mastery to pull off. “<a href="https://youtu.be/5QYRCVS7ix4">Curb sliding” in <i>Halo Infinite</i></a> (RIP) was one such thing. After sprinting, you could slide off a ledge to get a boost in speed. It was tricky to do, especially amidst the chaos of a good <i>Halo </i>match.</p>

 <p>But I don’t see that kind of skill in this ledge grab trick in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Being able to bail from a high vantage point without consequence feels a little too easy, and antithetical to the fairly grounded approach to combat <i>Arc Raiders</i> seems to be going for.</p> <p>Ledges and climbing are quite important in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, so much so that the game sometimes reminds me a little bit of <i>Uncharted</i>. As some folks have commented in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1kmrtjt/i_hope_this_doesnt_get_patched/">a Reddit post documenting the ledge-grab exploit</a>, grabbing onto a ledge from a great height is fine, but it shouldn’t cancel out fall damage. Especially when you’re jumping off something as tall as a skyscraper. Such silliness.</p>

              <p>Since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">players have been pretty miffed</a> to discover that the physical versions of many games don’t actually contain the game at all. Instead they’re so-called “game-key cards,” essentially a phony game cart that only contains an instruction to download the game from Nintendo’s servers. Until now, it’s something that’s only affected third-party titles, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-elden-ring-digital-downloads-1851774694">albeit some very big-name games</a>. But now—with March 5, 2026’s <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>—the phenomenon will seemingly affect a Nintendo-published game for the first time.</p>

 <p>While this isn’t fully confirmed, it’s all but certain after Nintendo simultaneously announced a March 5 release date for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331">recently revealed <em>Animal Crossing-</em>like <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></a>, and a video explaining how game-key cards work that used&nbsp;<em>Pokopia</em> as an example.</p>

  <p>Game-key cards have caused a huge amount of consternation among those who want to be able to simply buy and own a game, knowing it will be theirs and available to play forever. While Xbox and PlayStation consoles have long been plagued by shipping with discs containing just a fraction of a game’s code, or none at all, it’s not something that afflicted Nintendo consoles until the Switch 2. On every previous Nintendo device, if you bought a physical game for it, you can still install and play it today, going right back to the Game Boy. But no longer. And it’s seemingly happening for incredibly stupid reasons.</p>

 <p>For reasons no one but Nintendo seems to know, <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-cartridges-new-size-capacity/">the Switch 2 only offers 64GB carts to publishers</a> for their games to ship on, with the price (according to&nbsp;<em>Digital Foundry</em>) set at $23 a piece. That’s far bigger than most people need, and obliterates profits, so with Nintendo offering no other options, publishers are naturally picking the only other option, the fake carts. (In other cases, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413">like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, it’s about transfer speeds from the cart to the system without installing on the Switch 2’s SSD.)</p>

 <p>It’s absolutely fascinating that it’s only now that Nintendo intends to use a game-key card for the first time that the company has felt the need to explain them to its audience. In the jaunty video, it explains how it’s selling you an empty box as if it’s doing you a favor, using <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em><em>&nbsp;</em>as its example throughout. The game, which is “only” 10GB, would therefore also make using the 64GB carts extremely expensive, even for Nintendo, a fact which is likely driving this decision. But, you ask, why not just make cheaper 16GB and 32GB carts, too? Well, yes, great question.</p>

 <p>So why buy the boxes at all, if all you’re doing is adding an extra series of steps and a huge amount of wasteful plastic and shipping to what amounts to just downloading a game anyway? Well, the one advantage that remains is that you can—for now—use the same game-key card in a different Nintendo Switch 2, and thus share your game with your friends without having to go through that god-awful time-limited digital sharing feature that was added to the console. You can even (audible gasp) sell them when you’re done.</p> <p>However, it remains a massive disappointment that now even Nintendo is using this preservation-destroying option for its first-party titles. The day the servers are switched off, which we know will be far too soon, none of these carts will do a single thing and the game you bought will be lost forever.</p>

              <p>Is Jesus now canon in <em>Game of Thrones</em>? Will we get a surprise <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> announcement at this week’s PlayStation State of Play? And why are video game genre names usually terrible? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I purchased <em>Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</em> last night and have been having the time of my life. I also re-watched <em>Episode 2: Attack of the Clones</em> and was much less impressed. It remains the worst <em>Star Wars</em> movie by far.</p> <p>Outline</p> <h2>A Lannister always pays his AI</h2> <p>“So just to let y’all know the new [<em>A Feast For Crows</em>] illustrated edition is like almost definitely ai lol and id argue has taken pretty hard ’inspiration’ from existing fanart,” X user <span>novembernatten <a href="https://x.com/novembernatten/status/1986109371177181669">wrote</a> in a post that blew up last week (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/game-of-thrones-ai-art-controversy-a-feast-for-crows-artist-responds-denies/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). They weren’t the only one throwing around accusations of generative AI, and now the publisher has stepped in to tell fans they’re wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ht" dir="ltr">lol. lmao, even <a href="https://t.co/YYwEO911nb">pic.twitter.com/YYwEO911nb</a></p> <p>— 2åse (@novembernatten) <a href="https://twitter.com/novembernatten/status/1986109385383330281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Recently there have been accusations floating around that the Penguin Random House’s illustrated edition of <em>A Feast For Crows</em> was produced using AI generative art,” Raya Golden, responsible for<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> book materials, <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2025/11/10/ffc-art-accusations/">wrote</a> on George R.R. Martin’s blog yesterday. “To our knowledge and as presented by the artist who completed the work in question there was NO such programing used. While he is a digital multimedia artist and relies on digital programing to complete his work, he has expressed unequivocally that no AI was used, and we believe him.”</p>

 <p>Fans remain unconvinced, however. <a href="https://x.com/Mayham_H/status/1988054172613120286">They point to</a> an apparent crucifix that blurrily appears in the background of one of the scenes. “Uh. Then why are they all in blue?” <a href="https://x.com/andrewhunt_/status/1988046433899999721">wrote</a> one. “Why is there a cross on a wall? Why is Tywin obviously an AI recreation of Viserys? Why is there no heraldry? It genuinely could not be more obvious and no amount of lying is gonna work.” Is this a case of AI slop or just bad art?</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> finally getting ported?</h2> <p>That’s the wishcasting from some fans after discovering a <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> voice actor will be <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1988112940428587350">MC-ing the PlayStation Japan State of Play</a> this week. It might just be cope, but a trilogy ported to PlayStation 5 (and Switch 2) would be pretty awesome. It’s the only major <em>Final Fantasy</em> arc that’s not playable on Sony’s current hardware.</p>

 <h2>Former <em>Marathon</em> dev thinks “extraction” is a bad genre name</h2> <p>Ex-Bungie production manager Chris Sides told the Shooter Monthly podcast it’s “dumb. “I hate the genre name of extraction shooter,” he said (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/marathon/extraction-shooter"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “When I was working on <em>Marathon</em>, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, ‘Can we please create a different genre name?’ because extraction shooter is so dumb. It’s the only genre where its name is a mechanic.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “I cannot stand the name of it. So I think that when you say the extraction genre, it should hit your spot. I think it’s really the fact that the genre doesn’t even know what it is. You, as a player, how do you know what you’re going to get? And I think that’s one of the real issues with the genre itself.”</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s nasty drone glitch has finally been fixed</h2> <p>Players will no longer be able to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355">take to the skies and rain down death</a>. “Fixed an exploit allowing players to ascend and access unintended areas when standing on a XFGM-6D Recon Drone by hitting it with the Sledgehammer,” EA’s developers confirmed in the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/article/1987957508426608743">latest patch notes</a>.</p> <h2>Switch 2 gets some nifty new features</h2> <p>A <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473/~/system-update-information-for-nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2">new firmware update</a> made small but notable tweaks to the new console. Those include updated game card icons to make it clear when an installation is from a physical or digital purchase, the ability to cancel multiple game downloads at once, and an option to keep the system from going into rest mode while GameChat is active. Most importantly, perhaps, there’s now an “Improved the screen display when using Adjust Screen Size to make it easier to adjust.” Hopefully, that makes it easier to fix the system’s poor HDR implementation.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">We’ll probably get <em>Fallout 3</em> remastered before <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/goodnight-universe-review-before-your-eyes-webcam-baby-2000642517">The developers behind a radically innovative 2021 indie game are back with something more mixed</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/trap-plan-marketing-astroturf-warrobots-fake-reddit-accounts-posts-2000642503">A game company gloats about an astroturfed marketing campaign on Reddit</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox helped increase engagement as well as sales for the PS5 and PC versions. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios released Helldivers 2 for Xbox in August 2025, and that decision helped revitalise the game for a new platform of players. <span>It was also revealed earlier this year that Helldivers 2 sold more on Xbox than PlayStation&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-sold-more-on-xbox-than-playstation-in-the-first-six-days/" target="_blank">in its first six days,&nbsp;</a>and now, it seems that the Xbox port has also helped bolster&nbsp;</span>sales on other platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-provide-a-significant-increase-in-sales-for-ps5-and-pc">Helldivers 2 Xbox Port Helped Provide a “Significant Increase in Sales” for PS5 and PC</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/destiny-2-hasnt-reached-sonys-expectations-for-bungie-acquisition-says-cfo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This Week in Video Games</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-boosted-ps5-pc-player-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), Sony Group CFO Lin Tao spoke about Helldivers 2’s Xbox port contributing towards PS5 and PC sales during a Q&amp;A portion of the company’s earnings call. Tao first talked about how their live service titles “overall accounted for more than 40% of our first-party software revenue.” Even though performance is different for each title, they observed that live service games are “a recurring source of revenue” similar to the previous quarter. </p>



<p>Tao then spoke about Helldivers 2, stating that it was also released for Xbox in 2025 and “is doing extremely well.” The group CFO added that the Xbox port has not only helped bring in new players on Xbox but also increased engagement from existing users on PS5 and PC. This move has “resulted in a significant increase in sales of the title year on year.” Tao concluded, stating, “Building on this recent progress, we aim to strengthen our studio, business, and expand our IP franchises through continuous learning and improvement.” </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> was meant to act as a celebration of Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic role-playing game on its tenth birthday. But it turns out that things haven’t exactly gone to plan as the update was met with a backlash on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The $59.99 Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition includes the six official Fallout 4 expansions and over 150 Creation Club items (paid mods). But there’s also a Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition upgrade Bethesda is selling to existing owners of the base game, priced $39.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bethesda points out that this upgrade offers a discount on all the items sold separately, fans have hit out at the pricing for the Anniversary Edition, especially in the context of Fallout 4 itself being a decade old and what the Anniversary Edition actually gets you. It’s worth noting that the Fallout 4 base game is currently $19.99 on Steam (it launched at $59.99), and the Fallout 4 Game of the Year Edition, which includes the base game and all the six official expansions, costs $39.99.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout 4 - Creations Bundle, which includes the 150 paid mods released as part of the Anniversary Edition, costs $19.99 on its own. And it’s the Steam store page for this bundle that has born the brunt of the backlash, with a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Complaints there report crashing issues, glitches, and even a problem with getting the new mods to work. Meanwhile, it sounds like the Anniversary Edition is breaking prior mods, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-issues-fallout-4-mod-warning-ahead-of-anniversary-edition-release-patch-will-make-gameplay-and-performance-improvements-as-well-as-add-new-creations-menu">Bethesda warned this would happen when it came to mods that affect the new Creation Club menu</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Be a gamer in 2025,” reads the most helpful review, according to Steam. “You purchase the content. You don't get the content in game. Bethesda's update causes even more crashes. Trying to quit the game causes it to crash. GG.”</p><div id="fallout-4-perks-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3><h3>Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is bugging out like crazy and not giving out all of the creations that are mentioned in the bundle,” another review reports. “Game absolutely refuses to let you attempt to install anything involving the Creation Club and freezes upon launching and quitting the game to the point where you can’t even use task manager or Steam to force close. For the love of god Bethesda, this is worse than Skyrim's anniversary launch. Fix your game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reaction on the Fallout subreddit features a similar sentiment, and yes, the memes have begun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The backlash has also spilled over into Steam reviews for the Fallout 4 base game, where negative reviews have flooded in following the Anniversary Edition’s release, causing recent reviews to plummet to ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They just killed the game with this Anniversary update,” reads one negative review on the Fallout 4 base game. “Not going to sort my 400+ mods as it would take days. Goodbye Fallout, I would like to say I will miss you but I won't.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a disappointing start for Fallout’s big push ahead of the hotly anticipated December launch of Fallout Season 2 on Prime Video. A new Fallout: New Vegas bundle is also due out, with a Fallout TV show-themed update to Fallout 76 also coming in December. Hopefully Bethesda can sort these issues out sooner rather than later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fallout 4 - Creations Menu Update November 10 patch notes:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Creations Menu</strong>: A new in-game Creations menu has been added, making it easier than ever to discover, download and enjoy content from professional developers and passionate enthusiasts alike.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay &amp; Performance</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>VATS Accuracy:</strong> VATS hit chances are now consistent across platforms and no longer drop to 0% or show incorrect values.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/reanimal/" data-ref-id="5000-640431">Reanimal </a>is an upcoming horror-adventure game developed by Tarsier Studios, the same team behind Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares II. It puts you in control of two children trying to survive and uncover the mysteries of a hostile island that was once their home. With its unsettling visuals and cooperative gameplay, Reanimal will hopefully build on Tarsier’s reputation for creating intimate and atmospheric horror.</p><p dir="ltr">Reanimal blends puzzle-solving, stealth, and exploration in a world filled with eerie creatures and twisted environments. You play as a brother and sister duo navigating the ruins of a corrupted island, solving environmental puzzles and hiding from monsters that seem to be shaped by their past trauma. The focus isn’t on combat, but survival--the connection between the two siblings is at the heart of the experience.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Reanimal_be_released__"><span>When will Reanimal be released?</span></h2><p>As of now, no exact release date has been announced. The game is listed on Steam as “coming soon.” The development team has said it wants to emphasize quality and won't rush to a release date. However, a demo recently appeared during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/reanimal-is-the-evolution-of-little-nightmares-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6535470/">Steam Next Fest</a>, which shows the game to be in a state close to fit for release, so we wouldn’t be surprised if it appears within the next few months. Be sure to check out our list of the top <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/">survival horror games</a> to play in the meantime.</p><h2 id="Reanimal_Trailers">Reanimal Trailers</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUymvhAXOnM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mUymvhAXOnM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">So far, Reanimal has received three trailers that each highlight different aspects of the game. The first announcement trailer introduced the sibling protagonists and set the tone with eerie island visuals and shadowy figures. A later gameplay trailer expanded on that foundation by showing puzzle solving, stealth, and cooperative movement between the two characters, giving players a better idea of how exploration and tension will unfold.</p><p dir="ltr">The most recent trailer focused on the story’s emotional weight, teasing new environments and darker creature designs while hinting at the personal history tying the siblings to the island.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Reanimal_Platforms">Reanimal Platforms</h2><p>Reanimal is set to launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Nintendo Switch 2. The release date hasn’t been confirmed yet, but the Steam page lists it as “coming soon.”</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Reanimal_Story__Setting_and_Characters">Reanimal Story, Setting and Characters</h2><p dir="ltr">In Reanimal you play as two child characters--a brother and sister who head back to an island from their past only to find it corrupted, hostile, and transformed. The setting fuses childhood nostalgia with horror--abandoned amusement parks, homes frozen in time, and creatures that reflect past trauma. The game uses the siblings’ relationship as the emotional core, making exploration and survival something personal rather than purely mechanical.</p><p dir="ltr">Reanimal aims to make horror more human. Where most horror games focus on powerlessness, this one highlights vulnerability and connection--how two people face fear together. The game’s co-op mechanics, psychological tone, and handcrafted environments set it apart from more action-heavy titles, offering something closer to a playable dark fairy tale.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Reanimal_Gameplay">Reanimal Gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">Players can explore the world solo with an AI companion or in two-player co-op, either online or locally. The camera shifts between dynamic and fixed angles to build tension, much like classic survival-horror games. Tarsier’s signature use of scale and lighting returns here, making even quiet moments feel unsettling. Every corner of the island hides a piece of the story, from broken toys to forgotten homes, encouraging exploration and reflection rather than speed.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat is minimal. Your tools are stealth and evasion rather than firearms or brute force. The world design emphasizes hiding, running and reading the environment for clues. Environmental puzzles, exploration of hidden paths, and uncovering story fragments are key components. The game promises a tighter runtime and focused structure rather than an open-ended map.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Reanimal_Development_News">Reanimal Development News</h2><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/reanimal-is-the-evolution-of-little-nightmares-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6535470/">Reanimal demo</a> was available during the Steam Next Fest in October of 2025. The demo showcases the grimy world Tarsier Studios has created. It's a major change of pace from both Little Nightmare games the team had created ahead of this project. One of the biggest elements that has enticed us so far is how it feels to explore the world of Reanimal.</p><p dir="ltr">"Little Nightmares 3--and even Little Nightmares 2--got away from the first game's especially morbid, skin-crawling monsters, or Residents, as they're called," GameSpot's Mark Delaney <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/reanimal-is-the-evolution-of-little-nightmares-youve-been-waiting-for/1100-6535470/">wrote</a>. "The Reanimal demo feels like a return to form for Tarsier [...] Reanimal's slithering skin suits, inky black waters, ever-present unease, and air of mystery combine to give me the sense that this is the game that will get us there."</p><p dir="ltr">The Reanimal demo also featured some evolution in how Tarsier approached using camera angles. Little Nightmares, as a series, has mostly utilized a static, side-scrolling angle that sometimes shifted for tense moments.</p><p dir="ltr">"Reanimal's demo showed off a lot more dynamism in its perspective. Sometimes the camera pulled far away; other times it was practically a third-person over-the-shoulder experience," Delany continued. "By shifting the dynamics, Tarsier is able to experiment more with puzzle design and exploration, which may help eventually separate it from the Little Nightmares comparisons."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/mixtape-is-a-sharp-looking-coming-of-age-story-with-music-from-devo">Mixtape</a>, the coming-of-age adventure by the creators of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-artful-escape/the-artful-escape-review-a-rocking-space-oddity">The Artful Escape</a>, has been delayed to 2026. First revealed during the 2024 Xbox Showcase, the game was slated to launch sometime this year.</p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mixtapegame.bsky.social/post/3m5cpiizcqc2h">social media post</a>, developer Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur states that Mixtape is “almost complete” and implies it's largely just applying finishing touches. The studio didn’t narrow the release window beyond the year, however, so we’ll have to stay tuned to see if the game arrives sooner than later.</p><p>Here is Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur’s full statement:</p><p>While developing Artful Escape, our 3D artist Mikey, made an oven asset. It was a nice oven - the work of a true pro. He even put the knobs on. And that’s who we are at Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur. We put the knobs on. Mixtape is almost complete, we’re just putting the knobs on. See you in 2026.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mixtape is published by Annapurna Interactive and takes place in the 1990s, centering on teenager Stacy Rockford, who dreams of becoming a music supervisor in Hollywood. She has a passion for creating mixtapes, and the story follows her and her teenage friends as they embark on a final adventure together. The game primarily consists of playable vignettes as the teens recall cherished memories, which often unfold as exaggerated takes on these events, accompanied by fourth-wall-breaking narration. The game’s presentation features a stop-motion-inspired animation reminiscent of the Spider-Verse films, and the soundtrack boasts tracks from artists including Guns &amp; Roses, DEVO, The Smashing Pumpkins, Roxy Music, Iggy Pop, Joy Division, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>We played Mixtape during Summer Game Fest this year, and it became one of our favorite demos at the show. You can read our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/13/one-of-sgfs-greatest-hits">full preview here</a>.

            <p>Nintendo and Lego have teased a new set based on The Legend of Zelda, which looks to be based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>A teaser video shared by both companies shows a Lego minifigure of Link in his iconic garb, with a floating Navi the fairy. He's overshadowed by a horned figure (Ganon), while a Lego Zelda is out of focus in the background behind flames.</p>
<p>"Do you realise who you're dealing with?" the post reads, with the set due some time next year.</p>

<p>Details of the set remain unknown, but considering the video clearly depicts the final battle between Link and Ganon from Ocarina of Time, it's very likely the set will be based on this scene and include these figures.</p>
<p>As previously shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1nkt8cc/zelda_77093_the_2026_zelda_set_is_said_to_be_an/">reddit</a> by BrickTap, the set is rumoured to be an Ocarina of Time Ganondorf diorama made of 1003 pieces that will release on 1st March 2026.</p>

<p>The set would be the second based on The Legend of Zelda, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">last year's Great Deku Tree set</a> featuring both Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> designs.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Nintendo and Lego released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-taps-into-nostalgia-with-1980s-inspired-lego-game-boy-trailer">Lego Game Boy set</a>, launched with a trailer that recreated its famous 'Robot' commercial of 1989.</p>
<p>Next year, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-sets-could-be-among-the-most-expensive-ever">series of Pokémon sets will be released</a>, as revealed back in March, though they're looking pricey.</p>
<p>The forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-springs-back-to-life-next-year-with-switch-2-edition-major-free-content-update-and-lego-collaboration">Animal Crossing: New Horizons update will also include a Lego collaboration</a> with which to decorate your in-game home.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pokémon Pokopia, the cosy Pokémon life-sim, is set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 5th March 2026, Nintendo has announced.</p>
<p>Pokopia is a thoroughly odd feeling spin-off to the Pokémon franchise, as the shape-shifting Pokémon Ditto transforms into a human form – something which for a long time was said to be impossible, but is now a potentially horrifying reality with that blank line-art smile beaming back at you – and then sets about creating a little Pokémon paradise. They can do that, because Ditto will learn &nbsp;new abilities and moves from other Pokémon, perhaps spreading Bulbasaur’s vine whips to do a bit of gardening, and more.</p>


<p>It certainly looks like a Pokémon flavoured take on Animal Crossing, bringing other Pokémon to your corner of the world to hang out and engage with. Check out the original announcement trails from last month’s Nintendo Direct stream:</p>

<p>Pokémon Pokopia is now available for pre-order, with those that pre-order or buying the game shortly after release getting a Ditto rug to use for decorating their new home.</p>

			<p>Wccftech was recently invited out to join a select number of content creators and fellow journalists to get an early look at the upcoming <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us">Beta Test II</a> for Arknights: Endfield on PC. Throughout this seven-hour session, we were treated to a live performance by Starset, a band that has done a number of collaborations with Gryphline for Arknights trailers and will be debuting a new track for Arknights: Endfield sometime in the future. During the actual gameplay, we were permitted to play through the redesigned opening act and then free rein across a number of saves at different level tiers to get samples of the combat at various difficulties, as well as exploration of the new hub city of Wuling.</p>



<p>Gryphline started off the preview event with a brief rundown of the current state of Arknights: Endfield and what it’s taken to get to this point. During this presentation, we were introduced to Endfield through a live-translated fireside chat with Lead Designer Ryan (last name not given) and Producer Light Zhong. As they wanted to address the matters of “Whenfield”, the developers talked about how Endfield first began proper development in 2022 with a technical test in 2024, followed by the first beta test earlier this year. The development team at Hypergryph is currently recruiting for the second beta test, currently slated to open on November 28th.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The intent for Arknights: Endfield to differentiate itself from other gacha action RPGs out on the market is the factory building systems. Light Zhong talked briefly about how sandbox titles offer freedom for players to explore the world and make it more immersive, while the factory elements are something refreshing for the players, as most gacha games don’t dip their toes into these systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using the feedback from the first beta test earlier this year, Arknights: Endfield’s upcoming test was centered around three refining pillars: overall game progression, the stages and maps, and redesigning the cutscenes and cinematics. One example they provided was changing out an early quest involving gathering piles of trash to clean up a camp and instead replacing it with clearing the camp of raiders and miscreants by way of combat. Overall, they’re intending to make the map design feel “more self-contained” and guide players through with both storytelling and gameplay. Whether this means that they intend for the quest chains to guide the player along a guided path or provide points of interest off the beaten path is something that players will have to check out for themselves if they’re selected to take part in the second beta test. Hypergryph estimates that the amount of content coming to Beta Test II is an average of 50-60 hours, with a majority of that time dedicated to new content.</p>



<p>The factory building is, of course, going to be one of the key features that will set Arknights: Endfield apart from other action RPG games on the mobile market. Regrettably, I was not able to dive in from the beginning and experience building up a camp from the ground up, so I was limited in what I could see for myself and instead only got a glimpse during their keynote presentation. One of the features I saw most requested for the factory building was an element to share base creations with other players, and this is indeed a feature that will be coming to Arknights: Endfield at launch. By allowing players to share blueprints of their factory creations, they intend to make the system more accessible and encourage experimentation as players begin to understand what is possible with Endfield’s factories. Players won’t have to befriend one another to get access to these blueprints, as there will be a code system to post on social media and share with others.</p>

<p>The opening act that aims to onboard players with tutorials is quite a bombastic opener, starting with choosing the gender of your player Endministrator and taking part in a raid against a raiding alien menace. While the opening act from the first beta test was far more introspective, examining artifacts and the relics left behind, the revised opener in Beta Test II is more in line with what players might expect from a Western action RPG. Enemies are slowly drip-fed to the player in combat encounters, leading to how to target and dodge attacks before culminating in a massive multi-stage fight against a behemoth titan that towers over the battlefield and uses its long reach to swipe and smack down the player Endministrator. Following this five-minute-long fight is a radical shift in thematics compared to the original story, instead focusing on a cycle of death and rebirth for the Endministrator, who returns to duty in a hospital bed, suffering from a small amount of amnesiac trauma from the whole ordeal. From here, it returns to being closer to the original beta test, where players slowly venture out to rescue a hub base and set up a proper base of operations on Talos-II.</p>



<p>Arknights: Endfield’s combat has been greatly refined to be more in line with the popular character action games of recent years, obviously taking some notes from PlatinumGames’ Babylon’s Fall and Astral Chain. Each battle sees not just the Endministrator taking the field but also all three of their party members, who operate independently in terms of basic attacks. The player character has one main attack button where players can either tap the button or hold it down for a combo string and use dashes and dodges to evade oncoming attacks, often indicated by the enemy attacker's glowing red moments before their attack would connect with the player character. For some enemy types, the red aura can be difficult to figure out at a glance, especially on the fiery lava rock type humanoids.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In its current form, party members don’t use any actual resources for their special attacks, meaning they don't need to manage MP, TP, or any other type of resource for these attacks. Instead, everything the player can do is time-based and recharges over a period of time. For those players who want to mash buttons and blast through battles as quickly as possible, sure it’s possible to fire off all four special attacks and abilities back to back but often, it’s better to utilize these abilities in a particular order as players learn to synergize the different roles in their party and take advantage of both player buffs and enemy debuffs to maximize their damage far above the couple of thousand damage they might be able to pull off otherwise. One comment I had for the Hypergryph developers during my preview session was a desire to have two different attack buttons for light and heavy attacks to help the combat feel more dynamic; going onto Beta Test II, the combat can begin to feel somewhat one note despite the polished dodging and speed of combat as I simply held down one button for basic attacks for much of the fight while waiting for my abilities to charge up. There’s certainly the framework of what could be the single best action combat system for a gacha game on the market, but Arknights: Endfield needs to bring in more than just a good defensive system to truly shine.</p>



<p>Exploring around Wuling City showed off one of my favorite parts of open-world games: environment puzzles leading to tangible rewards. Scattered throughout the city are dozens of collectibles and hidden treasure chests, rewarding exploration with bonuses to the regional development level for that area, as well as working towards an overall account level, which in turn leads to important boons like being able to increase the level cap of units. What kept me from really getting into the sense of exploration was the jumping mechanics and platforming. I would constantly want to double jump or try to climb up to a higher level by jumping onto rails and boxes, only to fall off. Instead, it’s more about a deliberate path through side paths to get up to some of these elevated rewards. Adding in a double jump might trivialize some of these exploration moments, so I’m curious to see what Hypergryph does to refine map traversal in the coming months.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even as someone who only knows the surface-level lore and gameplay of the original Arknights, having played early on in its Western launch and only having to rely on anecdotes from players who have been enduring through TN-4 earlier this year, I was able to get a proper grasp on the overall universe and themes that make Arknights what it is. Being an entirely new genre and set in the far future from the original game, Arknights: Endfield aims to be something that can draw brand new players in that might have otherwise overlooked the original tower defense game. The gacha action RPG genre has become competitive in recent years, but Endfield’s AAA presentation and emphasis on base building might do well to set it apart from the competition.</p>



<p>Following my hands-on with Arknights: Endfield’s Beta Test II, I was able to take part in an email interview with both Ryan and Light Zhong, who were able to respond and get answers back to us ahead of publishing. While both developers took part in the email Q&amp;A, the responses aren’t attributed to a specific person. There was one more question that was asked to the developers about balancing power levels in Algorithmic Memories, as some gameplay videos showcased a massive damage spike for certain team compositions, but that answer wasn’t returned in time for publication.</p>



<p><strong>What led your team to make such significant changes to the combat system over the</strong> <strong>course of the different betas?</strong></p>



<p>We believe players naturally develop certain habits, and game design trends follow those patterns. When developing our games, we’re always thinking about how to adapt to modern playstyles without compromising on the core fun of the experience. The changes to combat skills came from this idea—we wanted battles to feel smoother and more dynamic, matching the pace players expect. It greatly enhances the sense of impact in combat. As for strategy, that aspect hasn’t been diminished, in part due to the addition of the Combo Skill system. Battles are now more fun and have an extra strategic layer. Players must think carefully about team composition and skill timing if they want to unlock their characters’ full potential.</p>



<p><strong>Arknights is very well known and loved for its approach to unit design and distribution,</strong> <strong>with older units remaining useful over the life of the game. Is that something you’re</strong> <strong>looking to replicate in Endfield?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. In Endfield, the design philosophy ensures that early characters continue to play important gameplay roles even as new units are introduced. While six-star characters can be powerful, optimal team compositions often rely on a mix of units, including four/five-star or earlier characters, due to their unique abilities and synergy in combos. This approach keeps older characters valuable and relevant throughout the game’s lifecycle, maintaining strategic depth and rewarding long-term player investment.</p>



<p><strong>How integral will the factory be to resource generation in Arknights: Endfield? The</strong> <strong>efficiency of resource generation is something that veteran gacha players tend to</strong> <strong>theorycraft and come up with builds as quickly as possible to maximize what’s earned</strong> <strong>per day.</strong></p>



<p>The Factory System will allow players to greatly empower their characters with equipment and improve the rate of regional development. Even if players do not focus on the factory gameplay or production efficiency, they’ll still have a chance to create quality equipment for their characters; they’ll just have to wait longer for the region to develop. However, this does not make the game significantly more difficult.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, we hope to share the fun of automation and make factory-building gameplay accessible to more players.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any plans for considering a blueprint system to make and share base designs?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we have introduced the blueprint system for Beta Test II to help make AIC Factory planning and construction easier. This will allow players to use various blueprints to quickly set up a production line and expedite development across various regions of Talos-II.</p>



<p><strong>What are the current plans for an Endgame in Arknights Endfield? Will this be available</strong> <strong>at launch? If not, do you have a timetable in mind?</strong></p>



<p>Currently, the game is still in the testing phase, and more information will be shared in the future, so please stay tuned!</p>



<p><strong>Will accounts be shared across different platforms for Arknights: Endfield? Can players</strong> <strong>group together for co-op across different platforms?</strong></p>



<p>The test will be available on PC, iOS, and Android. Endministrators will receive access for their chosen platform, and your progress will sync seamlessly between PC and mobile.</p>



<p><strong>Are there swimsuits on Talos II?</strong></p>



<p>More information will be introduced in the future, so please stay tuned.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any elements to the store or gameplay that will require premium currency that</strong> <strong>isn’t earned through regular gameplay?</strong></p>



<p>We aim to give active players more free opportunities to get high-star characters and weapons.</p>



<p>In the end, whether players choose to spend or not, they’ll still be able to experience the main content of the game—we’re not putting major content behind paywalls. We also greatly reduced character progression costs so players can devote more of their time to the core story content and gameplay.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-island-creators-can-now-test-selling-items-within-their-islands-including-loot-box-style-%E2%80%9Crandom-rewards%E2%80%9D.1349965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/">Insider-Gaming</a> pointed to a leak claiming that Epic Games would let Fortnite Island creators add gambling mechanics to their islands, Epic published <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers">a blog post</a> announcing that Fortnite Island creators start testing in-island transactions, with creators capable of selling permanent items, consumables, and loot-box-style "<em>paid random items (items that provide a chance to receive a random reward)</em>."</p>



<p>The ability to sell items within a Fortnite Island is currently in a preview phase within UEFN, and at the time of this writing, it can only be tested in unpublished projects. The ability to add them to published projects is coming later, though Epic did not clarify when that would be.</p>



<p>It's the latest evolution of Fortnite <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-will-let-fortnite-developers-sell-in-game-items-december/">inching closer to Roblox in terms of how it handles user-generated content</a>. When the feature is live and available to be included in published projects, players will be able to purchase items for islands using V-Bucks. Ahead of that, Epic has updated its developer rules and included new documentation to address how it will handle in-island transactions.</p>



<p>Here's a list of what creators can sell within their islands:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Durable items (items players can buy once that don’t expire over time, persistent across sessions within an island experience)</em></li>



<li><em>Consumable items (items that deplete when used in-game, may be persistent across sessions)</em></li>



<li><em>Items with gameplay elements, including those that share a visual overlap with approved Fortnite cosmetics categories (e.g. “Boots of Speed”, “Jetpack”)</em></li>



<li><em>Bundles or collections of durable, consumable and gameplay items</em></li>



<li><em>Paid random items (items that provide a chance to receive a random reward)</em>
<ul>
<li><em>New parental control will let parents decide if their child can acquire paid random items in regions where these are available to players.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Custom passes, progression systems, and paid areas</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The fifth bullet point, the one regarding "<em>random rewards</em>," is arguably the most concerning one, because it's essentially a loot box that creators can begin selling to players, but it is at least good to see that it's not an item that players will be able to purchase by default, at least for players who have their accounts under parental controls. </p>



<p>It's also worth noting that cosmetic items, items that contain visual overlap with other Fortnite cosmetics, items that try to undercut Epic's pricing for items it makes, physical products, experience points, and anything that takes the transaction off-platform with an external checkout process are all things that cannot be sold and are disallowed under the new terms for in-island transactions.</p>



<p>Even with those kinds of transactions disallowed, the concept of in-island transactions could have a major impact on Fortnite Islands and the culture surrounding them within the Fortnite community. It'll be interesting to see how the game is changed once the feature is fully implemented, and for now, it's arguably good to see Epic Games taking what appears to be a measured approach to the feature, even if it is adding loot boxes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo and Lego are teasing another <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1792136643"><em>The Legend of Zelda</em></a> collaboration for 2026. There’s no price tag or description yet but we did get a neat little live-action tease recreating the end of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p> <p>The scene shows Link in his classic green tunic with the Master Sword and Hyrulian shield standing in the ruins of the castle with Princess Zelda in the background. Navi hovers nearby as a shadow creeps up and Ganon’s theme plays, suggesting the Lego set might be a depiction of the final battle from the classic Nintendo 64 game.</p>   <p>The other big question, aside from what the set will be, is how much it will cost. Lego has been aggressively burrowing <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658">into fan nostalgia</a> and bank accounts in recent years with licensed sets that cost as much as some video game consoles. The Great Deku Zelda Lego set <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-lego-legend-zelda-great-deku-tree-set-price-1851503670">arrived back</a> in 2024 for $300. At 2,500 pieces it was no small set, but it was also the same price as a Nintendo Switch (less now due to the latter going up in price earlier this year).</p> <p>It seems like Lego is at least sticking with the <em>Ocarina </em>era for the follow-up and bringing Ganon into the mix this time. They might as well keep going and give us Zora’s Domain, Death Mountain, Gerudo Valley, Hyrule Castle, and the rest of Kokiri Forest. Personally, I’d love a Lego recreation of Clock Town from <em>Majora’s Mask</em>. I’m sure both companies can get to that eventually. Nintendo has its <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-delay-date-nintendo-avengers-secret-wars-1851784080">live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie</a> coming in 2027.</p>

              <p>As the days get shorter and the weather gets colder, it’s going to be more and more difficult to stay motivated to keep in shape and stick to running throughout the winter. One thing that keeps me going is that I use my runs as my podcast time. Been working my way through the third campaign in&nbsp;<em>Not Another D&amp;D Podcast</em> and four days a week, I’m out running and listening. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/">My pair of OpenRun Pro headphones from Shokz are perfect for the job. Right now, they happen to be on sale over at Amazon for 31% off</a>. The brings them down from $180 to just $125. You end up saving yourself a solid $55.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Bone Conduction Listening</h2>
<p>These headphones are different from your standard earbuds in that they don’t go in your ear. They sit around your ears and deliver sound using bone conduction. By vibrating your skull, you get the perception of sound.&nbsp; Elder millennial like myself might remember this tech from those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ca4tfXefk">lollipops in the 90s</a> that could play hit music when you put them in your mouth. Though unlike those, these play music, audiobooks, or podcasts through your cheekbones, not your teeth.</p>
<p>The main advantage to designing headphones this way is it keeps your ears free to hear the various sounds in your environment, keeping you alert of your surroundings. This is crucial while running in case, say, a car is approaching. You’re going to want to hear traffic for safety reasons.</p>
<p>The Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones sit comfortably on your ears like a backwards pair of sunglasses. They feature a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame which helps keep your headphones firmly in place during high intensity workouts. I much prefer this to in-ear buds so I can eliminate any fear of one falling out while on a run.</p>



<p>Battery life is reliable. You can expect a full 10 hours of listening time on a single charge. The OpenRun Pro headphones can recharge fast, providing up to 1.5 hours of listening time after being plugged in for only five minutes.</p>
<p>Shokz also offers a mini model which has a shortened connecting band that stretches around the back for smaller heads. The standard model measures across at 20.7 cm while the mini is 21 mm (or 0.83 inches) shorter at 18.6 cm. Check the product page or the Shokz website for instructions on how to decide which model is best for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/">Thankfully, both the standard and mini version are seeing the same discount.</a> The standard comes in black, beige, or blue. While the mini has the same color options, the beige and blue appear to be out of stock at the moment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>LEGO has announced that a new Legend of Zelda set is coming in 2026, though details on what exactly it entails are scarce.</p>



<p>The partnership between LEGO and Nintendo has seen a host of epic sets released, including the Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set and a host of Super Mario sets, and the catalogue is being expanded upon next year.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-teases-new-legend-of-zelda-set">LEGO Teases New Legend of Zelda Set</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New set incoming. Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>A short video on the LEGO website shows a minifigure of Link, with Zelda blurred in the background, standing still as an ominous shadow approaches.</p>



<p>The video ends with a message for builders across the world, telling them to ‘Build the Legend’ and confirming a new set is coming in 2026. However, that’s all the details that are available for now.</p>



<p>LEGO and Nintendo are set for a big year in 2026, as it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed back in March</a> that Pokémon sets are coming next year—coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise.</p>



<p>Other Nintendo franchises that have received LEGO sets include Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and LEGO recreations of the iconic Nintendo Entertainment System and the original Game Boy.</p>

The patch notes for version 21.0.0 highlight better visual clarity on the home menu for whether a game is owned physically or digitally, GameChat improvements, and a battery description alteration.</p><p dir="ltr">Switch 2 and the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525" rel="nofollow ">original Switch</a> are receiving the new symbols that will "indicate whether the software is a physical or a digital version," according to<a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473/" rel="nofollow "> Nintendo</a>. The icons are now red like the cartridges for physical Switch 2 games, while they're black for physical Switch titles. However, in general, Switch 2 is seeing more changes with this update. For instance, GameChat should now ensure a game doesn't go to sleep while talking online with a friend. Plus, the system setting language for limiting a charge on the console now says, "Stop Charging Around 80-90%."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-switch-2-update-out-now-doesnt-do-much/1100-6535105/">Switch 2 system update since version 20.5.0 released in September</a>. That only brought about "stability improvements," something that's expected and joked about constantly in the video game community.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/">Switch 2 has sold 10 million hardware units</a> in just four months of availability. That timeframe doesn't include October, when a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle-buying-guide/1100-6533331/">Switch 2 bundle with Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> launched, so the total number is obviously higher at this point. Meanwhile, Switch has surpassed 154 million units sold, sitting just behind Nintendo DS. It's more than likely at this point that Switch has now become Nintendo's best-selling console ever. Overall, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-has-sold-6-billion-games-including-nearly-1-5-billion-on-switch-alone/1100-6536099/">sold over 870 million systems and 6 billion games</a> over the past 40 years.</p><p>Later this week, there will be <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427" rel="nofollow ">a Nintendo Direct</a> for the debut trailer of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Pillsbury has accidentally already given us a good look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whoops-pillsbury-just-gave-us-a-look-at-yoshi-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/1100-6536080/">what Yoshi will look like</a> in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Below are the patch notes for version 21.0.0:</p><h2>Switch 2</h2><ul><li>Added symbols above software icons displayed on the HOME Menu to

                <p>Sony has confirmed that Destiny 2 has fallen short of expectations, forcing the company to record an estimated $204 million impairment related to Bungie’s assets. During its Q2 FY2025 earnings call, Sony acknowledged that the popular shooter's player engagement and revenue have been weaker than anticipated since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-acquired-by-sony-for-3-6-billion/1100-6500122/" data-ref-id="1100-6500122">the 2022 acquisition of Bungie for $3.6 billion</a>.</p><p>"Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement has not reached the expectation we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie," CFO Lin Tao explained (translated via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-destiny-2-sales-user-engagement-not-reached-bungie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>).</p><p>Tao noted that Sony has "downwardly revised the business projection for the time being and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie." The ¥31.5 billion (approximately $204 million) impairment, combined with an additional ¥18.3 billion (about $118 million) expense tied to development cost corrections. Tao said these adjustments were necessary to reflect the game’s current performance, which has been affected by lower player activity and market competition.</p><p>When asked whether this impairment could be the start of further write-downs, Tao clarified that the goodwill from the Bungie acquisition remains secure.</p><p>"This is an impairment loss of [Bungie's] intangible assets," she said. "As for goodwill, that is supported by the whole game segment, so there will not be any impairment loss for goodwill. For this time, Destiny 2's game performance did not reach the expectations we had when we acquired Bungie." She added that future risks remain for both Destiny 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/">Bungie's upcoming shooter Marathon</a> if they fail to meet Sony's goals.</p><p>The financial setback comes as Destiny 2 faces some of its lowest engagement levels in years. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1085660/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam data</a> indicates that player counts are dropping below the lows of 2018's Curse of Osiris, while fans have expressed frustration over missing updates and recent gameplay changes. Bungie has pledged to improve communication and focus on both the "immediate and long-term future" of the game.</p><p>The studio is banking on its next major expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-expansion-is-star-wars-inspired-and-gives-you-a-lightsaber/1100-6531341/" data-ref-id="1100-6531341">Renegades, launching December 2, 2025</a>, to revive interest. Still, for now, Sony is adopting a more cautious outlook for the once-dominant shooter.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-revealed-ahead-of-thursdays-trailer.1349911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date has been leaked ahead of a new trailer that's set to arrive for the cozy&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>life sim on Thursday.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>news platform <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1988245459807113647" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Serebii</a>, what looks like a Japanese-language thumbnail for the upcoming trailer apparently reveals the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date to be March 5th next year.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the front <a href="https://www.serebii.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a> of Serebii's official website also confirms that the game's physical version will be a Game Key Card and will require 10GB of memory to install, so if you're planning on picking up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia</em>, make sure you've got at least that much space.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak-charmander.jpg?itok=H60ZkLFA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak-charmander.jpg?itok=fxLNqQB5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date may have been leaked.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Japanese release date for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>may not be the same as its Western launch date, but simultaneous worldwide releases have been the norm for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>for a while now, so it's likely the game will launch around the world on the same day.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>is, it's an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed&nbsp;life sim. Revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">September's Nintendo Direct</a>, the game casts you as "a Ditto transformed into a human". It's up to you to "shape an empty land into a beautiful home for Pokemon".</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>looks to resemble games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-free-update" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, and HoYoverse's upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/petit-planet-preview-hoyoverses-foray-into-life-sims" rel="nofollow"><em>Petit Planet</em></a>. It'll feature Pokemon like Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur, and you'll be able to use their abilities to shape the world around you.</p>

<p>The game will serve as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, so if you want to check it out, you'll have to make the leap to Nintendo's new machine. Hey, at least you'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">far from alone in doing so</a>!</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on March 5th next year, assuming this Serebii leak is correct, of course. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Embark Studios has announced that its post-apocalyptic extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>has passed a major sales milestone in less than two weeks.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000421.000014847.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is entirely in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>sales have shot past four million, and the game seemingly continues to grow in popularity, too, having reached a record 700,000 concurrent users across all platforms this week.</p>

<p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is still the <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/globaltopsellers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best-selling</a> piece of software on Steam at time of writing, too. The game is beating popular rivals like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" rel="nofollow">Telltale-style adventure&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" rel="nofollow">Dispatch</a>&nbsp;</em>and FPS&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</em>to the (second from) top spot, something about which Embark is no doubt thrilled.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arc-raiders-sales-4m-hiding.jpg?itok=m-kr2njn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arc-raiders-sales-4m-hiding.jpg?itok=_0K8qbnf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is really making a name for itself.</figcaption></figure><p>It's an impressive feat for a game that has had a somewhat lengthy and complex development history. Originally revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">back in 2021</a>, Embark's game was originally intended to be a co-op third-person shooter set for release in 2022, but it was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" rel="nofollow">delayed into 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Following that delay, Embark revealed that the game's scope had been changed, and that it would now be a PvPvE extraction shooter along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>or Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>.</p>

<p>The game was released on October 30th to a positive reception, although it garnered some criticism for its use of generative AI to create some voice lines (and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025" rel="nofollow">far from the only game</a> on Steam to use that technology).</p>

<p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>sees players descending into a post-apocalyptic landscape in order to do battle with both lethal ARC machines and roving squads of other players, gathering loot and attempting to survive until extraction.</p>




<p>If you're interested in giving&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>a go, you can pick it up right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/arc-raiders/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/arc-raiders/9ndf1f263rz4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (and it sounds like now really is the time to do so, judging by the size of the player base). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-q2-2025-26-destiny-2-bungie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sales-up-but-income-down-as-bungie-and-destiny-2-disappoint.1349902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financial statement for the second quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and it looks like Bungie and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>aren't doing the business the Japanese tech giant had hoped for on acquisition.</p>

<p>As revealed in Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonypre.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial presentation</a>, sales in the company's gaming sector increased by 4% when compared to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">previous quarter</a>, but operating income fell by 13% across the same period, and Sony puts this down largely to "impairment losses" relating to&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and Bungie.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Sony says that&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s "sales and user engagement" haven't reached "the expectations [Sony] had at the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-is-acquiring-destiny-2-developer-bungie" rel="nofollow">time of the acquisition of Bungie</a>". The publisher therefore "downwardly revised" its "business projection" as a result of this underperformance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-sony-financials-q2-2025.jpg?itok=kxbQ7xl6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-sony-financials-q2-2025.jpg?itok=XSw5znDZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>hasn't proven the golden goose Sony apparently hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony contrasts&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s disappointing performance with that of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which it says is performing "extremely well", with sales of the game "significantly increas[ing]" due both to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">release on Xbox Series X|S</a> and "increased engagement from existing users on PS5 and PC".</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, which was released in October, has apparently already surpassed the three-million sales mark as well, which makes it "a major hit like its predecessor", according to Sony.</p>

<p>Exactly why&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;Bungie have disappointed Sony isn't clear from this presentation, but the game's player numbers have <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1085660/charts/#6m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">plummeted</a> in recent months (although it is worth noting that the game hasn't received a major expansion since July).</p>

<p>This will almost certainly be making Sony anxious about&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, Bungie's next major project, which still doesn't have a release date after being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed indefinitely back in June</a>.</p>




<p>That decision was made following the revelation that some of the artwork in&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">had been stolen</a> from an online artist, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">firing of the game's director</a> last spring after he was hit with misconduct allegations.</p>

<p>Despite Sony's disappointment in Bungie and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, the company says that over 40% of its revenue this quarter came from live-service games, so this isn't likely to mark a return to single-player shooters on Bungie's part. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shokz-bone-conduction-headphones-going-for-pennies-as-amazon-dumps-stock-before-black-friday.1349896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon just cut the price on what runners everywhere call their favorite workout companion: The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/"> Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction headphones have dropped to $124, down from their usual $179 price tag</a>. These aren’t your standard issue earbuds that block out the world around you: they use bone conduction technology to deliver audio through your cheekbones while keeping your ears completely open. It’s a design that makes them a go-to for runners who need to stay aware of traffic, fellow joggers, and their surroundings without sacrificing their workout playlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Why Choose Bone Conduction Over Traditional Earbuds</h2>
<p>The OpenRun Pro takes a fundamentally different tack with workout audio: traditional earbuds create a seal in your ear canal which might be OK on the gym floor but becomes a serious safety hazard when you take your runs outdoors. These <strong>headphones perch on your cheekbones and transmit sound through bone conduction</strong> and leave your ear canals wide open. You hear your music, podcasts, or calls clearly while simultaneously hearing cars approaching, cyclists calling out, or someone trying to get your attention on the trail.</p>
<p>The 9th generation represents years of refinement in bone conduction technology: They’re the first Shokz headphones built to take advantage of <em>TurboPitch</em> technology, a design that confronts the main critique of bone conduction models of the past. The <strong>bass response feels full and rich rather</strong> than tinny or weak. You get clear vocals across your favorite tracks, powerful volume when you need to bear down during tough intervals, and surprisingly deep low-end frequencies that other bone conduction models struggled to deliver.</p>



<p>The physical design solves problems that plague conventional workout headphones: <strong>A wraparound titanium frame weighs almost nothing</strong> but provides serious durability. This lightweight, titanium construction flexes to fit different head sizes without creating pressure points. The frame keeps the headphones locked in position through sprints, burpees, or mountain climbs during intense training sessions</p>
<p>Battery performance matches the requirements of the most serious athletes: The <strong>ten hours of continuous playback</strong> will handle everything from marathon training runs to full days of back-to-back activities. You charge them once and don’t worry about battery anxiety for days of normal use. The Quick Charge feature proves super-practical when you forget to plug them in overnight. <strong>Just five minutes charging gives you 1.5 hours of battery life</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>sweat-resistant construction</strong> handles whatever your workout throws at it. These headphones resist humid summer runs, aggressive HIIT sessions, and rainy morning jogs without degradation in performance.</p>
<p>At $124, these headphones cost less than most premium traditional sports earbuds and offer better situational awareness.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-has-dropped-down-to-just-650-2000642541</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-clears-out-amd-ryzen-5-gaming-laptop-at-62-off-from-premium-to-practically-budget.1349893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With us rushing right through to the end of the year, we find ourselves only a couple short weeks before one of the biggest savings events of the year — Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This will be a great time to save on a new TV, some kitchenware, or perhaps a new laptop. Even though we’re not quite there yet, you can already find some pretty lucrative deals and discounts ahead of schedule. Take a look at this IdeaPad Slim 3 laptop from Lenovo. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/">Amazon has it listed at $1,700, but current 62% discount ends up taking over a thousand dollars off the top. You only have to pay $650 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>Ok so wait a minute. How can this possibly be $1,050 off. That seems too good to be true. Well, if we take a look at the price history, we can see that this laptop has only been listed by this seller since the beginning of this month. After a few days of being full price, it got this massive cut, bringing it to the level it is now. And if we look at Lenovo’s own website, we can find a similarly-specced IdeaPad Slim 3 going for just $660.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>So what gives? Well, lots of independent sellers like to artificially inflate the base price of their products so they can give them a huge markdown, giving the illusion of a great deal. And that’s a shame because this laptop is already a great value at this price.</p>
<h2>Diving Into the Specs</h2>
<p>What you get is an ultra-slim, lightweight laptop with a 15.3-inch screen powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor with an integrated graphics card. The Amazon listing does call it out as a gaming laptop, but the IdeaPad Slim 3 is better suited as a general-use laptop for everyday users. It still might be able to handle some lighter games that aren’t so graphically intensive. The laptop includes a full keypad, featuring a number pad which is a welcomed addition for anyone crunching numbers all day long.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5451/">The laptop is working with 24GB of memory and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for storage. It’s got support for Wi-Fi 6 for fast and stable internet speeds.</a> The ports along the side include two USB-A slots, a USB-C slot, an HDMI so you can connect to a second display, an SD card reader (great for photographers to have handy), and a classic 3.5mm headphone and microphone combination jack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been almost four years since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-destiny-2-bungie-playstation-microsoft-xbox-ex-1848453326"><span>Sony acquired Bungie</span></a><span>, the developers of </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>and the creators of Microsoft’s flagship franchise </span><i><span>Halo, </span></i><span>for a whopping $3.6 billion. Now, as we approach the fourth anniversary of that transaction, it looks like Sony isn’t satisfied with the monetary return, as the company’s CFO and Corporate Executive Officer, Lin Tao, revealed that </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>has not met the PlayStation maker’s expectations.</span></p>

 <p><span>In Sony’s Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 earnings call (thanks, </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/destiny-2-hasnt-reached-sonys-expectations-for-bungie-acquisition-says-cfo/"><i><span>This Week in Video Games</span></i></a><span>), Tao spoke about </span><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> and said that its sales and player engagement have “not reached the expectations [Sony] had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie,” Tao said through an English translator.</span></p> <p><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> is one side of Bungie’s business right now, while the other is the upcoming extraction shooter </span><i><span>Marathon</span></i><span>, which has faced some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775"><span>middling reception during its testing phase</span></a><span>. For now, Sony seems intent on releasing the game within this fiscal year, meaning sometime before March 2026. </span><i><span>Marathon</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674"><span>indefinitely delayed earlier this year to address feedback</span></a><span>, so it has no set launch date at this time. Bungie recently concluded another testing phase in October, and </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-cfo-on-bungies-marathon-as-needed-we-will-make-corrections/"><span>Tao says</span></a><span> the company is in the “process of analyzing the performance against [its internal] KPIs.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We are fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule,” Tao said. “We will assume that we will launch this within this (financial) year, and that is included in the forecast.”</span></p> <p><span>While </span><i><span>Destiny 2</span></i><span> might be struggling in Sony’s eyes, Tao did say games like </span><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>MLB: The Show 25</span></i><span> have performed well, as far as the live-service section of the business goes. </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> has also sold 3.3 million copies since its launch last month, so PlayStation games are seeing some notable success in 2025.</span></p> <p><span>Bungie has been a big pillar of Sony’s </span><a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-cfo-on-bungies-marathon-as-needed-we-will-make-corrections/"><span>attempts at carving a space in the live-service games market</span></a><span>, but the studio has been mired in controversy in the years since the acquisition. From </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-3-cancel-final-shape-expansions-bungie-payback-1851612404"><span>canceled projects</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905"><span>widespread layoffs</span></a><span>, Bungie has been publicly struggling for a few years now, and things are </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><span>reportedly not great privately, either</span></a><span>. CEO Pete Parsons left the studio after 23 years </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-halo-destiny-2-sony-2000619244"><span>back in August</span></a>.</p>

            <p>Sony's bold entrance into the console market back in the '90s heralded the use of CD-ROMs instead of cartridges, which convinced several companies to jump on board the PlayStation train. It turns out FromSoftware was one of those companies lured in by the appeal of discs.</p>
<p><a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console?utm_source=Social+Media&amp;utm_medium=Social+Post&amp;utm_campaign=MPC+Acast+Page">Speaking to Simon Parkin on the Your Perfect Console podcast</a>, former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment Shuhei Yoshida stated it was the decision to embrace CD-ROMs which led FromSoftware to join the video game industry, kicking of a chain of events leading us to games like Bloodborne, Armored Core 6, and the wider Souls series.</p>
<p>Yoshida explained how it went down: "A few companies like Atlas saw the opportunity in [CD- ROMs], because it was so much cheaper to create and quicker to manufacture. They didn't have to wait two-to-three months to restock their games if they were successful, CD ROMS could be delivered in three-to-four days."</p>

<figcaption>Ten years ago, Eurogamer spoke with Shuhei Yoshida live on stage! What a blast from the past.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcvhiWw8-e0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>"One of these companies was FromSoftware" Yoshida continued. "FromSoftware was a business software company, but when they saw PlayStation was a CD ROM game system, they thought 'oh, we can become a video game publisher'! That's how they entered into the video game industry."</p><p>When asked how Yoshida convinced companies to take a chance on Sony, a company that at this point in time had no video game console experience, Yoshida said: "It was not easy. Industry people were saying between PlayStation and Sega Saturn, the Sega Saturn would probably be more popular due to Sega's experience. However, it was a combination of the 3D graphics capability of the PlayStation, as well as the CD-ROMs as a new business opportunity. Of course, the Sega Saturn provided the same opportunity with CD-ROMs"</p>
<p>"However, Bandai Namco provided a really good library of 3D games like with Bit Racer, Capcom brought Resident Evil, and eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squaresoft">Squaresoft</a> released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>. That was the more critical title."</p>
<p>So, in case you needed reminding, the decision to use CD-ROMs was a big deal for Sony and the future of the video game industry as a whole. The whole interview is filled with many similar tidbits of information about Sony's past, and is well worth a listen.</p>
<p>Shuhei Yoshida left PlayStation back in January and since then has proven especially opinionated on the video game industry. You can read his thoughts on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-ps6-sony-cannot-do-the-same-thing-they-have-been-doing-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">the PlayStation 6, and how Sony "cannot do the same thing they have been doing"</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-losing-their-identity-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-shares-damning-switch-2-verdict">how Nintendo is losing its identity</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-playstation-boss-shuhei-yoshida-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-a-job-overseeing-indie-games">he's also spoken about how he "had no choice" but to take a job overseeing indie games</a>.</p>
