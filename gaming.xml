            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I no longer expect video games that tackle the subjects of racism and discrimination through fantasy — as <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> does — to surprise me. Those stories never go beyond well-trodden depictions of “racism is bad,” and I tune them out like so much white noise. But <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has done the work, and its willingness to go beyond surface-level treatments of tired fantasy tropes to dig at the heart of the real issues with racism and discrimination is exactly what makes it a phenomenal game. <em>Metaphor</em> is a clever evolution of the <em>Persona</em> series, but it wouldn’t be as interesting or outstanding as it is without its refreshingly progressive message.</p><p><em>Metaphor </em>takes place in a world where our reality of “equality” between different ethnic groups is presented as an unattainable-but-nice-to-think-about idyllic fantasy, while discrimination, classism, and the struggle against monstrous creatures called “humans” rule the day.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>In </em>Metaphor<em>, society is arranged into a racial hierarchy based on different fantastical physical features... or lack thereof.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>The world of <em>Metaphor</em> is stratified according to a hierarchy of different tribes classified by their physical characteristics, like wings, horns, or elfin-like long ears. Then there’s the protagonist, who comes from the most hated tribe, which, to our eyes, resemble real-world humans with no distinct physical features. Atlus calling this game “Metaphor” is about as unsubtle as a brick thrown at a protest.</p><div><p>As I dive into the guts of what makes <em>Metaphor</em> so great, I do have to note the frequent issues I had with instability. I played the game on Xbox Series S and experienced numerous crashes that seemed related to the game’s autosave feature. On top of that, when the game did crash and I rebooted my Xbox to start over, the game frequently reloaded without a video input. I could hear the start menu music but see nothing, requiring me to end my gaming sessions prematurely as the issue only seemed to fix itself after an overnight break. You can read more about <em>Metaphor</em>’s technical performance <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metaphor-refantazio-a-sublime-game-let-down-by-bizarre-technical-choices">in <em>Eurogamer</em>’s review</a>.</p></div><p>The world is thrown into chaos when the dogmatic king is murdered, leaving behind no heir, as his idealistic son mysteriously vanished years before. His death triggers a nationwide contest whereby anyone, no matter their birth or circumstance, can compete to win the throne, provided they have the love and support of the people. Your job is to earn that love through a variety of contests in the hope of putting that idealistic prince on the throne so that he may change this hateful racist world for the better.</p><p>In <em>Metaphor</em>, the characters utilize a job class system called archetypes. Each party member starts with a specific archetype — warrior, healer, mage, etc. — and by developing relationships with other NPCs, unlock more. Like <em>Persona</em>, combat is centered on exploiting an enemy’s weakness while mitigating your own. There’s also an absolutely fabulous overworld combat feature where if you strike a weaker enemy, they simply die, forgoing a transition into a battle scene. However, if an enemy is your level or stronger, you can use overworld combat to surprise attack and weaken them, giving you a serious advantage in the fight to come.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The slick menus of </em>Persona-<em>series fame return.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>I adore these improvements over <em>Persona</em>’s combat because it significantly cuts down on the time needed to grind experience. It also makes combat <em>harrowing as hell</em> because while you’re able to ambush monsters, they can do the same to you. <em>Metaphor</em>’s combat excels, exceeding its RPG cohort, because it demands that I think more strategically. Arrogantly running around a dungeon or into boss fights with your biggest, highest-level guns blazing is not always the winning strategy, and it’s also a good way to get you killed.</p><p>My higher-level party was frequently wiped out by an enemy I’d otherwise mop the floor with simply because they got the drop on me. Conversely, I’ve been able to soundly defeat enemies eight and nine levels higher than me with freshly unlocked level-one archetypes because their special abilities were uniquely suited to exploit a weakness. <em>Metaphor</em> is the only single-player game that made me feel like a raid leader in an MMO like <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>or <em>World of Warcraft</em>.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em> also feels good from a tactile perspective. The animations that play as you fluidly zip between different options in combat add a kinetic energy that made me feel like I was playing an action game instead of a turn-based RPG. This experience is enhanced by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262357/persona-metaphor-menu-design">the slick-as-hell, highly stylized menus</a> and the <em>killer</em> soundtrack — especially the main battle music. I don’t know what that man is saying, but the way he says it gets me hype as hell.</p><p>But <em>Metaphor</em> is more than just a stylish, dynamic RPG — it’s also the rare fantasy story that tackles discrimination with nuance.</p><p>In a lot of fantasy, I’m annoyed by the storytelling conceit of using discrimination against fantasy races as an allegory for real-world racism. Stories featuring this trope usually stop at the “racism is bad” surface level, demonstrating that with ugly over-the-top displays of violence (hey there, <em>Dragon Age</em>) while ignoring the subtleties that make racism so heinous and pervasive. <em>Metaphor </em>manages to incorporate and tackle both aspects of this reality.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>“Rich people are corrupt” is a sentiment frequently expressed in video games but rarely so... pointedly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>There’s a moment when you’re reading a fantasy book with a companion, and they mention that realizing their goal of a world where everyone is treated equally won’t be enough. “Equal competition doesn’t mean equal footing,” Heismay says. It’s the first time I’ve seen a video game acknowledge that simply stopping the big bad evil racist won’t magically make up for the countless generations of oppression. The game does the same with class and wealth. There’s a character vying for the throne who wishes to essentially “eat the rich” and redistribute their wealth at the point of a guillotine. But by virtue of her extremely low status, she sees everybody with more than a few coins to rub together as her ideological enemy. It’s just like when people in poverty lash out at other people a little bit less in poverty when their real enemies are the wealthy powerholders who exploit that animosity. It’s awesome that the game calls that out.</p><p>There’s an almost reflexive instinct to call <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> “<em>Persona</em> with swords.” The game has the hallmarks of a <em>Persona,</em> which lend it an air of familiarity, not to mention <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262346/metaphor-refantazio-katsura-hashino-interview-persona">much of the same creative talent</a>. But this characterization doesn’t feel correct. Those familiar systems have been remixed to feel fresh while the game’s message is vibrating on levels the <em>Persona</em> games brush up against but never quite reach.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Heismay says, “Diversity, equality, </em>and<em> inclusion.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>The upsetting thing about racism, classism, homophobia, and the like is that there’s a reluctance in the real world to acknowledge that it’s not only the violence of individual actors that perpetuates this oppression but institutions and systems as well. We challenge those individual actors and call them out because that’s much easier and quicker to do than the difficult generational work it takes to dismantle racist systems and build equitable ones. Games with that kind of message do the same — ending with the climactic defeat of the bad guys. <em>Metaphor</em> is one of the first times a high-profile game acknowledges the real, much harder, and less glamorous work of dismantling systems.</p><p>And at a time when you can’t even call out the individual actors anymore without getting gaslit to hell and back — it’s moving, as a person of color, to see <em>Metaphor</em> go the extra mile to say, “These systems need to go, too.” That’s what makes <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> so powerful, resonant, and in every sense of a word that’s unfortunately been bastardized into meaninglessness, woke as fuck.</p><p><small><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ve got an early glimpse at both Master Chief and the signature <em>Halo </em>landscape as they look in the popular engine. Nintendo, meanwhile, no doubt aware that millions of fans are awaiting any details on the successor to the Switch with bated breath, took the opportunity to announce...an alarm clock!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-director-reveals-secret-to-atlus-games-metaphor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Katsura Hashino knows exactly what he wants when it comes to video games. The legendary game director, who is responsible for the modern Persona games and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review">more recently Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, believes that, in a world obsessed with pixel count and frame-rates, only one thing matters: the people who made it. </p><p>“I want something – even if it’s not complete, even if it’s really rough, even if it’s something really unfinished – to give me a glimpse of the humanity behind it. [I want to know] who created it and for it to give me a glimpse of the emotion that inspired it,” he explains.</p><p>It’s a philosophy that has served him well over the past 30 years and it’s one of the reasons the Persona games have such a devout following. Yes, the art direction is impeccable, as is the attention to detail, even down to the UI, but it’s the characters who populate this fantastical series that really make a difference. Chie, Junpei, Ann… They all feel like real people, with traits and emotions we can relate to, so much so they feel like old friends rather than characters from a video game. That’s entirely intentional and it’s what drives Hashino to make games – a personal approach that runs counter to some of the bigger projects out there that are required to meet the expectations of both fans and company shareholders alike.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want something – even if it’s not complete, even if it’s really rough, even if it’s something really unfinished – to give me a glimpse of the humanity behind it.</p></div><p>Hashino is a longtime director at Atlus, having worked on several of the company’s Shin Megami Tensei games, the much-loved RPG series that merges the occult with more grounded settings. In a world dominated by ‘traditional’ Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, they’re a sort of goth alternative that has steadily grown in popularity over the years. </p><p>He took over the Persona series starting with Persona 3, following the departure of the previous Persona director Kouji Okada. Hashino brought over some of the darker themes from Shin Megami Tensei and mixed them with Persona’s more stylish pop vibe, resulting in a vibrant anime-influenced aesthetic, set against a high school backdrop that grappled with mythic ideas like gods and demons, as well as psychology. It’s a series that has established Hashino as one of gaming’s most respected directors. On the eve of his latest game, Metaphor: ReFantazio, IGN sat down with Hashino to look back at his past work and what drives him to make games. </p><p>Persona 3 catapulted the series into mass popularity and coincided with a renewed interest in anime in North America. However, despite its cartoon visuals there’s a lot of depth to the game and, importantly, the characters, as Hashino explains: “I think the gap between the kind of realism of the characters themselves and the anime aesthetic is a really interesting and important part of the game. You might first look and see these very anime-style characters and this anime-style world, but then might be surprised and interested to see there’s a very real [world] underpinning to them. Looking beyond the anime and seeing the realism is really a wonderful part of our games.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I feel like if you have these super highly polished games that look like they were designed by a bunch of people in a CEO boardroom, that doesn’t really excited me</p></div><p>This realism – the effort Hashino and his team goes to, to ensure every character feels real – is what drives every decision in the design process, from broad ideas to specific dialogue, as Hasino explains: “There’s this little girl named Nanako [in Persona 4] who’s in elementary school. When we were first writing her dialogue, we wrote [it] to be really, really cute. But then we took a step back and thought, ‘Wait a minute, all of her lines are so cute and they’re so well done that it doesn’t feel like any actual human girl would [talk like that] at that age’. It just felt like too much.”</p><p>Rather than lean into the fact Nanako is a video game character and thus might have dialogue that doesn’t sound truly authentic, Hashino and his team went back to the writers’ room. “We started cutting back on those overly cutesy dialogues and tried to root it in reality instead. So even though Persona 4 is a modern fantasy game, we wanted it to feel closer to something that could be happening next door to you.”</p><p>One thing that becomes clear when speaking with Hashino is the love he has for the well-being of the characters in his games. When discussing his favorite moment in Persona 5, he tells us it’s when the cast of characters are able to hang out in the retro-style cafe in Shibuya that the Phantom Thieves make their hideout.</p><p>“In Persona 5, a lot of the characters don’t really have a place where they feel safe,” Hashino explains. “So I wanted to find a place where they can go and just really have that sense of security. And in Shibuya [a neighborhood in Tokyo] it’s really hard to find that location. There’s lots of roads, lots of corridors, but there’s not really a place where [you think], ‘Okay, you guys can just sit here and chill out and just use it as your base’. Finding a place [where] they’d be welcome is really difficult. So for the characters in Persona 5, I was trying to give them a place where they <em>would</em> be welcome. That’s when I came up with the idea of what we call in Japan a <em>junkissa</em>, which is an old-style cafe.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Hashino’s love for the characters he creates is something that’s echoed by fans, and even though Metaphor: ReFantazio steps away from the familiar Persona setting – it’s set in a new, fantasy world rather than Tokyo – it has a lot in common with the games he’s made before. Similarly, the characters you’ll meet in Metaphor, despite being different from the Phantom Thieves we’re familiar with, are faced with many of the same emotional pressures such as prejudice, fear, and anxiety.</p><p>“Metaphor is a game where the characters are around teenage age, but they’re not facing [traditional] teenager problems,” Hashino says, inferring that the characters you meet will struggle with a lot more than typical teen drama like peer pressure and romance. “They’re facing anxiety and all these other big things that affect everybody, no matter who they are, where they are, or how old they are.” So while Metaphor: ReFantazio presents a new world with new characters, many of its themes can be found in Hashino’s other games.</p><p>Indeed, whether it’s Persona, Shin Megami Tensei or Metaphor, getting under the skin of each character is core to the experience. It’s something Hashino believes comes from the people who make the games, and that he prefers projects in which you can see a developer’s true self: “I feel like if you have these super highly polished games that look like they were designed by a bunch of people in a CEO boardroom, that doesn’t really excited me — it doesn’t really interest me”, he admits, bluntly. “But when I see these sorts of games [which reveal a little about the people that made them], it really fills me with the motivation to keep developing,” he says. “That these artists, these creatives, had something they really wanted to say is where I get all of my inspiration from, and the drive to continue to be creative myself.”</p><p><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

The minute-long video is just as sphincter clenching as you’d expect. It shows the Cybertruck rolling out to the Terminator theme music. For some reason there’s smoke for the Cybertruck to drive through  before the truck stops and is joined by Irvine Police officers who awkwardly pose with the truck, complete with cyborg-like smiles. The video ends with custom thunder and lightning graphics created for the truck that reads “Irvine Police Cybertruck.” I guess we’re all supposed to go “hell yeah!” at that point.<br></p><p>Irvine Police are doubling down on the department’s reasoning for spending well over six figures on this electric pickup.

And not everyone is buying the department’s reasoning that the truck is for community engagement. Some experts believe the money spent on the Cybertruck and its law enforcement modifications should have been actually spent on, you know, the community. </p><p>The truck being a part of the DARE program doesn’t help things either. As Gizmodo pointed out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03346-017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-03346-017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies have shown</a></span> the program does not work. It also doesn’t look as if Irvine PD actually got proper licensing to use “The Terminator” music in the video; the department mentioned in a statement to Gizmodo that “The video was used on our socials and music credit was given to the artist.” Between the public backlash, this cringe video and a possible copyright violation, it looks like this Cybertruck is already turning out to be less of a plus for the department and more of a headache. <br></p><p><em>This story originally appeared on Jalopnik, our sister site, on Wednesday, October 9.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When it comes to movies, the summer was packed with the likes of <em>Cuckoo</em>, <em>MaXXXine</em>, and <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, while gaming has seen releases such as a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and the retro <em>Crow Country</em>. So, if you’re looking for something new to play or watch in the lead-up to Halloween, we’ve gathered all of our spookiest coverage here in one place to make things a little easier. (And if you missed it, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23911556/halloween-2023-games-movies-tv-streaming-recommendations">we did the same thing last year</a>.)

The film’s intricate set design alone makes it one of the series’ most visually impressive chapters, and its practical effects are a welcome change of pace in a summer blockbuster season that has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/11/24218046/deadpool-wolverine-is-in-the-billion-dollar-club">dominated</a> by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161853/furiosa-mad-max-review">uninspired CGI spectacle</a>.</p><p>Director Fede Álvarez’s new standalone entry in the long-running sci-fi / horror franchise feels especially primed to speak to a new generation of fans. But as fun as <em>Romulus </em>is to look at, its story plays more like a compilation of the <em>Alien </em>series’ greatest hits than a movie that’s trying to sing its own tune. And the few new ideas <em>Romulus </em>does bring to the table are undercut by its insistence on leaning into some very questionable optics.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24219417/alien-romulus-review">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-1bd3d180-1112-40d7-b610-ef4c41881805"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216922/horror-movies-maxxxine-longlegs-cuckoo-nothing-to-say">Horror movies need to be more than a big mood</a></h2><p>The release of <em>Get Out </em>in 2017 disturbed Hollywood — not just the box office but, briefly, the entire horror genre, which had long been the most consistent moneymaker in the industry. The film made a multiple of 56 times on its $4.5 million budget and was less a breakthrough and more of a victory lap for Blumhouse, the studio that had for nearly two decades championed scary movies at a low cost with hopes of a high return.</p><p>Partly, <em>Get Out</em> was exceptional — not the first movie where the true horror is racism, but one that balanced the terror with humor and absurdity. Eager to repeat that success, Hollywood greenlit a swath of horror movies about racism. Many of them were underwhelming and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/09/antebellum-movie-review-i-am-tired-of-films-like-this.html">appalling</a>. Mostly, it was exhausting to see so much repetition in a genre that thrives on novelty. But at least these movies were <em>about</em> something. Now we’re onto the next wave of horror films, which have trended toward being about nothing.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216922/horror-movies-maxxxine-longlegs-cuckoo-nothing-to-say">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-94413712-7afd-4b0a-b402-4fa052e067bc"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24215555/neon-cuckoo-review">Cuckoo is a picturesque nightmare that struggles to get its point across</a></h2><p>Coming on the heels of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24199318/longlegs-ending-explained-questions-oz-perkinsk"><em>Longlegs</em></a> and <em>Immaculate</em>, director Tilman Singer’s <em>Cuckoo </em>feels like the next phase of Neon’s plan to dominate this summer of horror. The movie’s haunting atmosphere and gorgeous cinematography make it seem primed to tap into Hollywood’s current obsession with unsettling features running on spooky vibes alone. But for all of its hype and a solid performance from its leads, <em>Cuckoo</em> suffers from a lack of thematic coherence. It’s definitely the strongest of Neon’s recent scary movies, but that isn’t exactly a high bar to clear.</p><p>Set in a corner of the German Alps where few foreigners tend to wander, <em>Cuckoo</em> follows as sullen, American teenager Gretchen (Hunter Schafer) is forced to move in with her estranged father, Luis (Marton Csokas), and his new family. With all of Gretchen’s beloved bandmates and treasured possessions back in the States, she can’t help but feel alone living with her stepmother Beth (Jessica Henwick) and mute half-sister Alma (Mila Lieu). And while Gretchen doesn’t try to hide her distaste at being uprooted for Luis’ job expanding a secluded resort owned by Herr König (Dan Stevens), she only feels comfortable expressing the depths of her sadness in voicemails to her unseen mother.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24215555/neon-cuckoo-review">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-96f4fc9e-9ce6-4d4e-b35a-b4edbd82d836"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24187551/maxxxine-review-ti-west">A24’s MaXXXine flips the script to give you something fresh to scream about</a></h2><p>With <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22979890/x-review-ti-west-horror-movie"><em>X</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23352979/pearl-review-tiff-2022"><em>Pearl</em></a>, it was hard to miss that Ti West was using pornography and horror as lenses through which to tell a story about the evolution of film.

Since 2020, the writer and director has been fully immersed in the genre-spanning franchise that started with the ’70s slasher flick <em>X</em> and continued with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23352979/pearl-review-tiff-2022">the technicolor prequel <em>Pearl</em></a>, which were filmed back-to-back in New Zealand during the pandemic and released in 2022. Now things culminate with the premiere of the series’ third act, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24124163/maxxxine-trailer-release-date-a24-mia-goth">the very ’80s thriller <em>MaXXXine</em></a>. It’s been an intense process that has meant West hasn’t had much time for anything else. “It’s all such a blur at this point,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It’s been seven days a week, 12 hours a day, for four and a half years.”</p><p>The franchise was born, in part, out of practicality. West had initially only pitched <em>X</em> to the powers that be at A24 but had ideas for a bigger trilogy in the back of his mind. And after getting a cast and crew to New Zealand and building the sets, he realized he could film a lot of that work again for a prequel. “We had already spent all of this time and money building a Texas farm in New Zealand. How do we reuse it for free?” he remembers thinking. “How do we amortize all of those costs and make the movie less of a risk for A24? That’s where the idea came from from a practical standpoint.” He ended up writing the script for <em>Pearl</em> in a two-week-long flurry while in quarantine so that they could start shooting right away.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190083/ti-west-interview-maxxxine-a24">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-3cd8d11b-4330-4052-a2a9-483085c52be9"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24159054/i-saw-the-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">For the director of I Saw the TV Glow, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was just the start</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Monica Schipper / Getty Images for IMDb</cite></p></figure></div><p>There is an honesty to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>’</a>s depiction of growing up as a lonely, fantasy-obsessed kid in the ’90s that makes it resonate. And that’s true regardless of whether you, like writer / director Jane Schoenbrun, were a fan of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>.</p><p>The film’s mind-bending story centers on Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine). The two outsiders spark an unlikely friendship over their shared love of <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, a fictional fantasy / horror series that feels like a twisted mashup of <em>The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete </em>and <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark? </em>Between its angsty, lo-fi atmosphere and pivots into explicit B-movie horror, almost every frame speaks to how large an impact <em>Buffy</em> had on Schoenbrun’s young imagination.

The stories we tell ourselves about what’s moving in the darkness, the creation of monsters out of unknown sounds — from this emerges our fascination with terror. In <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, players navigate a cold, dark ninth-century Iceland in the often wet shoes of the Pictish warrior Senua on her second adventure in the third-person action-horror franchise. I was very fond of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16117978/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-ps4-pc">the first <em>Hellblade</em></a>, which saw Senua journey into Hel to save the soul of her lover. But the sequel pulled me in even further, with some of the most unforgettable and unsettling psychological horror I’ve ever experienced.</p><p>Senua, who lives with psychosis that causes her to hear constant voices, is a fierce warrior who has “killed” gods before in her personal quests at redemption. Cast out by her people in the Orkney Islands for being different, or a “witch,” she has taken her battles across the sea to rescue her people from slavers.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-6bbb6b61-13b0-46e0-936e-5bfa71151366"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">Crow Country is a gloriously grimy revival of ’90s survival horror</a></h2><p>Even as modern horror games become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">unnervingly immersive</a>, there’s still a place for the particular mood of old-school survival horror. Through a combo of grimy visuals, cryptic puzzles, slow pacing, and clunky controls, PlayStation-era games like <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em> were able to create a distinct kind of tension and terror. <em>Crow Country</em> is what would happen if that kind of game never went out of style. It has the look and feel of the classics but with just the right amount of modern flourish. It’s a perfect bite of classic horror.</p><p><em>Crow Country</em> comes from indie studio SFB Games — led by brothers Tom and Adam Vian — which has so far managed to create quite the eclectic library of releases. There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16633946/snipperclips-plus-nintendo-switch-interview">the playful Switch launch title <em>Snipperclips</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20917268/apple-arcade-tangle-tower-localization-translation">the point-and-click murder mystery <em>Tangle Tower</em></a>, and now a dark survival horror game. <em>Crow Country</em> doesn’t just evoke the <strong>’</strong>90s&nbsp;— it’s set during the period as well. The entire game takes place in an abandoned Atlanta amusement park in 1990, as a woman named Mara sets out in search of the park’s elusive owner who mysteriously disappeared. Of course, the place is teeming with monsters and mystery.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-a61f2bbf-e1b8-49ed-941b-676f935ec39b"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24">I Saw the TV Glow is a tribute to the transformative power of fandom</a></h2><p>Discovering and latching on to pieces of art that touch you in profound, formative ways is a beautiful part of growing up in a world that’s so thoroughly saturated with mass media.

David Dastmalchian, a character actor who you’ll recognize from the margins of half a dozen Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve movies, gets a rare star turn as Jack Delroy, the host of late-night talk show <em>Night Owls</em>. But in an era where Johnny Carson rules after-hours broadcast, Delroy’s second-place program is on the verge of getting canceled. The only way to save it, Delroy believes, is to air an extraordinary Halloween episode about the occult in the middle of sweeps season.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/20/24135658/late-night-with-the-devil-horror-movie-shudder">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

By the time I was old enough to appreciate “Back to the Future,” its cultural impact had dissipated. Had I been born 20 years earlier, I would have been 16 when it came out, and I’d probably understand the attachment people have to a prop made out of a shitty car, but whether it’s age or something else, I just don’t get it. </p><p>The thing is, though, I don’t think it’s specifically a “Back to the Future” thing. I just don’t see any point in owning something that’s so obviously a movie prop. Want to build a replica of the black Toyota SR5 from the same series? Go for it. In fact, I even understand paying a little extra for a truck with the right BTTF<em> </em>look. It’s a subtle nod to those who know, but to everyone else, you’re just driving around in a cool, old pickup truck. </p><p>A DMC-12 that’s been given the time machine treatment, on the other hand, is only cool to people who are big fans of a move that’s nearly 40 years old. If you took it to a convention or something, I could see the appeal there, but for use outside of that? You’re just driving around in an obvious movie prop, and it comes off like you desperately want people to talk to you about your car. For less than $10,000, I could maybe understand, but these things go for real money! There are five days left on the auction, and as previously mentioned, it’s already been bid up to $35,000. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this thing ends up going for more than I make in a year.</p><p>The real questions here are “To whom?” and “Why?” And while it probably sounds like I’m being snarky here, I promise I genuinely want to understand. What is the appeal of these cars? Are Gen X-ers realizing 65 is creeping up on them quickly and desperately trying to relive their youth? Please tell me what I’m missing because, clearly, I’m missing something here.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on Jalopnik, our sister site, on Friday, October 11.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamer-finds-tarkov-player-with-1-3-million-raids-and-kills.1008084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/streamer-tarkov-player-million-raids/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, a popular Escape from Tarkov streamer stumbled across a player with a staggering (and implausible) <strong>1.3 million raids and kills</strong>. This particular player has almost 9,000 hours of playtime, has survived 1,341,434 raids in a row, and has assembled a KD of just 1.0. None of the numbers make sense, so it’s either a mathematical marvel or a serious issue that has occurred in the back end.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rookie-numbers">Rookie Numbers</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/RealTigz/status/1844853227772416066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘Tigz’ posted an image</a> of a player with some stunning stats.</p>



<ul>
<li>1,342,602 raids</li>



<li>567 survived</li>



<li>541 KIA</li>



<li>53 AWOL</li>



<li>1,341,764 kills</li>
</ul>



<p>Other users started commenting on this post, sharing images of the same player. One managed to capture a shot of this user just one match later, showing him kitted up (per the profile) and ready for battle, which suggests it’s a real player sitting behind a screen somewhere.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation is a bug in the data because it’s mathematically impossible for a user to have played that many matches since the game was wiped in August. It’s no big secret that Escape from Tarkov’s cheaters are capable of some pretty wild stuff, but they can’t bend the laws of time and space to their will.</p>



<p>It gets better, though.</p>



<p>A little digging <a href="https://x.com/Abbas2002_/status/1844955796024516638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">turned up another user</a> with 64 hours played and <strong>41 million </strong>raids and kills. Again, this user has a KD of just 1 but they also had an average lifespan of 00:00, suggesting that their raids aren’t even loading before they’re dying again. </p>



<p>If nothing else, it’s an indication of how fragile Escape from Tarkov’s data infrastructure must be. This revelation comes mere weeks after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-malfunction-profile-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a data issue wiped thousands</a> of Escape from Tarkov accounts, leaving Battlestate Games to offer immense in-game compensation to users.</p>

<p>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok is arguably the most recognisable competitor in the world of esports. He’s the GOAT of League of Legends and is considered a rockstar in South Korea, and he <strong>just </strong>ticked over 100 match wins at League of Legends Worlds. He’s the first player in history to achieve that milestone, and it comes after ten years of competing at the tournament.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-massive-milestone">Massive Milestone</h2>



<p>In 2013, Faker attended – and won – his first League Worlds, scoring a 3 – 0 victory over Royal Club with T1 to net a $1,000,000 grand prize. Since then, he has claimed the top spot at the 2015, 2016, and 2023 League World Championships, becoming the winningest player not just in League, but perhaps in the entire esports industry.</p>



<p>Those major victories have been bolstered by number-one finishes at the likes of MSI, the LCK, and IEM. As a whole, Faker has claimed almost $2 million individually since entering the League of Legends pro scene.</p>



<p>Recently, he became the first player to secure a major milestone, notching up his one-hundredth win at LoL Worlds. It arrived during a Swiss Stage fixture against G2 Esports, with T1 effortlessly grabbing a 2 – 0 victory over the European side. </p>



<p>Thus far in the tournament, T1 has lost just one match out of four, and it’s looking good for yet another victory for Faker – but let’s not speak too soon. There’s still quite a long road ahead, and the grand final of this year’s League Worlds event won’t arrive until November 2, when players will descend upon London, England to fight for the $445,000 grand prize.</p>



<p>Are you predicting another win for T1? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>There’s some sneezy sniffles in store for my weekend (thankfully without a C-word involved, at least), so I’m looking forward to hunkering down with games today and as much NFL as I can fit in my eyeholes tomorrow. Though I suppose I should try to finish some DIY projects as well…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/must-have-stormcast-eternals-our-favorites<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Serving as the golden children of the world of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>, the Stormcast Eternals are once again riding down to the mortal realms on a crack of lightning! Including a huge new range of reinforcements (some brand new, some previously only available via boxed sets), there's a lot to choose from for your army. But I'm here to help! Games Workshop sent me a big batch of these new units to check out, so read on for my picks for Must-Have Stormcast Eternals.</p>
<p>For more of our&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em>&nbsp;coverage, check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/new-skaven-warhammer-miniatures-review-rats-off-to-ya">coverage of new Skaven miniatures</a>, and our r<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set">eview of the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>&nbsp;Starter Set</a>. And to see all of the upcoming Stormcast Eternals releases coming up for pre-order, check out the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-us/articles/yrpl1os9/sunday-preview-unleash-the-ruination-chamber/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Warhammer Community Sunday Previews article</a> breaking it all down.</p>
<h2>Must-Have Stormcast Eternals: Iridan The Witness</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/iridan-the-witness.jpeg?itok=RxlPAZaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/iridan-the-witness.jpeg?itok=DwMCsdIa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First up, we have to talk about the largest, perhaps flashiest model in this batch of incoming Stormcast units. And even though I don't have access to the&nbsp;<em>Stormcast Eternals</em>&nbsp;battletome just yet (I do have the Faction Pack, which Iridan isn't in), what I can see from the article leading up to his release makes me&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;excited.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, his "Prayer of the Witness" ability, which states: <em>"For the rest of the turn, each time a friendly&nbsp;Ruination Chamber&nbsp;unit uses a&nbsp;Fight&nbsp;ability while it is wholly within 18" of this unit, after that ability has been resolved: Heal (D3)&nbsp;that unit. If the chanting roll was 8+,&nbsp;Heal (3)&nbsp;that unit instead. That unit has&nbsp;Ward (6+)&nbsp;rest of the turn."</em> In other words, if you plan on crowding other fighting units in around him, they'll be auto-healing every time they fight!</p>
<p>He also has an ability called "Dark Flight," which lets him roll to slay an enemy unit near him and then retreat for free. Because he's riding on a giant flying monstrosity, I love the flavor of this ability which is basically: he just blasts off out of danger, absolutely splattering one hapless foe in his way.</p>
<p>We can also see from his construction booklet that he has solid health and defense, with 12 HP and a 3+ save. We can also tell from these bare-bones rules that his main weapon has 4 attacks, hits and damages on 3+, with Rend 2, dealing d3 damage. So while we teasingly don't have the full details yet, I really like what I see - and the model is absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<h2>Must-Have Stormcast Eternals: Lord-Celestant</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/must-have-stormcast-eternals-lord-celestant.jpg?itok=0mrHg0lS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/must-have-stormcast-eternals-lord-celestant.jpg?itok=HS-mJ7jm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Lord-Celestant now comes in multiple builds, allowing you to customize the look of your army (MUCH needed in a Stormcast Eternals list)</figcaption></figure><p>The Lord-Celestant has always been a good option for players who prefer a more aggressive playstyle, as their key ability is to allow another friendly non-Hero Warrior Chamber unit within their combat range (3") to fight right after they fight (and adds 1 to wound rolls). This means you can really surround an enemy unit, and get in a lot of hits before they can reasonably respond with much force.</p>
<p>This new release of the model includes a big variety of potential builds for this unit, which I think does a really nice job of helping us get away from a samey-looking army of Stormcast Eternals, which is why I think this unit's definitely worth having!</p>
<h2>Must-Have Stormcast Eternals: Lord-Terminos</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/must-have-stormcast-eternals-lord-terminos.jpg?itok=LNVTrS_k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/must-have-stormcast-eternals-lord-terminos.jpg?itok=k1A_TVEU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Lord-Terminos and his little friend here (the Memorian) simply shrug off your special abilities.</figcaption></figure><p>While I understand that the Lord-Terminos is effectively a beefed up version of the Lord-Celestant, the&nbsp;<em>way&nbsp;</em>in which he's beefed up is absolutely worth highlighting. First off, he has the same ability to let another unit fight as mentioned above, except that instead of adding 1 to wound rolls for that other unit, he's adding 1 to hit rolls. That's... big.</p>
<p>Also, when he's picked as the target of a non-Core ability (aka a special ability), once per turn you can roll a resistance die, and on a 4+, that ability has no effect on him. The thought of simply ignoring some fell spell makes this unit feel so hardy (and his 3+ save doesn't hurt either).</p>
<h2>Must-Have Stormcast Eternals: Stormstrike Palladors</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/must-have-stormcast-eternals-stormstrike-palladors.jpg?itok=TwDqKAZZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/must-have-stormcast-eternals-stormstrike-palladors.jpg?itok=R8drD3Lr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I love the look of these Griff-riding Palladors!</figcaption></figure><p>This is another unit that I don't have a ton of info on yet, except to say that the models themselves are absolutely top-rate and have an extremely dynamic, mid-action move to them that I've come to expect from modern cavalry units in&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em>. Giving some visual movement to the collection here is really nice, and shows the fury of their attack.</p>
<p>As for the abilities we do know about at the time of this writing, the most interesting (aside from them have the usual Anti-Infantry rule that makes sense for mounted units) is their "Ride For Vengeance" special ability, which states that: <em>"if any friendly Warrior Chamber units have been destroyed this battle: You can re-roll charge rolls for this unit. This unit has&nbsp;Strike-First&nbsp;if it charged in the same turn."</em></p>
<h2>Bonus! Stormreach Portal</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/must-have-stormcast-eternals-stormreach-portal.jpg?itok=tojQi5Ru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/must-have-stormcast-eternals-stormreach-portal.jpg?itok=xeRRYVyi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I love the mausoleum look of this portal - very fitting for our constantly dying Eternals!</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, and more as a bonus, because I don't honestly think this unit is a "Must-Have" necessarily, is the Stormreach Portal. Aside from it being just absolutely gorgeous, and looking very nifty on the battlefield, it also has an incredible ability built into it.</p>
<p>Basically, when on your movement phase, you can choose a friendly non-Monster Stormcast Eternals&nbsp;unit, and as long as it's not currently in combat and is close to the Portal (i.e. wholly within 6"), you can: <em>"Remove the target from the battlefield and set it up again on the battlefield more than 9" from all enemy units."</em></p>
<p>The amount of mobility that this will add to your army, getting them basically&nbsp;<em>wherever</em>&nbsp;they want to be, is hard to ignore. But I wouldn't call it officially "Must-Have" since not every army's going to need that extra mobility.</p>
<p>What do you think of the new models coming out for Stormcast Eternals? Is this a solid upgrade to the army (both tactically and, in the case of new sculpts, cosmetically), or were you hoping for a different approach? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-2-seemingly-teased-by-actor-peter-stormare/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned actor Peter Stormare (Fargo, Armageddon, Constantine) has seemingly teased the existence of Until Dawn 2 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therealstormare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on his Instagram profile</a>. The latest story is a repost of the fan page Until Dawn News, which suggested a sequel was kinda confirmed by one of the remake's new endings.</p>
<p>Peter Stormare played the key character Dr. Hill in the game, and he's set to reprise his role in the upcoming movie adaptation <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-is-being-adapted-into-a-movie-annabelle-2-creation-director-and-writer-attached/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> earlier this year to be in development by Annabelle 2: Creation and Shazam! Director David F. Sandberg. As such, he would likely be kept in the know for a follow-up game, too.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Sony does appear to be investing quite a lot in the IP, between the adaptation and the Unreal Engine 5 remake that was just released for PlayStation 5 and PC by Ballistic Moon. Granted, the remake didn't exactly have the best reception, with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-ps5-remake-is-expected-to-retail-at-60-consumers-will-have-to-pay-the-sony-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high price&nbsp;tag</a> and several <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-remake-has-a-broken-ray-tracing-experience-amd-fsr-3-doesnt-work-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken tech features on the PC version</a>. However, personally, I would really love to see Until Dawn 2. The big question would be who would handle it: original developer Supermassive Games or Ballistic Moon itself. Sadly, the latter option appears unlikely as the studio just had to 'significantly scale down' and lay off some of its employees in order to stay afloat.</p>
<p>In case you're still on the fence about whether to get the remake, here's what I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/until-dawn-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought</a> about the original when it first launched on PlayStation 4:</p>
<p><em>I'll be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of the horror genre. In fact, chances to see me in line for the next horror flick are basically none. Despite this, Until Dawn kept me engaged and interested all the way (and a bit scared - yes, I jumped a few times) thanks to its intriguing plot. Nothing is as it seems up on this mountain, and the writers definitely did a fine job in weaving the story, which is guaranteed to grab your attention.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content.1008030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Insider Tom Henderson has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a new report on Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition. We first got wind that Warner Bros. Games was doing something of the sort last June when Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that some members of Rocksteady were working on a Director's Cut for the game.</p>
<p>Now, Henderson says this new version of the game will include between 10 and 15 hours of new content, including a story quest, more side quests and activities, and, of course, new outfits. According to the report, Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition should be launched next year. Owners of the base game will be able to upgrade to it for $20 or $30.</p>
<p>Avalanche Software's game was incredibly successful despite the boycott attempts against J.K. Rowling (who had nothing to do with the development). Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out on top</a> in 2023's best-selling charts despite incredibly fierce competition. Last we heard, the game had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-24-million-units-new-features-and-ex-playstation-exclusive-content-coming-in-q3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 24 million units as of this January, and that number has certainly gone up since.</p>
<p>On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> an 8.5 out of 10 score. Here's what reviewer Chris Wray had to say about it:</p>
<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy is, for better or worse, an entertaining and engaging game. By far the best digital version of the wizarding world, it offers a vast swathe of things to do. Even the more mundane elements (bandit camps!) are improved by a robust combat system that genuinely makes you feel like you're a part of the Harry Potter universe.</em></p>
<p>After all this success, it's no wonder Warner Bros. wants more of it. Just last month, WB Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-wb-games-biggest-priority-but-itll-take-a-couple-of-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the sequel is a priority, although it will take a few years before it can be released. WB Discovery also <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> via JB Perrette (CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games) that Hogwarts Legacy 2 could very well incorporate live service elements, although it's way too early to figure out in what capacity.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Is Escape from Tarkov 1.0 Being Released?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-escape-from-tarkov-1-0-being-released.1008024/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov is the most ambitious and popular extraction shooter ever made. It can be argued it has driven the genre’s growth since dropping into an alpha state almost a decade ago. The game has been in beta since 2016, which is a fact that often prompts users to ask: ‘When <strong>is </strong>Escape from Tarkov 1.0 being released?’</p>



<p>Technically, Escape from Tarkov hasn’t <strong>been released </strong>because it has been in a testing phase for almost ten years. It’ll be officially released when it’s a 1.0 product, which will only happen when the developer, Battlestate Games, feels like it’s ready to be classed as a full, finished game.</p>



<p><strong>So</strong>, when is Escape from Tarkov being released? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-tarkov-1-0">What is Tarkov 1.0?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov 1.0 will be the game’s version number when it becomes a fully released product. Until now, it has been numbered ‘0.15’, for example. That means there have been 15 major updates to the game since it entered a beta phase, but it is yet to be considered a full game.</p>



<p>When Tarkov 1.0 is released, the first major update will be ‘1.1’, and so on. </p>



<p>Sometimes, a game will have such a monumental overhaul that it’s considered a 2.0 product. For instance, in 2023, Cyberpunk 2077 underwent a phenomenal list of changes that made it feel like a whole new game – but it wasn’t. To describe that scenario, it was dubbed Cyberpunk 2077 2.0.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-will-be-in-tarkov-1-0">What Will Be in Tarkov 1.0?</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has fleshed out the Escape from Tarkov platform so much over the years, but there are still plenty of changes lined up for the 1.0 release. For instance, the team endeavours to put in place a dedicated storyline that’ll see players <strong>actually escape from Tarkov</strong>. By doing this, they’ll wipe the game, reset their character, and start afresh.</p>



<p>If they repeatedly complete the game, they’ll go through a ‘Prestige’ system.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Battlestate wants to add clans, alliances, and more factions to the game. Factions are rarely added to Escape from Tarkov, and for the most part, we’ve had the same units running around the game for almost ten years. The team also wants to introduce more DLC, further hideout expansions, a third-party API release, and more new maps.</p>



<p>That’s alongside all the usual changes that are added to the game: new weapons, new equipment, tweaked mechanics, and so on.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-1-0-being-released">When is Tarkov 1.0 Being Released?</h2>



<p>Presently, Tarkov 1.0 doesn’t have a release date, but in 2024, it dominated discussions related to the game. It’s expected that Tarkov 1.0 will arrive in 2026, as current roadmaps covering the game run until at least 2025. Like any new game, Battlestate will pour a huge amount of focus and money into marketing the release of Tarkov 1.0.</p>



<p>And that kind of thing takes <strong>a lot </strong>of time.</p>



<p>I’m predicting that Tarkov 1.0 will be released in 2026, and then the team will move on to focus on something else for the first time in more than a decade.</p>
