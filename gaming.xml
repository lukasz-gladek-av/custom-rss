			<p>The deckbuilding roguelike genre has been solved at this point. I don’t mean that in a bad way; it’s just that we’ve had a lot of takes on it since Slay the Spire really boosted the genre into the stratosphere. Demon’s Mirror, then, has a fairly large obstacle to overcome, because how do you stand out when there are already so many options to choose from? It turns out the answer is by also throwing in a match-3 game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demon's Mirror - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmwM3g188q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It takes a little bit of time to adjust to the way that Demon’s Mirror does things, and it initially feels as though the card game and the puzzle game are essentially separate. The only thing that appears to connect them is that a couple of your cards can interact with the board, and that everything costs energy, which means you need to decide if you’re better off matching a bunch of tiles to attack, get energy, get armour, or get willpower, or if you should use a card to do one of those same things or something else.</p>


<p>However, as you get to grips with not only the three characters available, but also the core mechanics each of them has, and then start properly building around them, everything starts to mesh together to make for a smoother experience. My favourite character of the three is one who can apply a unique status effect called influence, which basically represents them talking to the enemies you’re fighting, and if you can apply more influence than they have health remaining, they get taken out of the fight.</p>


<p>Despite being my favourite, this was also the character I had the hardest time finishing the game with. I could see an incredibly cool build in there based on skill cards that cost 0 energy, a card that applied influence X amount of times (where X was the number of skill cards you’d played), and a card that allowed you to put any 0 energy cards back into your hand from your discard pile if you matched green tiles. I then just needed the right relics, which ended up being ones that could reduce the cost of green tile chains, and a couple of others that let you match for free if you played enough cards.</p>
<p>Once I had this working, it took maybe four runs for everything to properly coalesce in both my head and my hand, until I suddenly had a build that actually beat everything within the first two turns. I just needed to keep thinning out my deck until the combo was guaranteed, and then just play a lot of cards to draw more cards and keep doing so for free, until the card that allows you to inflict three influence for each skill card would hit upwards of 200 in total.</p>

<p>The reason I spent two paragraphs detailing that one specific combo is because Demon’s Mirror is full to the brim with different builds to explore and combinations to mess around with, and you can make the game harder or easier with special modifiers you unlock, as well. There’s not as much to do here as there is in some other examples of the genre, but what is here is a delight.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Demon's Mirror is a wonderfully refreshing take on the whole deckbuilding genre, and well worth a look if you want something that genuinely feels new. If you've never played one of these before, however, then it's probably going to feel pretty tough to begin with, but it'll be worth it.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>A universe that includes a film and Project Rene, which is sort of Sims 5, maybe</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
People waiting impatiently for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a>: you have sinned against Simming and must do penance. In your temerity and ignorance, you have cried out unto developers Maxis and publisher EA for another sequential helping of the cuddly/sociopathic neighbourhood-building game - a "sequel", if you will. Know ye not that we live in the time of Disrupted Models? Sequels are archaisms devised by the old gods in their dotage. Let us all join hands and set forth into the sunny uplands of the Connected Cross-Media Cross-Platform Universe.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"The Sims will move beyond linear, sequential Sims releases and offer more options for players than ever before," explains <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims">an EA blog post about the future of the series</a>, published yesterday. "We're focused on creating a variety of games and experiences that will touch different categories across the simulated life genre including cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, mobile narrative games and continued depth, improvements, and modernization of The Sims 4, which will continue to be a foundational Sims experience."
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/">Variety</a> (ta <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">Eurogamer</a>), The Sims franchise general manager Kate Gorman explained the thinking in slightly more detail. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise started with Sims 1 and then Sims 2, 3, and 4," she began, in a useful refresher for those of us still wrestling with the whole "sequel" concept. "And they were seen as replacements for the previous products. [But now,] we are not going to be working on replacements of previous projects; we're only going to be adding to our universe." 
</p>
<p>
But what could this mean??? "What this means is that we will continue to bring HD simulation experience and what people would want from a 5," Gorman continued, "but it doesn't mean that we're going to start you over... As we think about the future of it, we want you to continue all of those families and generations. Those creations are your progress, your attachment. 
</p>
<p>
"We don't want to reset your progress. And so it's not about... what the numbers are in the games, but know that the future of the franchise looks more like keeping your progress, keeping things across titles, and really having an ongoing experience, and not a start-and-stop experience between products." 
</p>
<p>
Beyond this point, the brain of the writer buckles and cannot reassemble the majesty of EA's vision into cogent paragraphs. I am forced to resort to the simplified, World War-era medium of bulletpoints. Here's roughly what the Sims universe will encompass, based on the blog post and the interview above.
</p>
<p>
- The mysterious Project Rene, which "is focused on building ways for friends to meet, connect, and share while playing together in an all-new world". There's a small invite-only playtest happening later this year, which will give "an early look at a multiplayer experience that explores joining friends and other players at a shared location". I guess this could be something approximating a "Sims 5", if you're desperate. EA have previously said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-sims-game-will-be-free-to-play-with-paid-dlc">Project Rene would co-exist with The Sims 4</a>, and would be a free-to-play game with DLC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-devs-definitely-want-to-have-multiplayer-are-looking-at-animal-crossing-for-inspiration">multiplayer inspired by Animal Crossing</a><a></a>
</p>
<p>
- a Hollywood movie adaptation in partnership with Amazon MGM Studios, with Loki director Kate Herron directing and Dr Who scribe Briony Redman on the writing team. I think Margot Robbie is involved somehow. Make it like the Barbie film, please
</p>
<p>
- Continuing to improve and maintain The Sims 4, a venerable but very popular game. EA are "investing in meaningful new features and base game updates", so as "to evolve the game in both appearance and gameplay experience"
</p>
<p>
- expanding The Sims FreePlay, a mobile game spin-off, while developing another mobile experience or game, Project Stories
</p>
<p>
- "Reinvigorating the MySims product line, beginning with two lovable games available soon on Nintendo Switch", Nintendo's charming cut-price Steam Deck - the games in question are MySims and MySims Kingdom, which together form the MySims: Cozy Bundle. It burns, it burns!
</p>
<p>
- A set of creator tools, a player content gallery, a marketplace, and a social network, to be shared across Sims games
</p>
<p>EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-rene-aka-the-sims-5-shows-prototype-lighting-animation-routines-in-latest-video">revealed some strictly WIP footage of Project Rene last year</a>, with prototypes of daily routines around the neighbourhood and new animations for moods and reactions. I've popped a screenshot from one of those prototypes at the top of the page, there. Again, it does <em>sort</em> of feel like Project Rene will be something approximating a traditional Sims sequel, but I reckon I'll be struck by righteous lightning if I spell that out too avidly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-producer-hiroshi-kataoka-%E2%80%93-discussing-the-series-new-combat-system-additional-content.984123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-producer-hiroshi-kataoka-discussing-the-series-new-combat-system-additional-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In many ways, the announcement of Fairy Tail 2 was an unexpected but welcome surprise. While there's no denying the popularity of the series by Hiro Mashima, Koei Tecmo and Gust gave no indication that the franchise would continue to bring a close to the original manga's storyline.</p><div>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, I had the chance to try out the game before its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-december/">December release</a> and speak with Producer Hiroshi Kataoka, discussing the setting, characters, battle system, future content, and more. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>The original Fairy Tail was almost universally praised for being a very good adaptation of the manga by Hiro Mashima, but many found it difficult to keep up with the story and characters without any prior knowledge. Is there anything in the new game that addresses this issue?</strong></p>
<p>We have a few systems in place to address this issue. For starters, at the beginning of the game, there's an event that is specifically focused on looking back at the past story. We also implemented a glossary in the main menu, which allows players to check terminology as well as learn more about characters and their past, so it's easy to learn what happened before the Alvarez Empire Arc. During dialogues, there are also words highlighted in yellow, which can take the player straight to the glossary, even during gameplay. So, to enjoy Fairy Tail 2, it's not necessary to play the original.</p>
<p><strong>Fairy Tail 2 features an all-new original story called Key to the Unknown, set after the events of the Alvarez Empire Arc and the original story. Is there more original story besides this new epilogue?</strong></p>
<p>There is more original story, but it's not a lot, and it's mostly found in sidequests and optional content. Fairy Tail 2 is all about respecting the original IP, and we didn't want to break the flow of the original narrative. When it comes to the original story we added, including the epilogue, Mashima-sensei checked everything, so players and fans can look forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>One of the biggest changes featured in Fairy Tail 2 over the original is the battle system. Why go from a classic turn-based system to the new real-time one?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few reasons for the change. The first game featured a turn-based battle system to help newcomers to the genre and let them have fun right away, but its slow pace wouldn't have been suitable for what happens in the second game. The Alvarez Empire arc, which is the last arc of the original manga, features a lot of combat against some very powerful enemies, and I felt that a faster, more action-based combat system was better suited to properly adapt these battles. Being the final battle, it just had to be faster.</p>
<p><strong>Many role-playing game series are moving away from turn-based combat and employing more action-oriented systems. Do you think there's still a market for classic turn-based games?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think the market is shifting towards one or the other. It all depends on what kind of battles someone wants to have in their games. You can do interesting things with both turn-based and action-focused combat systems. Personally, I still find turn-based combat fun, but for Fairy Tail 2, I felt that an action-oriented combat system would have been best. It really depends on the game.</p>
<p><strong>Are there multiple difficulty settings?</strong></p>
<p>Fairy Tail 2 features multiple difficulty settings. We have an easy mode for beginners to enjoy the story, but we also have more battle-focused difficulties for those who find the other difficulties too easy. There's a total of four settings, so it's not either easy mode or normal mode.</p>
<p><strong>Fairy Tail features a lot of characters. How did you pick the playable characters? Are more coming after release?</strong></p>
<p>The playable characters were picked based on their role in the final battle against the Alvarez Empire. We picked those involved in the battle in the original story. There will be some additional characters coming after launch, but we can't specifically say who is coming right now.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about additional content, will there be more story added to the game after release?</strong></p>
<p>We will release additional free and paid content after the release. We're still deciding what to release specifically, but I can confirm that more content is coming.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead, will the Fairy Tail series continue? If so, would a new entry in the series feature an all-original story, or will it adapt the 100 Years Quest story?</strong></p>
<p>There's definitely the chance of more Fairy Tail in the future, but right now, it's hard to say if there's going to be another entry in the series and if it will adapt the new story or feature original content. It all depends on how Fairy Tail 2 is received. If players want more sequels, we will consider developing them and speak with Kodansha, who holds the IP, on how to proceed. So, there's definitely a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>If you could adapt any other manga series, which would it be?</strong></p>
<p>I like old manga series, and I would love to adapt some works from Leiji Matsumoto. I really like Space Battleship Yamato, and I would love to make a game based on it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Investor Day</a>, which also saw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> of the third installment in the Star Wars Jedi series, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson outlined the core importance of generative AI for the company's future. Following up on <a href="https://wccftech.com/generative-ai-will-allow-bigger-more-immersive-worlds-says-ea-and-developers-were-hungry-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his previous statement</a> that generative AI will allow bigger and more immersive worlds, Wilson explained how EA is using this technology for its upcoming projects as part of its bid to outpace market growth through 2027 and double the audience to over a billion users.</p>
<p><em>AI in its different forms has always been central to this creative journey. We all remember playing against the AI, and it has evolved into today's innovations in generative AI. This remarkable technology is not merely a buzzword for us; it's the very core of our business. Beyond writing or coding AI to ensure the believability of our characters, we have always used forms of machine learning and AI across our games and processes. Right now, we have over 100 active novel AI projects across three strategic categories: efficiency, expansion, and transformation.</em></p>
<p><em>Let me first talk about efficiency. This does not just mean cost savings today. Efficiency is doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality. That means driving more iterations, more testing and high quality content for our communities. It means removing obstacles for our game developers. It means culturalizing content across geographies so they can focus on finding more fun for more players around the world. The lowering of these friction points leads to deeper gameplay experiences.</em></p>
<p><em>Expansion is about giving our creative teams an exponentially bigger canvas upon which to create and richer colors so they might paint more brilliant worlds. It's about our incredible teams creating characters with more depth and intelligence, telling stories that are more personal and nuanced, and bringing more authenticity and deeper immersion. For years, we at EA have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different. We predict that with generative AI, we will truly be able to fulfill this promise for billions of people and billions of hours.</em></p>
<p><em>Transformation is about looking much farther into the future and finding new ways to play, watch, create, and connect that aren't imagined today. We believe AI will greatly expand and transform the entertainment experience for user generated content. It will accelerate how innovators and creators in entertainment are building and delivering experiences rooted in self-expression, content creation, curation, and instant gratification, the kind of entertainment that today's players and fans deeply crave.</em></p>
<p>Bold words indeed from the EA CEO, although Electronic Arts is not at all the only big company to believe in generative AI's potential to disrupt the gaming industry. Microsoft, for instance, partnered with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-big-inworld-ai-qa-everyone-in-gaming-sees-the-potential-of-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inworld AI</a> to create a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-partners-with-inworld-ai-to-empower-game-creators-through-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiplatform AI-powered toolset for game developers</a>. Ubisoft also <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> off an interesting demo at GDC 2024 powered by Inworld AI tech.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts appears to be developing an in-house solution rather than relying on a third party. Either way, we might be looking at an influx of games featuring some sort of generative AI implementation in the next few years.</p>

            <p>Having gone to bed last night with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> installed yet unplayed on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, I awoke to find Valve have slapped the moody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with Unsupported status for the handheld. Its crime: an inability to "run well" on the Steam Deck’s internals, regardless of settings changes. Dammit, Clive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve given it a whirl myself this morning, and while a literal interpretation of "unsupported" arguably doesn’t apply to FFXVI – the Steam Deck can still launch and run it without detonating in one’s hands – it does ask a little too much of the hardware. The Low quality preset and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a> on Ultra Performance is enough to keep me above 30fps in plenty of fights, but other areas will easily knock that down into the 20-25fps range, or even into the teens. Which ain’t particularly nice to play, even if you are still technically playing. FSR 3 can provide frame gen as well as upscaling, but this manages to make things worse, introducing heavy stuttering in exchange for only a tiny handful of extra generated frames.</p>
<p>(Strangely, nothing performs worse than the cutscenes, which I’ve repeatedly seen collapse to around the 17-20fps region for no clearly apparent reason. Though at least this pre-empts any potential annoyance about them also being capped at 30fps on PC.)</p>
<p>Also, and this isn’t part of Valve’s Steam Deck verification criteria but I can and will moan about it anyway: it’s a 152GB install. 152GB! So even if you decide the tough out the framerate dips, FFXVI is going to devour the lion’s share of any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">Steam Deck SSD</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a>. 152GB, honestly. You could fit twelve copies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls II</a> in that. Or six <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Risings</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-pc-performance-best-settings">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, this makes it two Big Budget Action Games Where You Play a Grumpy Man With a Sword in a row that fall just short on Steam Deck performance. As for how Final Fantasy XVI’s new PC port takes to more traditional PC hardware, I’m currently locked in the benchmark dungeon trying to find out, though I suspect you won’t want to take your chances with anything below the minimum requirements of a RX 5700 or GTX 1070.</p>

Here’s the official blurb, from Nintendo:</p><blockquote>The warriors from Double Dragon join forces with the toad-acious Battletoads trio to form the ultimate team in this 1993 beat-’em-up! Tussle with terrific twins Billy and Jimmy Lee as they team up with Zitz, Rash and Pimple to defend the Earth against the combined might of the Dark Queen and the Shadow Boss! Leap from the Battlecopter onto the tail of the Colossus spaceship and fight your way through beastly baddies and lethal objects using the Battletoads’ arsenal of Smash Hits or the Dragons’ array of Dragon Force Techniques – each provides incredible attacking combos, including kicks, punches, throws and more! You’ll also put your driving skills to the test with the Speeder Bike and high-speed Space Pod. How will this struggle for Earth’s future end?</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/unnamed-4-1726648535968.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Battletoads Double Dragon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Next, we have Jaleco’s Big Run, a racing game originally released for the Super Famicom in 1991. Check out what the game is about, per Nintendo:</p><blockquote>Race across the vast landscape of Africa – from Tripoli to Dakar – over the course of nine stages in this racing game originally released for the Super Famicom system in 1991. This monumental task isn’t only about putting pedal to the metal, though! First, you’ll need to select a sponsor and then use those funds to hire staff. Next, you’ll need some spare parts to replace tires and engines when they get damaged or worn out. The glory of victory awaits if you can combine precise tactics and bold driving to weather the brutal driving conditions that stand between you and your goal.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/unnamed-5-1726648565847.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Big Run.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Cosmo Gang the Puzzle is a 1993 action puzzle game developed by Namco and originally released for the Super Famicom.</p><blockquote>The Cosmo Gang take on falling-block-style puzzles across three modes in this 1993 action-puzzle game that was originally for Super Famicom. Focus on clearing blocks to get the high score in 1P Mode, play competitive battles in VS Mode and put yourself to the test in 100 Stage Mode, where you can solve stage after stage of strategic challenges. In each of the modes, progress is made by removing containers and Cosmos that fall from the top of the screen. You can remove the containers by lining six up in a horizontal row — and Cosmos are removed when they touch the blue orbs that occasionally make their way down. Though the two types of blocks are cleared in different ways, try to see if you can perform a combo by clearing both types at once!</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/unnamed-6-1726648607092.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Cosmo Gang the Puzzle.</figcaption></figure></output><p>And finally, Technōs Japan’s sports game Kunio-kun no Dodgeball da yo Zen'in Shūgō!, which came out on the Super Famicom in 1993, is available. The Kunio-kun series, known as River City outside Japan, is now in the hands of Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works, with recent revivals from WayForward.</p><blockquote>This sports game, released for the Super Famicom system in 1993, features Kunio-kun (who you may recognize from the River City series!) and his striking dodgeball moves. Take the field and square off against teams from various countries and employ a variety of jumps, passes and dynamic knockout shots as you aim to become the greatest dodgeball team in the world. Plus, each stage has hidden gimmicks to discover, so your matches may even take some unexpected turns! Build your ideal team, power up with in-game items and train your teammates to be the best they can be. Can you take the dodgeball championship by storm?</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/unnamed-7-1726648723391.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kunio-kun no Dodgeball da yo Zen'in Shūgō!.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Super NES – Nintendo Switch Online library additions for September 2024:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/battletoads-double-dragon-the-ultimate-team">Battletoads Double Dragon</a></li><li>Big Run</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/cosmo-gang-the-puzzle">Cosmo Gang the Puzzle</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/nekketsu-kunio-kuns-dodgeball">Kunio-kun no Dodgeball da yo Zen'in Shūgō!</a></li></ul><p>All four games are now part of the Super NES – Nintendo Switch Online library, and are available for all Nintendo Switch Online members to play today.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It means removing obstacles for our game developers," he added. "It means culturalizing content across geographies so they can focus on finding more fun for more players around the world. The lowering of these friction points leads to deeper gameplay experiences."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Underlining that point, Wilson said EA couldn't have created </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>College Football 25 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">without leaning on AI tools to build 150 unique stadiums and over 11,000 player likenesses. That sort of expansion is what he claims EA is driving towards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Expansion is about giving our creative teams an exponentially bigger canvas upon which to create, and richer colors so they might paint more brilliant worlds. It's about our incredible teams, creating characters with more depth and intelligence, telling stories that are more personal and nuanced, and bringing more authenticity and deeper immersion to our already unrivalled sports experiences," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For years, we have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different. We predict that with generative AI we will truly be able to fulfill this promise for billions of people, for billions and billions of hours."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for transformation? Wilson believes that concept is about gazing into the distant future and considering how AI can deliver experiences that cannot be "imagined today."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We believe AI will greatly expand and transform the entertainment experience for user generated content," he added. "It will accelerate how innovators and creators in entertainment are building and delivering experiences rooted in self expression, content creation, curation and instant gratification–the kind of entertainment that today's players and fans deeply crave."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said that when EA's biggest franchises have been "supercharged by AI," the company will be able to cultivate massive online communities, tell compelling stories, and harness player power "beyond the bounds" of video games. Admittedly, that doesn't sound too different from what many studios are already doing.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="EA ponders a generative AI future where players and developers form 'symbiotic relationship'">EA ponders a generative AI future where players and developers form 'symbiotic relationship'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA Entertainment and Technology president Laura Miele was singing from the same hymn sheet. Taking over from Wilson, she explained EA is in the middle of a multi-year effort to centralize decades of 3D data and assets to bolster its development teams and Frostbite game engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She said that "Smithsonian" scale library has allowed EA to train its machine learning and large language models with its own proprietary data. Those models can then be used by internal teams like the Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division (SEED), which Miele described as an "innovation lab."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SEED is currently focused on areas such as "AI-enabled game development, generative arts, and procedural content," including a tool called "Script to Scene" capable of aggregating multiple workflows to help devs build characters, direct performances, and craft worlds using text or voice inputs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She explained EA teams could use the tool to instantly generate a "four storey Parisian apartment building," before requesting tweaks with additional prompts such as "add more floors to the building" (as shown below). Miele said the tech could be deployed to create entire neighbourhoods, cities, and "eventually worlds."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a later portion of the presentation, EA chief strategy officer Mihir Vaidya grabbed the baton and said EA envisions handing tools like 'Script to Scene' over to players so they can "convert their imaginations into creations without coding expertise."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He went on to clarify that "Imagination to Creation" won't enable players to create and release and support entire video games (at least, not at first), but will rather allow them to build robust user-generated experiences (UGX).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Debuting a brief concept video that stitched together some of EA's more "exciting experiments", Vaidya showed how the company's AI tools could be deployed to create impossible, previously incomprehensible realities like a "game made out of cardboard boxes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Make a maze of cardboard boxes," says a disembodied player voice during the demo video. That prompt resulted in the creation of simple level made from everybody's favourite shipping material.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Disappointed with their original cardboard labyrinth, the nameless players then ask their AI enabler to make the level "more complex" and "multi-level." The below image is what EA imagines its 'Imagination to Creation' toolkit might then churn out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The video ends with two players engaging in a custom 1v1 deathmatch where only grenades are lethal. Both players were shown choosing between weapons and characters from existing EA franchises like Battlefield and Apex Legends, suggesting EA views its 'Imagination to Creation" toolkit as an open sandbox filled with remixable gameplay systems, assets, and logic from its biggest series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vaidya said EA wants players to be able to use that triple-A content as a "foundation" for those UGX experiences, perhaps eventually turning those creations into "chart-topping IPs."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This would create a new level of symbiotic relationship between our own developers and UGX creators, and one with our own IPs being the launchpads for new experiences and businesses," he added.&nbsp;We'll let you decide whether that's a positive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://eainvestorday2024.q4ir.com/home/default.aspx">You can watch EA's full investor day presentation right here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>EA has officially announced a film adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> is in the works and aims for it to have an impact like the Barbie film.</p>
<p>The film will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/barbies-margot-robbie-to-produce-the-sims-movie-adaptation">produced by Barbie actress Margot Robbie's production company LuckyChap</a>, with Loki director Kate Herron at the helm.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/the-sims-movie-plot-details-amazon-ea-margot-robbie-1236142126/">Variety</a>, EA's vice president and general manager of The Sims Kate Gorman discussed the company's plans for the film and the inclusion of fan-favourite Easter Eggs.</p>

<p>"What I will tell you is it's very much rooted in The Sims universe," said Gorman. "And what we want is to have a truly authentic Sims experience brought to a theatrical release. So what you'll see from us is that we have been wanting to get this right. We wanted the right partners and to make an impact the size of something like a Barbie movie is exactly what we want.</p>
<p>"And we know there's so much love and nostalgia, probably beyond what we would even realise, for The Sims and so many people like us have played throughout generations. So we want this to be an experience that reflects all that amazing history and play of so many people in this world, but also is something that you can share across generations and to be part of pop culture and culturally relevant."</p>
<p>Gorman has promised an "authentic Sims experience" that will see its universe "come to life" with "classic experiences".</p>
<p>"There will be Freezer Bunnies," Gorman confirmed. "I'm sure a pool without a ladder is somewhere in there, but we haven't finalised any of those details. But that's the idea, is to say that it lives within this space. It's a nod to all of the amazing play and creation and fun that people have had over the last 25 years within The Sims."</p>
<p>Freezer Bunnies, for those who haven't played The Sims, have recurred in the games since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a> as cute toys spotted in freezers, toy boxes and more.</p>
<p>Herron not only directed the first season of Disney+ series Loki, but wrote a script for an episode of Doctor Who and will be directing episodes of HBO's The Last of Us season two.</p>
<p>Yesterday, EA shared a blog post explaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">the future of The Sims</a>. The company confirmed it's not working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> and is instead moving "beyond linear, sequential Sims releases".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered has been rated by the ESRB for the PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<p>The rating comes following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-pre-order-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> and rumours suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation will have a State of Play</a> coming by the end of the month.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB rating</a> summary reads, “This is an action/role-playing game in which players assume the role of a hunter (Aloy) surviving through a post-apocalyptic world. Players guide Aloy as she learns to hunt robotic creatures and animals in the wild. Aloy uses arrows, spears, and explosive traps to injure and kill machines, boar, and occasional human enemies. Animals and humans emit small puffs of red blood when struck; one sequence depicts an abandoned camp with large blood stains on rocks and trees. The game contains a brief reference to sexual material (e.g., “Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?”). In text/audio files, characters sometimes reference fictional drugs, overdoses, and getting high: “…not even out of junior high and already a drug addict”; “…I ran across a pusher who was selling Razorwing for eight bucks a tab”; “I’d spend a few days getting high, then OD on Overcast.” The word “sh*t” appears in the text/dialogue.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear when PlayStation could announce Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, but the rating suggests it’s likely very soon and could be used to show off the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro features</a>.</p>



<p>Horizon Zero Dawn was first released in 2017 and, as of April 2023, has sold over 24.3 million units. On Metacritic, the game received an 89/100 for the PlayStation 4.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered has been <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/">rated by the ESRB</a>, listing PC and PlayStation 5 as its platforms.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-playstation-5-remaster-reportedly-in-the-works">remaster of Guerrilla's first Horizon game was rumoured</a> back in 2022, but is yet to be officially announced by Sony.</p>
<p>This rating brings fresh credibility to the remaster's existence, though no indication of a release date has been provided. Could this be some sort of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-700-ps5-pro-is-an-argument-against-pro-consoles-altogether">PS5 Pro</a> launch title?</p>

</figure>
<p>The game is already playable on PS5 via backwards compatibility, but there's no native version available. It's also already out on PC (since 2020), but again this is based on the PS4 version.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn was released on PS4 in 2017. A remaster for PS5 would presumably bring the game in-line with its sequel, Forbidden West, which released across both platforms in 2022.</p>
<p>Zero Dawn was previously available on PS Plus, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-is-pulling-its-own-blockbuster-game-from-ps-plus">being removed from Sony's subscription service earlier this year</a>. That's added speculation towards this remaster.</p>
<p>Specifically, it was the Complete Edition including the game's The Frozen Wilds DLC that was available.</p>
<p>Notably, the rating is for PC as well as PS5, following in the footsteps of remasters like The Last of Us Part 2 and Marvel's Spider-Man. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-release-date-time">God of War Ragnarök is also heading to PC this week</a>.</p>
<p>Despite Sony releasing more of its games on PC in recent years, joint CEO Hideaki Nishino stated earlier this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/consoles-to-remain-the-core-of-playstations-business-ceo-says">consoles would remain at the "core" of Sony's business</a>.</p>
<p>"I think that with mobile devices, there are many games that show advertisements, and PCs are difficult to set up, but with PlayStation, once you turn it on, you can experience the content you bought straight away," said Nishino.</p>
<p>Later this year, the Horizon series will continue with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-is-a-perfect-match-a-breezy-light-hearted-approach-the-series-has-perhaps-always-needed">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, turning Aloy and her robotic dinosaur enemies into bricks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is real. We haven't got an official announcement from Sony and Guerrilla Games yet, but the ESRB has already <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> the game for PlayStation 5 and PC, hinting at an imminent release:</p>
<p><em>This is an action/role-playing game in which players assume the role of a hunter (Aloy) surviving through a post-apocalyptic world. Players guide Aloy as she learns to hunt robotic creatures and animals in the wild. Aloy uses arrows, spears, and explosive traps to injure and kill machines, boar, and occasional human enemies. Animals and humans emit small puffs of red blood when struck; one sequence depicts an abandoned camp with large blood stains on rocks and trees. The game contains a brief reference to sexual material (e.g., “Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?”). In text/audio files, characters sometimes reference fictional drugs, overdoses, and getting high: “...not even out of junior high and already a drug addict”; “...I ran across a pusher who was selling Razorwing for eight bucks a tab”; "I'd spend a few days getting high, then OD on Overcast." The word “sh*t” appears in the text/dialogue.</em></p>
<p>We first <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-horizon-zero-dawn-playstation-5-remake-is-in-the-works-alongside-a-multiplayer-game-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> about Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered in October 2022, when two different sources suggested that the 2017 game would return with an improved lighting system, overhauled textures, improved animations, and new character models. Additionally, the new version of the game is believed to include the many accessibility options introduced in Horizon Forbidden West, multiple display modes, and various quality-of-life improvements. That rumor mentioned a 'remake', but that would have been very weird, as the game is so recent that a remake didn't make sense at all.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm not so sure even a remaster does, especially since Horizon Zero Dawn is also available on PC and was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-forbidden-west-delayed-2022-horizon-zero-dawn-60fps-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced</a> for PlayStation 5 with a patch. We'll have to wait for the official details to understand whether this new version is worth buying.</p>
<p>Later this year, fans can look forward to the spin-off game <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-reportedly-launching-on-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a>. On the other hand, the Netflix TV show was reportedly put on hold due to allegations against showrunner Steve Blackman.</p>

            <p>What are you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lymbus">LYMBUS</a>? In what vat were you grown? I feel like I’ve sluggishly ambled my way down to the fridge and tried to scoop a gherkin from the jar, only to find a disconcertingly tasty sliver of my own brain - like a creature from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland">Flatland</a> trying to play 4D chess, and all the pieces are just tiny carvings of my face with “lol get a load of this prick” whittled into the forehead. I quite like it.</p>
<p>“We combined your favorite genres into one grotesque piece of software! You're welcome, game journalists,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3190880/LYMBUS_Incomplete_Edition/">Steam page</a> for the demo. That is a very polite way to kick me in the head and call me a bitch, LYMBUS.</p>

<p>Right, let’s give this a go. LYMBUS: Incomplete Edition, as the demo is called, is from Happy Accident Studios. Earlier this year, they put out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815800/Anomalytics_From_the_Files_of_the_Arcane_Statistics_Authority/">Anomalytics</a>, which is partly billed as a boomer shooter but also arms you with a calculator. LYMBUS itself is a roguelike bullet hell where you need to play cards to do anything except move. The cards, which cost a real-time replenishing resource to play, let you do things like shoot, slash, parry, dodge, and shoot again but bullet-ier. Cards get burned on use, but you can find more by passing over tiles scattered around.</p>
<p>The tricksiness comes in the fact you’ll need to ready cards by switching between them, while also scrambling around like a terrified little wombat avoiding a lawnmower made of guns. Here’s the setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>The year is 19XX. Great strides in neuromechanical research have allowed the most common human actions to be transcribed onto memory cards. Great oversights in said research have also made it so nobody remembered to save a backup. After a catastrophic crash renders most of the population comatose, you are tasked with diving into humanity's collective unconscious to retrieve the memories that may hold the key to ending the blackout.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where are you in all this? You are here:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/LYMBUS-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Happy Accident Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thanks for that. Here's some more info:</p>
<blockquote><p>Move around with your keyboard. Do everything else with your cards. In LYMBUS, exercise maximum strategy in building your deck, then throw that strategy out the window in screen-shaking, bullet hell-style battles. Combat happens in real time with no turns or slowdowns, meaning resources are tight and every moment matters.</p></blockquote>
<p>LYMBUS is out later this year. Don't let it bully you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-support-confirmed-for-horror-game-retrieval/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of the PS5 Pro, Sony confirmed thirteen games that will be optimized for the new console: Alan Wake 2, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Demon’s Souls, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Gran Turismo 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Horizon Forbidden West, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, The Crew Motorfest, The First Descendant, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only a preliminary list, and many more will be confirmed throughout the coming weeks. One more can already be added to the list: it's the upcoming horror game Retrieval. Originally announced at Gamescom 2023, the game received a new trailer at Gamescom 2024. At the same time, it was added to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2999120/Retrieval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation</a> stores for wishlisting and quickly passed the milestone of 20K users adding the game to their wishlists.</p>
<p>Following the reveal of the PS5 Pro, Barcelona-based developer 333Studios confirmed some of the improvements players will see when playing the game on the more powerful console.</p>
<p><em>While Retrieval will look stunning on the PS5, the PS5 Pro version will offer even better visuals and smoother gameplay. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect:</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Improved Graphics:</strong> Expect sharper resolution with the newly announced PSSR technology, more detailed environments, and higher fidelity ray-traced reflections.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Higher Frame Rates:</strong> The PS5 Pro will push Retrieval to run at higher, more stable frame rates, ensuring smoother gameplay and more responsive controls.</em></p>
<p>The studio even provided a preliminary screenshot comparison between the base PS5 and the PlayStation 5 Pro version.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/retrieval-ps5pro-2-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Retrieval is set on a distant planet where protagonist Hana Loshe gets stranded in a subway base, uncovering all sorts of secrets and terrifying creatures within. The Dead Space inspiration seems pretty clear. The Gamescom 2024 trailer (embedded below) showed off NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination tech, which will likely only be available on PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Retrieval - Official 2024 Gamescom Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZ2NXIEu1JE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The full game is also expected to launch on Xbox Series S|X consoles. There's no release date yet, but we'll let you know when that changes.</p>

            <p>It's been long suspected (if not officially confirmed) that the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> will be getting a PC remaster some time in the near future. We've already seen a description for the PC version <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-store-lists-red-dead-redemption-as-now-on-pc-for-the-first-time-ever">appear briefly</a> on the PlayStation store (of all places). And earlier this year a snoopy fan of the studio who monitors the backend of Rockstar's launcher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-red-dead-redemption-could-finally-be-coming-to-pc-and-soon-according-to-a-fresh-datamine">found similar game descriptions</a> buried amid metadata. Yesterday, that same practice yielded yet another clue - the game's Steam app number.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The tidbit comes from Xitter user <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1836029927751032876">"TezFunz2"</a>, who has committed to a kind of cyber stakeout of Rockstar's online properties. The Steam app number in itself is not much information. You can view and track the game now <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2668510/">via Steamdb</a>, if you're so inclined. But it won't show any real info until the store page is actually live (in theory, anyway). Even so, it counts as another step towards the 2010 open world western finally hitting PC. We already know from the PlayStation store leak that the port will include "PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions and framerates." </p>
<p>There was a brief moment when it looked like the rootin' tootin' remaster <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-and-gta4-remasters-reportedly-scrapped-after-gta-trilogy-debacle">would be shelved</a>, following the lacklustre release of the remastered GTA Trilogy, which came out horrendously buggy and visually garbled (it even had to be briefly taken down from sale to remove unlicensed music). But it seems like work is resuming on it after all.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that a developer can add apps to Steam as unnamed items long before release. So this doesn't necessarily mean the remaster will be out soon. But a year has now passed since similar ports were released for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. And 14 years since the game's first appearance on PS3. Maybe that's enough time to get a PC version sorted?</p>
<p>Anyway, yes. Leaks are fun. The PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2 was itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-2-existence-on-pc-possibly-leaked-via-linkedin">leaked on LinkedIn</a> back in 2018 (more like LEAKEDIn, amirite?). </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> studio Arrowhead <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">thrust a white flag out</a> from their shelled position in an attempt to placate mutinous fans of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op </a>shooter. In response to a community sentiment best summed up by a popular Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ep9bq9/let_the_bots_advance_let_the_super_earth_burn/">post titled</a> “Let the super earth burn”, Arrowhead released <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/">a statement</a>. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update…what matters most now is action. Not talk.” Said action (which, it must be pointed out, felt a bit troublingly reactive to the loudest and most histrionic voices in the roo..uh, subreddit) was foreshadowed in a list of issues to be tackled over the coming months.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That list's gist, if you missed the list, was a promise to fix “our approach to balance. Our intention is that balance should be fun, not “balanced” for the sake of balance." Yesterday, Patch 1.001.100 dropped, accompanied by a video that I can only describe, in a professional capacity, as long as fuck. </p> <figure>

<p>In case you have better things to do with the next 35 minutes, here’s a summary of the patch notes, the full list of which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/7147864422081646859">find here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Major Overhaul of Anti-Tank, Armor Penetration, Health and Armor Values</p></li>
<li><p>Weapon &amp; Stratagem Balancing</p></li>
<li><p>Enemy Reworks</p></li>
<li><p>Helldiver Health and Damage Mechanics Tweaks</p></li>
<li><p>Gas Gameplay Mechanic Rework</p></li>
<li><p>New Galactic War feature</p></li>
<li><p>Emote Wheel feature</p></li>
<li><p>Crash &amp; Bug Fixes</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Thank you for your valuable feedback. Many players have expressed feeling constrained in how they approach challenges, often relying on a limited set of tools while other options seem less effective,” reads the blog. “To address this, we've reworked armor penetration, anti-tank weapons, enemy armor and health values."</p>
<p>"Our goal is to improve the effectiveness of weapons such as the Autocannon, Heavy Machine Gun, Flamethrower, and Anti-Materiel Rifle against heavily armored enemies," it continues. "Although they may not be as effective as specialized anti-tank weapons, they are now more viable choices making your loadouts more versatile, fostering better team collaboration and planning.”</p>
<p>It’s a hefty list in all, and Arrowhead say they aren’t done yet - they “plan to conduct another balance pass by Day 60 of our commitment”. The general gist of these changes seems to be that players are now more powerful, and the bugs, especially, are less oppressive. As noticed by cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer, the game’s director agrees that a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-creative-director-agrees-helldivers-2-needs-a-harder-difficulty-mode-after-the-buff-everything-patch/">harder difficulty is now needed.</a> Truly, the real sisyphean eterna-war was the constant rush to try and please the entire fanbase, all the time, along the way.</p>
<p>Arrowhead have also been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sightings-of-helldivers-2-illuminate-faction-on-galactic-war-map-are-fake-news-says-arrowhead-boss">not-teasing the game's third faction</a> recently. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Freedom Wars will no longer be a PS Vita exclusive, with Bandai Namco announcing that it is releasing Freedom Wars Remastered for PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC via Steam. Freedom Wars was originally released for the PS Vita in 2014. The remastered version brings with it support for 4K visuals and 60fps, adjusted difficulty options, gameplay balances, and new updates to weapon crafting and upgrading.</p>
<p><iframe title="FREEDOM WARS REMASTERED — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/feD7epA4CBk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Freedom Wars is set in the fictional world of Panopticon where your character has been sentenced to a one million year prison sentence, and the only way to reduce that sentence is to serve the state. That is done through fighting the enemies of Panopticon out in the wasteland, where the action is mixed between attacking with melee and range weapons, as well as using the Thorn grappling hook to get in close. When not in battle, players return to prison where they have to follow the rules or be pulled up on infractions. Behave and you are given additional liberties to help cope with your prison sentence. You will also meet a range of characters, and it is from this pool you can select who will venture into battle with you.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/10/freedom-wars-review/">Freedom Wars Review</a></h2>
<p>In our review for the original Freedom Wars release, Jim said, <em>“Freedom Wars is far from being the Vita flagship fans were hoping for. Though it makes a sound first impression it’s ultimately held back by a forced narrative and gameplay segments that fall by the wayside. Thanks to its unique tone and approach to gameplay, Freedom Wars manages to distance itself from Monster Hunter, yet it’s difficult not to compare the two. After all, Capcom’s power-selling franchise didn’t just popularise the genre, it single-handedly created it. Though Freedom Wars’ appeal is limited, there will doubtlessly be many who find themselves hooked. For them, the game has a lot to offer, even beyond the limitless hours of content thanks to a suite of online features. Those who aren’t willing to put in the time, however, may find themselves short-changed.”</em></p>

<p>Freedom Wars Remastered will be released on January 10th, 2025.</p>

<p>Netflix has issued an update on The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, the upcoming feature-length anime starring Doug Cockle reprising his role as Geralt of Rivia. It was confirmed that the animated feature will be released on Netflix on February 11, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s a canonical injection of content that lands between the fifth and sixth episodes of the first season of the Netflix live-action adaptation. To that end, both Anya Chalotra and Joey Batey return to play the roles of Yennefer and Jaskier — but Henry Cavill, who previously played Geralt of Rivia in the Netflix series, is long gone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cockle-is-back">Cockle is Back</h2>



<p>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep marks a return to the franchise for Doug Cockle after almost a decade. The iconic voice actor was more than happy to step back into the role of Geralt of Rivia after recently admitting that he’d gladly represent the famed monster hunter forever if he could.</p>



<p>Sirens of the Deep will see Geralt take on a contract involving ‘merpeople’ in a seaside village. It’s a story pulled from A Little Sacrifice, a shorter Witcher text from Andrzej Sapkowski, the creator of The Witcher. In the story, Geralt will become intertwined in a conflict that eventually pulls in other characters from in and around The Witcher’s wider universe.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>At 1 hour and 29 minutes, Sirens of the Deep is the longest adaptation of The Witcher to make it to screens. As CD Projekt continues to work on the next Witcher game, fans of the franchise can use productions like this to ‘plug the gap’. It’ll likely be a few years before we see the next Witcher game surface, even if it is the chief focus of the team right now.</p>



<p>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep will be released worldwide on Netflix on February 11, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-game-is-absolutely-not-dying%E2%80%99-ubisoft-on-xdefiant%E2%80%99s-year-one-roadmap.984027/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has published a sizeable roadmap that covers XDefiant’s first year on the market, outlining the next three seasons of content. In a blog post, the team highlighted the key development focuses going forward, including ‘bandwidth reduction efforts’ and improvements to XDefiant’s netcode and ‘hitreg’.</p>



<p>In the relatively transparent blog post, the team stated quite clearly that ‘<strong>the game is absolutely not dying</strong>‘, addressing recent community-driven concerns that XDefiant is already on shaky ground mere months after release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-it-kind-of-is">But It Kind of Is</h2>



<p>When it was released in May, XDefiant soared up the charts, quickly becoming regarded as the first Ubisoft title to hit substantial milestones as rapidly as it did. As a free-to-play, multiplatform shooter, it was essentially guaranteed that XDefiant would do well at launch, but the numbers quickly paled as gamers moved on to bigger and better things.</p>



<p>Today, the player count is wavering, the sentiment around the game has faded, and viewership on social and streaming platforms is slim to nothing.</p>



<p>But Ubisoft is determined to keep the game afloat, despite recent claims that it has a brief window to turn things around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">before the game enters dangerous territory</a>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-au/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> written by Mark Rubin on the Year-One Roadmap, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I just want to quickly address the status of the game. i.e. is the game dying? No, the game is absolutely not dying. We know there are things we need to improve like Netcode/Hitreg and adding more content to progression, but the game is doing well. We just want it to do better. </p>



<p>And we do that by addressing the concerns of our community which has always been the plan. Ubisoft is very much behind us and has allocated more resources to the team in order for us to do that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Today, the team will reveal what’s coming in season two of XDefiant, but until then, users can leaf through the graphic provided by Ubisoft for the road ahead:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The driving focus of the team right now is stabilising the game’s networking elements, which have long been a sticking point for players worldwide. Plenty of content sits on the horizon, and the folks at Ubisoft are still determined to produce an esports ecosystem for XDefiant, but will there be enough players to keep the game afloat until then?</p>

<p>Routledge has announced the impending release of ‘Handbook of Esports’, a comprehensive and gargantuan deep-dive title into the full breadth of the esports industry. This monster of a handbook is marked as being ‘the first fully comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of esports’, and it’s designed to give even the most uninformed readers the full scope of the wider market.</p>



<p>It’s available to pre-order now with Routledge and will be released on September 24.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-learn-everything-about-esports">Learn Everything About Esports</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Handbook-of-Esports/Jenny-Besombes-Brock-Cote-Scholz/p/book/9781032531502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Routledge Handbook of Esports</a> is a hefty title, numbering 764 pages and 62 chapters, and featuring contributions from almost 100 industry experts and academics.

<p>If you were looking for the most comprehensive breakdown of the entire esports industry, you’ll be hitting the mark with this handbook, though.</p>

<p>On September 16, Electronic Arts revealed details about the next Battlefield game, along with a single shot of concept art that refused to reveal the game’s <strong>real name</strong>. We’re still working with the assumption that it’ll be called ‘Battlefield 6’, but hopefully there’s room there for something more creative to surface.</p>



<p>Following the art drop, eagle-eyed fans compared the concept art with real-world locations, eager to figure out which country was depicted in the shot.</p>



<p>And then Insider Gaming confirmed where it’s located.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-purely-conceptual">Purely Conceptual</h2>



<p>Respawn Entertainment’s Vince Zampella addressed the next generation of Battlefield recently, outlining a few core details about the game. He mentioned that it’s a ‘return to classic Battlefield’ with 64-player maps and a resurgence of the class-driven multiplayer system. </p>



<p>He also stressed that the team is looking at a 2025 release window, but whether it makes that is another question entirely.</p>



<p>Along with the information came a concept shot, which showcased an urban environment under siege, with a forest ablaze, choppers in the air, and explosions erupting in the distance. Fans were quick to question where the concept art is located, even if the driving topic was whether or not AI was used to create the image.</p>



<p>Based on map and image comparisons, it was determined that the concept art is set in <strong>Gibraltar</strong>, the minuscule British territory located between Spain and Africa.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson corroborated those assumptions:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not the first time Gibraltar has surfaced in a Battlefield game. Historically, the region appeared in Battlefield 2142 as an area under contention between PAC and EU forces. Other users were quick to point out the geographical importance of Gibraltar, further highlighting how it fits nicely into a Battlefield concept.</p>



<p>Are you excited about Battlefield 6 potentially being the best game we’ve had from the series in <strong>years</strong>? Let us know on the Insider Gaming Forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-hands-on-preserving-the-vita-classic-as-you-remember-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ah yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/freedom-wars">Freedom Wars</a>, the seemingly last bastion of the PlayStation Vita, is finally <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-announced-vita-steam-switch-ps5-ps4">moving onwards from Sony’s retired handheld</a>. With the help of Bandai Namco, developer Dimps (partially made up of members from the original Freedom Wars development team) is bringing the Monster Hunter-style action-RPG to modern platforms. It became a hit as a Vita exclusive in 2014 for its unique persistent world mechanics and dystopian sci-fi premise that made it more than just something that played off its influences. And I can tell you first-hand that there’s a certain excitement to Freedom Wars Remastered since it’s as true to the original release as you could possibly expect.</p><p>I had the chance to get roughly four hours of hands-on time with a preview build of Freedom Wars Remastered on PlayStation 5. After spending about an hour with the tutorial to shake off the decade of rust, I jumped back into high-level operations. In the following three hours, I cleared several instanced missions hunting massive monster-like machines and rescuing civilians from their clutches – and unwittingly tacked on extra years to my prison sentence by acting a fool back in the Panopticon you call home.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Freedom Wars Remastered - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If you’re not familiar with Freedom Wars, or need a refresher since it’s been quite some time, it takes place in a dystopia set in the far future where the surviving population fights over limited resources. People are either wardens running a Panopticon or prisoners (aka Sinners) stuck in indentured servitude and forced to fight for “a greater good.” You play as a Sinner, and by taking on operations and contributing resources to your Panopticon, you shave years off your…1,000,000-year prison sentence. Aside from sending yourself to instanced hunts, there is a story that develops as you get deeper in operations and learn more about fellow Sinners on your prison block. </p><p>You’re also under constant surveillance by an android companion, called an Accessory, who applies disciplinary action, and you earn little bits of freedom as you clear more missions. Something worth noting here is that the remaster features expanded voice acting and English audio – that includes the androids, which has been done oddly. Android characters are voiced through a primitive text-to-speech style modulator that clearly mispronounces words; it’s said to be intentional to add to the creepy dystopian vibe, but it comes off rather tacky. Overall, it’s a dark premise, for sure, but it’s satirical in a way that has only gotten more bleak as time goes on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Everything that made the original a Vita classic either remains intact or has been touched up to mitigate frustrations,</p></div><p>I talked to Takashi Tsukamoto, the original director and now producer for the remaster, and Tetsunosuke Seki, the director for the remaster, and they reflected on the commentary of Freedom Wars. Tsukamoto saw new developments in Japan as inspiration for the dystopian vision of Freedom Wars’ story, saying, “When the original version came out 10 years ago, there was a thing called My Number in Japan, similar to the US with social security numbers. This was a very new concept in Japan 10 years ago. Citizens of Japan didn't have a social security equivalent and since it was a brand new idea coming up, there were a lot of people who were against it. Like, don't put a number on us. I guess living in a first-world country like Japan, they always have your information on hand. You're on file. It's kind of like you're being in constant surveillance. When you're walking around the city, there's cameras everywhere. There's a little bit of a parallel between that and this game. Obviously, we're not in a prison, but the idea of being in constant surveillance and people having our information was a very strong concept we wanted to work with when creating this game. In the game these people are prisoners with million-year sentences, it’s not a one-to-one, obviously. I mean, I hope I'm not a prisoner!”</p><p>The story and premise remain intact in the remaster, exactly as it was in the 2014 release, and that faithfulness extends to the gameplay mechanics, for better and worse. Aside from the control scheme being updated to make sense for modern gamepads, the gameplay is pretty much one-to-one as I remember it. Lock-on targeting, third-person shooting, melee combos, the Thorn system, all of that is unchanged – so if you thought it was janky back then, you’ll definitely find it janky now. Don’t come in expecting it to be streamlined or revamped to feel like a new release. However, there’s a novelty to the way Freedom Wars experimented with unique mechanics and brought it all together in a fully fledged action-RPG on Vita.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While every character has a melee weapon for basic light and/or heavy attack combos and a firearm to take shots from a distance, it’s the Thorns that made Freedom Wars standout. Thorns are akin to hookshots or Spider-Man’s webs – you can attach these to enemies to slam them on the ground or zip right onto them to get in melee range. It’s also the key to traversal, letting you reach high-up places or quickly dart around the battlefield to stay nimble. Considering it’s a little sticky since it remains unchanged, it still works really well as an intuitive gameplay mechanic and a premier feature that made Freedom Wars a ton of fun to begin with.</p><p>There’s still a thrill to attaching your Thorn to a specific part of a beastly machine, frantically mashing the circle button to pull it to the ground, leaving it staggered and vulnerable to melee combos. And it’s also a novelty to use your Thorn to pull yourself toward a towering robot to mount it and sever one of its limbs before backflipping off to avoid getting tossed down, not unlike the rush we all got that same year scurrying up the backs of the Titans in Titanfall. Thorns serve other functions as a means for utility on the battlefield, like setting up traps, throwing out area-of-effect heals for your party, or casting powerful shields. It’s not terribly complex, but there’s beauty in its simplicity, and I still got a kick out of it while playing the remaster.</p><p>It remains my favorite thing in Freedom Wars – using my Thorn to latch onto the pod of an Abductor to rip out the hostage it's captured, and jumping off of it with the hostage in your arms before dashing back to safety. Not only are you caught in the fray of your party fighting this huge robot, but you’re risking heavy damage if you can’t execute it swiftly enough. And man, it feels good to get away with it scot-free.</p><p>Because this is a faithful remake, I found the structure of operations – the instanced missions that mainly drive the gameplay loop – to be somewhat repetitive. Even at Code 4 operations, which are several hours deep into the story, many of the maps and enemy types are reused. Different missions pop up to add variety, such as hostage rescues, wave-based encounters, or straight-up brawls of attrition against hulking damage sponges that’ll take 10 to 15 minutes to conquer. However, it tends to fall into a routine after long sessions; not that it’s absolved of its shortcomings that were apparent back in 2014, but the repetition was better suited as a handheld game played in shorter bursts.</p><p>Freedom Wars doesn’t necessarily evolve fundamentally as it goes on, and from what I can recall from my time on the Vita version and now with the remaster, you settle into a playstyle and stick with it throughout. You’re still upgrading weapons with the materials you gather and earning new ones from mission to mission. There’s a decent amount of weapon types to mess around with before settling on what works for you – personally, I loved the chainsaw sword for chunky melee damage and the burst-shot rifle that could melt fodder from a distance. The one quality-of-life change worth noting here is that weapon crafting and upgrades are streamlined to take the old randomized aspects out of the process. This aligns with crafting systems seen in modern games, and this was a deliberate decision according to Tsukamoto and Seki.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a dark premise, for sure, but it’s satirical in a way that has only gotten more bleak as time goes on.</p></div><p>The biggest idea behind Freedom Wars was the persistent world aspect of Panopticons. Players would sign onto their own Panopticons based on region and the missions they take on would all contribute to its status, and you would be ranked against rival Panopticons in perpetuity, as if it was this ongoing multiplayer competition without having to do direct PvP. That remains intact with the remaster. Traditional multiplayer and co-op was a major part of the original Freedom Wars, though, and it’s also being preserved. Although I didn’t get to try it out, Tsukamoto and Seki both said that matchmaking has been revamped to reflect that of modern games, which will be a vast improvement over the original’s system.</p><p>Part of me sees Freedom Wars Remastered more as a novelty – a Vita classic that is now at least playable on modern platforms with its most important parts unsullied, for better or worse. It’s fundamentally the 2014 game with some quality-of-life necessities. It was a perfect fit for Sony’s last handheld, and a blast to sink hours into, competing with other Panopticons across your region and reducing your prison sentence in futility. I’m not sure if it’s going to hit the same way it did 10 years ago, but I do believe this is a big win for preservation, making a cult classic much more accessible in a faithful form. Freedom Wars was experimental for its time, and it tried new ideas that are great to see holding up relatively well – even just constantly adding years to your sentence for minor infractions as you roam your prison block was an annoying but good goof that fed into the game’s overall themes.</p><p>Novelty or not, both Seki and Tsukamoto stated that remastering the original game is the necessary first step in hopes of revitalizing the series. Tsukamoto said, “We’ve been wanting to create something like this for a long time, but we really didn't have the opportunity. As Dimps [the development team], we’ve been looking for opportunities to release <em>something</em>, maybe a sequel – something related to Freedom Wars. However, it was very difficult to set up a team and nothing was really lining up. At some point, we said maybe a remastered version of the original would be good.” As for why it made sense now to revisit the series, he continued, “The opportunity never really presented itself until now. We were able to come to an agreement with Sony regarding the license and they were able to partner up with Bandai Namco, and it just so happens that it’s about 10 years later that all of it started coming to fruition.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/17/vlcscreenshot2024-09-17-15h14m37s295-1726611590880.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>I followed up by asking about how they’ll define success for the remaster and how a sequel would factor into their plans in the future. Tsukamoto said, “What success would look like is for this game to do well, and well enough that we could take the next step into potentially releasing a sequel.” He continued by saying, “As much as we’d like to share it with you, we don't know if there's going to be a sequel yet of course, but if there is a sequel, we have tons of ideas we’d want to implement into said sequel.”</p><p>It’s pretty wild to see a Vita game remastered with many of its assets true to what they looked like in original form. On PlayStation 5, Freedom Wars Remastered runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, which is really nice, although it does create a sort of uncanny valley effect when the character models, animations, and environments haven’t gotten a makeover. I also played a bit of the Nintendo Switch version in handheld mode and though it’s considerably lower resolution and only ran at 30 fps – it’s still very much playable, but it’s a bit disappointing to see a former Vita game struggle on Switch. While it’s definitely not a technical marvel by any measure, everything that made the original a Vita classic either remains intact or has been touched up to mitigate frustrations not present in modern games. </p><p>You’ll be able to start serving and working time off of your 1,000,000-year sentence when Freedom Wars Remastered launches on January 10, 2025 for PlayStation 4 and 5, PC via Steam, and Nintendo Switch.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bandai Namco announced today that Freedom Wars will be getting a remastered version on modern platforms, bringing with it 4K resolution, 60fps support, and other enhancements.</p><p>First released on Vita back in 2014, Freedom Wars is a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/freedom-wars-review">dystopian third-person multiplayer action game similar to Monster Hunter</a> that supports up to eight players. It was originally developed by the now-defunct Japan Studio, which was merged into Team Asobi in 2021. Freedom Wars' servers were turned off that same year. The remastered version is being developed by Dimps Corporation, which was able to gain permission from Sony to use the license.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Despite Freedom Wars' status as a niche favorite, it was able to develop a cult following and earn a spot on our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/26/igns-top-25-playstation-vita-games">list of the 25 best Vita games</a>. </p><p>"Freedom Wars' emphasis on fighting, looting, and upgrading creates an addictive gameplay loop for Vita owners. It certainly isn't the only Monster Hunter clone available on Vita, but it’s perhaps its most successful one," we wrote at the time. "The staying power of its addictive fight-loot-upgrade cycle is enhanced by deep gameplay, customization options, and a really interesting online component made it one of our favorite portable releases of 2014."</p><p>In addition to graphical enhancements, Freedom Wars Remastered will feature an overhauled weapon crafting system and additional difficulty settings, among other additions. Nevertheless, we wrote in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-hands-on-preserving-the-vita-classic-as-you-remember-it">our hands-on preview</a> that it feels similar to how it was 10 years ago.</p><p>"Part of me sees Freedom Wars Remastered more as a novelty – a Vita classic that is now at least playable on modern platforms with its most important parts unsullied, for better or worse. It’s fundamentally the 2014 game with some quality-of-life necessities," our previewer Michael Higham wrote. "It was a perfect fit for Sony’s last handheld, and a blast to sink hours into, competing with other Panopticons across your region and reducing your prison sentence in futility.

Tussle with terrific twins Billy and Jimmy Lee as they team up with Zitz, Rash and Pimple to defend the Earth against the combined might of the Dark Queen and the Shadow Boss! Leap from the Battlecopter onto the tail of the Colossus spaceship and fight your way through beastly baddies and lethal objects using the Battletoads’ arsenal of Smash Hits or the Dragons’ array of Dragon Force Techniques – each provides incredible attacking combos, including kicks, punches, throws and more! You’ll also put your driving skills to the test with the Speeder Bike and high-speed Space Pod. How will this struggle for Earth’s future end?</li><li><strong><em>Big Run</em></strong> – Race across the vast landscape of Africa—from Tripoli to Dakar—over the course of nine stages in this <a title="Genres > Racing [205 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> game originally released for the Super Famicom system in 1991. This monumental task isn’t only about putting pedal to the metal, though! First, you’ll need to select a sponsor and then use those funds to hire staff. Next, you’ll need some spare parts to replace tires and engines when they get damaged or worn out. The glory of victory awaits if you can combine precise tactics and bold driving to weather the brutal driving conditions that stand between you and your goal.</li><li><strong><em>Cosmo Gang the Puzzle</em></strong> – The Cosmo Gang take on falling-block-style puzzles across three modes in this 1993 <a title="Genres > Action [2,162 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-puzzle game that was originally for Super Famicom. Focus on clearing blocks to get the high score in 1P Mode, play competitive battles in VS Mode and put yourself to the test in 100 Stage Mode, where you can solve stage after stage of strategic challenges. In each of the modes, progress is made by removing containers and Cosmos that fall from the top of the screen. You can remove the containers by lining six up in a horizontal row—and Cosmos are removed when they touch the blue orbs that occasionally make their way down. Though the two types of blocks are cleared in different ways, try to see if you can perform a combo by clearing both types at once!</li><li><strong><em>Kunio-kun no Dodgeball da yo Zen’in Shuugou!</em></strong> – This <a title="Genres > Sports [567 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/sports">sports game</a>, released for the Super Famicom system in 1993, features Kunio-kun (who you may recognize from the <em>River City</em> series!) and his striking dodgeball moves. Take the field and square off against teams from various countries and employ a variety of jumps, passes and dynamic knockout shots as you aim to become the greatest dodgeball team in the world. Plus, each stage has hidden gimmicks to discover, so your matches may even take some unexpected turns! Build your ideal team, power up with in-game items and train your teammates to be the best they can be. Can you take the dodgeball championship by storm?</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <title><![CDATA[EA’s Cutting-Edge AI Concept Imagines A Pile Of Boxes]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-cutting-edge-ai-concept-imagines-a-pile-of-boxes.983961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Picture, if you will, a world in which your wildest gameplay whims can come to life in an instant – no muss, fuss, or coding required. What would you do? What vast possibility spaces would you pluck from the infinite realms of your imagination? At <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1836129684351791337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent investor event</a>, EA went with boxes.</p><p>EA chief strategy officer Mihir Vaidya introduced the company’s new “Imagination to Creation” AI pipeline with a concept video, meaning one made with intention – almost certainly by human beings – to convey why this thing is The Future. And yet, able to mock up pretty much anything, especially given the pie-in-the-heavens rhetoric the letters A and I often inspire, EA settled on two “community-designed” generi-characters hopping around a glorified box fort.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>“Make it more epic.”</p><p>⁰EA Chief Strategy officer Mihir Vaidya demonstrates how EA plans to super-charge user-created game content with AI in this concept video "Imagination to Creation" from EA’s Investor Day event in NYC today. <a href="https://t.co/sgBnawF7rK">pic.twitter.com/sgBnawF7rK</a></p></div>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1836129684351791337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Commands like “make it more complex” and “make it multi-level” just added more boxes, seemingly with little rhyme or reason, let alone attention to meaningful level design. After some light skirmishing, one player – sounding as much like a real person as every other actor in the industry’s long history of labored co-op game “demos” – told the AI to “make it more epic.” This, too, added more boxes.</p><p>Vaidya boasted that in this currently-imaginary vision of the future, users will be able to take elements from EA games’ asset libraries and remix them. “Elements like characters, gameplay systems, weapons, and logic,” he said. If you’re an investor, the target audience for this presentation, I’m sure you were floored. Infinite content with minimal input. Gray slop oozing forth from an endless faucet. Finally, your precious numbers and lines can go up forever.</p><p>But EA’s concept video – which, again, could have been <em>anything </em>but for some reason settled on boxes – mostly demonstrates how profoundly unimaginative this whole enterprise is. Assuming EA can create something that reliably works this way – itself a big if – then you’re basically getting a set of Legos that a machine assembles for you. Direct control is minimal. You just lob prompts at the AI and see what it spits out. And these building blocks come from preexisting games, so the end result will necessarily be a mishmash of ideas and characters with no understanding of how they are meant to fit together, because AI cannot understand.</p><p>This is a solution in search of a problem. Modding communities have been remixing their favorite games for nearly as long as video games have existed, and they’re thriving. There are arguably too many mods of popular games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skyrim</em></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/im-in-awe-of-how-hard-this-new-doom-track-goes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Doom</em></a><em> </em>– more than any single person could ever try. These were born of actual creativity and ingenuity; instead of painting firmly within the lines – as AI must – modders redefined them, in the process creating some of today’s most popular genres (not to mention <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/IceFrog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">landing</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-london-mod-4-skyrim-pc-hired-bethesda-fan-dev-1849136115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">themselves</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2#Development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jobs</a>, in some cases).&nbsp;</p><p>If this year has shown us anything, it’s that people <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t want derivative games made of parts from cast-off playsets</a>. They want experiences that legitimately spirit them and their friends away to new places, that are exciting enough to dislodge them from established games that have become comforting daily rituals. To call what EA is doing “imagination” is an insult to the word. Nobody in this process is imagining anything. Piece by piece, box by box, EA is attempting to build a rehash machine, one in which players whose data the company is hoovering up are all cogs. Let us hope it does not succeed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The main hook, Chief Experiences Officer David Tinson says, is its tie-ins with EA's various sports games, including the possibility of unlocking prizes like Ultimate Team cards based on the sizzle reel.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/17/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-1-52-27-screenshot-1726608647296.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The EA Sports app is being touted as a new way to engage with sports using EA's existing technology.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Our thesis is simple: With the right products, features, and capabilities, a significant portion of hyper valuable consumer attention is available for a fraction of the cost," Tinson says.</p><p>Ultimately, Tinsons says EA's goal is to create a social app that allows fans to follow their favorite sports and teams while integrating in-game rewards and community elements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Tinson showcased a number of features that incorporate EA's technology, including a system that appears to seamelssly translate real-life moments into virtual highlights that can be viewed from any angle using the EA Sports FC engine. EA is also introducing predictive simulations that not only simulate upcoming matches, but can also questions like "who would win between 85 Bears and the 07 Patriots."</p><p>Based on Tinson's presentation, the app appears to make heavy use of AI, featuring prompts that allows users to create its simulations. Generative AI was a big part of EA's overall presentation, and was touted repeatedly in relation to franchises like The Sims and its sports games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/17/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-1-58-20-screenshot-1726608686364.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>EA claims the new app will let you view highlights from any angle.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The EA Sports app will initially be focused around soccer, making it an extension of one of EA's most popular and successful sports sims in EA Sports FC. Support for other sports will also be added over time, with the NHL, NHL, F1, and NCAA Football all highlighted at various points.</p><p>The new app will soft-launch in Space this fall, and will be supported on iOS and Android devices. In the meantime, EA Sports FC is set to enter early access this week, with a full release on September 27.

According to Seagate's website, this SSD normally retails for $220, so this is a 40% price drop. The Firecuda 530R works equally well as storage expansion for your PS5 console - it will triple your existing storage capacity - or as a blazing fast boot drive for your gaming rig.</p><h2>2TB Seagate Firecuda 530R 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink</h2><div catalogid="77b17120-1386-4338-907b-52882079c649" id="143896"><div id="143896" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Seagate FireCuda 530R 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>The Seagate Firecuda 530R is a direct successor to the 530, which was already one of the faster PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs on the market. Seagate is pretty tight-lipped about what exact hardware or software changes were made, but we do know that the upgrades include a marked increase in random read and write speeds (IOPS) and a higher endurance rating. The Firecuda 530R boasts sustained read  speeds of 7,800MBps and write speeds of 6,800MBps which is well above Sony's PS5 recommendation of 5,600MBps. It's also equipped with a robust EK-designed aluminum heatsink that's slim enough to fit both PS5 and PS5 slim drive bays (the new 530R removes the EK logo and replaces it with a Seagate logo). Of course, the same specs make it a prime candidate for your gaming PC boot drive. It's still one of the fastest drives on the market and goes toe to toe with other heavy hitters like the Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black SN850X, and the SK Hynix P41 Platinum.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more SSD storage upgrade options for your PS5 console, check out our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2023"><em>best PS5 SSD deals of 2024</em></a><em>.

On paper, the Fusion Pro 4 is a fairly substantial leap forward versus the Fusion Pro 3. Most notably, the new model comes with Hall Effect triggers and sticks, which also support the Quick-Twist feature that lets you adjust the height of your thumbsticks on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">Other notable features include four remapppable back buttons and a rubberized grip. The controller connects to Xbox Series X|S or PC via an included 10-foot braided USB-C cable, and sports a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the Fusion Pro 3 had swappable sticks, which have been replaced by the Quick-Twist sticks. The only potential downside to this change is that you can no longer have different thumbstick cap options. The Pro 3 came with a pair of short sticks with concave caps, and a pair of tall sticks, one concave and one convex. That said, the Quick-Twist sticks in the Fusion Pro 4 utilize Hall Effect technology to prevent stick drift, and you can lock them in three different positions, so overall it should be a positive change.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fusion Pro 4 is available now for $70 at Amazon, which is $10 less than the launch price of the Fusion Pro 3.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-now-has-a-deckbuilding-card-game/1100-6526544/">Avatar: The Last Airbender Now Has A Deckbuilding Card Game</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>   </ul> </div>
