			<p>NetEase Games has announced today that the cross-platform test for Once Human has begun, where it will be testing the cross-platform feature for mobile devices and PC in particular. This will benefit players greatly, as it will widen the pool of players available to interact with, as well as giving them more of a chance to build, engage in combat, and explore the post-apocalyptic world that has been taken over by Lovecraftian creatures.</p>
<p>At the moment, Once Human is only available on PC, but the game will be available on Android and iOS devices come April 2025, and the versions will be cross-compatible.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in joining Once Human's current cross-platform test, it is currently live and will be available to participate in until March 30. Players across Europe, Japan, and North America can sign up to participate. To sign up, you can either <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/863iir/paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete a survey</a> within Once Human or join through the official social media for Once Human. There are limited slots for this test, so make sure you sign up quickly.</p>
<p>For those who want to test the game on mobile, iOS users will have to participate through TestFlight, while Android users will have to install the game's APK from the official website. Of course, for those on PC, the process is significantly easier, and you can jump into the test via the game's official client once you've been added to the test.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the cross-platform test will be using the current global server environment from the PC version of Once Human. This means that those joining on mobile or PC will get access to all Scenarios, as well as the Visional Wheel and Lunar Oracle.</p>
<p>In addition to the cross-platform test, pre-registration is now live for the mobile version of Once Human. The full launch of the mobile version is scheduled for an unmentioned date in April 2025. You can<a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/129/f42m6hk9tex0ofpxkzu7weoo7/3/c52da950fe9ce2ab511d86047fac03b84befe1d1625a354bd30a7d621e7f76c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-register</a> your interest in playing the mobile version of Once Human, where you can then win in-game rewards, which include some great weapons and items that can prove beneficial to your journey. You can also try your luck by pre-registering, as you'll be entered into a draw to win an iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p>
<p>Since its release, Once Human has performed very well and has received a multitude of updates, including specific PvP Scenarios and<a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-august-update-out-includes-animal-ranching/"> Animal Ranching</a>, for those who prefer to have a little bit of a farm life in the game.</p>

The modern <em>Pokémon </em>games have been universally plagued by technical issues, but the debate about the series’ graphics and art style is a bit more complicated and subjective than simple acknowledgments of technical shortcomings. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is being held to a lot of scrutiny after games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125"><em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em></a></span><em> </em>traded the intimate, crafted environments of their predecessors for open-world scope, and the fandom seems divided on whether the upcoming Switch RPG is an improvement or another step in the wrong direction.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

But it is a step up from the 2022 RPGs in that it’s more colorful, uses smaller environments to get more details and textures on screen, and at least in the trailer, it looks like it’s running better than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> do, too. I’m open to conversations about whether <em>Legends: Z-A </em>looks bad, but I feel like anyone who thinks it looks <em>worse</em> than the ugly open world of Paldea probably hasn’t booted up <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>in a minute or is wearing rose-colored glasses. The side-by-side comparisons are pretty damning.</p><p>For all the discussion happening in the <em>Pokémon </em>fandom, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>feels like a calculated pivot away from the pitfalls of the series’ recent open-world entries. It’s focusing on a smaller world by taking place entirely in Lumiose City, which means we’ll hopefully not be subject to the same framerate culling and texture pop-in that plagued <em>Legends: Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet</em> / <em>Violet</em>. But even if it’s a technical step up earned through careful planning, does <em>Legends: Z-A</em> beat the ugly artstyle accusations? That’s the question fans can’t seem to agree on.</p><p>I’m still interested in some of the mechanical changes <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is implementing like real-time battles, but the longer I’ve thought about it, the more I’m disappointed that visually, the <em>Legends</em> subseries isn’t following in the superior footsteps of <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. Yes, <em>Arceus</em> had some of the same technical troubles that impacted <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but it was generally pretty to look at because it adopted a colorful cel-shaded look. Seeing <em>Legends: Z-A </em>fall in step with <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>is a bummer because moving away from the open-zone structure could have, in theory, given Game Freak the chance to focus on smaller environments with some visual flair and personality. <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em> was the last game that featured (primarily) smaller environments, and it had some real standout towns that popped on screen and had a real sense of place. I look back at the city of Ballonlea, which is adorned with colorful, bioluminescent mushrooms, as a reminder that Game Freak can create gorgeous environments when it scales back. Lumiose City looks better than anything in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but if it were more stylized, it could look even better.</p><p>Hopefully, we’ll see something more visually striking between now and when <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch later this year. Until then, at least I haven’t seen anyone <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0l58j/why_is_this_ok/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0l58j/why_is_this_ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting mad about the trees.</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The storage box holds up to 250 sleeved cards and three punch-out dividers, making it an affordable way to keep your new cards safe as you start your collection.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Disney Lorcana - Archazia’s Island Starter Deck</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DDL8HJ2M,B0DDL6BJDS&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$17</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Don’t want the hassle of building your own deck?

In the post, they answered over a dozen fan questions about how the upcoming open-world stealth game will perform on consoles, specs needed on PC, upscaling and raytracing options, and more. And in this new post, Ubisoft confirmed that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Steam won’t, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-connect-steam-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-1849809946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-connect-steam-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-1849809946">like past many Ubisoft PC games</a></span>, require players to download and install Ubisoft Connect. </p><p>So yes, here’s the good news: According to Ubisoft, you won’t need to muck about with a separate launcher when playing <em>Shadows </em>via Steam. The company says that <em>Shadows </em>includes a “lite embedded version” of Ubisoft Connect in it. </p><p>However, you’ll still need to link your Steam account to a Ubisoft Connect account to play <em>Shadows</em>. Ubisoft promises this is a “one-time” thing and once you link the accounts you will be good to go, but it is still a weird barrier between Steam users and the game. And for those worried that this means you have to be online to play <em>Shadows</em>, that’s not the case. Ubisoft confirmed you only need an internet connection to install the game. Then you can play offline. </p><p>Now for some bad news: Steam Deck users won’t be playing <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> at launch. In today’s tech Q&amp;A, Ubisoft very bluntly responded to a question about <em>Shadows </em>on Steam Deck with: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC.</p></blockquote><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933?_gl=1*1lj6v08*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2NTY5Ni4xNy4xLjE3NDA3NjY1NjAuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933?_gl=1*1lj6v08*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2NTY5Ni4xNy4xLjE3NDA3NjY1NjAuNjAuMC4w">This isn’t surprising, as more and more games are struggling to run on the aging Steam Deck</a></span>. However, the fact that Ubisoft specified it won’t be playable <em>at launch</em> is interesting. Perhaps in a future update the company will add some Steam Deck options to make it playable on Valve’s portable PC. But if you don’t have a computer that can play <em>Shadows</em> and rely on a Steam Deck to play PC games, I’d hold off on buying the new <em>Assassin’s Creed.</em></p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is nearly here. The game launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-hoping-legends-z-a-will-bring-a-certain-elemental-monkey-trio-to-nintendo-switch-at-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A complete PokéDex at last.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's Pokémon Legends: Z-A gameplay reveal flooded us with new information about the upcoming Pokémon games set in a futuristic Lumiose City, including looks at dozens of Pokémon we should expect to see there. But one trio of monsters that fans were really hoping to see did NOT appear: the elemental monkeys Panpour, Pansage, and Pansear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why are fans so hung up on the monkey trio? It's a bit complicated. The three monkeys and their evolutions have been a part of an increasingly shrinking list of Pokémon that are currently unavailable in any Nintendo Switch game. If you want to truly catch 'em all, you still can, by transferring them from other Pokémon games pre-Switch to Pokémon Home. But at the moment, the following Pokémon are unavailable for capture natively in any Nintendo Switch Pokémon game:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Panpour</li><li>Pansage</li><li>Pansear</li><li>Simipour</li><li>Simisage</li><li>Simisear</li><li>Patrat</li><li>Watchog</li><li>Furfrou</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This list used to be much longer, but Game Freak added a ton of new Pokémon in the DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that culled the list down to these nine. What's more, the trailer we saw yesterday showed both Patrat and Furfrou, confirming these two at least will be available in Legends: Arceus. And since Watchog evolves from Patrat, it's a safe bet it will be in the game too. So that just leaves the three monkeys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The elemental monkey trio was first introduced in Pokémon Black and White, and are somewhat beloved by fans due to the unique way the player obtains them. In Black and White, the first Gym the player encounters will use a typing that the player's starter Pokémon is weak against. However, if the player visits a certain person in the Dreamyard, they'll receive the monkey that has an advantage against that Gym, making it easier to tackle. Their designs are also memorable for being based on the "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" wise monkeys of Japanese folklore.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/pokmon-legends-z-a-releases-in-late-2025-3-1740761188956.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Furfrou lets out a lakeside howl in Pokemon Legends Z-A.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Realistically, the odds of the monkey trio showing up in Legends: Z-A are actually pretty good. It would be very surprising for Game Freak to leave them out of what could possibly be the last major Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch, and given that they appeared in the Kalos region PokéDex back in the day, it only makes sense for them to still be there in Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if the monkeys are included, there's still one other problem Game Freak needs to solve: Spinda. Spinda is catchable on Nintendo Switch in Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, but due to an error in how the game reads its spot patterns, it cannot be transferred to Pokémon Home. You can still get a Spinda from pre-Switch games transferred to Home, but the weird stuck nature of Spindas on Switch means that the dizzy little bear could probably use a functional Z-A appearance too, if Game Freak feels amenable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">first real look at Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> gave us a lot to take in, and we're still dissecting the footage to find all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">connections between this and other, past Pokémon games</a>.

Here’s how it works: once you reach level 25 on a class, you can buy a Prestige Level that will unlock a unique Prestige Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Choose them wisely,” Focus and Saber said, “because you won’t be able to change your selected Prestige Perks before unlocking the four Prestige Levels.” On top of that power boost, each class will have a unique cosmetic reward that emphasizes the class’ iconic armour part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 will get Public Test Servers (PTS) on Steam only in March before Patch 7 comes out. This will give fans early access to the upcoming features and the chance to share feedback so the developers can refine the content ahead of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Focus and Saber teased the upcoming launch of Horde mode, a feature Space Marine 2 players have been looking forward to ever since the game came out last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now,” Focus and Saber said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the Space Marine 1 Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we get really interesting things to show you about it, we will do it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bear with us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same post, Focus and Saber also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-stamps-out-live-service-game-talk-amid-backlash-to-fomo-community-events">stamped out live service game talk amid a backlash to 'FOMO' Community Events</a>.

Terrifying beasts roam the countryside, and they're going to stomp on your character's head if you're not careful. However, if you manage to perform aerial attacks, you might be able to clamber on top of them and hang on for dear life. Our guide helps you with this particular mechanic so you can have an edge in combat.</p><h2>How to mount monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds</h2><p>You can mount monsters by performing aerial attacks. First, make sure that you have a melee weapon equipped. Then, be ready to do either of these two maneuvers:</p><ul><li>Jump off ledges while a creature is below you.</li><li>Jump off your <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-seikret-customization-guide/1100-6529798/" data-ref-id="1100-6529798">Seikret mount</a></strong> while a target is at a lower height/lower stance.</li><li>Use your Slinger to grapple onto floating contraptions, vines, or insects, then drop down a creature that's below you.</li></ul><p>Then, while in mid-air, press the main attack button--i.e. Triangle on PlayStation 5, Y on Xbox Series X/S, or the left mouse button. If all goes well, your character should be able to cling onto a target's back, which leads to a minigame of sorts.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451992-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451992" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451992-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451992"></a><figcaption>Get ready to hop and wallop a giant beast on the head.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451992-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-1.jpg"></figure><h3>What to do once you're on top of a monster?</h3><p>Assuming you're able to mount a monster in Monster Hunter Wilds, don't celebrate prematurely. First, take note of the control prompts and information on your screen:</p><ul><li>The upper-left corner of the screen shows your stamina meter. It will gradually drain while you're riding the creature.</li><li>Monsters will attempt to buck and toss you away. If this occurs, press and hold the brace button to minimize stamina depletion.</li><li>You can press the attack buttons to strike a monster's body parts. Once you've opened a wound, press the corresponding prompt--i.e. R1, RB, or Left Shift, depending on your control scheme. This lets you perform a Focus Strike that causes tremendous damage.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451993-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451993" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451993-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451993"></a><figcaption>Strike a wounded body part while you're mounted to perform a flashy finisher.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451993-monster-hunter-wilds-mount-monsters-guide-2.jpg"></figure><p>Apart from attacking outright, you may continue to move around a monster's body to find a specific weak spot that you want to target. You may also cause it to ram into walls, pillars, and other obstacles to temporarily stun it.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how to mount monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds.

                <p>4A Games and 4A Games Ukraine might sound like part of the same organization, but as the Metro developer recently clarified, that's not actually the case anymore. In <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an update</a>, 4A Games explained that though the majority of its workers remain in Ukraine, the other studio 4A Games Ukraine (now known as Reburn) is now a completely separate entity.</p><p dir="ltr">In the update, 4A explains that the original founders of the studio formed 4A Games Limited to create a new HQ in Malta with 50 members of their team back in 2014. When Metro Exodus was released in 2019, 4A Games Limited created a separate studio in Kyiv and hired roughly 50 employees from their existing Kyiv office 4A Games Ukraine, which then spun off into its own separate studio no longer affiliated with 4A or the Metro franchise, now called Reburn.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> La Quimera | Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This name and studio confusion stems from Reburn's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metro-dev-4a-games-rebrands-to-reburn-announces-new-sci-fi-fps-la-quimera/1100-6529689/">recent announcement</a> of its new project, La Quimera. It's described as a first-person shooter with a "heavy focus" on narrative, world design, and characters. The game's world and story have been created by Nicolas Winding Refn, best known for directing Drive and The Neon Demon, and it draws from Latin-American folklore.</p><p dir="ltr">4A Games was formed back in 2006 by former developers from Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl studio GSC Game World. They are best-known for the Metro series, based on a series of novels by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/islands-and-trains-are-two-of-my-favorite-things.1122183/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/islands-and-trains-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was almost <em>scared </em>to open up<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Steam's Next Fest tab</a> earlier this week. There are simply too many demos of too many good games going around; how would I even know where to start? Thankfully, Steam instantly made a very helpful suggestion: maybe try <em>this </em>demo first, since it's for a game you already have wishlisted.</p><p>That game is called <em>Islands And Trains</em>, and between the name and the screenshots you can probably tell where this is going. If you can't, here is perhaps the best elevator pitch for a video game I have ever seen:</p><blockquote><p>Craft tiny railway dioramas in a stress-free island sandbox. No rules or timers - just design, build, and enjoy.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I don't know about you, but I <em>love</em> little trains. I hate stress, I love islands, I dig sandbox creation games. I hate rules and timers, and I really enjoy designing, building and...enjoying. So I smashed that install button, and 100MB later I was playing.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Islands &amp; Trains - New Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8w-xEMce10?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Turns out, in a rare W for truth in advertising, <em>Islands And Trains</em> is everything it says it is! Imagine the free-form construction of "<em>Islanders</em>, <em>Dorfromantik</em> and <em>Townscaper</em>"--and I'm not being reductive here,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> those are three games the developers list as their primary inspiration on their own Steam page</a>--but here you also build a little rail network and get to watch little trains toot around towns, through tunnels and under waterfalls.</p><p>The sandbox toolkit is snappy, the cosmetic options are plentiful (if restricted, since this is a demo) and everything looks <em>gorgeous</em>. I really appreciate the depth you can get to here; you're responsible for shaping everything, from the terrain of the island itself to its hills, forests and waterways, so even if you hate trains (though how could you?), I think you could still find joy just building an island with a town and some rivers and farms on it.</p><p>Though by doing that you'd miss out on the game's best part: after building a little train, you get to control the train with a little throttle on the right of the screen, which is such a tiny flourish. As a model train diorama enjoyer, it’s been a delight every time I'd nudged it to start, then nudged it to stop perfectly outside of a little train station that doesn't even have any people on it, but which I imagine has people on it, because I also built them little streets and a little school and a little football pitch behind the school that looks out over the ocean.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Islands And Trains'</em> release date is TBA</a>, but being a sandbox game this demo lets you mess around with most of it; it's just the variety of options that are limited, so most of the stuff you can do here is the same as the full release, you just don't get as many buildings, terrain, climate or train options as you will when it's finally out.</p><figure><figcaption>There's the train controls on the bottom-right! You get to build everything AND move the little train!</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-strikers-to-unlock-in-mecha-break.1122174/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-strikers-to-unlock-in-mecha-break/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Mecha BREAK is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-popular-demos-from-steam-next-fest-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attracting far more players</a> than any other demo at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest</a>, and those players have to decide which Striker (or mech) to unlock first. It takes a while to unlock all of the Mecha BREAK Strikers through the progression system, so knowing what the best ones are beforehand can make the task much easier.</p>



<p>After you complete the tutorial, you’ll have the default Striker Alysnes unlocked already. Once you’ve completed a few matches and some introductory tasks, you should have enough Matrix Credits to unlock these must-have Strikers in Mecha BREAK. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-interview-mecha-break-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game’s creator Kris Kwok may not be able to pick favorites</a>, but we can.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-strikers-to-unlock-in-mecha-break">Best Strikers to Unlock in Mecha BREAK</h2>



<h3 id="h-tricera">Tricera</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Tricera only costs 3,200 Matrix Credits, a relative steal considering the cost of other Strikers and given how valuable he is. An Ultra-Heavy Defender, Tricera comes equipped with two sets of gatling guns, and its greatest strength is its unreal defensive capabilities. Its gatling guns can be fired at the same time, shredding opponent armor. Tricera can also transform into a nearly impenetrable turret mode, in which it can also deploy drones that heal itself and friendly units around it. When a defender is needed to hold down an objective in 6v6, there’s arguably no better option early on Tricera.</p>



<h3 id="h-welkin">Welkin</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>In contrast to the defensive capabilities of Tricera, Welkin is a melee offensive dynamo, costing 6,800 Matrix Credits to unlock. Equipped with a sick battle axe that bypasses enemy armor, Welkin’s signature ability is a stasis field that locks enemies in with you and a drone that deals additional damage and stagger. It e also has two smoke fields to get him out of tricky situations: a Jamming field that destroys enemy drones and blinds enemies facing you, and a Defense field that blocks and reduces incoming Energy damage. Close the distance on an enemy, pop the stasis field, and let the Axe go to work </p>



<h3 id="h-hurricane">Hurricane</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hurricane, another Ultra-Heavy Defender that costs 9,600 Matrix Credits, excels in creating areas that enemies will steer clear from. Its defensive field creates a large barrier that it and allies can take shelter in, and it can deploy Decoy Drones and Turret Drones to harass enemies. Hurricane’s primary fire Energy Blaster is worth charging up, as it deals continuous Area and Energy damage and will absolutely melt light attackers.</p>



<h3 id="h-skyraider">Skyraider</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Skyraider, a Medium Attacker that costs 45,000 Matrix Credits, is the perfect blend of firepower and mobility, and is worth saving up for. While standing, its Autocannon and Missile deal massive amounts of damage, with a Jamming Missile that allows for blocking damage and escape potential. Once it switches to its Aerial Assault form, it can dodge missiles or lock-ons, and utilize a Missile Dispenser that can target up to 12 different units. Skyraider is great for clearing out teamfights in 6v6, and is overall a strong choice in Mashmak extraction matches.</p>

It may not be much to look at, but Guzman plans to help players make a killing with new missions to sell and transport illegal arms. What McKenzie lacks in aesthetics, it more than makes up for as a staging ground where players can fly a Western Duster 300-H plane and the Buckingham DH-7 Iron Mule helicopter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/capcom-responds-to-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-problems-with-basic-troubleshooting/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Today’s launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has disappointingly been met with a wave of complaints from PC players over the game’s performance.</p>
<p>With the game’s Steam reviews rating sat at Mixed, Capcom has responded and offered some basic troubleshooting tips.</p>


<p>A post by the official Monster Hunter Status social media account says,&nbsp;“If you’re experiencing any initial issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam, please try updating your graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode, and then readjust your settings.”</p>
<p>That’s all well and good, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry’s analysis</a> of the PC version of the game highlights a number of fundamental issues that they found with the game. In particular, there’s a very lengthy shader compilation stage that could last 13 minutes on a Ryzen 5 3600. The automatic graphics settings seemingly fail to handle adjusting texture quality to match available VRAM on 8GB cards (leading to hefty stutters), and even if that’s adjusted, they continued to see stutters during camera movement. Even with more than 8GB VRAM, they suggest keeping texture settings reduced at this time, and suspect that there’s some issues with GPU-based DirectStorage texture decompression overloading the hardware.</p>
<p>This seems to be a bit more than just needing to have your drivers updated, and it’s yet another wonky PC game release – see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/01/spider-man-2-pc-port-gets-a-rough-reception-over-performance-and-graphical-issues/">Spider-Man 2</a> at the end of January. Here’s hoping that further driver updates and some game tweaks in updates can help with performance as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Still, here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Capcom’s troubleshooting steps</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements for the game.</li>
<li>Update your Video/Graphics Drivers.</li>
<li>Check for Windows Updates and ensure all of the latest programs are installed to your OS.</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, try performing a clean installation of the video driver set.</li>
<li>Update DirectX to the latest version.<br>
For details on how to update DirectX, please visit the Microsoft support page or Microsoft Download Center.</li>
<li>Add the game’s folder and files to your anti-virus program’s exception / exclusion list.<br>
Default Paths:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds\MonsterHunterWilds.exe</li>
<li>Add folder and files for Steam.exe to your anti-virus program’s exception / exclusion list.<br>
*Default Paths:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe</li>
<li>Give administrator privileges to Steam.<br>
To run Steam.exe in administrator mode, right-click on the .exe file and select “Run as administrator.”</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, try logging into your PC in administrator mode and then run the game’s execution file (MonsterHunterWilds.exe).</li>
<li>Verify the game’s files on Steam.<br>
To verify your game’s files, follow these steps:<br>
(1) Restart your computer and launch Steam.<br>
(2) From the “Library” section, right-click on the game, and select “Properties” from the menu.<br>
(3) Select the “Installed Files” tab and click the “Verify integrity of game files” button.<br>
(4) Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.<br>
Important: One or more files may fail to verify. The files that fail to verify are local configuration files that should not be replaced as part of this process. You can safely ignore this message. If problematic files were detected during this process, Steam will automatically download and / or replace those files.</li>
<li>Disable Compatibility Mode for “MonsterHunterWilds.exe” if enabled.<br>
(1) Right click on “MonsterHunterWilds.exe” located in the following folder:<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\MonsterHunterWilds<br>
*The above is the default location.<br>
(2) Go to Properties<br>
(3) Open Compatibility tab<br>
(4) Untick “Run this program in compatibility mode for:”<br>
If the above does not resolve the issue, please disable the Compatibility Mode for “Steam.exe” located in the folder below.<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam</li>
<li>If you still experience issues, please also try the troubleshooting steps on the Official Monster Hunter Wilds Troubleshooting &amp; Issue Reporting Thread posted on the Steam community page as they contain more detailed and additional steps that may help resolve your issue.<br>
*Some steps mentioned in this article is also mentioned in the troubleshooting guide below, but please try all the steps in the guide again.</li>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-horus-heresy-roleplaying-game-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-the-horus-heresy-roleplaying-game-announced-for-2026.1122135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-horus-heresy-roleplaying-game-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed that it's releasing a roleplaying game based on the popular&nbsp;<em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy&nbsp;</em>setting, and it's set to debut in 2026, with preorders opening up in summer.</p>

<p>The roleplaying game will begin with the massacre on Isstvan III, which saw Horus launching an Exterminatus attack on the planet, wiping out the vast majority of life. It's one of the major inciting incidents in the Horus Heresy mythology, and the one that uncovered Horus as the traitor he would come to be known as.</p>

<p>You and your compatriots will play as Legionary Consuls on the side of the Imperium of Man. Rather uniquely, you'll also create a secondary character like a Naval Commander or a Remembrancer, and you'll switch to playing as these characters "when their particular skills are required", according to Games Workshop.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-horus-heresy-roleplaying-game-battlefield.jpg?itok=V8O0PHCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-horus-heresy-roleplaying-game-battlefield.jpg?itok=deJBdZfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Horus Heresy is one of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000</em>'s most important events, and you'll get to experience it soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Horus Heresy&nbsp;</em>roleplaying game is being developed by Cubicle 7, whose name you might know from its previous efforts in the world of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer</em>. The studio's prior efforts include&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Wrath &amp; Glory</em></a>.</p>

<p>Cubicle 7 head Dominic McDowall says that in the new game, you and your friends will get the chance to forge "legends" that will "rival those found in the classics" of the setting. He describes the Heresy itself as "as big as it gets" in the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the Horus Heresy, it's one of the most important events in the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>timeline. Horus Lupercal, one of the Emperor's sons and the Primarch of the Luna Wolves Space Marine Chapter, betrays the Imperium after being seduced by the Gods of Chaos.</p>

<p>While Horus and his traitor legions technically lose their war against the Imperium of Man, their efforts lead to the near-total destruction of the Emperor's body, which is now kept alive through constant horrifying sacrifice and venerated as "God-Emperor" among mankind.</p>




<p>It's a setting that has been covered in a number of Black Library novels, including the likes of Dan Abnett's&nbsp;<em>Horus Rising&nbsp;</em>and Aaron Dembski-Bowden's&nbsp;<em>The First Heretic</em>, among many others.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy&nbsp;</em>roleplaying game's core rulebook and starter sets will launch in spring 2026, with pre-orders opening up this summer. Excitingly, Cubicle 7 also has an RPG in the works based on&nbsp;<em>Warhammer: The Old World</em>, so stay tuned for more on that.</p>

<p>If you’re a Call of Duty fan who has yet to upgrade to a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, it looks like you’ll be able to still keep your old system for at least another year. According to a new report, Call of Duty 2025 is in development for last gen PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>



<p>The claim was first reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1895228195471007981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> on Thursday night. Insider Gaming sources have since been able to corroborate the report that the game is in development for those platforms. Whether it actually releases on them is something that sources couldn’t confirm just yet.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-media-s-fault">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-medias-fault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman Canceled And Is It The Games Media’s Fault?</a></h6>



<p>In addition to the plans for the game to remain on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, CharlieIntel speculates that the 13-year-old systems might be a reason why Warzone doesn’t have “two big maps at the same time”.</p>



<p>As far as why the game could continue on last-gen consoles, it likely has to do with the popularity on those platforms. Still, it has fans on social media split about the decision.</p>



<p>“Studios having to support 12 year old hardware is bad for the industry and holds back the full potential for games,” <a href="https://x.com/xSERP3NT/status/1895230590129185239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user said</a>. “It’s time to move on.”</p>



<p>Said another: “Crazy but not surprising. Still a ton of ppl on there, and the game scales to low end hardware, [and the] game engine can even play on phones now as we saw with warzone mobile.”</p>

<p>Inside the source code are some wonderful reminders of what Windows game development from 1995 to 2003 was really like. One experienced modder <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rwtema.bsky.social/post/3lj73vvrhr226">posted some gems on Bluesky</a>, like a "HACK ALERT!" text string added just to prevent the Watcom IDE from crashing because of a "magic text heap length" crash: "Who knows why, but it works," wrote that poor soul.</p>
<p>This writer's personal favorite is this little bit in <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour/blob/main/Generals/Code/Tools/WorldBuilder/src/RampOptions.cpp">the RampOptions.cpp file</a> in <em>Generals</em>, credited to John K. McDonald Jr., which expresses concerns about "TheRampOptions" existing with a set value:</p>
<p><code>if (TheRampOptions) {</code><br>
<code>// oh shit.</code><br>
<code>return;</code><br>
<code>}</code></p>
<p>In addition to helping out modders and entertaining experienced coders, the GPL-licensed source code releases do a lot to help preserve these games, such that they can be reworked to run on future platforms. Projects like <a href="https://www.openra.net/">OpenRA</a> and <a href="https://opensage.github.io/">OpenSAGE</a> already offer open source reimplementations of those games' code, but having the original source can only help. <em>C&amp;C </em>community stalwart Luke "CCHyper" Feenan worked with EA leaders to get the code back into a build-ready state and said in a press release that the updated code should make the classic games easier to patch in the future.</p>
<p>As part of the source code release, the&nbsp;<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> team dropped off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN2gryZYz6g">35 minutes of footage</a>, newly found in the archives, of alpha and archive footage from the later Sage-engine based&nbsp;<em>Generals</em> and <em>Renegade</em> games.</p>

<p>It's heartening to see that with the right combination of people and purpose, classic games can find renewed interest and longevity inside a big publisher.</p>
