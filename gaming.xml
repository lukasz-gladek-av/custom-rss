		<p>Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has given a new interview and explained that Xbox exclusives are a thing of the past as they no longer make financial sense. <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1883243143342231655">Destin Legarie</a> asked Phil if Starfield, one of 2023’s big Xbox exclusive games would be “staying put” and after a few moments Phil replied with a firm “No.”</p>
<p>“There’s no specific game… this kinda goes back to my red line answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place, where it would find players, where we would have business success for us.” He then adds “To keep games off other platforms, that’s not a path for us.”</p>


<p>The statements come almost exactly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">a year after Microsoft’s presentation i</a>n which they announced the first four games that would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo, during which they specifically stated Starfield was not coming to other consoles, so a lot has changed in the last year.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/"> Rumours suggest</a> Flight Simulator, Hellblade 2, and the Halo Collection will be coming to PlayStation sometime this year.</p>
<p>Two reliable sources – NateTheHate and Windows Central’s Jez Corden – have been posting about the games in question.</p>
<p>“So, games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025 beyond the obvious include Flight Simulator, which will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/07/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>&nbsp;will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” states Nate on his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">podcast.</a></p>
<p>Jez has confirmed he had also heard about Flight Simulator and Halo, and<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo">&nbsp;adds</a>&nbsp;“I’ve heard that also Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 this year, although I’m unsure if that includes the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eve-online-2025-roadmap-shared-in-directors-stream-two-expansions-coming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, CCP Games shared their 2025 roadmap for the space MMO EVE Online during a Directors' stream. During this stream, it was announced that there will be two major expansions released, as well as the return of a fan-favorite in-game event, such as the EVE Fanfest 2025. This particular event will take place on May 1-3 at Reykjavik's Harpa Concert Hall. For those who want to watch the Directors' Stream from today, it is available to watch on the official CCP Games <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ccp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ccpgames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> YouTube</a> Channel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Diving into the roadmap for EVE Online,<a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-receives-revenant-expansion-bringing-new-ships-dens-and-more-customizations/"> the Revenant storyline</a> will continue to play out across Q1 as the tensions continue to rise between the Deathless and the Drifters. This will then carry players over to the next expansion for EVE Online, which is set to release in Summer 2025, with a focus on empowering the players, offering new enhanced tools for customization and content creation.</p>
<p>"This year, we're putting even more power in the hands of our capsuleers," said Snorri Arnason, Game Director for EVE Online. "From customizing sovereign space to crafting missions that spark new alliances, the 2025 roadmap is all about letting players create and shape their own moments, their own stories, and ultimately being part of the history books of New Eden itself."</p>
<p>Aside from the summer expansion, as mentioned earlier, fan-favorite events will be making a return to EVE Online. This includes events such as Capsuleer Day, Crimson Harvest, and Winter Nexus. The second expansion for EVE Online is set to release in the Winter of 2025. There haven't been many details about this expansion yet, as more details for the Summer expansion will be yet to come.</p>
<p>For those interested, tickets for EVE Fanfest 2025 are on sale but are nearly sold out. Those who want to attend can purchase tickets from <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/eve-fanfest-2025-tickets-716031949837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eventbrite</a>, with the price starting at $35. However, for those who want the full experience of Fanfest, the Festival Pass will cost you $295, which includes access to the party at the Top of the World, exclusive in-game content, an EVE Fanfest 2025 t-shirt, and a goodie bag.</p>
<p>"2025 will be monumental for EVE Online. We've listened to player feedback to refine our development process and create high-quality expansions that empower capsuleers. Join us in New Eden to experience a year filled with characters to meet, alliances to forge - or break - and thrilling stories to uncover. It's a year you don't want to miss!" says Bergur Finnbogason, EVE Online's Creative Director.</p>

                <p>Most of the early research into video games seemed to be designed to find a link between in-game violence and its effects on players in the real world. More recently, there have been studies about the adverse affects of gaming addiction. However, there's now research that suggests playing games may actually be beneficial for players, depending upon the type of the game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/VIDEO-GAMES/MENTAL-HEALTH/akpeewkqgpr/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, the majority of the research into the benefits of gaming focuses on cozy video games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-island-getaway/1900-6417431/" data-ref-id="1900-6417431">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. These casual games are designed to be soothing to play and almost impossible to lose. That genre also avoids putting players into overly stressful situations.</p><p>Hiroyuki Egami, an assistant professor at Nihon University, published a study conducted in Japan between 2020-2022 which found that participants experienced greatly reduced stress and an increase in mental health if they spent one extra hour playing games each day. A separate study by McMaster University assistant professor Michael Wong compared the benefits of casual gaming to meditation.</p><p>"To our surprise, there really wasn't a difference between the two forms of interventions," explained Wong. "For blood pressure and heart rate, there was no statistically significant difference between playing a video game and engaging in meditation."</p><p>This is an area of study that still remains largely unexplored, but these results are encouraging for players who have touted the benefits of gaming for years.</p><p>Improved mental health for players isn't the only way games are creating positive change.

                <p>The Call of Duty series is an annual franchise, so it's expected that Microsoft's Activision division will launch a new Call of Duty this year, like it has every year since 2005. In fact, 2025 will mark 20 years in a row of Activision releasing a new Call of Duty game (the series debuted in 2003 but had no release in 2004).</p><p>It's still early days, and to be clear, Activision has not announced the new Call of Duty game that's expected to release in 2025. But there have been a handful of leaks and rumors about Call of Duty 2025, including a rumor that it's a sequel to Black Ops 2 set in the 2030s.</p><p>In this post, we're rounding up everything we know, and what's been rumored, about the next Call of Duty.</p><h2>What is Call of Duty 2025?</h2><p>If <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>'s sources are correct, Call of Duty 2025 is a new Black Ops game, a sequel to 2012's Black Ops II--set in the early 2030s. 2024's Call of Duty game was also a Black Ops game--Black Ops 6--and this would mark the first time Black Ops games were released in back-to-back years. Specifically, Call of Duty 2025 is expected to pick up where Black Ops II left off--that game was set in 2025.</p><h2>When will Call of Duty 2025 be released?</h2><p>If Activision and Microsoft keep to the standard formula, fans can expect Call of Duty 2025 to launch in October or November 2025. It is likely to be announced at least a few months before that, with Activision almost assuredly using Call of Duty: Warzone to tease the next game, as it's done in the past.</p><h2>Will Call of Duty 2025 have a beta?</h2><p>Call of Duty 2025 is expected to have a pre-release multiplayer beta, as all recent entries in the series have. Now that Microsoft owns the franchise, fans can expect the beta to launch on all platforms at the same time, at least if the company sticks to the gameplan from Black Ops 6. Previously, Call of Duty betas were held first on PlayStation due to a co-marketing deal between Activision and Sony. The Black Ops 6 beta took place in August 2024, so it's reasonable to assume the Call of Duty 2025 beta could take place in August 2025.</p><h2>Preorder Call of Duty 2025</h2><p>While a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of the safest bets a person could make in the video game landscape, Call of Duty 2025 hasn't been announced yet and thus isn't available for preorder. If history serves as precedent, preorders for the game are likely to open around the time the game is officially announced.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 trailer information</h2><p>As of yet, Activision has not released any official trailers for Call of Duty 2025.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 platforms</h2><p>Activision has not announced the next Call of Duty, but it's likely to show up for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sure-sounds-like-xbox-games-are-coming-to-switch-2/1100-6529052/" data-ref-id="1100-6529052">alluded to bringing games to Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but whether or not this will include the next Call of Duty is unknown.</p><h2>Will Call of Duty 2025 be on Game Pass?</h2><p>Microsoft put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass at launch, and it's expected the company will do the same for Call of Duty 2025.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Insider Gaming reported that Call of Duty 2025 is a Black Ops II sequel set in the early 2030s, picking up after the events of Black Ops II. The Black Ops storyline is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/get-ready-for-black-ops-6-with-this-explainer-of-the-story-so-far/2900-5855/" data-ref-id="2900-5855">full of twists and turns and wild political conspiracies</a>, and it's expected that the new Call of Duty would continue this trend if it is indeed a new Black Ops game.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="73178005" data-promo-id="0"

            <p>
Developer Techland has teased plans for "multiple unannounced projects" set in the Dying Light universe - including new video games, board games, and a webcomic - as the zombie series celebrates its tenth birthday.
</p>
<p>
Dying Light 1 released on 26th January, 2015 and proved to be a massive hit for Techland, selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">over 20m copies as of 2022</a>. A sequel followed in 2022, and an 18-hour standalone adventure, Dying Light: The Beast, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">set to arrive this summer</a>.
</p>
<p>
And that's far from the end of Techland's Dying Light ambitions. The studio has now revealed it's planning "multiple unannounced projects" as it aims to position the series as the "ultimate zombie experience". According to the developer, these will "go beyond video games", and include the likes of board games, a webcomic series, merchandise, and "more".

<p>
"Our goal is to bring the world of Dying Light to even more people," Techland writes. "From the ongoing support of our currently released games to Dying Light: The Beast and beyond, there's never been a better time to be a Dying Light fan."
</p><p>
In the more immediate term, Techland is releasing new updates for Dying Light 1 &amp; 2 "very soon". The first game is poised to see the return of old events alongside new rewards, and will receive a range of "enhancements", including improved visual quality, a remastered soundtrack, and more. As for Dying Light 2: Stay Human, it's getting "further prologue changes", and its roguelite Tower Raid mode is set to become permanent.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, for those that haven't yet dipped their toes into Techland's open-world zombie series, Dying Light 1 &amp; 2 are both currently discounted on Xbox and PC.

Today is release day for The Game Kitchen's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stone-of-madness">The Stone Of Madness</a>, an isometric tactical stealth game set in an 18th century monastery - "isometric tactical stealth game" being a pretty clinical way to describe the plight of sundry lost souls exploring a maze of hellish Catholic art populated by guards and ghouls.

As in Commandos, you control a group of characters with different skills, strengths and weaknesses. Unlike in Commandos, your characters have sanity bars and a range of narratively-grounded foibles and phobias - either present from the get-go, or sprouted in response to the hardships you put them through. Lewis Gordon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-stone-of-madness-review">done a review for Eurogamer</a> and he makes it sound extremely appealing, half-cooked plot and tricksy controls notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in The Stone Of Madness partly because it's from the Spanish studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, a terrific study in religious horror, and partly because I've been thinking lately about the role of monastic orders in developing "modern" European understandings of time. For the philosopher Michel Foucault, the hourly and daily rites of forgotten generations of monks paved the way for the 9-to-5. Writing in <a href="https://archive.org/details/disciplinepunish0000fouc_j5k6">Discipline And Punish</a>, he describes the monasteries as "the specialists of time, the great technicians of rhythm and regular activities", and explores how they influenced the secular world by way of attached schools and poorhouses and eventually, industrial workplaces that "long retained a religious air".
</p>
<p>
This ancient discipline of timekeeping, as Foucault describes it, can also be traced to the variably time-locked worlds of video games. Being a game set in a monastery, The Stone Of Madness naturally makes the connection explicit. Its challenges and opportunities follow an elaborate day-night cycle, requiring you to match the right character to the right hour if you're to succeed. It takes inspiration on this count from another, much older Spanish production, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Abad%C3%ADa_del_Crimen">The Abbey Of Crime</a>, itself a loose adaptation of Umberto Eco's gargantuan monastic mystery novel The Name Of The Rose. 
</p><p>
All this makes me wonder whether "monastic time" is a concept worth pursuing to other, non-monastic games, as both alternative and precursor to the better-known idea of the "game as a job", encapsulated by live service looting simulators. I'll hopefully have something lengthier to say about all that in the next few weeks. For the moment, The Stone Of Madness seems worth a stab. There's still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309710/The_Stone_of_Madness/">a Steam demo</a> live at the time of writing.

He’s ben making RPGs there ever since, from cult-classics like Xbox 360 exclusive <em>Lost Odyssey </em>to smaller mobile games like <em>Terra Battle</em>. Most recently his team shipped <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantasian-final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-nobuo-uemats-1851729068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantasian-final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-nobuo-uemats-1851729068"><em>Fantasian: Neo Dimension</em>, an excellent old-school RPG</a></span> that began life as an Apple Arcade release in 2021, before recently getting remastered for consoles and PC. </p><p><em>Fantasian</em> definitely felt heavily inspired by <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. It starred an amnesiac fighter trying to save a world on the brink of chaos, aided by an eclectic group of noble misfits. The details were different but the overall mood and focus on narrative drama felt reminiscent of SNES-era Final Fantasy games. Sakaguchi reportedly replayed <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, which he helped write and produce, before making <em>Fantasian </em>and considered both games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/fantasian-tied-final-fantasy-6-hironobu-sakaguchi-love-family?amp=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantasian-tied-final-fantasy-6-hironobu-sakaguchi-love-family?amp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kindred spirits through their mutual focus on family</a></span>. </p><p>But his next project will apparently feel even more closely inspired by one of his old franchise’s peak games. “It’s generally going to follow a similar style to my previous works, and it’ll be something that can be a successor to<em> Final Fantasy VI</em> in a good way—our goal is to create something old but new at the same time,” the veteran creator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently told <em>The Verge</em></a></span>. “It’ll be part two of my farewell note.”</p><p>Sakaguchi said he had intended for <em>Fantasian</em> to be his final game, but had too much fun working with the team behind it to actually retire when it was done. “Humans are greedy creatures, aren’t we?” he told <em>The Verge</em>. “For that reason, I’m currently working on a new project with the same team that worked on <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>.” </p><p>We don’t yet know what being a successor to<em> Final Fantasy VI </em>will mean for Mistalker’s next game. Retro HD-2D graphics? A sprawling cast of disparate characters brought together through shared tragedy and common purpose? A show-stopping opera scene foiled by a giant octopus? Or maybe Sakaguchi intends the connection to be more subtle and philosophical than that. </p><p>Fans will always pine for the direct sequel to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-hd-2d-dragon-quest-3-square-enix-1851702829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-hd-2d-dragon-quest-3-square-enix-1851702829">they’ve dreamed of but never got</a></span>. The legendary RPG maker, on the other hand, has much grander ambitions. He said, “In the distant future, or maybe after I have already left this world, I imagine this game will find its meaning if someone chooses to look into the legacy of either myself or <em>Final Fantasy</em>.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/martha-is-dead-playstation-cut-content-face-peeling-masturbation/">Wired Productions</a> and Pollar Studio have released the first of three trailers for Karma: The Dark World in the lead-up to the release of the title. Karma: The Dark World is an upcoming first-person psychological horror that's set to channel iconic movie and game directors such as Lynch, Kojima, and Nolan. The first trailer is called 'ROAM.' At the moment, the release date for Karma: The Dark World still hasn't been announced, but it's said that it will soon be announced, most likely coinciding with the trailers that will be released. You can watch the brand-new trailer for the game below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KARMA: The Dark World | ROAM Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQA9fdoVetQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As said above, this is the first of three trailers to be released for Karma: The Dark World, with the developers planning to release them to release key aspects of the game's story, as well as showing off the immersive world and intense gameplay mechanics that you'll have to contend with when playing the game. This first trailer is used to set the stage for the game, so players know what they are getting into when jumping into this first-person psychological horror.</p>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of director David Lynch. His art has had a profound influence on our game development, inspiring us to pay tribute to and learn from his work," said Ke Yang, Art Director of Pollard Studio. Even in the above trailer released, a quote by the iconic director is used to help set the scene.</p>
<p>For those who are hearing about this game for the first time, Karma: The Dark World is a psychological horror title where players will be playing as a Roam Agent and investigating the deepest and darkest secrets of their suspects' minds. The game takes place in an alternate timeline after the war in Germany. In the alternate timeline, Germany has instead fallen into a dystopian state that is ruled over by the Leviathan Corporation. The corporation uses mass surveillance and mind-bending technology to keep an eye on the citizens of the country, providing no privacy at all. Playing as Daniel McGovern, you investigate crime scenes and interview suspects to then report your findings back to Leviathan. However, it's not quite as it seems, and the world begins to crumble around him, where he doubts everything and anyone, including himself.</p>
<p>Karma: The Dark World has been developed in Unreal Engine 5 and will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1376200/KARMA_The_Dark_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released soon on PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Karma: The Dark World when it releases?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cheating-in-valorant-spiked-during-riots-holiday-break/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the the weeks before and after the start of 2025, when Riot Games employees are taking their annual holiday rest, recorded instances of cheating in VALORANT doubled across all regions. While the rise in cheating is now under control, the spike shows that it is a never-ending battle between developer and cheater.</p>



<p>But how did cheating in VALORANT get so bad during the holiday break? The head of VALORANT’s anti-cheat explained in a <a href="https://x.com/deteccphilippe/status/1883945555102957617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy post</a> yesterday.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheating-in-valorant-reached-historic-levels-in-brazil">Cheating in VALORANT Reached Historic Levels in Brazil</h2>



<p>According to head of VALORANT anti-cheat Phillip “mirageofpenguins” Koskinas, Riot’s holiday break opened the door for cheaters to take advantage. During this time, with less resources and people available to detect cheaters and roll out fixes, “the cheaters that weren’t immediately detected started multiplying.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via @deteccphilippe on X.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From the days before Christmas through the first week of January, the percentage of matches with a cheater detected rose in all regions, but none as dramatically as Brazil. In Brazil, which already had the highest percentage of cheaters of any region, the percentage of matches with a cheater spiked from just under 5% to around 12%. According to Riot, Brazil cheaters regularly use a “pixelbot” that reads the screen, identifies enemy outlines and heads, and then submits mouse events to the OS that points the cheater towards that enemy.</p>



<p>The pixelbot cheats popular amongst Brazil cheaters are supposedly cheap and easy to install, but Riot says they’re also easy to spot. Once the Riot holiday break ended and normal anti-cheat detection resumed, the cheater percentage in Brazil (and other regions) dropped dramatically to a lower level than it was before the break. Riot says the the January 10-13 weekend featured its “highest sustained ban velocity on record, with almost seven suspensions occurring every minute.”</p>



<p>In yesterday’s post, Riot admitted that the fight against cheaters will never end. Because VALORANT is free and there’s little to no barrier to entry, no cheater can be truly permanently exiled. While Riot team remains committed to disrupting cheaters, they also plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-2025-new-agents-more-map-variety-ranked-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implement ranked rollback in the next act</a>, which restore rank rating to players that lost against caught cheaters.</p>

It will launch on March 18, with early access for Digital Deluxe Edition buyers beginning March 14. Unlike previous years, <em>MLB The Show 25</em> will not be available via Game Pass. <span id="more-940834"></span></p><p>Paul Skenes, Elly De La Cruz, and Gunnar Henderson will be featured on <em>MLB The Show 25</em>‘s first-ever three-athlete cover. Here are short profiles for each player:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Paul Skenes</strong>&nbsp;– Paul Skenes’ journey began in high school and continued through college, where he cemented his status as one of the most talented young pitchers in baseball by winning a national championship before being selected as the No. 1 overall pick by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2023 MLB Draft. The following season, Skenes made his MLB debut and became the first player in MLB history to start the All-Star Game just one year after being drafted. He capped off an incredible 2024 season by earning National League Rookie of the Year honors and being named to the All-MLB First Team. His story and skillset align perfectly with Road to the Show, where you can chart your own path to greatness.</li><li><strong>Elly De La Cruz</strong> – Elly De La Cruz’s meteoric rise from the minors to the majors perfectly captures the excitement of working up to a big league debut and becoming a star. Since making his Major League debut in 2023 with the Cincinnati Reds, Elly has consistently proven to be one of the most electrifying players on the field. He became one of the youngest players in MLB history to hit for the cycle and is renowned for his blazing speed on the bases and his cannon-like arm, further cementing his status as one of the league’s most promising talents. The 2024 All-Star showcases an impressive five-tool skillset and a dynamic switch-hitting approach—exactly what <em>MLB The Show</em> fans dream of when developing or acquiring their starting shortstop in Franchise mode.</li><li><strong>Gunnar Henderson</strong> – Rounding out this triple play of talent is the 2023 American League Rookie of the Year, Gunnar Henderson. Selected 42nd overall in the 2019 MLB Draft, Gunnar quickly ascended through the Orioles’ farm system, making his MLB debut late in the 2022 season. Heading into 2023, he was named the #1 prospect on MLB’s Top 100 list. In his first full season in the majors, Gunnar became a cornerstone of the Orioles’ young core, helping lead the team to its first postseason appearance in seven years. His outstanding performance earned him AL Rookie of the Year honors and a Silver Slugger Award. Gunnar’s star continued to rise in 2024, as he was selected to start in the MLB All-Star Game and compete in the Home Run Derby. His MLB journey resonates deeply with <em>MLB The Show</em> fans who strive to dominate head-to-head competition in their pursuit of greatness on the diamond.</li></ul></blockquote><p>And here is a short description of the game:</p><!-- AD: content -->

This rules out the game being added to PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass this year, but it's still possible that it could be added to gaming subscriptions in 2026 and beyond. This is a big departure given that when the series went multiplatform starting with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-mlb-the-show-21-is-included-on-xbox-game-pass-on-april-20/1100-6489677/" data-ref-id="1100-6489677">MLB The Show 21</a>, it and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-biggest-games-of-the-year-will-be-on-game-pass-again/1100-6520708/" data-ref-id="1100-6520708">each subsequent entry</a> also released for Xbox Game Pass on launch day.</p><p>Preorders start on February 4, and those who preorder the Digital Deluxe Edition will receive early access to the game on March 14. You can also sign up for the MLB The Show Scouting Report. Starting in April 2025, subscribers will receive a unique pack each month filled with in-game rewards through December 2025.</p><p>MLB The Show 25's first gameplay trailer will be revealed on February 4 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET, along with a features deep dive from MLB Network host Robert Flores at a later date.</p>

			<p>fYesterday, Polish developer People Can Fly <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it is co-developing the upcoming prequel Gears of War: E-Day with The Coalition. People Can Fly has a long history with the franchise, having ported the first installment to PC and having led the development of Gears of War: Judgment, so it's a return home in a way for them.</p>
<p>PCF CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski stated:</p>
<p><em>Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.</em></p>
<p>Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF, said:</p>
<p><em>Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations. While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.</em></p>
<p>Mike Crump, Studio Head at The Coalition, added:</p>
<p><em>Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic. We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, Gears of War: E-Day will take fans back fourteen years before the events of the first entry, to Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde first emerged from the underground of the planet Sera to wreak havoc among humans. This will provide the chance to explore the beginning of the narrative as well as the birth of the close friendship between Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago.</p>
<p>No&nbsp;<span>official release window has been provided yet, although rumors&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point</a> to a launch sometime this year—and a PlayStation 5 port <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also be on the cards</a></span>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-vegas-mod-fallout-nuevo-mexico-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lead developer on ambitious-looking <i>Fallout: New Vegas&nbsp;</i>mod<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has canceled the project in order to prioritize his "mental health" and to "face reality".</p>

<p>In a message shared on the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), developer Zapshock says that while&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has been his "passion" and "obsession" for years, the project's workload and costs are "too great".</p>

<p>As such, continuing with&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>'s development "simply isn't sustainable for [Zapshock] and everyone involved, including voice actors", and so the decision was made to cancel the project. Zapshock says the decision was "painful", but "necessary".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=1SqRHiLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=EcpTjdIf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ambitious&nbsp;<em>New Vegas&nbsp;</em>mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has sadly been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Before its cancellation,&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>was set to be a mod roughly the size of one of the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series' DLC packs, and it would have taken you to the US state of New Mexico, as the name suggests.</p>

<p>The mod was to be set five years after the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, putting it several decades before the events of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>, both of which take place as humanity is beginning to rebuild something resembling a coherent society.</p>

<p>Per a Game Rant <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-new-vegas-mods-good-nuevo-mexico-scripting/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> from February last year, the modders were planning to include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>-style origins for characters in&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, including one for a ghoul character, which would have fundamentally changed the mod's gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Honestly, it sounds to me like it's no wonder the mod was canceled; Zapshock and his team clearly had an insane level of ambition for&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, and with just four people working on the project, they were bound to burn out sooner or later.</p>




<p><em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod to have been canceled in recent months; back in October, the developers of&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, a mod that attempted to remake the entirety of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>in the fourth game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended" rel="nofollow">shut down their mod</a> due to "a combination of factors".</p>

<p>If you are looking for a DLC-sized&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod experience, however, all is not lost. There's still&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now" rel="nofollow">launched in July last year</a>&nbsp;and which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow">attracted a million downloads</a> by October. It's a&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod, though, so you'll need the base game to play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/598008/atari-nubeo-asteroids-watch-retro-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Atari has released a collection of new watches with a unique design that celebrates the 45th anniversary of <em>Asteroids</em>. In the original version of the game that debuted in 1979, spotting and shooting a passing UFO would earn you extra points. On the Asteroids watch, a pair of orbiting UFOs are less of a threat and are instead used to represent the hour and minute hands — no numbers needed.</p><p>Created in collaboration with watchmaker Nubeo (which previously released a collection of <a href="https://nubeowatches.com/collections/space-invaders-limited-edition"><em>Space Invaders</em>-themed timepieces</a>) the new Asteroids collection features five styles, each with a differently colored band — nebula blue, plasma pumpkin, supernova red, nova nightfall, and celestial citrine — and varying colors for the watchface elements. They’re <a href="https://nubeowatches.com/collections/atari-limited-edition">available through Nubeo’s website</a>, which lists each watch’s price as being discounted to $499 from $1,650. You can also <a href="https://atari.com/collections/atari-x-nubeo-watches">order them through Atari’s website</a>, which just lists the price as $499 each, although some have already sold out. Each style is limited to just 125 pieces.</p><p>The watch uses a Japanese automatic movement that powers three spinning discs. The smallest features a recreation of the game’s simple triangular spaceship in the center that serves as the watch’s second hand, while two larger discs, rotating at different speeds, portray asteroids drifting through space and the UFOs that function as the hour and minute hands.</p><p>All of the graphical elements on the Asteroids watch’s face are printed with glow-in-the-dark “Swiss Super-LumiNova” pigments and are protected beneath a durable sapphire lens and a stainless steel case. The watch is water resistant with a 21 ATM (atmosphere) rating and a screw-down crown, making it durable enough for recreational diving. It comes in a protective case with an interior that borrows design elements from the Atari Video Computer System (VCS) that launched in 1977.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Did you have a tamagotchi as a kid? I did, and yes, I too let it die. I am thankful that the handheld LCD graphics of the era did not allow me to witness my companion blob's amiable decline into shit-caked starvation. I am also thankful that my tamagotchi did not itself have a tamagotchi, because the only life principle I ever taught my tamagotchi was neglect. This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Before I peel back the metafictional layers I guess I should tell you briefly about Yolk Heroes itself, which featured in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yolk-heroes-a-long-tamago">one of Alice0's (RPS in peace) screenshot round-ups</a>, many moons ago. The gist: some Dark Lord is causing a nuisance. The Fairy Queen has tasked you with hatching out and nurturing an Elf hero to take the villain down. I'm not as familiar with elf reproduction as I should be but I've played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and I'm 75% sure elves don't come from eggs. Still, I like the looks of the game's "idle RPG" malarkey. It sounds like I'll have plenty of time to get the laundry done while my chickelf is busy grinding level-1 rats.
</p>
<p>
"Part digital pet game, part RPG adventure, and part casual idle game, Yolk Heroes is a charming blend of many different elements," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417850/Yolk_Heroes_A_Long_Tamago/">Steam page</a> explains. "Quest and grind to protect the citizens of the realm, or simply enjoy your digital friend!" Here be tray-tray to wash that down. Game Boy Color-flavoured art direction = good.

Hearty, innocent fun, you might think. The user reviews certainly paint a rosy picture. But now for the horrifying twist: the devs are making another virtual pet game called Poke Place, rendered in simpler monochrome pixelart. It fits snugly inside Yolk Heroes, "so your Virtual Pet can have Virtual Pets". 
</p><p>
"You know you've always wanted this!" explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2417850/view/547851035326023072?l=english">a new Steam post</a>, with an air of jovial malice so concentrated I can feel my skin exfoliating as I read. "Poke place is pronounced to rhyme with yolk. Poke being slang for little buddy and all that. It won't have any plot importance, but it will have the importance of getting to raise a little fairy thing! Also, some of the best pixel art we did for the project but ended up being cut from the main game is being re-used to give it some real pizzazz!"
</p>
<p>
While games-within-the-game aren't unusual - even Call Of Duty likes to Nolan it up now and then - the disturbing element here is that Poke Place is billed as a game for your Virtual Pet, not you. Will your chickelf treat the "little fairy thing" as they themselves were treated? Is this where our fond technological ambitions have led us, to a place where tamagotchis are smart enough to let their own tamagotchis perish in a cascade of doleful emojis and poop?</p>
<p>Ah, but perhaps the tamagotchis will learn different lessons from our colossal frivolity and apathy. Perhaps your chickelf will strive to be a better custodian and mentor for their fairy sprog than you ever were for them. Honestly, this sounds worse: your virtual pet is going to make you feel bad about yourself. It's a facet of the AI utopia/dystopia debate I hadn't considered.
</p>
<p>
It's not clear when Poke Place will be added to Yolk Heroes, but 14 Hours Productions are hoping to release the update later this year. No guarantees, though, because "the lead developer on it also has a full time job NOT working on cute games like this, so it's a bit slow going! Bills are hard!" Fair play. I will end this with the thought that while I've played many a game-within-the-game, I've yet to play a game-within-the-game-within-the-game. I suspect this idea has probably occurred to 14 Hours Productions. I hope they give that "little fairy thing" a virtual pet game too, so that my chickelf can experience the terrible vertigo I'm feeling right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<div><p>Following 185 layoffs and a studio shutdown, Ubisoft has sent an internal memo to staff via its Agoro Newsroom about the recent layoffs, saying that the decision was made due to “finding more efficient operating models and to ensure our long-term success.”</p><p>The internal memo confirms that approximately 65 positions where eliminated at Ubisoft Dusseldorf, approximately 100 roles are effected at Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Reflections, and approximately 20 roles at Ubisoft Stockholm, taking the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-another-studio-185-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total to 185 people laid off</a>. In addition, Ubisoft’s Leamington site would be shut down.</p></div>



<p>The update reads,</p>



<p>“Jeff Combos, Studio Manager of Ubisoft Dusseldorf, informed the studio yesterday about a plan to reduce its headcount by approximately 65 positions. Most of these reductions would affect production roles currently not assigned to active development for a prolonged period of time. The studios in Berlin and Mainz are not affected.</p>



<p>Also yesterday, Lisa Opie, Managing Director of the UK studios informed the teams about planned restructuring measures aimed at ensuring Reflections’ long-term stability and meeting its financial targets. Approximately 100 roles could be made redundant across Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Reflections. Additionally, this proposal also includes the decision to close the Leamington site.</p>



<p>“I understand the uncertainty these changes will bring. We are committed to supporting everyone who may be impacted during this transition. Let me assure you, these decisions were not made lightly. We believe they are essential to improve our operational efficiency and ensure the long-term sustainability of our studios, the zone and the company,” says Benedikt Grindel, Production Zone 4 Managing Director.</p>



<p>In parallel, Ubisoft Stockholm announced yesterday its plan to reduce approximately 20 roles. This step is necessary to secure the studio’s long-term success and refine the studio strategy.</p>



<p>Individual meetings were held with affected employees yesterday.</p>



<p>“We know that this decision impacts more than just the studio and its projects; it impacts people-our colleagues, teammates, and friends. We deeply understand how difficult this is, and supporting everyone through this transition is our utmost priority,” Thomas Andren, Production Zone 3 and Stockholm studio Managing Director, said yesterday in his message to the team.</p>



<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>



<p>All the team members that are affected have already been informed, and necessary processes are underway depending on the labor laws in each country.</p>



<p>While difficult, the changes announced yesterday are targeted at us finding more efficient operating models and to ensure our long-term success. This is driven by a strong conviction: our ability to keep creating and operating unique, powerful, and popular brands that extend beyond video games.”</p>



<p>Speaking with both current and former employee’s at Ubisoft, it’s currently unclear on if any Ubisoft projects where effected with the recent layoffs. It’s understood that Ubisoft Reflections are primarily developing an unannounced WW2 live-service extraction shooter named CREST, which was supported by some staff at Ubisoft Leamington. Ubisoft Leamington staff where working on Avatar content.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft is currently in the process of exploring its options to stay afloat, including a potential deal with&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese company Tencent</a>, where both companies are in talks for a new venture centered around Ubisoft’s current assets.</p>



<p>When asked for comment on whether or not any projects were cancelled, a Ubisoft spokesperson declined to comment.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is one of the largest and most well-known video game companies in the world. Known for franchises such as EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Battlefield, and more, EA’s presence in the industry is felt almost everywhere. Because of that, EA’s earnings reports are closely watched by analysts, investors, and consumers alike. </p>



<p>That makes it important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into EA’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and general outlooks for the months ahead.</p>



<p>What is EA’s focus on the heels of recent game releases? What are investors looking for? Are there any concerns or roadblocks? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-ea-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next EA Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its third quarter (Q3) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2025 on Tuesday, February 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to why the company is releasing its third quarter earnings in February, EA—like many companies—has a fiscal calendar that runs from April 1-March 31. Their third quarter runs from October 1-December 31, meaning the latest call will include information from the holiday sales season.</p>

<ul>
<li>Q1: April 1 – June 30</li>



<li>Q2: July 1 – September 30</li>



<li>Q3: October 1 – December 31</li>



<li>Q4: January 1 – March 31</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-ea-earnings-report-start-time">Next EA Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next EA earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5PM ET/2PM PT on February 4, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-ea-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To EA’s  Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to EA’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via the company’s website. Simply do the following:</p>

<li>Under “Upcoming &amp; Recent Events”, select “Webcast” for the Q3 2025 Earnings Call</li>
</ol>

There will also be updates on currently known in-development games from the company as well as a lookback at games that were released during the current fiscal year. Lastly, the company prepared investors for lower-than-expected net bookings after it revealed that both EA Sports FC 25 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed</a> to meet internal revenue expectations.</p>



<p>With the lower results, EA adjusted its expected net bookings for the quarter from $2.4-$2.5 billion to $2.21 billion.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-ea-earnings-report">The Last EA Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When EA announced its earnings for Q2 FY2025 last October, it was revealed that the company broke a record for Q2 net bookings of $2.08 billion. It was also mentioned that the company expected American Football to generate over $1 billion alone in net bookings for FY2025. Lastly, EA said that 74% of all net bookings for the prior 12 months came via Live Services.</p>

<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>
