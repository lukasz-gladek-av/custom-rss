            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241275/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-apple-watch-ultra-2-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In case you missed the news, <strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong> subscriptions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">recently went up in price</a> with the rollout of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241171/xbox-game-pass-standard-launch-pricing">new “Standard” tier</a>, which doesn’t include day-one access to first-party Xbox games. Thankfully, if you’re still keen on an Ultimate membership, CDKeys is offering <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fxbox-live%2F1-month-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-xbox-one-pc">one-month subscription codes</a> for $11.19 ($9 off) and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fxbox-live%2F3-month-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-xbox-one-pc">three-month codes</a> for $29.79&nbsp;(about $30 off). These aren’t the lowest prices we’ve seen, but they sure beat paying the subscription’s new price of $19.99 a month.</p><p>If you need a refresher, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate grants access to a massive library of downloadable games for Xbox consoles and PCs. Naturally, that includes first-party titles&nbsp;like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a><em>&nbsp;and </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23589879/hi-fi-rush-making-of-interview-xbox"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a> but also great third-party games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a>. It’ll also grant you access to highly anticipated games due to be released soon, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173655/xbox-fable-game-release-date-2025-trailer"><em>Fable</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24174839/perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-microsoft"><em>Perfect Dark</em></a>, and other games that’ll be available within the next year or so. An Ultimate subscription also provides access to other perks including&nbsp;exclusive deals, an EA Play membership, and online multiplayer, making it a great value overall, especially at this discounted price.</p><p>We’re aware CDKeys isn’t a well-known merchant, but it’s a trusted retailer here at <em>The Verge </em>that often sells discounted gaming codes. That being said, if you would feel more comfortable making a purchase from a more reputable seller, Woot is offering <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5">three-month subscription codes for $36.49</a> and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5">one-month codes for $13.79</a> until 1:59AM PT on September 14th.</p><div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to more than 100 titles, including new first-party releases on day one, which you can play on multiple devices. The pass also gives subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join nearly 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more ways to save</h3></p><div><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24239740/apple-watch-ultra-specs-price-features-release-date">black <strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2</strong></a> is set to arrive on September 20th, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSV8JVJP/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> is currently selling it in its original color for $689 ($110 off).

The Ultra 2 features Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband&nbsp;chips, too, allowing you to take advantage of on-device Siri processing and Apple’s handy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23928706/double-tap-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2">double tap gesture</a>, among other features.

The budget-friendly tablet starts with 64GB of storage and ads and features an eight-inch 1280 x 800 screen. That’s not as crisp as the display found on Amazon’s higher-end Fire tablets, but it’s sharper than the Fire HD 7 and good enough for basic entertainment needs. It also sports a relatively long battery life, making it a decent buy if you’re looking for an inexpensive device for watching TV or surfing the web. </li><li>You can buy<strong> AeroGarden’s Harvest 2.0 </strong>on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AeroGarden-Harvest-Indoor-Garden-Hydroponic/dp/B0D23ZGY5L?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> for $72 ($18 off), which is its third-best price to date. If you’re new to gardening or are just looking for something relatively low-maintenance, I can’t recommend the AeroGarden enough. The LED-equipped planter is easy to use, with six pods that can grow vegetables, flowers, and herbs. You’ll have to buy most seed pods separately, but AeroGarden does include a complimentary starter kit and a bonus packet of lettuce seeds, so you can get started growing your indoor garden immediately. </li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The PS5 Pro is now a fast-approaching reality. The $700 mid-generation upgrade arrives on November 7, approximately a year in advance of the game that will likely push the four-years-old base PS5 to its very limits: Grand Theft Auto 6. But how essential will the PS5 Pro be to enjoying GTA 6 at its very best? It’s a question more complicated than it first seems.</p><p>“I think there's good evidence to suggest that the [GTA 6 trailer from last year] was running on either PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X,” says Richard Leadbetter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/authors/richard-leadbetter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology editor at Digital Foundry</a>. As such, the impressive level of graphical detail seen in that trailer should be achievable using the power of the original 2020 model PlayStation 5. It stands to reason, then, that the new PS5 Pro will be more than capable of delivering what we saw in that short glimpse of Vice City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Frame rates, though, are an entirely different thing. When asked if GTA 6 could realistically run at 60 frames-per-second on the PS5 Pro, Leadbetter is blunt in his analysis: “No. Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30fps (or lower!). </p><p>“The PS5 Pro uses the same CPU as the PS5 and it would be extremely challenging to hit 60fps if the base PS5 version is targeting 30fps,” he explains. “This isn't a GPU problem, it's a CPU problem.” </p><p>There’s a multitude of simulation work running concurrently and constantly in GTA to keep its open world ticking. Every street is, at the very minimum, a stage for complex traffic and pedestrian simulations – AI routines and physics calculations that bring those roads and sidewalks to life. GTA 6 will very likely feature one of the most realistic depictions of city life we’ve seen in a video game, and so will be significantly taxing on the CPU as it renders all sorts of NPC behaviours. That leaves little bandwidth to boost those frame rates. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30fps.</p></div><p>Still, thanks to the PS5 Pro’s other enhancements, GTA 6 will undoubtedly look better on the new console. It just likely will not be the 4K 60fps experience many will be expecting following Sony’s boastful presentation. “What you will get will be higher quality visuals, but likely still running at similar frame-rates [to the base console],” says Leadbetter. “If GTA 6 can't sustain a locked 30fps (GTA 4 and GTA 5 couldn't on PS3 and Xbox 360), PS5 Pro can run the CPU with a 10 percent bump to clock speeds – so you may get more stable performance.</p><p>“Of course, all bets are off if Rockstar is targeting 60fps on the standard PS5 - but we've seen no evidence so far to suggest it is.” </p><p>While it seems unlikely that the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 4K 60fps, there’s still reason to believe the new console will prove an impressive machine. Right now, though, there’s little evidence of its transformative abilities. “I think the hardware's certainly capable, but the actual presentation confused me,” says Leadbetter. “Nine minutes just isn't really enough to describe in depth the features the machine has and the philosophy behind the design.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Leadbetter also notes that the games showcased during the presentation were already fantastic graphical showcases in their original forms, and so were not ideal demonstrations of the Pro’s machine learning-based upscaling technology. Why was it the already gorgeous Horizon Forbidden West and Spider-Man 2 being shown off when we could have seen how transformative PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution could be for games that have shaky image quality on the standard PS5? </p><p>“Combine that with poor presentational techniques and YouTube's inadequacies as a video delivery platform and you didn't see much of an improvement,” says Leadbetter.  </p><p>While Sony has chosen to so far only preview enhancements to games that barely require them in the first place, we can at least be relatively confident that those titles in desperate need of a performance boost will be catered for. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> states that up to 8,500 games will be improved thanks to the PS5 Pro Game Boost feature. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We might even <em>finally</em> get Elden Ring locked to 60 frames per second.</p></div><p>“I think [the improvements will] be quite cool actually, assuming the extra 45 percent of GPU power is fully available to existing games,” enthuses Leadbetter. “Many titles have dynamic resolution scaling. You should see clear image quality improvements there. Similarly, a lot of games have frame-rate issues in their 60fps performance modes – I'd expect those to be cleaned up. We might even finally get Elden Ring locked to 60 frames per second.”</p><p>One thing Leadbetter thinks is less likely to make an impact is the Pro’s 8K capabilities. While he foresees a very small number of tech-focused developers, like Gran Turismo 7 creator Polyphony Digital, making 8K resolution options available for PS5 Pro, he doubts other studios will work on such modes “because the audience out there is vanishingly small.” </p><p>“I had an 8K screen for four years, but even as an RTX 4090 owner, I have little interest in 8K gaming when high frame-rates at max 4K are so much more desirable,” he says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p>Talking of Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards, PC gaming has been the much-debated topic following Sony’s reveal of the PS5 Pro’s eye-watering $699.99 price tag. I’ve seen several suggestions across social media that it’s better value to just save up a ‘little extra’ money and buy a PC that will prove more powerful than the PS5 Pro. It’s an argument I personally think is flawed – a strong 4K, high frame-rate PC will set you back notably more money than the cost of the new console. And, when it’s built, it simply won’t be capable of doing the thing many prospective PS5 Pro owners want: playing GTA 6 at launch with the best possible graphics. (GTA 6 will ship on console first, remember.)</p><p>Leadbetter has a similar outlook. “You will struggle to get that kind of visual quality on a similarly priced PC,” he says. “The closest GPU on the market now with that kind of feature set and performance is the RTX 4070 – which is a fair bit better, I'd say. But your base cost there is $540/£480. And then you need to factor in CPU, motherboard, memory, storage, power supply and case. </p><p>“You could offset the extra cost against the fact that you don't need extra subscription costs over time, I suppose, but I think you're missing the fundamental point of what PS5 Pro is and who is going to buy it.</p><p>“It's a console, not a PC – and there are still key differences there, not least in a viable living room experience. I'd also say the Pro is designed to appeal to core PlayStation users with a library built up over many years. That library will not transition over to PC so those users are effectively starting from scratch.”</p><p>Of course, that’s not to say that the PS5 Pro is a ‘good deal’. “That user base likely has a physical game library, too – so the notion you don't even get a disc drive for your £699/$699 is nuts,” Leadbetter concludes. </p><p>There may be other people looking at the PS5 Pro and failing to see a good value proposition, too, although for entirely other reasons. “I think Phil Spencer watched the presentation and felt vindicated in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-reiterates-there-is-no-need-for-a-mid-generation-refresh-for-xbox-series-xs-right-now">decision not to make a 'pro' console for this generation</a>,” Leadbetter theories. “Xbox players already have a great way to play high-end Xbox games – and that's on PC, where the enthusiast has more freedom to pick and choose the kind of hardware they want.” </p><p>It’s true: Microsoft has been running three different platforms from the very start of the generation, offering a solution for players of all tastes and budgets. It is arguably Xbox’s biggest advantage over PlayStation. Who needs a Series X-X when you can play Starfield at 4K60 on a PC? <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-runs-at-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-and-s-obsidian-confirms">Avowed’s 30fps lock</a> simply isn’t a problem if you’ve already shelled out for an RTX 40-series graphics card. </p><p>But, as we’ve already said, the PS5 Pro is not a PC. It’s a different beast entirely. Is it the console the PlayStation hardcore needs, though? Let's see how fast it flies off the shelves this November. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

      </div>
<p>Epic released this statement to clarify Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's usage of an Epic online services. The game installs an Epic Online Services client after the player accepts a EULA, even on Steam. Developer Focus confirmed in a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a> that the Epic client facilitates optional cross-play and syncs friend lists across services. However, linking Steam and Epic accounts is completely optional and will not affect gameplay.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/maligned-epic-account-login-requirement-results-in-new-steam-game-getting-review-bombed/1100-6525349/" data-ref-id="1100-6525349">Earth Defense Force 6 got criticized</a> for requiring an Epic Games login for online play. Helldivers 2 faced similar complaints for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">requiring a PSN login</a>. As for Space Marine 2, the sequel has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-is-already-breaking-franchise-records/1100-6526389/" data-ref-id="1100-6526389">broken Warhammer records</a>. Nearly a quarter-million players booted the game up on Steam, besting Total Warhammer III's previous concurrent player-count.</p>

Here is a list of all the included weapon and item packs:</p><ul><li>Deadly Weapons Pack</li><li>Memories of Banoi Pack</li><li>Golden Weapons Pack</li><li>Pulp Weapons Pack</li><li>Red’s Demise Pack</li><li>6 Slayer's Premium Skin Packs</li></ul><p>Preorders for the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of Dead Island 2: Ultimate Edition are available for $70 at Best Buy.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you missed it when it first came out, Dead Island 2 is a horror-action first-person game that unfolds in Los Angeles after the city was overrun with zombies. It has a great sense of humor, plenty of interesting gameplay systems, and it's one of the best 7/10 games of 2023. Basically, it has a few annoyances, but the positives far outweigh the negatives.</p><p>"Games labeled as being in "development hell" rarely release in a state anyone would want to experience--if they release at all. With Dead Island 2, however, Dambuster Studios kicks away a decade of dev hell problems like they’re a zombie lunging for its throat to deliver an undead RPG that is surely imperfect, but also enjoyable and even inventive," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-island-2-review-eat-the-rich/1900-6418055/" data-ref-id="1900-6418055">Dead Island 2 review</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-the-complete-1997-tv-series-is-only-37-at-amazon-best-price-yet/1100-6524954/">Berserk: The Complete 1997 TV Series Is Only $37 At Amazon, Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Thanks to Sony’s new refurbished website for PS5s, you’ll soon be able to buy an older version of the console for a lot less money than the PS5 Pro’s eye-watering cost.</p><p>You can see everything that’s on offer on Sony’s <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/certified-refurbished">certified refurbished website</a>, which lists a bunch of products as “coming soon.” A refurbished PS5 in the original launch design with a disc drive will cost $399.99 (a $100 discount from a new PS5 slim with a disc drive), while a refurbished all-digital PS5, also in the original design, will cost $349.99 (also a $100 discount).</p><p>The store features refurbished DualSense controllers, too, with white and black controllers for $59.99 and purple, pink, and gray camo controllers priced at $64.99. (Those prices are a $15 discount off the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24239722/sonys-ps5-controllers-get-a-5-increase">newly bumped DualSense controller cost</a>.)</p><p>“Every PlayStation certified refurbished product completes a rigorous recertification process that includes full testing that meets the same functional standards as new PlayStation products,” according to Sony. “Your certified refurbished product works like new.” However, in a footnote, Sony says the refurbished products “may have minor cosmetic imperfections.” The refurbished products will also come with a one-year limited warranty.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But merch lines like the Original Stitch collaboration (RIP) and the Sitting Cuties plush line are giving everyone a chance to own some cute, affordable, official representation of their favorite Pokémon. Now, The Pokémon Company is releasing the Generation VI Sitting Cuties plushies, so if your favorite ‘mon is from the Kalos region in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em>, your chance to grab a plush for them has finally arrived.<br></p><p>The new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552">Kalos</a></span> plushies cover Pokémon #650 to #721. That’s Chespin to Volcanion. However, the latest Sitting Cuties additions include a lot more plushies, with every variation of Vivillon and Furfrou in the mix as well. Vivillon is a butterfly with wing patterns that differed depending on where the player was geographically when it evolved, while Furfrou could take on one of ten different appearances if you trimmed its hair. The Pokémon Center made plushies for all of these, on top of every other Pokémon that debuted in <em>X </em>and <em>Y</em>. Surprisingly, it didn’t go a step further and make plushies of the Mega Evolutions that were introduced in Gen VI, but the standard forms of all those Pokémon have been represented with a Sitting Cutie plush.</p><p>As the name implies, the Sitting Cuties line is meant to sit comfortably on a desk. While some Pokémon designs aren’t usually meant to sit, The Pokémon Company has found a way to make it work for most of them. Others just kinda lay there. The full line is available now on<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-is-the-700-ps5-pro-for.978171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/who-is-700-ps5-pro-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony announced the long-awaited PlayStation 5 Pro this week, and with it came an onslaught of discourse about one particular point: the PS5 Pro price. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november">Retailing for $699 this November</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro is the most expensive console of the modern gaming age, pricing out fans who might have considered buying it.</p>
<p>So, who is the PlayStation 5 Pro for? The 60 million players who have already spent up to $500 for the base PS5 won't exactly be eager to shell out another $700 after only four years. And those who haven't bought into the PlayStation ecosystem may be hard pressed to pay the premium price for what the PS5 Pro promises.</p>
<p>I've written before about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/who-is-audience-for-sonys-project-q-streaming-device">who the PlayStation Portal was meant for</a>, and now I'm having similar questions about this new console. Who is willing to pay this high price, and will the product's performance be worth the cost of admission?</p>

<h2>Does the Performance Boost Justify the PS5 Pro Price? </h2>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8&amp;t=467s&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation">PS5 Pro presentation</a>, PlayStation 5 architect Mark Cerny said that 75% of players prefer playing their games on Performance mode, prioritizing 60 FPS over 4K visuals. The PS5 Pro is supposed to bridge that gap and add in better fidelity options with advanced ray-tracing while maintaining 60 FPS. </p>
<p>Games like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> </i>and <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part 2</a> </i>look genuinely better, creating some excitement over what the PS5 Pro is capable of. Other games, like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</a> </i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2"><i>Marvel's</i> <i>Spider-Man 2</i></a>, looked less impressive.</p>
<p>During the PS5 Pro showcase, Cerny was zooming in on leaves in&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em><i>&nbsp;</i>to show how much sharper the pixels are. Is this something the average gamer will notice when viewing from several feet away on a large TV, often while quickly zipping through the environment? </p>
<p>A console that can handle 4K/60 FPS has been something the PlayStation community has wanted for a while, but it's also something many agree that the console we got four years ago should have been able to deliver on this. Plus, even with the higher PS5 Pro price, we're missing some key elements that are sure to be missed.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-pro-price.jpg?itok=lVmtzGj1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-pro-price.jpg?itok=-tealOaX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least they're up front about the vertical stand being sold separately?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>PS5 Pro Shortcomings: No Disc Drive &amp; No Stand <span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>As hefty as the $699 price tag is, the PS5 Pro comes in a digital-only configuration with no disc drive and no vertical stand. These accessories are priced at $80 and $30 respectively, bringing the total PS5 Pro price to roughly $810 before tax. Want an extra controller or even a <a href="https://techraptor.net/platform/playstation-vr-2">PS VR2</a> peripheral? We're looking at well over a thousand dollars. </p>
<p>This pricing is extremely reminiscent of the PlayStation 3 launching at $599 back in 2006, but even the PS3 came with a Blu-Ray player, an expensive device that had yet to become a mainstream media player. By not including a disc drive or even a stand, Sony is rolling back some of the things we used to expect as standard features in our consoles. </p>
<p>The three selling points are all internal upgrades: </p>
<ul><li>A larger GPU with 45% faster rendering than the PS5</li>
<li>Advanced Ray-Tracing</li>
<li>AI-Driven Upscaling with PlayStation Spectral Super Sampling (PSSR)</li>
</ul><p>And to be fair, there are impressive improvements, and I'm curious to see what new PS5 games will look like and how they'll run when they fully take advantage of the PS5 Pro architecture. I just don't think it justifies a $699 PS5 Pro price tag, especially considering it only feels like we just recently moved on from games being cross-gen with PS4.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A PlayStation 5 Pro Isn't a Big Enough Jump for the Price</h2>
<p>The PS5 Pro is a great showcase of why mid-gen refreshes have diminishing returns in the modern era. While the PlayStation 4 Pro offered the jump from 1080P to 4K, the PS5 Pro improvements feel more nuanced for those seeking faster framerates and better ray-tracing. </p>
<p>There is, without a doubt, a population of gamers who celebrate these improvements, but those same players likely already have a PC that offers the performance they desire. For the average PlayStation fan who enjoys gaming on a user-friendly console in their living room, I think they're having too much fun with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> on their existing $500 system to consider that an upgrade is needed. </p>
<p>The reality is, we're likely within four years of the next generation of video game technology. So it feels like a weird time to make a $700 investment for what doesn't feel like a commensurate return. We're really just starting to see what the base PS5 is capable of, so it would make sense that many are happy with their current console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, Play Has No Limits, but bank accounts sure do. </p>

            <p>Earlier today, Nic did me a great injustice by waving aside my suggestion that he write about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shroom-and-gloom">Shroom And Gloom</a>, because "I want to read you describing mushrooms in interesting ways". Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morels-2-sure-has-a-lot-of-unicorns-for-a-mushroom-collection-game">Morels 2</a>, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.</p> <!--more-->

<p>The aforesaid mad human (that's your character, yes) does not even bother to finish murdering the fungus folk before dining out on their butchered brethren. Slay a mushroom with a fireball, and you'll render the corpse "Toasty" enough to consume, stuffing its portly, seared body into your mouth even as you slice another mushroom with a wavy dagger. If this were an actual foraging expedition you'd at least want to count the spots and gills before sinking your teeth in.</p>
<p><a href="https://teamlazerbeam.itch.io/shroom-and-gloom">Find a fleshy prototype for Shroom And Gloom on Itch.io</a>. It's certainly got atmosphere, with a soiled 3D parchment world of unpleasantly nested 2D rock and vegetation. Moving along the branching path feels like crawling down somebody's intestine. Somebody who's been eating a lot of mushrooms, and treasure chests. Gangs of pugnacious toadstools pop up at intervals, ranging from tiddly, er - <em>consults <a href="https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780746095898/Mushrooms-Funghi-Usborne-Spotters-Guide-0746095899/plp">Usborne Spotter's Guide</a></em> - Puffballs to rampaging Stinkhorns. Is this interesting yet, Nic? When I used to write for Edge, they'd chop your commission in half for calling things "interesting". It was one of those banned Edge words, like "wowza" and "ginormous".</p>
<p>You'll massacre the mycelium using ability cards, the mushroom's traditional foe. After 20 minutes with the demo, the card-battling is notable for a couple of reasons: firstly, the absence of conventional healing skills in battle means you'll want to devour at least half of the enemies you kill, and secondly, there's a "mood" system whereby you generate cards for "repressed rage", "impatience" and other states of mind, unlocking buffs and special attacks. Yes, this is a game in which victory may be achieved by tactically driving yourself nuts. In addition to your combat deck, you've got an exploration deck of cards that include various types of lockpick and shovel. I say "lockpick" - one of the "picks" is the ability to throw up corrosive goo. Ah, if only Thief's Garrett had thought of that one.</p>
<p>"Our dream version of this game features hundreds of cards, deep metaprogression and scores of unique enemies, spread across a dense network of caves and tunnels to explore!" explain developers Team Lazerbeam, who are being funded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anger-foot">Anger Foot</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-nil">Terra Nil</a> developers Free Lives. "This prototype offers a taste of what that experience could be.</p>
<p>"We've shot for the stars with what we tried to cram into this prototype over 3 months of development, and we're really proud of what we pulled off," the blurb continues. "That said, please note that this is a prototype. Expect rough edges and some jank. Keep in mind this is all a work in progress." I hope they make it all the way to the finish, because Shroom And Gloom is my kind of desperately grim. One of the later-game card options lets you turn mushrooms into soup. I wonder if we'll get to hear mushrooms scream. That would be interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A union within Call of Duty developer Raven Software is claiming that that Activision is “discriminating against” union employees and failing to negotiate in “good faith”.</p>



<p>That’s what the complaint against the company claims in the official charges filed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has received a copy of the complaint via FOIA request. Within the document comes the basis of the charge, which gives more information on claims of retaliation and discipline against members.</p>



<p>“In the six months prior to the filing of this charge, and on an ongoing and continuous basic, the Employer [Activision] discriminated against bargaining unit employees on the basis of their union membership concerning several terms and conditions of employment (e.g., pay treatment, hiring, work assignment and tasking, promotions, permanent work-from-home),” the charge reads.</p>



<p>“The Employer also engaged in surface bargaining, failed to engage in good faith on any economic proposals and on other mandatory subjects of bargaining (e.g., discrimination and harassment at work), and failed to meet at reasonable times and places for bargaining.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has once again reached out to Activision and Microsoft for comment on the claims. This story will be updated should a response be received. The last comment from Microsoft was a message to Stephen Totilo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/raven-software-union-files-complaint-against-microsoft-and-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in August saying</a> that it will “negotiate in good faith.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-echoes-zelda-and-assassins-creed-with-its-action-packed-open-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last month I went <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024">hands-on with Crimson Desert</a> to try out some of its brutal boss battles. I left the demonstration impressed by its fast combat system and spectacular monster designs, but curious as to what the wider world and gameplay of Crimson Desert looks like. What happens between those epic clashes? Now, thanks to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crimson-desert-exclusive-gameplay">53 minute gameplay video</a> from developer Pearl Abyss that’s available to watch here on IGN exclusively, I have a much clearer picture. If Crimson Desert’s combat is a mix of God of War and Dragon’s Dogma, then its wider gameplay is more reminiscent of modern Assassin’s Creed and other quest-driven open world adventures. </p><p>The gameplay video introduces us to Kliff, Crimson Desert’s protagonist who sports a gruff Scottish accent and a no-nonsense attitude. After a prologue establishes a bloody conflict between the Greymanes and the marauding Black Bears, Kliff’s major goal is made clear: explore the continent of Pywel in search of his surviving Greymane allies who have been scattered following the battle. Kliff also presumably wants revenge against Myurdin, the demo’s first boss fight, considering the Black Bear chief seemingly murdered him. Quite how Kliff remains alive after having his body filled with arrows and his throat slit is a mystery left for the full game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p> The bulk of this preview demonstration is set in Hernand, a medieval town populated by a fun range of fantasy races that wouldn’t look out of place in any Tolkienesque fantasy story (look out for the giants and the antlered elf-like beings among the crowds). Similarly, Kliff’s interactions around its beautifully rendered streets are very much what you’d expect of a modern open world adventure game – there’s a horse you can whistle for, NPCs to be spoken to (via cutscenes, there's no dialogue options here) and hostile regions to infiltrate. That last one is where Crimson Desert has a little fun, as the demo shows Kliff changing into Hernandian Banquet Attire in order to walk past a castle’s guards unnoticed, much like how you can wear disguises in games like Hitman and Kingdom Come: Deliverance. I hope there are plenty of opportunities to do this, and various outcomes to your trickery; it would be fun if you could use disguises to open up new conversations as well as gain entry to forbidden zones.</p><p>Inside the castle, Kliff pilfers an ‘Abyss Artifact’, which is where Crimson Desert gets a little more unusual. The device opens up a pixelated portal in a wall, and walking through it transports Kliff to a digital-like realm (reminiscent of the Animus in Assassin’s Creed) that leads to the Library of Providence. There, an alchemist called Alustin reveals that the Library is at the centre of all worlds and that there are beings who plan to bring “everything to nothingness”. While I can’t say I’m impressed by Crimson Desert’s writing in this demo – this exchange and others feel cluttered and wrapped up in themselves – it does point to a much grander, more mythical plot beyond Kliff’s hunt for his allies. That ambition of something larger is made abundantly clear when Alustin’s ally, White Crow, gives Kliff the glider-like ‘Crow Wings’ ability, which allows him to leap off the Library’s floating island and reenact Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s title sequence. It’s a little bold to use this motif – can Pearl Abyss really craft something that lives up to the wider meaning of that iconic visual? – but even if it falls short, the magnificent view and subsequent glide to earth is a thrill all the same. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Crimson Desert - Open world exploration and questing screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Back on the ground in Hernand, Kliff soon finds himself in a duel with a local knight. It’s another good example of Crimson Desert’s fight mechanics (more on that in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024">gamescom preview</a>), but it also triggers the start of the demo’s major questline. Impressed by Kliff’s combat prowess, a local peacekeeper tasks him with finding and eliminating some local bandits who fight using a red mist. Heading out in search of such villains, Kliff comes across a burning house and throws nearby vases of water to save the clergyman trapped inside. It’s not clear from the demo if such objectives organically occur around the map, Red Dead Redemption 2-style, but what is soon clear is that this blaze is the work of those aforementioned bandits. The local church says one of their men, Hubert, fled the scene in an attempt to bait the enemies away and asks Kliff to find him.  payment is another one of those Abyss Artifacts, once again suggesting the worlds-beyond-worlds are of high importance to Crimson Desert’s story. I hope this results in a decent amount of weirdness that helps set the largely typical setting apart from other fantasy games. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pearl Abyss is making good progress in its transition from Black Desert Online’s MMORPG into single player territory.</p></div><p>Hubert is found at a bandit camp that allows the demo to show off Kliff’s stealth abilities. It’s pretty classic stuff and looks very reminiscent of silent takedowns in the Assassin’s Creed games – not particularly challenging, but an alternative option to Crimson Desert’s more publicised melee brawls. Hopefully when we go hands-on again, stealth will prove a worthwhile addition rather than a shallow tacked-on extra. </p><p>With Hubert freed, Kliff is approached by the goblin Shakatu, a merchant of the Goldleaves guild. He explains that the Goldleaves are currently under the command of the evil Split Horn, someone Kliff must now kill. In return, Shakatu offers money and his services, things Kliff believes will be helpful in finding the missing Greymanes. </p><p>Arriving at the Goldleaf camp, it quickly becomes clear how all these quests are linked. The goblin guards use red mist as part of their battle tactics, and so reveal themselves as the very same miscreants that were causing trouble for the people of Hernand. And so Split Horn’s death not only allows Shakatu to take over and help Kliff, but also fulfils the task set by the peacekeeper back in town. I hope Crimson Desert features plenty more of these overlapping goals and storylines, and forms a wider narrative that feels enjoyably interlaced. That would certainly make up for the uneven quality of the writing shown in the demo.   </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/crimson-desert-kliff-shakatu-1725975076438.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kliff makes a deal with the goblin merchant Shakatu.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Split Horn (who, amusingly, looks more like a bobblehead elf than any of his goblin brothers) acts as the culminating boss fight of the demo. He’s as agile and aggressive as Crimson Desert’s speedy combat demands, wielding a sword that emits blasts of wind in vertical and horizontal patterns, forcing Kliff to dodge and block as he attempts to close the distance. Unlike the bosses featured in the gamescom demo, though, he has just one health bar and doesn’t put up quite as much of a fight. It’s over soon enough, further suggesting that the game will feature a variety of challenges big and small – add ‘small windy Joffrey’ to a list that already contains ‘mega wrestler with stag antlers’, ‘the abominable snow deer’ and ‘a literal mountain’. </p><p>This new look at Crimson Desert continues to show that Pearl Abyss is making good progress in its transition from Black Desert Online’s MMORPG into single player territory. I don’t think anything shown in this demo particularly breaks new ground – much of it is very familiar if you’ve played the likes of modern Zelda, Assassin’s Creed, or The Witcher 3 – but it nonetheless looks largely well put together. While I do hope that the Abyss Artifact storyline goes suitably off-the-wall, I’d like to see the more typical fantasy storylines find suitable hooks to ensure regular gameplay feels more varied and creative than what we’ve seen so far. With a combat system that shifts from classic sword-and-board action to slingshotting Spider-Man-style around a walking mountain, the questing and exploration side of Crimson Desert ideally also needs to aspire to that kind of diversity. But even if it doesn’t, this latest slice of gameplay certainly suggests that the bridges between epic boss battles will be solid, if not the most memorable aspect of the experience.  </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The focus here is on the Halloween aesthetic, with reprints like Pikachu and Gengar looking extra spooky with their new stamps. However, you'd be surprised at how many of the cards still have solid abilities for casual play. Plus, you've got new cards from the Scarlet &amp; Violet set, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti, to add a fresh vibe.</p><p>Each set is packed with 35 mini boosters, containing 3 cards in every "mini-booster". The entire set of 30 cards can be completed by grabbing just one bundle. Unlike regular packs, these cards aren't about <em>game-changing pulls</em> or competitive play but more about celebrating Halloween with a collectible twist. The nine Cosmo holo cards add a bit of shine to the whole experience, making cards like Pikachu and Mimikyu even more special. We love the 2024 set, and highly recommend it for anyone Pokémon fans getting into the Halloween spirit.</p><div catalogid="3520d4d6-aea6-42cb-a703-ebd423387efd" id="207021"><div id="207021" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Pokémon TCG Booster Bundle - Trick or Trade</h3></p><div><p>"Spooky Surprises Lurk Inside!

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">the official reveal of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> earlier this week, the majority of the conversations about it have centered on its $700 price rather than its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">advanced PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution technology</a>. This is understandable, since $700 is a lot of money to put down on a new version of a console that's only been out for four years. But as noted by former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, there's at least one way to get that price down. Or as they say in the spam ads, "one weird trick."</p><p>Ybarra pointed out a tactic that many fans had already thought about--namely trading in their existing PS5 models and effectively cutting the cost of a new PS5 Pro in half.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833527742534500820" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Think of this a bit differently. Pro models, or any in-generation upgrade, is about existing users upgrading. So when teams evaluate the cost - they don't want to lose money on each console as that puts pressure on other parts of the business. And they think about how they can…</p>  — Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833527742534500820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>GameStop is offering between $350 to $385 in store credit for used PlayStation 5 consoles, with the higher prices for models with the disc drive. But if a significant number of gamers pursue that strategy, would GameStop keep that trade in value or lower the amount that it offers? Just because GameStop is offering those rates now doesn't guarantee that it will in November. That would throw a wrench in this strategy, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-makes-a-surprise-profit-warns-of-impending-store-closures/1100-6526415/" data-ref-id="1100-6526415">GameStop is facing more store closures</a>. Additionally, the PS5 Pro doesn't come with a disc drive, with the optional add-on costing another $80. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">it's already selling out across multiple retailers</a>.</p><p>That strategy also runs into a problem if gamers haven't upgraded to a PS5 yet. Without a modern console to trade in, getting a PS5 Pro remains prohibitively expensive for some fans. But if a lot of used PS5 consoles suddenly hit the market--even with GameStop's markup--then perhaps that's a solution for anyone who hasn't joined the current console generation yet.</p><p>Sony will release the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">PS5 Pro</a> on November 7.</p>

                <p>Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play game, but if you're a big fan who wants to show off their love for the popular RPG, a physical edition for PS5 is now available to preorder at Best Buy. Priced at $40, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1853347803757836957%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhonkai-star-rail-is-getting-a-ps5-physical-edition-with-collectible-art-cards-and-cute-keychains%2F1100-6526416%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail Trailblazer Edition</a></strong> includes the base game on a disc and the following bonus content: nine gilded holographic cards, two holographic character keychains, an exclusive postcard, and a game redemption code with exclusive in-game items. Best Buy lists the release date as March 31, 2025, but this date is sometimes used as a placeholder for Q1 (first three months of the year).</p><p>It's not unheard of for a free-to-play game to receive a physical edition. Fortnite has received multiple boxed releases over the years, each of which <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fortnite-Transformers-Pack-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CCSNDXT9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">contains exclusive in-game cosmetics</a>. The difference here is that you're actually getting a disc. This is a bit unusual, especially since Honkai: Star Rail requires an internet connection and you'll need to download the game regardless.

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are quite excited about The Plucky Squire's release, which is arriving on day one on Sony's PS Plus subscription. This is the upcoming storybook adventure game from All Possible Futures, which flits brightly between 2D and 3D realms.</p>
<p>"I'm still early on in the game, but in both of its worlds, I want to see what comes next," Christian Donlan wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-offers-familiar-ideas-in-a-lovely-new-arrangement">Plucky Squire preview feature</a> last month.</p>
<p>"I want to see where the adventure in the children's book leads, and I want to know what else awaits me out on that expanse of child's desk. I'm in. And I can't wait for more.</p>
<p>As for games that have already been released, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/night-in-the-woods">Eurogamer's review called Night in the Woods</a> a "witty smalltown adventure with light puzzle-platforming elements", but one which "walks the line between nostalgia and nihilism".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-5-review">Far Cry 5</a>, meanwhile, Eurogamer dubbed a "competent yet conflicted open worlder".</p>

			<p>Keiichiro Toyama is a name that horror games fans know rather well, having directed and written the very first entry in the Silent Hill series, but that isn't the only game the Japanese developer created, as he was also the man behind Sony's Siren series. Moving away from horror games, Toyama-san created and directed the Gravity Rush series, which, surprisingly enough, had the same impact on the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-gets-gameplay-trailer-pc-specs-and-november-8-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slitterhead</a> as the horror games the legendary game director created before it.</p>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, we had the chance to talk with Toyama-san about his next game, the unique mechanics that set it apart from similar titles, and his feelings regarding the return of the Silent Hill series. You can find the full Q&amp;A session below. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The Q&amp;A session was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Where does the name Slitterhead come from?</strong></p>
<p>The project was, in many ways, going back to my roots, so I wanted to keep the SH initials while having a new name. As such, I worked with English-speaking staff to come up with the Slitterhead name.</p>
<p><strong>Possession mechanics seem to be central to the experience. How did they come about?</strong></p>
<p>The possession mechanics in Slitterhead are the modern reconstruction of one of the mechanics seen in Siren. In that game, there was a mechanic called sight jacking, which allows the player to borrow someone else's sight. In Slitterhead, we went further with this concept, allowing the player not just to borrow someone's sight but their entire bodies, letting them move around while controlling these NPCs. So the possession mechanics in the game are effectively an evolution of similar mechanics seen in Siren.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead has deeper combat mechanics than other horror games. Why did you go in this direction?</strong></p>
<p>I am aware of how much survival horror fans are passionate about the genre, but I wanted to offer something different from past games. In this regard, the Seinen manga genre has had a big influence on Slitterhead. The genre combines elements such as action, battle, horror, and dark themes well and is quite popular with young players. I felt the combination of these elements would be a better way to introduce the game to a young audience and people who play action games. It was also a combination of elements that I wanted to do for a while.</p>
<p><strong>In horror games, the player is usually powerless against everything they have to face, which contributes to the atmosphere a lot, but in Slitterhead, you can fight these horrors rather effectively. What has been done to preserve the "horror" feel while also offering these deeper combat mechanics?</strong></p>
<p>The horror elements are preserved in Slitterhead mostly by the narrative elements of the game, with a sense and fear of the unknown that is prevalent throughout the story that players will hopefully find and appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead features multiple characters with different skills. How does the game handle this so that it is not disorienting for players?</strong></p>
<p>We have been very precise in the development of different movesets and animations, making sure not to change the "rhythm" between different movesets. It was a lot of hard work.</p>
<p><strong>At the beginning of the game, you possess a dog. Are there other non-combat possessions?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, I have focused mostly on the human aspect of the possession mechanics. I have found the idea of possessing the dog fun, and that won't be the only time you will see him, but I haven't focused on the aspect of possessing anything other than human NPCs.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Slitterhead won't offer any variety. Throughout the game, the player will be able to unlock new and rarer possessions, and all come with different skill sets and different moves. After the beginning of the game, players will be able to take two possession rarities to a mission, and I feel picking the best ones for the mission will be an entertaining part of the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead features multiple difficulty settings. What's the difference between them?</strong></p>
<p>The difficulty settings influence the difficulty of combat. Higher difficulties not only increase the enemy's parameters compared to lower settings but also change how often they attack and use certain special moves. The highest difficulty, Nightmare, will be quite challenging and will require players to master all of the game's mechanics. I myself haven't completed the game at this setting. (<em>laughs</em>). Normal difficulty, on the other hand, will be more approachable. Its challenge level is far from being close to that of certain popular games where the player constantly dies.</p>
<p><strong>The game is also releasing on PlayStation 4. Why? And did launching on a previous-generation console limit the project in any way?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to have as many players as possible to play Slitterhead, and this is why we are releasing the game on PlayStation 4. At the same time, this helped us keep the PC system requirements low, so even those players with middle-range systems can easily enjoy the game. Being the first game from Bokeh Game Studio, we really want as many players as possible to play Slitterhead, and I feel we made the correct decision, in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka has created the Slitterhead soundtrack. How did this collaboration come about? How has his work improved the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Having worked together on the original Silent Hill, Yamaoka-san and I have discussed working together over the years, and eventually going indie with my new studio made it a lot easier for this collaboration to happen. His works basically carried the development in many ways: the songs and the audio he implemented in certain areas made the design even better, giving the level designers more freedom with their choices. It was a very good collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about Silent Hill, the series is finally coming back after some years with multiple games after a long hiatus. How do you feel about having created something so iconic and its return?</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, Silent Hill was a small project compared to others in the works at the same time, and not many people, even at Konami, knew about it. A very young team worked on it, and when it was released, we were all surprised by how good it turned out to be. Konami was surprised as well by the reactions and the fan base that was created around it since they didn't think it would be so influential. Even though I only worked on the first game, I am happy to see it back. It was the first game I directed, and it has taught me many lessons in game development. And I'm thankful to see that the franchise continues to be popular nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for your time!</strong></p>

To accept it, talk to “The Well-Heeled Youth” which will also give you the Gold Airship Ticket. Then, go to the Ul’Dahn Airstrip and present the ticket to Elyenora. The game will then bring up a prompt asking if you want to go to the Gold Saucer. Select “Yes,” and after a short cutscene, you will be able to turn in the quest and arrive at the Gold Saucer with a notice that the Manderville Gold Saucer has been unlocked.</p><h2 id="h14957"><a id=""></a>What Can I Do In the Manderville Gold Saucer</h2><figure id="" data-id="29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-recommend-id="image://29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-recommend-id="image://29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> As you might expect, <em>FFXIV’s</em> version of the Gold Saucer—titled the Manderville Gold Saucer—has a collection of minigames for you to play. In order to play these games and purchase many of the prizes available, you need Manderville Gold Saucer Points or MGP, just in case there weren’t already enough currencies in this game. One MGP can be purchased for 10 Gil, though it can also be obtained by winning these minigames. And it’s a good job too, as prizes can cost up to one million MGP, and you are limited to only being able to purchase 500! </p><p>I’d advise you to talk to the AirShip Ticketer, who offers a quest as soon as you land, entitled “World of Wonders.” This will have you talk to multiple NPCs and introduce many of the features and games available in the Gold Saucer. Below is a walkthrough of how to complete the quest, as well as a brief introduction on the feature that is introduced. I’d also suggest you interact with all the crystals, to open the many fast travel locations as you work your way through this quest.</p><figure id="" data-id="d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-recommend-id="image://d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-recommend-id="image://d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Talking to the attendant at the main counter will introduce the general concept of MGP, and how to obtain them. After that, you will talk to the Triple Triad Trader at the Card Square. The popular game from <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> returns here, and can be unlocked by speaking to the Triple Triad Master. He will also give you five cards for completing this incredibly fast quest, which can be added to a deck to play this minigame.</p><p>Before they can be registered to your account, they need to be used from your inventory. Once that is done, you can create a Deck by bringing up the menu, and under the “Character” tab, select “Gold Saucer.” Scroll down until you see the Deck Options and add your new cards there. You can also challenge the Triple Triad Master and he will explain the rules of the game. </p><figure id="" data-id="2ad5639c76af167c7822faf5803ff31f" data-recommend-id="image://2ad5639c76af167c7822faf5803ff31f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Valeda.

There are two Cactpot Lotteries, and by talking to the Jumbo Cactpot Broker, you can buy up to three cards per week with four digits of your choosing. Winners are revealed on Saturdays at a specific time according to your server, and if your numbers are drawn, you will win! Note that you actually need to check your numbers at the Cactpot Cashier (right next to the ticket vendor), as the rewards are not given automatically.</p><p>You have a week to do this, and if you don’t pick them up in time, you forfeit your winnings. Even if none of your numbers match, you will receive a consolation and you also gain a bonus if you check in the first hour after numbers are called, so always check the winners, and try to do it as close to the designated time as possible.</p><p>There is also a Mini Cactpot Broker that can be played daily. You can buy a card with a grid on it, with all spaces covered except one. You can then choose an additional three squares to reveal and then pick any row, column or diagonal you want to bet on. You can see the payout for each sum of numbers, so the goal is to get the three numbers that will provide the largest payout. Talking to the Broker for the first time also rewards you with a MGP voucher, which can be used from your inventory for 100 MGP to get you started on your first card. You can buy up to three per day, so you should take advantage of this relatively easy way to generate MGP.</p><figure id="" data-id="c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-recommend-id="image://c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-recommend-id="image://c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The last spot before we return to our attendant is a GATE Keeper. GATEs are basically minigames which rotate every 20 minutes. They are generally pretty short and different from most content in <em>FFXIV</em>, and are fun diversions even if you aren’t grinding for MGP. They can be anything from a platforming obstacle course to a shooting gallery, and worth checking out. You also don’t need to talk to this specific Keeper to partake in the events, as there are several Keepers scattered around the Gold Saucer, and speaking to any of them will teleport you to the location of the next event. </p><p> After speaking to the GATE Keeper, you can speak to the attendant to turn in the quest. You will be rewarded with five Gold Saucer Tickets. These are different from the MGP vouchers! This means they can generally only be used for the smaller carnival minigames scattered around the park, which only cost about 1 MGP and don’t offer very high rewards. </p><h2 id="h14958"><a id=""></a>Is There Anything Else?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-recommend-id="image://9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-recommend-id="image://9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> While “World of Wonders” will show you a lot of the content the Gold Saucer has to offer, it doesn’t show you everything. There’s a NPC in the main area named Lewena who will offer you two quests that unlock additional games at the Gold Saucer. The first is a quest named “Passion for Fashion.” It will task you with talking to a character named the Masked Rose which unlocks Fashion Report. This challenge is available from Tuesdays to Fridays and requires you to equip a different piece of equipment in each slot that fits a given theme, and are then judged on your ensemble with a score from 1 to 100. If you receive a score higher than 80 you get MGP. </p><p> The other quest Lewenna offers is “Everything Little Thing She Does is Mahjong.” By talking to the Mahjong Tutor you can complete this quest and unlock Mahjong Duties, which allow you to play the famous game for MGP. They can be accessed from the Duty Menu. </p><figure id="" data-id="569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-recommend-id="image://569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-recommend-id="image://569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In order to unlock the final two features of the Gold Saucer, you will need to talk to the Lift Operator, which will give you access to the Minion and Chocobo Squares. At the former, you can unlock and play “Lord of Verminion,” which pits your minions against others for MGP. At the Chocobo Square you can pick up a quest to unlock Chocobo Races. </p><p> To do so, talk to the Race Chocobo Registrar to unlock “So You want to Be a Jockey?” This quest will have you travel to Bent Branch Meadows (near Gridania) to speak to Katering. This completes the quest and you can choose a male or female Chocobo for racing as a reward. Talking to her again will accept the quest, “So You Think You Can Ride This Chocobo?” To turn it in, talk to the Chocobo Trainer to register your new bird, and then talk to the registrar to try out the training course. After you pass, you will have Chocobo races available in the Duty Finder. </p><figure id="" data-id="10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-recommend-id="image://10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-recommend-id="image://10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> There are a ton of things to do in the Gold Saucer, and it’s incredibly easy to lose track of time. Whether you are there specifically to buy one of the awesome prizes, or just spend time mastering Triple Triad, it’s worth it to check out one of the coolest locations in <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>and see what it has to offer. You may just find yourself sinking hours acquiring the area’s unique currency. After all, the Fenrir Mount is only one million MGP. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/when-it-costs-700-who-exactly-is-the-ps5-pro-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">Sony finally announced the long-rumoured PS5 Pro</a> in a technical presentationn hosted by Mark Cerny. The console is a more advanced version of the PlayStation 5 that boosts its graphics capabilities, and even improves backwards compatibility with some PS4 games.</p>
<p>Yet the biggest catch of all is its £700 price tag. What's more, with this being a digital-only console, the £100 disc drive add-on is required for physical games, not to mention the additional £25 needed for the optional stand just to hold the console vertically. That's a total of £825 - without games, as well as the fancy TV necessary to really show off those extra pixels.</p>
<p>The reaction so far has been overwhelmingly negative, predominantly thanks to that audacious price. Indeed, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-700-ps5-pro-is-an-argument-against-pro-consoles-altogether">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wrote</a>, the PS5 Pro is "an argument against 'Pro' consoles altogether". It certainly seems more in-line with the expectations of PC players than console players.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, then, what really are the benefits of this new console? Who is the target audience? And would we consider buying one ourselves?</p>
<p>Joining me to discuss all things PS5 Pro in this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a> are news reporter Victoria Kennedy, Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan, and managing editor Katharine Castle.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a> is getting a free update next month, which will include a new co-op horde mode known as Neighborhood Watch and New Game Plus.</p>
<p>"Taking place over the span of five fictional days, Neighborhood Watch sees a group of college kids - the Bobcats - defend their frat house from an approaching zombie horde," reads <a href="https://deadisland.com/patch-6">Neighborhood Watch's description</a>. "Initially, you and your friends complete a variety of missions, setting traps, and stockpiling weapons as you prepare your defences.</p>
<p>"Then, on the fifth and final day, the zombie onslaught begins! If your defences, skills, and teamwork are up to the task, you might just live to tell the tale." You can check out a trailer for Neighborhood Watch below.</p>

<p>In addition to this new horde mode, the forthcoming update will also include New Game Plus. This will allow players to head back to LA (or, Hell A, as the Dead Island 2 team call it) for another crack at the main story, but with an additional skill slot and an increased level cap.</p>
<p>In addition, there will also be some new skins, enemies, weapons and an increased difficulty level for players to hack and slash their way through.</p>
<p>This free update will be arriving on 22nd October, and will coincide with the release of Dead Island 2's <a href="https://deadisland.com/gb/ultimate-edition">Ultimate Edition.</a> This edition will include the base game, as well as both story expansions (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-roadmap-reveals-two-gore-ful-sounding-expansions">Haus and SoLA</a>) and a number of weapons and skin packs. It will also include New Game Plus and Neighborhood Watch on its release next month.</p>
<p>"If you've somehow yet to play an undead-themed action-RPG or you have an appropriately on-brand mindless hunger for the subgenre, Dead Island 2 might be worth your while," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-review-its-still-2011-in-los-angeles">Eurogamer's Dead Island 2 review</a> from last year. "It's certainly got the zombie disassembly part down pat."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
