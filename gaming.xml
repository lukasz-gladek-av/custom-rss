			<p>ARC Raiders developer Embark Studios has just <a href="https://arcraiders.com/it/news/whats-coming-in-the-december-update">put out the game's first winter update</a> with Cold Snap, an update that freezes over the Rust Belt and adds a new survival layer you need to be concerned about every time you step out into a new run. The new update also adds a new Raider Deck coming later this month, and a new event for players to dig into.</p>



<p>Winter in the Rust Belt means that now, beyond having to worry about other players and killer robots, you have to worry about other players, killer robots, and potentially freezing to death. You'll have to keep warm and move fast to ensure that you don't wind up out in the Belt, unable to see because of the cold, your feet freezing, and frostbite starting to set in.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's also a new event with this update, the Flickering Flames event. It's a particularly special time of year where Sperenzans are huddling together for warmth and being thankful for what little they do have, like a warm candle and some fresh berries. </p>



<p>While out on runs, you'll be tasked with gathering Candleberries for festive centrepieces and finding anything that can help make your underground shelter a little brighter and warmer. Plus, collecting as many candleberries and sources of light and warmth as you can will help you earn new cosmetics, weapons, raider tokens, new items, and more when you return with your bounty of berries.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">According to what we know of the roadmap</a> for ARC Raiders, this is the final big update of the year for ARC Raiders, and all in all, it seems like a more than fruitful update to cap off 2025 with. ARC Raiders may have only walked away from The Game Awards with one win for Best Multiplayer game, but it arguably won the back-half of the year overall, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">as it skyrocketed in sales and concurrent player counts</a> since it launched at the end of October.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is undeniably one of the biggest games of 2025. It was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most-searched video game according to Google's wrap-up of the year</a>, and it didn't even release until 2025's final months. Amidst the <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">controversy that has surrounded it</a>, it's simply impressive to see what Embark Studios has accomplished with its latest title.</p>



<p>Now, though, the big question is whether Embark can sustain this level of success, and even grow from it, going into 2026. ARC Raiders wouldn't be the first, nor the last, multiplayer game to make a big splash in its launch window and fail to find its legs a little further down the line. We'll see how it looks a year from now, but for now, you can cozy up with its new update.

            <title><![CDATA[Divinity Is a Turn-Based RPG, Will Be ‘Way Better’ Than Baldur’s Gate 3, Says Larian’s Swen Vincke]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/</link>
            <guid>1384693</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios went big with the reveal of Divinity at The Game Awards 2025. With the help of host Geoff Keighley, they teased the news with a real-life statue placed in the Mojave Desert. A European trademark <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the initially mysterious teaser was related to a new Divinity game, and then the trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped at the event</a>.</p>



<p>However, the developer remained silent on what it would be. They only mentioned that it wouldn't require playing Original Sin 2, which spurred speculation that Larian was making an action RPG this time around.</p>



<p>That's now been officially dispelled by Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke. <a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with Bloomberg</a>, Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based roleplaying game, just like the studio's last three games including their most famous one, Baldur's Gate 3, which reportedly surpassed 20 million units sold to date. The head of the studio also reckons that it will surpass the award-winning game by far:</p>



<p><em>This is going to be us unleashed, I think. It's a turn-based RPG featuring everything you've seen from us in the past, but it's brought to the next level. Baldur's Gate 3 was a good game and I'm proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better. Here, we are making a system that's made for a videogame. It's much easier to understand. [...] The idea is that when you talk to fellow journalists about the game, you'll have completely different stories. We're doing a couple of things that you haven't seen in RPGs before, I think.</em></p>



<p>Despite the incredible ambition, Larian is still hoping to get this game made quicker, with Vincke mentioning that a three or four year cycle is 'much healthier' than six years. That said, as we had suspected, early access is still in the plans for Divinity, but it's not likely to happen in 2026. This means a 2027 early access launch, with a possible 2028-2029 full release, which would align with the typical five to six years of development.</p>



<p>One way the team is trying to accelerate the development progress is by utilizing generative AI tools. Although the game itself won't include any directly AI-generated content, they are using AI to write placeholder text, quickly develop concept art, or make internal PowerPoint presentations. As of now, Larian employs 530 people across its seven offices, located in Asia, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Europe</a>, and North America. Additionally, the developer is creating a new engine that aims to improve streaming performance, hoping to avoid troublesome situations such as the titular city of Baldur's Gate 3 having to be split in two (and still running very poorly).</p>



<p>In other Divinity news, Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-has-launched-ps5-switch-2-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now has native PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2 versions</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to sacrifice your entire workspace just to fit a traditional tower PC on your desk. If space matters to you, switching to a compact yet capable mini PC can make a huge difference. The ACEMAGIC Mini PC is designed for students, professionals, and everyday users who want strong performance without clutter.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/"> It is currently available at a deep discount on Amazon in which you can save as much as $240 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Performance in a Small Footprint</h2>
<p>Despite its ultra-compact design, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC delivers impressive power. Inside this tiny chassis, there are a couple options for memory and storage. The cheapest option—housing 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage—normally runs for $459, but is right now down 28% to just $329. You can choose to upgrade to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. That one is normally $499, but has come down to just $429 (14% discount). Both these options come with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with integrated graphics, though you can bump up to the upgraded AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor for just $519 total. That’s down by 32% from $759 (also comes with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage).</p>
<p>If you find you don’t have enough space for your needs, storage is expandable up to 4TB with an additional compatible SSD.</p>
<p>This hardware combination is well suited for everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, office work, creative projects, and even light gaming. Multitasking feels smooth thanks to the included 32GB of memory, which helps applications run quickly and efficiently. The system comes preloaded with Windows 11 Pro, allowing you to get started immediately without dealing with complicated setup steps or extra software installations.</p>



<p>For display capabilities, the mini PC supports impressive visuals. Using its USB4 Type-C or DisplayPort 2.0 output, it can deliver up to 8K resolution at 60Hz. There is also an HDMI slot available which is capable of up to 4K at 60Hz. All together, these enable you to connect three monitors at the same time for increased productivity or multitasking.</p>
<p>The ACEMAGIC Mini PC includes built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, ensuring stable internet access and easy pairing with accessories like keyboards, mice, and headphones. You’ll also find two USB 3.2 ports on the front with four more on the back for even more peripheral options.</p>
<p>Thermal management has not been overlooked either. Dual centrifual fans and a stacked fin array design help keep internal temperatures under control. The independent aluminum SSD heatsink can disperse heat quietly, allowing you to maintain stable read and write speeds during extended use.</p>
<p>If you need a full-featured computer that takes up minimal space, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is a compelling option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/">With its current discount of up to 32%, the price of the highest tier model drops to just $519 for a limited time.</a> For anyone upgrading, downsizing, or building a clean, efficient workstation at home or the office, this mini PC may be just what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>Check out the steps below to learn how to download the Bully Online mod on your PC. </p>



<ul>
<li>Players need to have Bully v1.200&nbsp;installed without mods, and it shouldn’t be a pirated copy of the game. </li>



<li>Then, players should download the latest version of derpy’s script loader and drag the ASI file into the game’s folder. The player should also ensure they have an ASI loader installed (such as&nbsp;dinput8.dll&nbsp;from Ultimate ASI Loader).</li>



<li>The players should download the latest&nbsp;Bully Online Launcher Pack from this <a href="https://swegta.com/online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>. </li>

<li><span>Players can only use mods that change files in the&nbsp;World.</span>img&nbsp;/&nbsp;World.dir and TXD folder. Apart from that, SilentPatchBully, One Percent Better Project, and focus.asi are the only other accepted mods. If any other mods are found, the player risks being banned. </li>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shadow-drop-release-was-callous-says-hell-is-us-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally rewarded everyone in 2025. The breathtaking Metroidvania challenged the patience of many, but piqued the interest of millions. The indie title has won awards, recouped millions in sales, and Team Cherry has already revealed the game’s first expansion.</p>



<p>As long as things go to plan, the wait won’t be anywhere near as long, which would be the Team Cherry on top of the game.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Please stick to this! Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry has told everyone to expect the Hollow Knight: Silksong Sea of Sorrow DLC in 2026 and won’t disclose any further details until then.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming wishes it had more news—as the team is looking forward to more Silksong content just as much as you—but developer Team Cherry is likely aware of the pressure that comes with the release date for new Hollow Knight content.</p>



<p>Silksong descending into limbo for years was painful for everyone. It must have been just as torturous for Team Cherry, knowing the developer probably wanted to just release the content and end everyone’s wait. The wait ended up being worth it, and Silksong is one of 2025’s Game of the Year contenders.</p>



<p>This means there’s even more pressure on Sea of Sorrows (and any subsequent DLC) to be just as good. Don’t be alarmed at the sight of the word, but if the content ends up being bigger than Team Cherry plans (like Silksong), a <em>delay </em>to 2027 may not be out of the question. </p>



<p>So keep your hopes in check until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>The Sea of Sorrow DLC is a free expansion for Hollow Knight: Silksong owners and comes as part of the full package, and the content looks to be “nautically” themed.</strong></p>



<p>To be clear, Team Cherry could easily have charged money for whatever expansion or new content was coming the game’s way. Sea of Sorrow will do no such thing. It’s a free expansion and adds even greater value to Silksong’s already alluring and generous price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the dev’s official words on the content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“New areas, bosses, tools, and more! Hornet’s adventures continue in our nautically themed expansion, coming free for all players next year.”</p>
</blockquote>

During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!</p><p>Note: <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource <a title="Genres > Management [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and surviving despite the inhospitable environment. Therefore, the game doesn’t feature combat or any other military aspects.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build on a Mountain</strong> – Each mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability, and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.</li><li><strong>Deal With Avalanches</strong> – One of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can’t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it’s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!</li><li><strong>Craft a Transport Network</strong> – So, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons, and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges, and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town’s population, always look for opportunities to optimize your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.</li><li><strong>Raise a Summit Temple</strong> – If you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains, and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavor you’ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Laysara: Summit Kingdom | PC &amp; Console Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NRSQJTfE5Pw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/laysara-summit-kingdom-launches-february-27-2026]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Divinity Will Be Better Than Baldur’s Gate 3 “On All Fronts” Says Larian CEO</p>
      </div>
<p>He also confirmed that the new Divinity game will not have any AI-generated content in it. "Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," he said.</p><p>None of this is new or surprising, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">Vincke said many months ago that Larian was using machine learning systems for a variety of functions</a>, including "tasks that nobody wants to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"For an RPG developer, what you really want is something that helps with reactivity to agency," he said. "So, permutations that you did not foresee, reactions to things that the player has done, in the world, they will certainly augment the gameplay experience," Vincke said of using machine learning to help generate new gameplay elements.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke, like many in the industry before him, also said he is aware of "red flags" pertaining to the use of generative AI in game development.</p><p>Some people have legitimate fears of machine learning and AI systems stealing their work or taking their jobs. However, Vincke said Larian is hiring more people, not fewer, thanks to new technologies. This is what others,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969"> like EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, have predicted.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's always going to be the people that are going to make a difference," Vincke said. "And so for us, it's super clear that we're investing heavily into the team and the human touch that's being added to that."</p><p dir="ltr">With more automation, human workers are freed up to create more, which in turn leads to the possibility of making "more complex things," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">"When complexity goes up, things start getting really interesting. So it's fair to say that the games that are being made today are arguably more complex than they were in the past," he said. "The faster you can iterate, the faster you will get to a certain result. And then and the tightening of those pipelines should allow you, in theory, to make your games in a more efficient manner."</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke also said the general population might not be aware of how much time an animator may spend on "stuff they don't want to work on." As such, thanks to automation, "It adds a lot to the time that they have to work on the creative stuff," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke said it's "the wrong attitude" to assume that automation will replace various people and departments. Because automation should, in theory, allow people to do "more of what really matters and less of the stuff that they don't want to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"That's not necessarily cost reduction," he added. "But it's going to be an increase of ability, which is a good thing."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Divinity game was announced at The Game Awards recently with a flashy--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/" data-ref-id="1100-6536908">and super gross</a>--CGI trailer. The game has no release date as of yet.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, be sure to read GameSpot's own new interview with Vincke, in which he claims that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/" data-ref-id="1100-6536981">the new Divinity game will be better than Baldur's Gate 3 "on all fronts."</a></p>

                <p>Infinity Ward, the developer of the popular Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series, has told fans, "Don't believe everything you read on the internet" amid a rumor about next year's game.</p><p>In a post on social media, the studio wished fans a happy holiday and teased that it's "looking forward to talking soon." In the meantime, the developer said fans should be wary of what they read on the internet. Although there was no further context provided, this may be a reference to a recent report that claimed Infinity Ward is making 2026's Call of Duty game, rumored to be Modern Warfare 4, and that its multiplayer would be a "complete copy" of Modern Warfare 2's.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Happy holidays everybody!</p><p>Wishing our community an awesome holiday season and looking forward to talking soon.</p><p>Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.

This has yet to be confirmed, but Infinity Ward's latest social media post ended with, "See you in 2026."</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is the newest entry in the series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">reportedly sold worse than 2024's Black Ops 6</a>.

                <p>Ubisoft has acquired the game March of Giants from Amazon Games, and this also means that creative director Xavier Marquis has returned to Ubisoft. He was the original creative director on Rainbow Six Siege and comes back to Ubisoft alongside Alex Parizeau, the former managing director of Ubisoft Toronto.</p><p>March of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn2aJ3UmVnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zn2aJ3UmVnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marquis said in a news release that, "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle."</p><p>"We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level," he said.</p><p>Parizeau, meanwhile, thanked Amazon for supporting March of Giants and said he's excited to re-join Ubisoft to "build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs."</p><p>March of Giants has held multiple playtests on Steam, but there is no word yet on a release date for the full game, nor do we know if it may come to consoles.</p><p>The sale of March of Giants to Ubisoft comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-cuts-hit-video-game-division-reducing-work-on-mmos/1100-6535769/" data-ref-id="1100-6535769">Amazon confirmed mass layoffs across the company</a>, including at its gaming division.

"You followed the winds, tested your blades and proved that the best stories are the ones we tell together," reads the statement from Everstone. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/2000213983790522645" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">15 Million Wanderers have joined the Jianghu! <br>You followed the winds, tested your blades, <br>and proved that the best stories are the ones we tell together. <br>Thank you for being here! <a href="https://t.co/xRpSYpVXgT" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/xRpSYpVXgT</a></p>  — Where Winds Meet (@WhereWindsMeet_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/2000213983790522645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>No specifics were shared regarding how much playtime each of those people put in or any other details.

                <p>Pedro "Flute Guy" Eustache has become one of The Game Awards most-beloved returning figures, known for playing his outlandish collection of flutes with incredible passion and panache. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-keeps-the-legend-of-flute-guy-strong/1100-6536923/" data-ref-id="1100-6536923">another stellar performance</a> at The Game Awards 2025, Eustache has taken to social media to show off all the different instruments he played in this year's show.</p><p>While Eustache's stage presence is the main element that has made him so popular with viewers of The Game Awards, his unusual collection of instruments has also tickled the internet's fancy over the years he's been a part of The Game Awards Orchestra. This year, he has named all the different instruments he played in the famous Game of the Year medley, which include a handful of curiously custom-made or customized instruments.</p><p>Showing them off in the order they were played during the medley, Eustache's first two instruments are western concert flutes with swapped-out headpieces--the first from a traditional Armenian shvi, and the second a 3D-printed head based on the Armenian blul. Eustache also demonstrates the strange flute he played during the Clair Obscur section of the medley, simply calling it a "PVC-based flute." <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999518701444337802" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Geoff Keighley revealed</a> after the show that Eustache built this instrument just for TGAs.</p><p>The next flute is another traditional folk instrument, this time a Chinese dizi. The medley is finished with two western flutes, the bass flute, and the huge contrabass flute--the former being the instrument Eustache first went viral with during his enthusiastic performance in the 2022 Game of the Year medley.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/EustachePedro/status/2000797921735008329" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I'm elated that you were unto our GOTY TGA 2025 performance.<br>YES you got it: the Thumb-size-Ocarina wasn't on my last video!<br>Thanks to @geoffkighley &amp; @lornebafle &amp; to God, for His awesome grace!<br>Stay tuned: many more great projects coming up soon!<br>God bless you all! <a href="https://t.co/CfF87T9IRR" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/CfF87T9IRR</a></p>  — Pedro Eustache (@EustachePedro) <a href="https://twitter.com/EustachePedro/status/2000797921735008329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a follow-up video, Eustache revealed that he had omitted one instrument that made an appearance at the 2025 awards ceremony--the thumb-sized ocarina played for Donkey Kong Bananza. He finishes by thanking "gamers of the world" for their support, promising he will indeed be back for The Game Awards 2026.</p><p>Outside of Flute Guy and the TGA orchestra's incredible performances, this year's awards show was dominated by Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which took home a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">record-breaking 13 nominations and nine award wins</a>, including Game of the Year.

The lack of communication and clarity from show organizers has left some Future Class alumni wondering whether the program was simply a superficial way for the oft-criticized extravaganza to garner a bit of goodwill.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unknown Worlds co-founders duke it out with Krafton"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ousted-unknown-worlds-founders-former-ceo-sue-krafton-for-breach-of-contract">Unknown Worlds co-founders duke it out with Krafton</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where do we even start with this one?

"Keep an eye out to grab a discounted copy, whether that's for a friend, a family member, or for yourself. That's it! But for a tiny team, that feels like a lot! And we've even more plans for 2026 that we're keeping under wraps.

<p><a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/2000929148324217105">Koei Tecmo</a> and <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/2000929148324217105">Nintendo</a> have announced that version 1.0.3 will drop on 18th December 2025, version 1.0.3 is adding new features, more Battle and Hyrule Challenges in the post-game, and a brand new difficulty mode (Thanks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3ma4cogcglm2w">OatmealDome</a>!).</p>
<p>Let's dig into Phantom Mode, first — this is an event that randomly occurs in fights you've already cleared. Some foes will turn into either a more powerful version of itself or a "Miasma" variant. Oh, and Phantom Ganon can appear out of nowhere.

<p>A few functionality and bug fixes are being patched in too, but for a deeper rundown of the specifics, we'll have the full English patch notes later this week. For now, here are the major new additions (via Koei Tecmo, Google Translate):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Phantom Mode</strong><br>
"Phantom Mode" is a new feature that randomly occurs in battles that have already been cleared.</p>
<p>In battles where "Phantom Mode" occurs, some of the enemies that appear will change into "Dangerous Species" or "Miasma Enemies," and there is a chance that "Phantom Ganon" will appear when a strong enemy is defeated. Compared to normal battles, you can obtain more "High-Purity Zonanium Steel."<br>
<strong><br>
Difficulty level "Taboo"</strong><br>
In the new difficulty level "Taboo," you can experience high-difficulty battles that are even more tense than "Very Hard."</p>
<p>By clearing a certain number of battles in "Taboo," you will receive special rewards such as "High-Purity Zonanium Steel" and "Increased Carry Limit for Special Food."<br>
<strong><br>
Adding new challenges</strong><br>
Following the first free update, the second update will also add multiple <strong>"Battle Challenges"</strong> and <strong>"Hyrule Challenges"<br></strong><br>
to the Hyrule map after clearing the main story. Lizalfos and Chuchu will appear as new "dangerous species." Additionally, the "Training Hall" on Sky Island will be unlocked, allowing players to activate Sync Strikes by entering the "Training Hall" with two other players.<br>
<strong><br>
New unique skills added</strong><br>
New unique skills will be added to the Mysterious Golem for the One-Handed Sword, Two-Handed Sword, and Spear.</p>
<p>The One-Handed Sword's unique skill, "Shield Charge," allows you to step forward with your shield ready to ward off dangerous attacks from charging enemies. Additionally, by timing this skill with an enemy attack, you can unleash a powerful spinning slash.<br>
(You can learn it by completing the "Battle Challenge" and "Hyrule Challenge" that will be added in this update.)<br>
<strong><br>
New weapons added</strong><br>
The Forbidden Sword, a one-handed sword whose blade has been tainted by miasma and transformed into a sinister blade, has been added. It can be equipped by Mysterious Golems and warriors of all races.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the following new battles will be added:<br>
- "Battles focused on warriors"<br>
- "A deadly battle with a certain formidable enemy"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you haven't been back to Age of Imprisonment since launch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-update-1-0-2-patch-notes-new-quests-weapons-and-battles-added">the last update</a> brought with it new challenges, weapons, and sync strikes, so you'll have plenty more to do with 1.0.2 <em>and</em> 1.0.3.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Let us know whether you'll be diving into Taboo Mode in the comments.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Celebrating Rainbow Six Siege’s 10th Birthday With Ubisoft Montreal – Interview with Alex Karpazis and Joshua Mills]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-10-year-anniversary-celebration-interview-joshua-mills-alex-karpazis-ubisoft-montreal/</link>
            <guid>1384597</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>"<em>You're game only turns 10 once</em>," said creative director Alex Karpazis as a means of an apology before showing other members of the press and me a previously released video he assumed we had already seen, celebrating Ubisoft's Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege reaching over 100 million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege-review/">across the 10 years it has been on shelves</a>.</p>



<p>He has no need to apologize, of course. Anyone who was a part of building a game like Rainbow Six Siege would want to show it off and its accomplishments as much as possible. It's a game that, despite how you might feel about it now, has stood the test of time. It went from being a major miss at launch to becoming one of the mainstay multiplayer games in the industry, even after games like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone arrived two and five years after it (respectively) to take over the multiplayer shooter space in a way that no one has dominated since.</p>



<p>Karpazis was showing us the anniversary video below while, just outside the cornered off room we were in, Ubisoft Montreal staff, their families, fans of the game, and content creators were sharing a large space on the bottom floor of the Montreal studio, partying and celebrating all of that, and the journey Rainbow Six Siege went on in the last 10 years to get to this anniversary.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege: 10th Anniversary Celebration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RV0y0xTRLhs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I wasn't just there to attend a party and to watch an old video with the game's creative leads. Members of the press and I were given a tour of the Ubisoft Montreal studio, which lives in an old textile factory building that was converted into an office building, and eventually, entirely overtaken by Ubisoft after they occupied just the fifth floor when they first moved in.</p>



<p>I also got to speak with Alexander Karpazis and Joshua Mills, Rainbow Six's game director, all about the 10 years leading to this milestone, how the landscape of live service games and multiplayer first-person shooters has changed in the last decade, and I also got the chance to prod at a personal question I have for Ubisoft overall, which is trying to figure out why Assassin's Creed Valhalla is such an unbelievably long game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-1-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The face of Ubisoft Montreal was all Rainbow Six Siege-focused for the anniversary.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before I get into all of that, I want to dig into the tour of the studio during the day and the evening's festivities first. Starting with the tour, which couldn't help but feel like a school trip to the science centre. Not that I'm finding fault in that. That's just how these things seem to go, or at least that's been my experience of Ubisoft studio tours since this was my third one within two years.</p>



<p>At my previous outlet, I had the opportunity to visit Ubisoft Toronto ahead of Star Wars Outlaws' launch, and just prior to joining Wccftech, I got to visit Ubisoft Quebec ahead of Assassin's Creed Shadows' release. Both of those tours had a layer of that 'school trip' feeling, but each stop on the way through the building had a direct connection to the game and that team's role in its development.</p>

This is what the lights look like at 5% power.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, it is always undeniably cool to see the spaces and the technology that a massive triple-A company like Ubisoft puts behind its games, and it was especially cool to see two volunteers from our group get scanned the same way Ubisoft would any of its actors or physical objects it wants to bring into the game in detailed ways.</p>



<p>The foley room was also a personal highlight, but the letdown of it all was not getting to see very much about what's coming next for Rainbow Six Siege. We did get an early look at Wildcards after the tour, but overall, the tour itself just felt disconnected from the game that brought me and everyone else on the tour to Montreal.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After the tour, and before my conversation with Alex Karpazis and Joshua Mills, we hung around the celebration event, where there were displays of key moments from Rainbow Six Siege's history, including a wall documenting the 10-year journey since the game's launch and its internal pre-launch beginnings.</p>



<p>There were also replicas of recognizable weapons, gadgets, and armour from Rainbow Six Siege, though perhaps the most significant display was that of messages from players that Ubisoft received over the last 10 years. Not the kinds of comments and messages you'd see on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or Reddit, but messages like a letter from a couple that met while playing Rainbow Six Siege, who were married this year on October 4, 2025, and who likely would not have found each other if not for Siege.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>A wall of portraits of Operators from Rainbow Six Siege.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Or a letter from Connor, a Siege player from the US who had to deal with major health issues in recent years and was helped through his struggles by playing Siege, a game he's played since 2016. These letters, the families of the developers attending the event, and the wall of Siege's journey were some of the most tangible displays of how much impact Rainbow Six Siege has had in 10 years.</p>



<p>It's always good to be reminded of how games touch the lives of millions of people in ways you can't know, because the well is so vast and we have so many games at our fingertips. In that framing, the fact that Rainbow Six Siege has been around for 10 years is all the more impressive and impactful, especially when you remember that hundreds of games, even those made by Ubisoft, don't have that kind of longevity. This is all to say that, for a moment, it didn't feel like a cookie-cutter corporate party. </p>

<p>With that settled, here's my conversation with Rainbow Six Siege's creative director Alex Karpazis and game director Joshua Mills.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Could you please start by saying who you are, your role within Rainbow Six Siege, how long you've been with the game and how long you've been with Ubisoft?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex</strong> <strong>Karpazis:</strong> <em>The name is Alex Karpazis, creative director on Rainbow Six Siege. I've been a part of the team for over seven years now and I've been with Ubisoft for over 14 years.</em></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills:</strong> <em>My name is Joshua Mills, [I'm] the game director on Siege. I've been with Siege for a little over four years now, but I've been at Ubisoft for over 10 years</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Rainbow Six Siege has been around for 10 years now, and for a number of those years, it was <em>the</em> example to other studios of how it is possible to turn around a multiplayer FPS game that doesn't hit its mark at launch.</strong> <strong>Looking at the landscape of shooters now, where do you feel Rainbow Six sits in the heiarchy of live service and first-person shooters?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills:</strong> <em>Well, first, I'm still incredibly proud of where we stand, for Rainbow. Like the fact is we're going strong, 10 years in. We just crossed a hundred million</em> <em>players active in the game and being part of this</em> <em>community, which is amazing. As far as, like, [the] competition of it all, we've always kind of done our own thing as far as how we move this game forward and then where we focus, and I don't think we're going to be changing that.</em></p>



<p><em>We just want to continue to serve our community as much as possible and exactly what they want, because at the end of the day, Rainbow is a really, really unique experience, and we're going to continue to build and serve that. And because of it being such a unique experience, it's one of a kind, in a lot of ways. Once you play Rainbow and you really get into it, it's very hard to find that anywhere else, and I'm super proud of the team and where we are on this, and we'll just keep investing on it.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-event-Photos-6-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>An entire wall dedicated to telling the story of Rainbow Six Siege.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>I would say, not only just to double down on that, but we're always trying to answer the needs of our players first, and not to whatever some competition is doing. It's one of the reasons why we chose to continue invest in the game rather than do something like a sequel. So, hopefully, that sets the precedence that others can look and say, 'hey, this can work,' because for us, we're always going to want to reward and respect the time that our community puts into a game.</em></p>



<p><strong>You've clearly carved out a community of players that play Siege, they love to play Siege, and they'll keep playing Siege. So how do you focus, with the next 10 years in mind, how do you direct for those players and then also for chances to grow the game, because you know you can't stay stagnant; growth is required. So how do you balance both?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>I think one of the key things there is the depth of Siege. We haven't reached the bottom of that barrel, like, as far as what we do next, the game is constantly kind of showcasing where we should be going next, just by the nature of it being a systemic beast of a game, which is fantastic and it helps us continue to reinforce that core, which is reinforcing that core audience.</em></p>



<p><em>Beyond that, how can we kind of open the doors for more players to get involved and grow? It really influenced impacting on our onboarding experience, because Siege has an intimidation factor around it. It is a tough game, but it is incredibly rewarding once you really get into it and you understand the mechanics and understand, say, some of the maps and stuff. So our investment into onboarding is a pretty big focus. We literally, just with Season 4 launching this week, the Clear House mode was introduced. Which is kind of a reinvention of T-Hunt, almost, which is an awesome way for players to be able to start learning maps, learning weapons, and also it came with a mini map, which we didn't have anything like this.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-7-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>We'll see if Ubisoft is able to stay true to this goal.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>In fact, I think, what was</em> <em>it, Year Seven, when we got our first tutorial kind of thing? So that's the kind of focus we need to have for new players coming in. Because, we've said this before, we recognize [that] we may not be your first FPS, but we're going to be you're last FPS. That's our kind of target on it because there is a step that's required to get into Rainbow, but if you're willing to make that step, we're going to do everything in our power to help guide you along the way. The road to mastery is ridiculously long and up until this point, it's been a gravel road with a lot of hills and we're paving it a little bit, but it's still going to be just as long.</em></p>



<p><em>So you have this time to invest and you have this time to gain that mastery, and we're going to do our best to make it a little smoother for you.</em></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>I would say too, when</em> <em>you're talking about growth. First, the players who jump into Siege and love Siege, supporting us all this time,</em> <em>it's incredible. But this has now become a generational game. So, [if] you were 20 years old, and now you're 30, going into the game, it's about ushering in that new generation of people who haven't discovered it yet.</em> <em>So, for us, that's great,</em> <em>because we're now building this</em> <em>community and the next generation is just being added to it, added to it, added to it. So we can see that in our player base, just how they're evolving and how they're growing. Like, that's hugely satisfying to see that kind of impact</em> <em>too.</em> </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-8-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>One of the rooms in Ubisoft Montreal's foley studio.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The landscape of live service games has changed so much; there are all these new challenges for developers, and all these new flavours of live service games. Where do you pull inspiration from now? How has that changed over the years, and how do you find ways to still be creative?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills:</strong> <em>I think one of the key things, when we're talking about inspiration and making sure we're going true to the path that Rainbow needs to follow, is to</em> <em>look at the legacy of Rainbow Six itself. The entirety of Siege was built off that legacy, and we continue to reference it and build forward with it. Looking in other people's backyards for our solutions, for the game, isn't necessarily going to be the Siege solution, and it's really important we recognize that and know we are a niche experience as well.</em></p>



<p><em>We're a tactical hero-based shooter. Which is, there's not</em> <em>many in that same demographic, let alone at the level of intensity that we're offering. So, not all solutions are going to work with us. There are universal options and design theories and stuff like this that work with a lot of different games, and that's fantastic. But I think in general, it's much healthier for both your community, your team, and the industry to serve your niche as best as possible. And that's really how we focus on it.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-9-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Someone at the event is either a big Phineas and Ferb fan or just a big fan of platypuses.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>On top of that is, the things we are adapting to right now are still answering to the needs of the players, and that's making sure that their appetite for content is satiated, and it's a never ending goal for us, but to be able to quickly deliver new content, new events. We're seeing it with</em> <em>Season 4, we've just been starting to communicate it more and more, we want to be able to make more meaningful change to the game that answers to the needs of the players faster.</em></p>



<p><em>So whether that's meta changing updates so that our players, who love to theory craft, get to make more of those changes sooner, that's something that we want to focus on for now for the future, that answers their needs</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>That's a really good example, because the reality is people consume video games in a very different way than they did 10 years ago, and being able to meet those needs, while at the same time, obviously,</em> <em>we're making sure we're respecting our team and respecting the core base that we're trying to move forward with and the core identity of the game, but a hundred percent this is part of the way we are changing some stuff so we can serve those needs.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-10-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>There was a lot of memorabilia showcasing Rainbow Six Siege's esports history.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How set up for success do you feel under the new regime with Vantage Studios? It's a huge change, and kind of an unavoidable topic. Do you feel set up for success and while revenue is the obvious way everyone measures success, it's not the only way, so how are you measuring success?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>At least when it comes to Vantage Studios and what it means for us, it means that there is commitment and investment in the Rainbow Six game and Siege itself. So, for us, it's when we say we're going to be around for the next 10 years,</em> <em>this is something that can help us build that future as well. So that's something that's really encouraging for the entire team. </em></p>



<p><em>And then speaking as creatives, the way that we're measuring success is looking at the player satisfaction of the game, making sure that the changes we make resonate with them and that we're not alienating our community and we're not disregarding their investment in a game that has been around for 10 years</em> <em>and we want it to be around for 10 more years too.</em></p>



<p><strong>So that's why you'd never make a sequel?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>It's one of the big reasons why we did <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">[Rainbow Six] Siege X</a>, to make sure that we set that new foundation and we don't discard anything. We don't throw out what we've spent so much hard work building for right now.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-11-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Several of the displays included looks at Rainbow Six Siege concept art.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Looking back on the last 10 years, could both of you tell me what moment you are most proud of and what you feel was your biggest mistake in those 10 years?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>I think for me, I mean, this team's seen a lot of different things, different</em> <em>changes. Speaking professionally,</em> <em>going through the COVID time and all of a sudden everybody has to work from home, but still deliver a season every three months. That's probably one of my proudest moments of being a part of this team. Not skipping a beat and finding ways to work in a new environment that we all weren't really sure about</em>. <em>Absolutely one of my proudest moments with the project, with Siege, and with the team itself.</em></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>I'm thinking more about the worst, the second part. But as far as proudest moments of the team and everything like that, shipping [Siege] X was big for us, because we were essentially building a second game at the same time, still supporting one, and that was tough. That was really, really, really tough, and I'm incredibly proud of the team for the work that went in there because...okay.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-12-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Some of these displays felt like a peak into a future where Ubisoft opens a museum like Nintendo.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>I get made fun of a lot on the team now, about this, because I got a little emotional a couple of moments when we were on stages. But that was because in those moments I was thinking about the blood, sweat, and tears that were going into the game, and the hard conversations that were happening and just people literally grinding to get it done, to bring everything they could to it. It was a tremendous amount of effort and work,</em> <em>and again, there's foundational work there, not all of it was player facing, but it set us [up] for Year 11 and beyond</em>, <em>with different things that we can do. But yeah, shipping that felt great, like, just getting it all out there and pulling it off because it was wild that we attempted it, to be honest. [It was] a lot of work</em>.</p>



<p><em>Now, as far as the biggest mistake, that's a tricky one-</em></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis:</strong> <em>That one's easy. It's Pizza Mozzie. [Karpazis and Mills laugh]. Pizza Mozzie was a customization that we released for a character called Mozzie, our Australian operation, and he looks like, I want to say, he's a pizza slice as a head</em>-</p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>Pizza-the-Hut from Spaceballs or something.</em></p>



<p><strong>Alex Karpazis: </strong><em>Yeah, with googly eyes on it. So that one's on us.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ubisoft-Montreal-R6-Event-Photos-13-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>A Rainbow Six Siege love story.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills:</strong> <em>So, I though I had to pick from me specifically, but I'll say, I'll be really honest. When I joined Siege, I was a little slow in my confidence to act on certain things because I was trying to figure out the live pace of the game and understanding how quickly we need to move on different things and stuff like this, because there was, different balancing things that were live for too long, in my opinion, where we could have resolved it faster and I really wish we had, but it was a learning experience, and that's the reality of it. You learn from these, we call them mistakes, but they're learning opportunities, and it was exactly that and it led us to being faster and being more dialed in on how we make certain changes</em>. <em>This is the earlier stuff though, like this is around Grim and Souls kind of things, but learning from that was a big one for me. Pizza Mozzie is a nightmare, but that one, that one's for me.</em></p>



<p><strong>I have one final question, apologies to you Alex because it is for Josh, because I know you worked on Assassin's Creed Valhalla before Siege. You were a level designer, a lead level designer and quest designer. So, are you the reason why the game's so long?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Mills: </strong><em>[Laughs] Okay, so, actually I can tell you this. Anyone who had an issue with a quest after the game's launch, like they had a progression block or whatever, I was the guy who fixed it. So, I joined the team later in production, to come in as the guy to put</em> <em>out a lot of different fires. Like, the drainer quest system, I built that and worked with a bunch of different folks on this, but then I was sent to spot fix different things and all the different quests across the entire game.</em></p>



<p><em>And then after we launched, I ended up doing post-launch support for all the quests, pretty much solo, for a good while there. But, I built out the system for it, so, anytime you'd load your save and maybe you couldn't progress, and then you load it up after a patch and then it worked, I did that for a year of just fixing post-launch support stuff. So, the length of it, I got nothing on that. But I supported all of it though, as far as correcting different things in it and being a spot fixer</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[I’ve been waiting years for Animal Crossing’s best new features]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features</link>
            <guid>1384594</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I never felt done with my <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> island. Despite playing every day for two years, and racking up 1,700 hours of playtime, I somehow never finished decorating. I had plenty of <em>ideas</em> for my island, sure, but actually implementing them was another story: The decorating and terraforming systems that helped make <em>New Horizons</em> a huge success are also slow, manual, and cumbersome, and my patience for decorating and redecorating had finally worn thin.</p><p>Fast-forward a few years, and a very much unexpected update is coming to finally fix some of those pain points. Update 3.0 is launching on January 15th, 2026, alongside the Switch 2 Edition of <em>New Horizons</em>. And while the paid Switch 2 upgrade has some nice-to-haves (like Joy-Con 2 mouse controls for indoor decorating), it’s the free update that brings all the key new features.</p><p>I recently attended a virtual preview for the <em>New Horizons</em> upgrade and update, and there are two caveats: I have not yet played either the Switch 2 version or the new free content myself, and it’s hard to gauge the quality of the Switch 2 version’s visual and performance improvements over a Zoom call. (I still have some unanswered questions about the biggest performance issues on the original Switch, like the choppy frame rate on more densely decorated islands.) But seeing the 3.0 additions in action, it was easy to imagine myself finishing my island — or at least <em>an</em> island.</p><p>As shown in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january">October announcement trailer</a>, update 3.0 makes much-needed quality-of-life fixes. You’ll finally be able to craft multiple items at once, <em>and </em>crafting will pull materials from your overall storage instead of your pockets, meaning you won’t have to do a bunch of inventory management just to craft some decor. Then there’s Resetti’s Reset Service, which can help you clean up entire sections of your island instantly so you don’t have to pick everything up individually in order to redecorate. Some players also noticed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkq2sdWhX2Q">a very subtle but potentially impactful change to movement while terraforming</a> that should hopefully make it a smoother process. And then, as if to show off those decorating improvements, Nintendo also added Slumber Islands.</p><p>Not to be confused with dreams, <em>New Horizons</em>’ online island-sharing feature, Slumber Islands are <em>extra</em> sandboxes for you to decorate and play with, where you can set the time of day and the weather and magically conjure up any item you have in your in-game catalog to decorate with, similar to the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC. You can build bridges and inclines instantly by talking to Lloid, rather than going through Tom Nook and waiting (or time traveling) a day. And while it seems like terraforming works the same on Slumber Islands, the apparent addition of strafing while terraforming — instead of having to constantly reorient yourself manually — should help at least a little bit. (It’s the first thing I’m going to test on January 15th, that’s for sure.)</p><p>For me, the worst part of decorating in <em>New Horizons</em> was having an idea, ordering all the furniture I’d need for it over the course of days, testing out the design, realizing it did <em>not</em> look the way I envisioned, and facing the tedious process of breaking it all down and starting over again brick by brick — or, at the very least, having to push and pull objects around for a while to see if I could make it work. The design process I saw on Nintendo’s Slumber Island during the preview, meanwhile, seemed quicker and smoother. Trying out an idea or aesthetic in that environment doesn’t sound like such a tall order.</p><p>Without any hands-on time, I can’t say if it will <em>actually</em> be noticeably easier to design and decorate with the 3.0 update. But I’m excited by the idea that I can go to my Slumber Island scratch pad and try out my designs before committing to them (and the cost in bells to get it all done) on my main island. And maybe, if I really like how it feels to decorate, I’ll make an entire Halloween-themed Slumber Island — the kind of island I’ve wanted to make for years but never did on my main island, where the seasons continue to change and actively ruin the vibe.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features]]></content:encoded>

              <p>It’s been less than a week since Larian Studios <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed <em>Divinity</em></a>. Fans have spent much of that time <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105">debating whether it would be an action-RPG</a>.&nbsp;While much of the new game remains mysterious, studio head Swen Vincke isn’t trying to keep that part a secret. He recently confirmed it will indeed be a turn-based game like its other recent hits, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Except he’s also promising it will be “way better” than the 2023<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based Game of the Year winner.</p> <p>“<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was a good game and I’m proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better,” Vincke <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> this week. One challenge during&nbsp;<em>BG3</em>‘s development <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-dnd-races-classes-hours-ps5-xbox-pc-1850590383">was taking the existing ruleset</a> for Wizards of the Coast’s pen-and-paper RPG and adapting it to a video game. “Here, we’re making a system that’s made for a video game. It’s much easier to understand,” he explained.</p>

 <p>Considering <em>BG3</em> is already one of the most beloved games of the last decade, surpassing it will be a tall order, but the veteran developer doesn’t seem worried. “[<em>Divinity</em>] is going to be us unleashed, I think,” Vincke said. “It’s a turn-based RPG featuring everything you’ve seen from us in the past, but it’s brought to the next level.”</p>

 <p>That “next level” includes growing development resources spread across a larger number of studios that will allow the team to make more of the game in parallel, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. Ideally, that should cut down on the development time. Vincke said Larian is aiming for three to four years with <em>Divinity</em>, rather than the six it took to make <em>BG3</em>. It will still start in Early Access, however, and won’t be arriving anytime in 2026.</p> <p>Where will this new level of investment show up? More cinematic scenes and narrative experiments. In other words, the parts of <em>BG3</em> fans loved the most. “We’re doing a couple of things that you haven’t seen in RPGs before, I think,” the Larian cofounder said. I hope <em>Divinity</em> delivers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Watch 8 earlier this year, at a not-so-friendly, but quite justifiable retail price of $350. If you’ve been wanting to upgrade but the high price tag has been holding you back, we bring good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/">Thanks to Amazon, you can now snap it up for just $250, after the retailer quite generously took a massive $100 off it</a>. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, and you’ll even get free shipping with your purchase, which means $250 is quite literally all you’ve got to pay. The deal applies to the graphite and silver color options. Additionally, Amazon is also offering a free two-month Audible trial with your purchase, which is a service that lets you buy and stream audiobooks, podcasts, and audio shows.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Blend of Fitness and Health Features</h2>
<p>At first glance, the watch looks quite similar to its predecessor, but that isn’t really the case. It features a sleek, thinner-than-ever silhouette and offers a snug fit with a sporty style. The screen is both spacious and bright, letting you view your stats, check notifications, keep an eye on the latest news, and more, comfortably throughout the day. The interface has improved, too, so using the thing is going to feel more effortless than ever.</p>
<p>Watch 8 comes packed with a range of health and fitness features. We’re talking Vascular Load monitoring that monitors your stress levels, plus an antioxidant index that uses BioActive Sensor to measure carotenoid levels in your skin. When worn at night, the watch tracks how well you sleep at night, and offers Advanced Sleep Coaching to provide you with tips and insights that can help you rest better. Based on your performance/energy levels of the previous day, it even creates a personalized Energy Score with the help of Galaxy AI. This score lets you see how ready your body is for the upcoming challenges, which you can take into consideration while planning stuff for the day. For instance, a score over 85 indicates you’re well-rested, making it an ideal day to take on the tasks you’ve been putting off. A lower score suggests you need rest, so it might be a good idea to skip an intense workout that day.</p>



<p>Fitness-wise, the watch tracks your steps and comes with a Running Coach that monitors your performance and gives you real-time feedback. There are a bunch of fitness programs built right in, which you can follow to train better. As for the battery, the life depends on how you’re using the watch, but you can expect it to last around 1-2 days. What’s more, Google Gemini integration brings an efficient AI assistant right to your wrist. You can use it to find quick answers, brainstorm ideas, get help with replies, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Connecting it to your smartphone via Bluetooth gets you all your important notifications right on the app. You can check emails or messages, plus manage music without pulling your phone out.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to grab the latest Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, now is a great time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/">This deal lets you grab it at a nice $100 discount, for just $250.</a> There are two color options to choose from, and multiple band sizes available.</p>

            <guid>1384582</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has outlined what's new in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dota-2"><u>Dota 2</u></a> patch 7.40 and provided a rundown of its latest hero, Largo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dota is an ensemble cast, but keen observers looking through the collection of rogues, wizards, druids, and knights (not to mention two characters named 'ranger') may have noticed the absence of that most maligned of hero classes: the bard. At least, up until now," Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>, before introducing Largo himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Largo is the shamanic head of the bardmonk order, and unlike bards that "sing about current events and chord changes," he "tailors every song to his exact circumstances, raising his allies' spirits or, if necessary, their foot speed as they run toward battle (or away). As a frog, his prehensile tongue has, shall we say, all kinds of tricks."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One such trick is his Catchy Lick, in which he targets someone, licks them, pulls them back a short distance, and applies a basic dispel. If they're an ally, he pulls them out of harm's way, and if they're an enemy, his tongue deals damage. By dispelling an effect from a target, Largo gets a brief health regen, too. He can also fire froglings that stomp the ground every second, dealing damage and ministuns, and minimize ally mana costs with his Croak of Genius skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ultimate skill is Amphibian Rhapsody. To be honest, with a name as incredible as that, I don't even <em>care</em> what it does, but for those wondering, it's essentially a mini-rhythm game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Largo gets ready to groove," Valve explains. "He is disarmed and his ability bar switches to three song abilities, each with different effects. Songs are only effective if strummed on the beat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every time he strums successfully, he gains a stack of Groovin'. Each stack gives him bonus armor and reduces the mana cost of every song, but he loses a stack if he misses a beat. Stacks linger for a short duration when Largo's song ends."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is tradition, the full patch notes are so huuuge they're too big to publish on Steam itself, <a href="https://www.dota2.com/largo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>but you can find them on the Dota 2 website right here</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Built with Unreal Engine 5, Legacy of Atlantis is due out next year as the franchise marks its 30th anniversary, with Catalyst set to follow in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some, quite naturally, suggest starting at the beginning makes sense given the anniversary, others are wondering if the announcement of the new game means the team has to go back and retcon some aspects of Lara Croft's story to make sure everything makes sense in the character's 30-year-old canon timeline.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are many theories about why the reimagining of TR1 is happening. Some say it’s only because of the 30th anniversary but I personally think it’s happening because it HAS to happen. We’re entering a new unified timeline where some things need to be retconned and some need to be reimagined," suggested X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/merychxrry/status/2000648075636011212" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Merychxrry</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This kind of reimagining will likely need to happen for every mainline game, but especially for these four story-heavy titles: Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, Tomb Raider: Legend, and Tomb Raider: Underworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You might ask, 'Why not TR2-3 first?' Well, they’re not story-heavy. As much as I’d love to see them remade, we first need to unify these four story-focused games. Otherwise, it would take too long to reach them, and their stories would need to be retconned."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Mery added, the order itself likely doesn't matter — "it could be 4 and 6 first, then Legends and Underworld, or vice-versa" — but since the assets for Legacy of Atlantis will be available first, "it shouldn't take too long to produce these games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That is actually genius!" <a href="https://x.com/Gamer_0wl/status/2000772462947037443?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a> one commenter, while another <a href="https://x.com/jaylennasir/status/2000792479189364981?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "Yes!

"TR1 was the safest choice they had for a reimagining because of its simple story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As game director Will Kerslake recently told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-catalyst-picks-up-years-after-2008s-underworld-finally-continuing-lara-crofts-story-from-the-legend-trilogy-after-almost-two-decades/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar+</u></a>, Catalyst fits into the timeline <em>after</em> the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld. The most recent games, known as the Survivor reboot trilogy — 2013's Tomb Raider, 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider, and 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider — are still considered as part of Croft's origin story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the news of the recasting was a surprise for some, actor Camilla Luddington — who portrayed Lara Croft in the Survivor Trilogy — shared a bittersweet Instagram post about her time as the lead this week, saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lara-croft-survivor-trilogy-actor-camilla-luddington-passes-the-baton-to-alix-wilton-regan-who-takes-on-the-role-for-tomb-raider-catalyst-and-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>she loved the fans and Croft will "forever be a part of [her]</u></a>." Alix Wilton Regan will now play Lara Croft in both Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis and Tomb Raider: Catalyst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there's the upcoming Amazon TV show to consider.

An unknown force spreads strife and madness through her realm.</p><p>The choice is yours—shape the future, for salvation or ruin.

The DLC will add new dungeons, buildings, weapons, characters, quests, and even entirely new systems to shake up the gameplay. This includes an all-new ranching system, which will let you tame and raise beasts that can be used as mounts or as emergency food, depending on how dire your situation gets.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YH21SghaUU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9YH21SghaUU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Continuing the story of the main game, Woolhaven adds a whole new region to explore as you journey to the titular Woolhaven, which also happens to be the lambs' ancestral home. Keeping your flock safe in Woolhaven will be even more of a challenge than in the base game, faced with the ice and snow of Yngya, the God of Winter and the forgotten God of the Lambs.</p><p>The trials of winter won't be the only danger you'll have to contend with in Woolhaven, with enemies spread across the frozen mountain, and a creeping Rot threatening the Lambs' homeland.</p><p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven arrives for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on January 22, and will cost $17.</p>

                <p>In November, a modder going by the name Froddoyo released Project Misriah, which used Valve's Counter-Strike 2 as a medium to recreate Halo 3. The mod was well-received by fans, but apparently not by Microsoft itself. Microsoft filed a takedown request with Valve, and the latter complied.</p><p>Froddoyo described Project Misriah as "a workshop collection of Halo ported maps and assets that aims to bring a Halo 3 multiplayer-like experience to Counter-Strike 2." It also directly lifted character models, maps, gameplay mechanics, and sound effects from Halo 3, which may have contributed to Microsoft's desire to have the mod removed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ki1RQF0-jyk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Froddoyo shared the takedown on X, and wrote, "It was fun while it lasted. Make sure to give your thanks to Microsoft!"</p><p>In a separate comment posted on the trailer's YouTube page, Froddoyo thanked players for supporting the mod but noted that it will not uploaded again. In a more hopeful message, Froddoyo added, "We will use the knowledge and skills obtained from this to cook up something else!"</p><p>It's unclear if Microsoft has any plans to revisit Halo 3 or any of the other classic games in the franchise beyond the first one. The original Halo: Combat Evolved is getting a modern remake called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, which will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the franchise while launching simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 in 2026. There are reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-last-update-arrives-this-month-as-devs-move-to-other-halo-projects/1100-6536070/" data-ref-id="1100-6536070">other unannounced Halo games</a> currently in the works, but it's unclear what Halo Studios will release after Campaign Evolved.</p>

Also similar to Silksong, all players who already own the Nintendo Switch version of Hollow Knight will get the Switch 2 Edition for free when it launches.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In preparation for the Switch 2 upgrade, Hollow Knight is going to get a major update across all platforms, which will serve to add new features and patch up bugs in the game. Players on PC will be able to preview some of these upgrades in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new public beta branch</a> for Hollow Knight, available to test through Steam or GOG. The beta update includes official support for people playing on Steam Deck or ultrawide monitors, with full 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support.</p><p>Team Cherry hasn't shared a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition, only saying that it will arrive sometime in 2026. The studio has also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-getting-a-free-nautical-themed-expansion/1100-6536988/" data-ref-id="1100-6536988">a new free expansion for Silksong</a>, Sea of Sorrow, which is also scheduled to release in 2026.</p><p>It's been a big year for the Australian indie studio, with the surprise release of Hollow Knight: Silksong in September after an extended seven-year development period. Silksong took home the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">award for Best Action Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and was included as one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2025/2900-7322/" data-ref-id="2900-7322">GameSpot's 10 best games of 2025</a>.</p>

The studio once again isn't planning on giving incremental updates during development, saying that they will be releasing more information on Sea of Sorrow "shortly before" release.</p>

<section><p>Divinity game director Swen Vincke and writing director Adam Smith sat down with GameSpot to talk about their follow-up to Baldur’s Gate 3 right after its announcement at this year’s Game Awards.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">After a lot of back and forth on the internet regarding what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/" data-ref-id="1100-6536779">Geoff Keighley’s demonic obelisk</a> could mean, it was finally revealed at The Game Awards that the statue was related to Divinity, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/divinity-official-larian-studios-teaser-trailer-with-full-intro-from-the-game-awards-2025/2300-6466578/" data-ref-id="2300-6466578">the next game from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios</a>. Shortly after that reveal, we at GameSpot received an email asking if we would like to go sit with game director Swen Vincke and writing director Adam Smith to talk about the game once the show concluded.</p><p dir="ltr">Post-TGA plans sorted.</p><p dir="ltr">Returning to Divinity was always, eventually, in the cards for the team at Larian, but it wasn’t the original plan following Baldur’s Gate 3. “ We were gonna do more Dungeons and Dragons, so we were in the process of figuring out what that was,” says Smith. “And one fateful day, we sat down and realized that we weren't excited and we don't wanna make a game we're not excited about. And so we said, ‘Can we go back to Divinity right away?’”</p><p dir="ltr">In order to do that, the team knew that they had a lot of work ahead of them. While Rivellon, the setting of the Divinity games, has been deeply explored in previous entries, Larian had never actually sat down to build their universe from the ground up before.</p><p dir="ltr">“We learned from BG3 the importance of having a ruleset, allure, and a world solidified behind you,” says Vincke. “It was quite a lot of work actually. [Now] we know what the days of the week are. We know what people eat in the evening. We know the way they dress. All these things needed to be sorted out. So as progress grew, we started saying, ‘Okay, well this is a really good cornerstone for everything that we've built. And there's never been a real Divinity, so let's just call it Divinity. People will henceforth refer to it as the Divinity Universe quickly and like it.’”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623334" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623334"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both Divinity and Baldur’s Gate 3 share a lot of connective tissue; rich, fantasy worlds filled with magic and a diverse roster of races. However, when it comes to gameplay, the two are quite different. While the Original Sin duology bears somewhat of a resemblance to Baldur’s Gate 3, previous installments prior to those games have looked more like titles such as Diablo and The Witcher. So what should players expect from this new Divinity? “Agency,” says Vincke plainly. “Agency at every level. In the systems and how you can develop your character, your identity, and then also obviously in the narrative and the choices that you make.”</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke then points out how dark the trailer for the game that premiered at the TGAs is. “ We have this thing that the player will be the one that brings light into the darkness or pushes it completely into deeper darkness,” says Vincke. “ We want you to be surprised at the level of things that you can do.”</p><p dir="ltr">When pressed for more granular details on the gameplay, Smith adds that the team wants the game to speak for itself when it's ready to be shown. “You don't want to be told, 'This is what it's gonna do.' You want to see it,” says Smith. “You know the kind of games we make, so you can speculate from there. But we'll put it in front of you as soon as we're ready to, and then you'll see what it is.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623335" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623335"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Divinity is likely to be the first game in the series that many players will experience thanks to the immense popularity of Baldur’s Gate 3, the team is making sure that existing fans of the franchise also feel it to be a continuation of what has come before. “We ensure that that continuity is present. If you didn't know it, you will [still] fully understand everything that's going on,” says Vincke.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke explains that it will be akin to how Baldur’s Gate 3 had plenty of continuity with the previous games in the series but didn't require you to have played Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2 to understand it. He also points out that the Original Sin installments sold over 10 million copies, and therefore, there should be a large returning player-base in addition to those coming from BG3 as their first Larian title.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it’s easy to see how the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 might put enormous pressure on the development of Divinity to live up to player expectations. However, it’s not something that the team at Larian is concerning themselves with, as Smith points toward how much space there is left in the RPG genre to iterate and innovate. “Clair Obscur is so different to us and they nailed it, right? I think they did something very similar to us in that they made the game they wanted to make, [but] they did it in a completely different way [with] a completely different skeleton,” says Smith.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623336" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623336"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite feeling that Divinity doesn’t need to compete with Baldur’s Gate 3, Vincke is very confident that their new game is a step up from their previous outing. “ It's going to be better, in my opinion, on all fronts,” says Vincke. “ One of the biggest struggles that we had with Baldur’s Gate 3 is every single class has almost different rulesets, so getting players on board with that was quite complicated. I'm surprised actually that it worked out that well. I think when you see what we can do when we make something for a video game that’s not derived from a tabletop, it's going to be a lot better.”</p><p dir="ltr">For those that want to get a taste of what Divinity may have to offer, the previous installment in the franchise, Original Sin 2, just launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
