		<p>While Nintendo talked a bunch about the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> paid upgrades of a select few original Switch games, there’s also some titles that will be getting free upgrades to support the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Free updates to improve playability on the Nintendo Switch 2 system will be released for select Nintendo Switch games,” Nintendo states.</p>
<p>“By connecting your Nintendo Switch 2 to the internet, you can download free updates that may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games. The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These updates will work on multiple levels. Simplistically, they can offer visual improvements through higher resolutions and improved frame rates – this will be a boon for both The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Echoes of Wisdom, not to mention Pokémon Scarlet and Violet – but there are also patches to enable GameShare for titles with multiplayer.</p>


<p>GameShare lets a single copy of a game be used to share multiplayer access to other consoles, both locally for Switch and Switch 2 devices, and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">GameChat</a> for Switch 2. This is great for when you just want to each have your own personal screen instead of sharing a TV, games where all players might have different viewpoints and camera angles, and more. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">See here for more details for how GameShare works on Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>ARMS</li>
<li>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker <em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Super Mario Odyssey<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</li>
<li>Game Builder Garage</li>
<li>New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe</li>
<li>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</li>
<li>Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain <em>– GameShare</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction between a free update and a Switch 2 Edition paid upgrade seems to be whether or not Nintendo is adding significant content to their games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/23/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-switch/">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> are both getting major content expansions, while the improvements for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> extend to HDR support and Switch Online app support (and these updates can be had when bundled in with Switch Online + Expansion Pack). Cross-gen games like Metroid Prime 4 are more straightforward.</p>
<p>For the free upgrades, they could be as simple as lifting the dynamic resolution bounds and any frame rate caps to let the Switch 2 stretch its legs. We’d love to see similar for games with iffy visual quality and frame rates on the original Switch, like Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p>

<p>All of this means that third party developers are free to choose their own path. 2K are going down the paid upgrade path for Civilization 7, but other developers will no doubt choose free patches.</p>

            <p>
I'm not sure I've seen people swing back and forth on a game so rapidly like they have with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. It's had a few hiccoughs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">there</a>, which has made for some tough times for developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a>, at least in terms of battling the accursed "mixed" rating on Steam (and lower). In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to">The Game Business</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani quite accurately noted that it's been "one heck of a roller coaster year" for Helldivers 2, and also went on to speak about what it was like clawing its way back from low ratings - all the while having to explain to Sony about summer holidays in Sweden.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As Jorjani noted, at one point in time Helldivers 2 went as low as 30% positive on Steam, which as he says, "usually that's the death knell for a game, but we came back from that." The bigger problem came after some balancing tweaks which brought it down to 19%. "I think [19%] was the lowest. Games that get 19% user score do not generally recover." 
</p>
<p>
Except, at that point, everybody was on vacation. "When I was asked to step in [as CEO], they gave me the keys to the car… and told me: ‘we're going off on vacation, because we haven't been taking much over the last few summers,'" Jorjani explains. "And I was like: ‘we're running a live service game, people can't be off for the next three months!’ But that's what happens in Sweden. We take our summer vacations very seriously."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani had to explain this to SIE Studio Business Group CEO too, not exactly an easy task - "maybe the lowest point during my tenure so far" as the Arrowhead CEO put it - but a plan was formed, and reviews have swung back around to positive. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jorjani said he was "inspired" by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hello-games">Hello Games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, perhaps one of the most infamous games of the past decade when it comes to changing the rhetoric surrounding it. "The game was hyped, then bombed, and then they put the head to the grindstone and just updated the game," Jorjani noted.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Hello Games had a lot more work to do to right that spaceship, it took years to get it to where it's at now. The response to Helldivers 2 has certainly been a lot more volatile, and one could pretty easily argue that that fact speaks to where we're at with live service games: kick up enough of a fuss, and you'll more or less get what you want. In any case, fingers crossed for Arrowhead that Helldivers 2's second year goes a bit smoother.

Does the mashup of <em>Minecraft</em> jokes and fish-out-of-water oddball comedy succeed? </p><p><em>Entertainment Weekly</em>’s Jordan Hoffman seemed to think it was fine but that Black was a weak link. “His opening voiceover has some of the audible panic of someone asked to watch after someone else’s kids, laying on the excitement really thick in the hopes they don’t notice Mommy and Daddy have stepped away for a few minutes, “ he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/minecraft-review-jason-momoa-mines-gold-surprisingly-well-crafted-comedy-11706595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/minecraft-review-jason-momoa-mines-gold-surprisingly-well-crafted-comedy-11706595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a></span>. </p><p><em>Mashable</em>’s Kimber Myers was more upbeat, though she conceded that probably nobody watching the movie is there for the story. “Parents will likely find this film more entertaining than listening to their kids talk about <em>Minecraft</em> for the equivalent amount of time (101 minutes, for the record),” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mashable.com/article/a-minecraft-movie-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mashable.com/article/a-minecraft-movie-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a></span>. “<em>A Minecraft Movie</em> might also provide a deeper understanding of the universe (<em>Minecraft</em>’s, not the real one) for those who haven’t experienced it firsthand before. It’s a good primer for the game that never feels like homework.”</p><p>The creative conundrum at the center of <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is how to convert a game about freestyle play, exploration, and building into a coherent 90-minute spectacle, and the sense you start to get from reading many of the current reviews is that nothing that happens in the film is that impactful, but neither is it a drag, and often it’s pleasant enough. “The limitless creativity inherent in the game hasn’t been fully replicated in the movie, which is designed to expand its brand dominance,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-2025#google_vignette&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-2025#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a></span> Brian Tallerico for<em> RogerEbert.com</em>. “However, there’s just enough inspired heroism in this flick to make people who put the game down years ago circle back to it and build something new.”</p><p>Writing for <em>The New York Times</em>, Brandon Yu said that much of the film has “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a camp quality of so-dumb-it’s-sort-of-fun.</a></span>” For Jacob Oller at <em>The</em> <em>AV Club</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>the lack of any coherent story arc earned the film a C-. <em>IndieWire</em> gave it a similar grade, with critic David Erhlich <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-1235112484/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-1235112484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a></span>, “Fleet pacing, vivid colors, and a poppy Mark Mothersbaugh score do what they can to paper over the film’s prefab nature, but even kids — especially kids — will pick up on the disconnect between what they can make in <em>Minecraft</em> (anything they can imagine) and what Hess has made of <em>Minecraft</em> (nothing they haven’t seen before).”</p><p>But Johnny Oleksinski at<em> The New York Post </em>wasn’t having it. “It’s the kind of formulaic brand-extension tale a writer could pitch while in a coma,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-review-idiotic-video-game-film-stomps-on-your-brain/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-review-idiotic-video-game-film-stomps-on-your-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a></span>. It only gets more brutal from there, as he continues, “‘To hope, to dream, to create is to suffer,’ the baddie says. She left out ‘to watch.’” Ultimately, <em>A Minecraft Movie </em>doesn’t sound anywhere near as bad a video-game-turned-movie as last year’s <em>Borderlands</em>, but it also doesn’t seem set to have the same juice as <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>or the first few<em> Sonics</em>. Like most of the critics who reviewed it, however, I’ll ultimately be deferring to my kids’ takes when we see it this weekend. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/trumps-new-tariffs-on-exports-to-u-s-could-push-nintendo-switch-2-price-higher/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Potential Nintendo Switch 2 fans were surprised by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high price point revealed after today’s Direct</a>, but it may end up costing even more for American buyers. Thanks to a high tariff rate imposed on Vietnam and Cambodia by President Trump, the cost of a Switch 2 could get much higher.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-reason-to-get-your-nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-in-right-away">More Reason to Get Your Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Orders in Right Away</h2>



<p>On April 2nd, hours after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct showcase, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan to impose a minimum 10% tariff on effectively all goods coming into the country. However, Trump has imposed higher tariff rates on countries with higher trade deficits with the United States.</p>



<p>What does that mean for Americans trying to buy a Nintendo Switch 2? Well it means that those that wait too long may be hit with a higher cost. Nintendo shifted production and sourcing of parts away from China and towards Vietnam and Cambodia in order to avoid tariffs on China. However, the United States will now tariff products from Vietnam <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1907531727683334384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at a 46% rate</a> and from Cambodia at 49%, significantly higher than the 34% rate that’s being implemented onto Chinese goods.</p>



<p>Nintendo though has reportedly stockpiled “hundreds of thousands” of units in the United States over the past few months, in anticipation of these tariffs, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7edbe449-0c44-462e-8787-7347d7ac7a18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Financial Times</a>. It’s unclear though whether or not the $450 price of the Nintendo Switch 2 ($500 for the bundle including Mario Kart World) already takes into consideration the increased cost brought on by the tariffs. It’s possible that if the stockpile runs low and the tariffs don’t relent, the cost of a Nintendo Switch 2 could get even higher. Insider Gaming has already reached out to Nintendo for comment on how the tariffs will affect consumers, and is still awaiting a reply.</p>



<p>Trump’s tariffs are already affecting the PC gaming side of the market, thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/price-increases-for-game-consoles-and-pc-parts-likely-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 25% tariff on all computer imports</a> announced the same day. This includes desktops, laptops, and various parts, and likely will include video game consoles as well. In addition to the Switch 2’s price potentially getting higher, tariffs could also negatively affect consumer spending as a whole.</p>



<p>Do you think the Switch 2 price could get even higher in America because of tariffs? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1807/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

However, there appears to be a concerted effort from Nintendo to introduce specially enhanced versions of Switch 1 games to the Switch 2. And these seem to go beyond just a graphical boost and framerate bump.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What Games are Playable on Switch 2?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nintendo breaks down, there will be primarily three types of games playable on the Switch 2. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Switch_2_Games_List_-_Release_Date,_Price,_and_Exclusives">Native Switch 2 games</a> that are developed for the system and cannot be played on the original Switch. Compatible Switch 1 games whose cartridges can slot right into the Switch 2 and be played natively on the console. And Switch 2 Edition games which are Switch 1 games that will receive new features and performance enhancements when played on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This doesn’t include classic games that are available through Nintendo Switch Online which includes a library of games from the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and now GameCube.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>So What Comes in a Switch 2 Edition Game?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The main takeaway from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is that Nintendo appears to be trying to throw in a little extra for anyone playing a Switch 2 Edition of a Switch 1 game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Super Mario Party Jamboree was a Switch game and the Switch 2 Edition will come with a new suite of content called Jamboree TV that will take advantage of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Switch 2 microphone, and the Switch 2 USB-C camera that will be sold separately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with upgraded resolution up to 1440p in TV mode and better frame rate, there will be new minigames and online functions as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which will be a cross-gen game, will support mouse controls with Joy-Con 2, and multiple display modes like Quality Mode which runs at 60fps in 4K when docked, or 1080p at 60fps on handheld; or Performance Mode which runs a 120fps in 1080p when docked, or 120fps in 720p in handheld mode. All modes will support HDR.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Switch 2 Edition titles will get new story content like Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s Star-Crossed World add-on, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-72-new-game-details-mario-kart-9-the-duskbloods-and-more">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a> will gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that will give you guides and game help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some games, like Pokemon Legends: Z-A will only feature performance and resolution bumps as part of the Switch 2 Edition label.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>When are the Switch 2 Edition Games Coming?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 is set to be released on June 5, 2025 and that’s around when the first batch of Switch 2 Edition games will arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will get Switch 2 Editions on the day of the console’s launch on June 5, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 Editions for Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV will arrive a little later on July 24, 2025. Same for Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s update which will arrive on August 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither Metroid Prime 4: Beyond of Pokemon Legends: Z-A have release dates yet so both Switch 2 Editions are scheduled for sometime in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How Much Will Switch 2 Editions Cost?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That depends. If you don’t own the Switch 1 version of the game, then you can purchase the Switch 2 Edition at retail, which will be distinct thanks to the new red-colored physical game case. The digital versions will also feature a prominent Switch 2 logo so you know you’re buying the right edition for your Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you own the game on Switch 1 and want the upgrades that will be added in the Switch 2 Edition you will need to purchase an upgrade pack from Nintendo. The upgrade packs will be available at select retailers, the official My Nintendo Store, and Nintendo eShop. However, Nintendo has not revealed how much an upgrade pack will cost just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some upgrade packs, like the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom will be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is the same membership that gives Switch owners access to online features and the classic library.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda Nintendo Switch Editions</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So there you have it, that’s everything you need to know about the Switch 2 Editions of a game. We’ve detailed previously how Nintendo is making the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-making-the-jump-to-switch-2-as-easy-as-possible-for-everyone">jump to the Switch 2 fairly seamless</a> thanks to its backward compatibility stance, and it looks like Nintendo is looking to bolster its launch library with improved versions of Switch classics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Nintendo Switch 2 check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">all the news announced during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">how much it costs</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-start-time">when pre-orders go up.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo is revitalising one of their favourite multiplayer game concepts for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with GameShare, letting you share multiplayer games with other Switch owners, using just a single copy of a game.</p>
<p>This is different to PlayStation’s SharePlay, which streams a gameplay video to invited players, but is instead beaming game code to the other systems, letting them run the game on-device and with each player having a bespoke viewpoint, depending on the game.</p>


<p>GameShare will work both over local wireless and over the internet via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">GameChat</a>, but it will be more limited in that second scenario.</p>

<p>Locally, a Nintendo Switch 2 can share a multiplayer game with both Switch 2 and original Switch consoles (depending on the game), but GameChat is a Switch 2 exclusive feature, so online GameShare only works with Switch 2 consoles. Additionally, some games will only have local GameShare enabled and block online play.</p>


<p>Six Nintendo Switch games are getting upgrades to support GameShare on the Nintendo Switch 2, most of them free.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/11/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-switch-review/">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/big-brain-academy-brain-vs-brain-review/">Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> Switch 2 Edition – <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Paid upgrade</a>, and no GameChat sharing</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is a very different style of game. 51 Worldwide Games is packed full of boardgames, so each player can have different views of a chess board, for example. Treasure Tracker and 3D World are both isometric platformers from the Wii U with fully separate character control, while Super Mario Odyssey’s multiplayer is restricted to the second player being Cappy.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this concept many times in the past, whether it was the limited cable linked multiplayer of GBA games, giving small portions of games to those without a cartridge, or the same idea wirelessly with later handhelds like the 3DS – I think Tri-Force Heroes had this feature? – and it will be interesting to see just how extensively this is featured in Nintendo Switch 2 games.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's post-Direct <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> info-dump has been full of juicy little details, and the nuggets keep on coming. It now appears, for instance, that Nintendo's newest console will be making things a little easier for the avid screenshot sharers and gameplay clippers out there.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, just like the original Switch, features a dedicated button for capturing in-game screenshots and gameplay. It was a welcome addition on Switch 1, but a bit of a faff too; sharing captures either involved saving them to a memory card and plugging that into a secondary device for download, uploading them to a social media account (until the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-removing-x-support-from-switch">feature was removed</a>) then downloading them onto your device, or scanning in QR codes to get them onto your device. Hardly backbreaking stuff, admittedly, but not exactly seamless either.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2, however, looks to have streamlined the process if a little infographic tucked away on Nintendo's website is anything to go by. On a page introducing the revamped Nintendo Switch App (formerly known as the Nintendo Switch Online app) Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/mobile-apps/nintendo-switch-app/?srsltid=AfmBOopCv3siqbq6sJWgpzEYRt7_R9DcsjOjA3x59XIZYRwHsaN-nMG-">draws attention to the process of sharing screenshots and video using Switch 2</a>; by selecting the 'Upload to Smart Device' option from the console's album, it's possible to send captures from the console directly to the app - seemingly with no fiddly middle steps to slow things down.

<p>
Captures are stored in a new 'Uploaded Screenshots and Videos' gallery - accessible from the app's home screen - which can display 100 screenshots or videos from the last 30 days. From here, screenshots and videos can be saved to your smart device if you want to keep them indefinitely, or shared on social media. So if you're the kind of person to regularly go on a game-capturing frenzy, you could end up saving literal seconds - if not minutes - out of your day. Oh, and Nintendo notes the feature is available without a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.
</p>
<p>
Alongside streamlined capture sharing, the revamped Nintendo Switch App will continue to offer game-specific services - including SplatNet 3, NookLink, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">newly announced Zelda Notes</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Additionally, the app will still let users see which of their friends are online and register new friends using a QR code - although, notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-finally-explains-what-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-does">Switch 2's new GameChat system</a> means the app's voice chat functionality won't be supported for games exclusive to the new console.
</p>
<p>
So there you go - another bit of Switch 2 business to ponder. And there's plenty more information regarding Nintendo's new console over in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">round-up of everything announced during (and after) today's Switch 2 Direct</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fuck-this-anthropomorphic-diesel-engine-in-particular.1153395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was terrified of the scary movies my mom would rent from Blockbuster when I was little. The most menace I could handle was Brendan Fraser's <em>The Mummy</em>, though I'd get squeamish at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJP8XTzpOCw&amp;pp=ygUadGhlIGJlZXRsZSBzY2VuZSB0aGUgbXVtbXk%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the scarab scene</a>. One day, my mom rented the VHS of <em>Thomas and the Magic Railroad</em>, thinking it would give me a break from habitually re-renting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball:_Curse_of_the_Blood_Rubies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies</em></a> and serve as an appropriate flick for a kindergartener to watch without any scary violence. She was wrong. <em>Thomas and the Magic Railroad</em> was terrifying, and its villain, Diesel 10, gave me nightmares.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On paper, <em>Thomas and the Magic Railroad</em> had the set up of a lighthearted, amusing, and charming children's film. Its story sees the Island of Sodor suffering from a magic gold dust crisis—the resource Mr. Conductor (played by Alec Baldwin) uses to travel to and from the human and train worlds. Thomas discovers a portal to a magic railroad and a long-lost train named Lady that could help them procure the magic dust they need to keep their quaint little society going. The only being standing in their way is Diesel 10.</p><h2>Diesel 10 be demented</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Calling all Engines but only diesel 10 scenes and narrated by michael brandon" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20S6D0JpISk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Whenever an opportunity arose for Diesel 10 to be an asshole to Thomas and friends, he took it. He'd spook them by barrelling past them on the railway, kicking up dust in their eyes in his wake, and revel in it. Diesel 10 is sick in the head. Instead of clearing debris off train tracks using his crane claw attachment (which he'd nicknamed Pinchy), he used it to threaten the livelihood of Mr. Conductor, Thomas, and his friends. Whenever he wasn't lurking in the shadows, he used Pinchy to destroy their houses and scare them away from fixing their resource issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Diesel 10’s only weakness is sugar, which Baldwin threatens to pour into his fuel tank and kill him(?). That wasn't enough to stop the lunatic from spinning the block on Baldwin, abducting him in broad daylight, and threatening to drop him off the edge of a bridge if he didn't tell him where the magic railroad was. Thankfully, after cutting a cord on Pinchy, Baldwin avoids certain death and is <a href="https://youtu.be/D5nuckKBO_8?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safely flung miles away from the crazy train</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Thomas and the Magic Railroad but it's just Diesel 10" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGUWLou8CZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2>Diesel 10 is also a fascist</h2><p>On a good day, Diesel 10 deplorably refers to tank engines like Thomas as puff balls. On bad days, Diesel 10 calls them steamies. While the former doesn't hit the ear quite as harshly as the latter, Thomas and friends tolerate the louse's slurs on account of them needing him to do his fucking job. In 2005's <em>Calling All Engines!</em>, Thomas and crew butter Diesel 10 up, calling him "the most useful engine of all" to coax him into clearing the rubble from train tracks with Pinchy so they can fulfill their duties.&nbsp;</p><p>I only know the above after retroactively looking up more information about my sleep paralysis demon on rails a couple of days ago. My friends thought I was joking when I claimed Diesel 10 was terrifying because they only remember him being Thomas' grumpy, reluctant ally in <em>Calling All Engines</em>. Diesel 10's characterization in the film my mommy rented for me was far from <em>Calling All Engines</em>' chummier portrayal of him. Looking back on it, dude was kind of a Nazi.</p><p>Diesel 10's sole purpose in <em>Magic Railroad</em> was to cleanse the Island of Sodor of steam engines like Thomas. He plans to destroy Lady, whom he failed to kill in the past, and transform Sodor into a land dominated by engines like himself. I was used to villains thwarting heroes in some vain attempt to gain something in return in Disney films. But Diesel desiring to wipe out all of the tank engines to fulfill some warped ethnic purity was a lot for my child brain—which was still stuck on Pinchy being the vilest weapon known to man— to quantify.&nbsp;</p><p>Diesel's mania wasn't helped by Baldwin breaking the fourth wall to thank me, the viewer, for placing his safety cushion in place after getting yeeted by Diesel 10. Now Diesel 10 knows I'm involved, Baldwin! All that stress was enough material to shape nightmares. In my anxious dreams I was aboard Thomas, getting chased through the magic railroad tunnel by Diesel 10 for having the gall to thwart his genocidal plans by breaking Alec Baldwin's fall.</p><p>In the final moments of the film, Diesel 10 is abandoned by his lackeys, who decide he's too much of an unhinged asshole to be their friend. Diesel doesn’t give a shit because he'd set his warped, villainous mind on chasing down and destroying Thomas and Lady once and for all. In my earliest example of schadenfreude, I witnessed Diesel 10's heavy, wide-load ass fall through a gap in the same bridge he threatened to drop Mr. Conductor from. After desperately hanging off a broken rail with his stupid-ass claw, Diesel 10 plummeted off the bridge to his doom. Although director Britt Allcroft denied me the satisfaction of watching him plummet to his doom—which we all know is shorthand for him dying a miserable off-screen death—she did give me the satisfaction of watching him land in a sludge barge pulled by a tugboat. Fuck that guy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval"><h3>I Found A New Age Of Magic At A Dungeon Synth Show In Queens</h3></a><p>Dungeon synth isn't a return to an imagined past, but a vibrant vision of the future.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This sneak peek features the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army, the newest edition to the Soulblight Gravelords.</p>

<h2>The <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle Army Preview</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/jellrva2/deathrattle-army-set-this-skeleton-legion-has-a-bone-to-pick-with-the-mortal-realms/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop breaks down what the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army will bring to the gaming table.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-deathrattle-army-cursed-sepulchre-.jpg?itok=J9_k_dSR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-deathrattle-army-cursed-sepulchre-.jpg?itok=BDbTuoel 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Naturally, the army is undead-themed; a collection of skeletal soldiers. Given this army is home to vampires and liches, this tracks. This is important since it ties into a new feature: Cursed Sepulchres. These are fonts of necromantic power that you can set up on the battlefield as part of the Deploy Faction Terrain step of your Deployment Phase.</p>

<p>This terrain is crucial since they are conduits for Manifestations and rallying points for Rising Dead units. These are units that start in the grave but can be deployed within 6" of one of these Cursed Sepulchres. The upside of being undead is they don't stay dead for long.</p>

<p>One set of units in the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army is the Barrow Knights. Their passive, Knights of the King, give all nearby units Ward 5+. That is bad enough, but then there's the end of turn ability, Cursed to Rise Once More, which lets you bring back one slain model.</p>

<p>On the more offensive end is the Wight King unit. In addition to solid stats and a ferocious skeletal steed, the Wight King can inclict an Ancient Barrow Curse on a unit it crits. This curse will cause a -1 to all saves. A unit can only be cursed once, but multiple units can be affected.</p>

<p>Naturally, this <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army preview is just a glimpse at what these units will bring to the game. There is still plenty more to be seen with this faction of the undead. More that may be unearthed in its upcoming battletome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While sharing screenshots and videos from the original Nintendo Switch has always been an excessively complicated process, it’s going to be much easier for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2</a>.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">today’s Direct presentation</a>, Nintendo spent a lot of time talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the Switch 2’s new built-in GameChat functionality</a> that will give players a way to share their screens during group video calls. But the company also announced that it’s rolling out an update for the Switch family of systems’ companion smartphone app. </p><p>Now simply called the “Nintendo Switch app,” the application will continue to support Nintendo’s old voice chat feature for specific titles like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>on the original Switch. But for Switch 2 owners, the Nintendo Switch app will serve as the easiest way for you to move screenshots and videos from the console onto your phone, computer, or internet.</p><p>To move screenshots previously, you had to pop a Switch’s SD card out from behind its kickstand and slot it into another device. You could also share images and videos directly to Facebook and, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057/~/discontinuation-of-x-%28formerly-twitter%29-integration-and-social-media">until last year</a>, X / Twitter by linking your Switch to accounts on either of those platforms. It was also possible to move media straight from your Switch to your smartphone by going into the Switch’s Album section, hitting share, and then taking a picture of the QR code generated by the console. That last option was as clever as it was cumbersome, but it won’t be an issue for the Switch 2. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">According to Nintendo</a>, Switch 2 users will be able to access the console’s 100 most recent screenshots and videos directly from the smartphone app. Obviously, a Nintendo Account will be required to make this work, but the company noted that you will <em>not </em>need a Nintendo Switch Online membership to take advantage of the smartphone app’s media transfer feature.</p><p>The media transfer details alone are already a significant upgrade for the application, which never felt all that well-integrated into many of Nintendo’s games. But, as if to emphasize that it really does see the application as an important part of the Switch’s future, Nintendo also announced the forthcoming release of <em>Zelda Notes</em>, a special set of features designed specifically for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears for the Kingdom</em>. Located within the smartphone app, <em>Zelda Notes </em>is meant to serve as a useful tool to help guide you through the <em>Zelda </em>games with features like spoken directions to specific locations you’ve marked on a map. You can use <em>Zelda Notes </em>to hear Princess Zelda recall memories of places she’s been as you guide Link to them. The application will also give players a way to share blueprints for their unique Autobuild creations.</p><p><em>Zelda Notes </em>feels like a very smart way to get people excited about coming back to two older games many people have already spent quite a bit of time playing. It’s kind of wild to think of Nintendo’s smartphone app being one of its more promising Switch reveals, but these kinds of surprises are how you keep things interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-is-in-early-development-shows-powerful-new-creative-tools">when Project Rene was first announced</a>, everyone quite fairly assumed that it would go on to become <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 5, given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> was quite old by that point. Then, last year, EA actually said no, they're not making a Sims 5, they're just going to keep making things for The Sims 4, and Project Rene will be more of a multiplayer game. While bits and pieces of the game have been shared here and there, some gameplay of Project Rene now appears to have been shared online, which looks like it very much wasn't meant to be seen by many eyes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, to be clear, the game hasn't technically been labelled as a Sims game. On the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.lifegame&amp;gl=ph">Google Play Store</a> it's been listed as City Life Game with Friends. It is from EA's official account though, and your character both has one of those classic plumbobs, is referred to as a Sim, and speaks Simlish throughout the gameplay footage (which you can check out below).
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pMyt1ioAs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
It's absolutely worth noting that the leaked footage in question is obviously from quite an early build of the game. It certainly looks functional, but to be honest, it also looks a bit dull. You can see what appears to be other players walking around, and <a href="https://youtu.be/1S38bOIsuWo?si=Bfwrz0Je0QZm8Wks">other footage</a> appears to show that you have the ability to chat over text or voice, but from the various clips shared online, right now it doesn't appear like there's meaningful ways to interact with anyone else.
</p>
<p>
Another clip shows that you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE&amp;ab_channel=GamingMobile">create your own cafe</a>, but it looks like more of a challenge than the usual casual approach to building, with a timer counting you down. You also seem to be playing as one, specific Sim rather than acting as a benevolent/ unkind god over all Sims, which doesn't really feel like it taps into the appeal of a series.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's clearly early days for Project Rene, I mean, City Life Game with Friends, I just can't help but wonder if this is a future <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a> 2013 level disaster waiting to happen. Sims with multiplayer doesn't sound awful in concept, though the proof will be in the pudding.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/price-increases-for-game-consoles-and-pc-parts-likely-in-the-united-states/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you are a citizen of the United States, you may want to get ready see the the price increase on your game consoles, PC parts, and other electronic devices in the coming weeks and months. The United States <a href="https://x.com/spectatorindex/status/1907534017223864812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">government has announced</a> a 25% tariff on all computer imports as of April 2.</p>



<p>These imports include all laptops, desktop parts and components, and, likely, video game consoles.</p>



<p>As of publishing, it’s uncertain how and when prices could be impacted by the tariff announcement. Video game hardware sales in the United States <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-to-fall-in-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have regularly fallen</a> over the last year. With the likelihood of the increased cost being passed down to American consumer, it could be expected to see spending continue to fall.</p>



<p>Where many could see a higher cost is with the Nintendo Switch 2. The Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is slated to have a price</a> of $449.99 in the United States. However, the United States government enacted a 46% tariff on all products from Vietnam where Switch 2 production is taking place. Those tariffs, on top of the aforementioned 25% ones, could see the latest Nintendo console price increase at some point in the near future.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, and other major PC and video game hardware companies for comment on what these tariffs could mean for consumers. Should responses be received, they will be amended to this article.</p>



<p>How much impact do you think these tariffs will have on consumer video game spending and the price of game consoles and PC parts in the United States? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1806/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new email from Rockstar Games, it’s been revealed that GTA 5 will be coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass later this month.</p>



<p>The news comes from primarily Rockstar Games related X account <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1907516701123461261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@videotechuk_</a>, who says that Rockstar Games has sent an email to GTA-related community pages telling them of the news.</p>



<p>For those unaware, GTA 5 has been on Xbox Game Pass a couple of times, but this would be the first time that GTA 5 would be coming to PC Game Pass. Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-could-come-to-pc-game-pass-its-rumored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar insider Tez2 tweeted that Rockstar Games</a> was preparing to launch GTA 5 on PC Game Pass, so its something that the has been in the works for a while.</p>



<p>Ben also said that GTA 5 would be coming to xCloud, which would also be for the first time.</p>



<p>As for when GTA 5 coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass will be announced remains to be seen, but with Rockstar Games sending the announcements to creators today, an official announcement is likely to come soon.</p>



<p>In December 2024, Take-Two Interactive reported that GTA 5 had sold an eye watering 210 million copies worldwide across all of its platforms. </p>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games is working on GTA 6, which is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but Take-Two Interactive is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-about-not-announcing-gta-6-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to announce an official release date for PC</a> (which traditionally comes later than consoles).</p>



<p>Will you be playing GTA 5 on Game Pass? Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming community forum</a>.</p>

        <p>In this brand-new director’s cut, enjoy additional scenes starring major characters and the series’ first-ever online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode, Red Light Raid!</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The battle deciding the next ruler of Kamurocho begins.</p><p>It is December of 1988. Within the vibrant district of Kamurocho, Tokyo, numerous organizations are mobilizing to seize control of a large-scale redevelopment project. However, a tiny lot with an unidentified owner is all it takes to throw these plans into disarray.</p><p>The “Empty Lot.” The struggle over this meager plot of land soon escalates into a major conflict involving powerful yakuza organizations from both the east and west.</p><p>As one era draws to a close, the stage is set for two legends to carve out their legacies.</p><p><strong>Cast</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kazuma Kiryu</strong> (voiecd by Takaya Kuroda) – A member of the Dojima Family, a direct subsidiary of the Tojo Clan—the largest yakuza organization in Eastern Japan. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised in the Sunflower Orphanage established by Shintaro Kazama, a captain of the Dojima Family. Following in Kazama’s footsteps, he plunges into the depths of the yakuza underworld—but finds himself in a bind after a murder puts him at odds with the Tojo Clan. When the pressure shifts to Kazama, Kiryu steels himself to depart the Dojima Family in order to protect his father figure—though the three Dojima Family lieutenants have no intention of letting him leave quietly.</li><li><strong>Goro Majima</strong> (voied by Hidenari Ugaki) – The manager of the thriving Cabaret Grand in Sotenbori, Osaka. Many know him as the “Lord of the Night” for having skyrocketed the club to popularity. However, this is all a facade to mask his true identity as a former yakuza turned expendable “pet.” Once a member of the Tojo Clan, he was punished for defying a direct order from his superior. For his disobedience, he is condemned with eternal servitude, now no more than a dog under the watchful eye of his master. Majima is finally given an opportunity to rejoin the Tojo Clan under one condition: to murder someone with his own two hands.</li><li><strong>Daisaku Kuze</strong> (voiced by Hitoshi Ozawa) – A former professional boxer, and a true yakuza to the core. His propensity for violence sets him apart from even the rest of the notoriously brutal Dojima Family. As the eldest of the three lieutenants, he leads the Dojima Family in Kazama’s absence—and is currently one step away from becoming the next captain.</li><li><strong>Hiroki Awano</strong> (voiced by Riki Takeuchi) – A hedonist who goes with the flow. However, beneath his laid-back exterior lies a cunning man skilled at intel gathering, often tasked with following through on the Dojima Family’s threats. While Awano outwardly obeys his sworn brother Kuze, he harbors a hidden desire to become the next Dojima Family captain, patiently awaiting his chance to strike.</li><li><strong>Keiji Shibusawa</strong> (voiced by Hideo Nakano) – A shrewd yakuza lieutenant who boasts a reliable skill set and an impressive list of accomplishments. Well-versed in finances, Shibusawa handles the clerical work of the Dojima Family. While he falls behind Kuze and Awano in the pecking order for the next captain, he has yet to reveal his true capabilities.</li><li><strong>Tetsu Tachibana</strong> (voiced by Arata Iura) – A real estate mogul who operates in the shadows of Kamurocho. In a city overflowing with restaurants and pleasure houses, Tetsu Tachibana is notorious for buying up land the moment it hits the market—not hesitating to adopt even the most underhanded tactics. Despite his soft-spoken and sophisticated demeanor, Tachibana holds great ambitions to usurp the Tojo Clan and take control of Kamurocho.</li><li><strong>Jun Oda</strong> (voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi) – A Tachibana Real Estate employee who specializes in on-site land acquisition. Despite his seemingly flippant attitude, Oda is a man with no fear, even in the face of the yakuza. As Tachibana’s right-hand man, he leverages his ample funds and information network to coerce property owners into selling with frightening efficiency.</li><li><strong>Sohei Dojima</strong> (voiced by Hisao Egawa) – A man whose ambitions are matched only by the cruel and ruthless violence he uses to achieve them, laws be damned. Though he reigns as the most powerful patriarch in the Tojo Clan, he owes much of his success to his right-hand Kazama. He is currently attempting to secure the land necessary for the full rights to the entirety of the Kamurocho <a title="Games > Revita [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/revita">Revita</a>lization Project, which will allow him to usurp the title of chairman from the Tojo Clan’s acting second chairman. His three lieutenants hang on his every word, maneuvering to seize control of the Empty Lot—the lynchpin to his ambitions.</li><li><strong>Akira Nishikiyama</strong> (voiced by Kazuhiro Nakaya) – Raised in the Sunflower Orphanage alongside Kiryu, Nishikiyama also followed in the footsteps of Kazama and swore an oath to the Dojima Family. Having been best friends since childhood, Kiryu considers him a brother. While Kiryu has no interest in climbing up the ranks of the yakuza, Nishikiyama has the wits and drive to soar through the ranks.</li><li><strong>Osamu Kashiawgi</strong> (void by Shunsuke Sakuya) – Kazama’s right-hand man and a skilled yakuza whose name is infamous throughout Kamurocho. Sakuya earned the trust of his peers and has been entrusted with running the family. He holds the ideals of duty, empathy, and respect dear, and he will not tolerate anyone who dares stray from their code of honor. As a member of the Kazama Family, a lower-ranking Tojo Clan subsidiary, he technically ranks lower than Kiryu in the Dojima Family. Despite this, Kiryu and Nishikiyama regard him as an older brother figure they fear more than anything.</li><li><strong>Shintaro Kazama</strong> (voiced by Tetsuya Watari) – A key figure in bringing the Dojima Family to power, many regard Kazama as one of the most exceptional men in the Tojo Clan, both in physical strength and character. He personally established the Sunflower Orphanage to support children without families, becoming the father figure and role model to Kiryu and Nishikiyama, who were both raised there. Police took him into custody after one of the Kazama Family’s gambling sites was raided six months ago, and he is currently locked away in prison. The Dojima Family’s three lieutenants have been gunning for his position as captain.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>aru Sera</strong> (voiced by Toru Okawa) – Despite his gentlemanly demeanor, Sera leads an organization that handles the Tojo Clan’s dirtiest work behind the scenes. He eventually joins the dispute over the Empty Lot, but his true motives remain unknown.</li><li><strong>Takashi Nihara</strong> (voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata) – The man at the helm of Eastern Japan’s most powerful underground <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal group in 1988. As such, Nihara stands as a god among men, especially to the rank-and-file members of the clan’s great families. The conflict over the Empty Lot leads him to an unlikely encounter with Kiryu that gives way to a challenging dilemma.</li><li><strong>Tsukasa Sagawa</strong> (voiced by Shingo Tsurumi) – Owner of the Cabaret Grand who keeps Majima on a tight leash in Sotenbori, wielding the power to kill him at a moment’s notice. Majima winds up in his care after Futoshi Shimano, Majima’s former boss and Sagawa’s sworn brother, hands him the reins. Despite his low-key profile amid Sotenbori’s nightlife, he is a dangerous man who is not above violence when things don’t go the way he planned.</li><li><strong>The Blind Woman</strong> (voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro) – An employee of the massage parlor, Hogushi Kaikan. Although her vision is impaired, she uses her skills as a massage therapist to overcome her handicap and make a living. She lives quietly on the edge of Sotenbori, unaffected by the city’s hustle and bustle. However, she soon finds herself caught in the crosshairs of a bloody yakuza conflict after a certain incident.</li><li><strong>The God Hand</strong> (voiced by Kazunari Tanaka) – The owner of a massage parlor on the outskirts of Sotenbori. Despite his terrifying appearance, he is a very friendly and caring man. His skills as an acupuncturist have earned him his distinct nickname. However, the keenness of his eyes suggests he’s more than your average everyday civilian.</li><li><strong>Homare Nishitani</strong> (voiced by Keiji Fujiwara) – An unpredictable man whose three tenets of life are money, sex, and violence. He is loyal only to his desires and acts upon them without fear of consequence. Not even an organization as large as the Omi Alliance can entirely control him. Majima may find that his fate is more tied to this man than he ever hoped.</li><li><strong>Futoshi Shimano</strong> (voiced by Naomi Kusumi) – Audacious and brutal, he has a hulking figure and an intimidating presence that demands respect. As the head of Majima’s former family, he is responsible for Majima’s expulsion from the yakuza and exile to Sotenbori.

However, he said he always wished to make the attachment and detachment process for the Joy-Cons easier.</p><p dir="ltr">Tetsuya Sasaki, a general manager at Nintendo's technology development division, said in the interview that research on how magnets could be used continued even after scrapping the prototype, as the team wasn't "ready to give up" on the idea.</p><p dir="ltr">That led to the idea returning for the Switch 2.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At least two of Nintendo’s Switch 2 games are going to be more expensive than most games on the first Switch. Many Switch games cost $59.99, but Nintendo revealed today the Switch 2’s <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a June 5th launch title, will cost $79.99, while <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, releasing a little over a month later, will cost $69.99.</p><p>These aren’t Nintendo’s first titles to exceed a $59.99 price. That honor goes to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591275/nintendo-70-dollar-game-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">launched at $69.99</a>. When that price was announced, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2023/02/08/update-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-costs-70">told <em>Game Informer</em></a> that “we determine the suggested retail price for any Nintendo product on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p>Nintendo is taking some of the sting off <em>Mario Kart World’s</em> higher price if you get it as part of a special $499.99 Switch 2 bundle. (On its own, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2 costs $449.99</a>.) But it appears that Nintendo’s next-generation console could have games that are generally more expensive than before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
