			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion from Bungie for Destiny 2 and the first major expansion to kick off a new era of Destiny, the Fate Saga, is out now on all platforms. </p>



<p>The Edge of Fate sees the Guardians getting some help from a new ally, Lodi, as the story centers once again on the Nine, and sees the Guardians dealing with a threat to the universe that goes back even before the Traveler came into the picture. Set in a new location, Kepler, there's plenty of mystery and changes to Destiny 2 coming in this update.</p>



<p>Edge of Fate introduces an overhaul to the armor system with Armor 3.0, a new UI system that's supposed to streamline the experience for players. It also marks the removal of the paywall for seasonal content, and the addition of a new permanent shooting range. </p>



<p>While the expansion is out today for players to check out, the new raid, The Desert Perpetual, will launch this weekend on July 19, 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's been no secret that Bungie has been struggling recently. While this new expansion offers a chance for the studio to experience a bright spot in their calendar this year, the delay for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">massive plagiarism scandal around it</a>, and reports of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">studio's internal troubles all pointing to leadership;</a> it's clear that the studio desperately needs a win. If only for those developers who have been working overtime to fix the mistakes of their bosses. </p>



<p>Hopefully, Edge of Fate is the beginning of Bungie taking a turn for the better. It's the sign of a healthy industry when a storied studio like Bungie can grow in strength over its many years, instead of dwindling into what many long-time fans fear to be the inevitable, that the studio shuts its doors for good within a few years time.</p>

            <p>
Santa Ragione - the acclaimed indie studio and publisher behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-review-a-horrible-nightmare-in-all-the-right-ways">Saturnalia</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mirrormoon-ep-review">Mirror Moon EP</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mediterranea-inferno-review-a-bruising-intensely-stylish-post-covid-nightmare">Mediterranea Inferno</a> - has accused Apple of yanking one of its titles from the App Store without "clear justification".
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Eurogamer, Santa Ragione co-founder and director Pietro Righi Riva revealed the studio's 2016 visual novel Wheels of Aurelia will be delisted from the App Store on 25th July following a number of unsuccessful appeals to Apple.
</p>
<p>
According to Riva, Apple's reasoning for Wheels of Aurelia's removal has remained vague, with the company only citing its "policy to remove apps deemed 'obsolete' or 'outdated'" during correspondence. Riva insists the game remains "fully functional and compliant with current technical standards" and that no "clear justification" for the removal has been provided "despite multiple appeals and sincere efforts to seek clarification." We've contacted Apple for comment.
</p>
<p>
Riva added that "enforced and unnecessary" updates "represent a substantial financial burden" for developers, and "negatively [impacts] their ability to sustain existent projects and to pursue new creative endeavours."
</p>
<p>
"We firmly believe that removing fully functional artistic works simply due to infrequent updates undermines the value and sustainability of games as cultural and artistic products," he continued. "Like books, films, and music albums, video games represent complete creative works that do not inherently require continual updates beyond maintaining basic functionality."

<p>
Riva called Apple's practices "especially troubling" given the tech company's "dominant position in digital distribution", adding they reinforce the "importance of diversified ecosystems". He also applauded the European Union's recent efforts at "fostering more fairness and plurality in the digital marketplace." Apple, of course, has repeatedly expressed its discontent over EU decisions stemming from the Digital Markets Act legislation Riva appears to be referencing, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-appeals-eus-500m-fine-for-app-store-anti-steering-practices-says-its-far-beyond-what-the-law-requires">currently appealing a €500m fine</a> it received in April over the restrictions it places on app developers wishing to use alternative purchase methods.
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione is far from the only developer to take issue with Apple's approach. Studios described creating games for the company's platforms as being "like an abusive relationship" in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-games-for-apple-platforms-like-an-abusive-relationship-say-developers">report last year</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developer Epic Games has been heavily involved in legal efforts to curtail Apple's much-criticised practices following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">significant falling out</a> in 2020.
</p>
<p>
As for Wheels of Aurelia, Santa Ragione is making the game - a "narrative road trip... set in the roaring Italian 70s" - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wheels-of-aurelia/id1198170026">free on the App Store</a> until its delisting on 25th July, to ensure "as many people as possible can experience this work before its removal".

The studio described the expansion as a non-canonical side story to ARK in “an ambitious underwater setting featuring 95% of gameplay taking place beneath the surface."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ark-survival-evolved-fans-lash-expansion-trailer-filled-with-ai-generated-slop"><u>ARK: Survival Evolved expansion trailer released alongside the announcement was resoundingly condemned</u></a> after fans discovered evidence of generative AI imagery, and the follow-up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWTdUtQHRSg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>11-second trailer released last week</u></a> really didn't show us very much at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, however, a brand-new launch trailer is available to tempt you into picking up the expansion today.

The underwater biome adds 21 new tameable creatures, 74 new Engrams — including seven tek Engrams — and underwater survival thanks to features like air pockets and propulsion vehicles. Expect new characters and a "narrative connecting multiple ARKs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARK: Aquatica is available exclusively on PC via Steam.

                <p>Players anticipating the co-op horror shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killing-floor-3/" data-ref-id="5000-599968">Killing Floor 3</a> are a little concerned about the state of the game ahead of its launch on July 24, as a recent play test a little over a week before launch required players sign a five-year non-disclosure agreement in order to participate.</p><p dir="ltr">The stress test occurred on Sunday during two, two-hour sessions, during which players could request access through Steam. However, the fine-print of an NDA required in order to play raised some eyebrows. As revealed in a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/killingfloor/comments/1lyxr4w/a_5_year_nda_for_2_hours/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, in addition to agreeing to not take screenshots or record gameplay of developer Tripwire Interactive's upcoming shooter, players had to agree to not discuss the test for five years.</p><p dir="ltr">While NDAs are not unusual when playing early builds of games, the fact that the test required one when the full game is slated to launch close to a week later caught many players by surprise. It's possible the five years-distinction was legal verbiage copied and pasted from previous, older playtests, but it still doesn't inspire confidence.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-delayed-post-launch-update-to-undo-a-controversial-change/1100-6529977/" data-ref-id="1100-6529977">Killing Floor 3 was originally supposed to arrive earlier this year</a> on March 25, but was delayed just a few weeks before release. The requiring of a lengthy NDA for a playtest so close to launch has fans worried another delay could be on the way, but in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190?emclan=103582791474057313&amp;emgid=496075125142061061" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about the stress test, Tripwire said it has been focused on optimizations and enacting player feedback so it can "ship a great game to fans on July 24."</p><p dir="ltr">"This test is designed to help our team and partners ensure that the multiplayer environment stays as stable as possible at launch," Tripwire states.</p><p dir="ltr">Tripwire has already laid out some of its post-launch plans for Killing Floor 3, which include improved animations, the ability for playable characters to be able to pick any perk, and the implementation of text chat.</p><p dir="ltr">Killing Floor 3 supports six-player co-op and features cross-play across platforms. In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-looks-like-2025s-killer-co-op-game/1100-6529407/" data-ref-id="1100-6529407">hands-on preview, we said Killing Floor 3</a> "paints a terrific first impression" and "looks like a killer co-op package," though only "time will tell if it can sustain itself in the long-term."</p>

Toward the very end of the film, Lois Lane and Superman embrace and kiss passionately as he slowly lifts them into the air. It’s a wonderful moment and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Ox8ZLF6cGM0?t=156&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Ox8ZLF6cGM0?t=156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one that was featured heavily in trailers</a></span> for the superhero film. But India’s Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) reportedly removed that 33-second mid-air smooch from <em>Superman</em>. </p><p>Why was this scene removed? According to India’s CBFC, the kiss was “overly sensual” for <em>Superman’s </em>UA (13+) rating, which is similar to the MPAA’s PG-13 rating in the United States. Reportedly, another kiss between the two lovebirds was also removed for similar reasons. This is likely the lengthy kissing scene that happens in Lois Lane’s kitchen earlier in the movie. </p><p>The news that kissing scenes were removed from <em>Superman</em> led to reported backlash online from members of India’s movie industry.</p><p><em>Variety</em> spotted Actor Shreya Dhanwanthary <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shreyadhan13/status/1943602667890078128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shreyadhan13/status/1943602667890078128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacting negatively to the reports of Superman’s censorshi</a></span>p: “If this is true, this is RIDICULOUS!!!

Now, studios’ only option to dispute such rulings is through India’s courts, which is expensive and takes forever, and doesn’t work for most movie release schedules.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-big-kiss-cut-india-censored-dc-lois-lane-cbfc-1851786333]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> next major update is coming August 5, and now Blizzard has revealed two surprise quality-of-life changes that will arrive alongside the new content and season--a bank overhaul and a major update to Valorstones.</p><p dir="ltr">As announced in a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/player-character-bank-updates/2132208" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>, in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a>, banks are getting a significant facelift. For as long as Blizzard's MMORPG has existed (that is, over 20 years), players have had to purchase additional bag bank slots and then place bags within them to get more storage. That will no longer be the case come update 11.2, which will replace bag slots with purchasable storage tabs more similar to stash tabs from Blizzard's Diablo series.</p><p dir="ltr">The update will additionally remove the reagent bank and Void Storage, two bank-adjacent storage options that were more restrictive. While some players were initially concerned they might be losing storage space when hearing that news, as broken down in a post by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1m06ypv/read_this_if_youre_concernedconfused_about_the/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/is-the-11-2-bank-rework-good-the-numbers-and-player-concerns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user SpartanG01</a> (and highlighted by <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/is-the-11-2-bank-rework-good-the-numbers-and-player-concerns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Icy Veins</a>), the new bank system seems to be a straight upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">Purchasing bank tabs is cheaper than buying bag slots and users are overall gaining an additional 50 slots without any of the restrictions previously associated with Void Storage or the reagent bank. Any bank tab can now be a reagent tab if one chooses, but with the added benefit of not having to use it exclusively for reagents. It's also less confusing, as all banking can now be done with one system as opposed to also using void storage, which was accessed via a completely different NPC and only for certain items. Funnily enough, this new bank overhaul that removes Void Storage is the first major change to item banking since the addition of Void Storage back in 2011 as part of WoW's Cataclysm expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">That, however, isn't the only surprise Blizzard had in store. Blizzard also unceremoniously announced in the game's <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/ghosts-of-k%E2%80%99aresh-development-notes/2119874/10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">11.2 public-test-realm patch notes</a> that WoW's main gear upgrade currencies, Valorstones, will no longer reset between seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard didn't elaborate on the change in philosophy, but it's a huge change, as previously at the start of each new season players would need to grind Valorstones in order to start upgrading their gear. With this change, players can now stock up on Valorstones ahead of time without having to worry about them being erased in a few months, allowing players to more easily prepare for future updates.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's a great change that will allow players to get a headstart on gear upgrades, it appears Valorstones are still capped at 2,000, meaning players can only stockpile so much. Maybe that will change in the future, but for now, Blizzard is at least making Valorstones a non-seasonal currency.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's Ghosts of K'aresh update will take players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals to stop the Void Lord Dimensius. In addition to new content and the quality-of-life features outlined above, the update will also finally add a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-getting-a-new-highly-requested-emote-for-the-first-time-in-17-years/1100-6532592/" data-ref-id="1100-6532592">highly-requested emote</a>. Meanwhile, Blizzard continues to share more information about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">WoW's upcoming housing system</a> and is gearing up to fully reveal the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">next expansion, Midnight, at Gamescom</a> in August.</p>

            <p>Free-to-play MOBA Predecessor is doing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> as it returns to its original map, in tribute to its Epic Games-developed predecessor (pun intended).</p>
<p>Epic Games previously released a MOBA called Paragon, but in 2018 it shut down the servers. However, content creator Robbie Singh refused to let it die and so, using public assets from Paragon, formed Omeda Studios to develop spiritual successor Predecessor.</p>
<p>A year after its launch in August 2024, Predecessor will now return to Paragon's map, called Agora, following demand from its community. It's a move similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite's OG map</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-original-verdansk-map-return-dated">Call of Duty Warzone's return to Verdansk</a>.</p>

<p>"The Agora map holds a special place in the hearts of OG Paragon players because it was their first introduction to that world, a world that felt vast, immersive, and alive in a way other MOBAs, constrained by isometric perspectives, simply couldn't replicate," Singh told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"The sense of verticality, scale, and atmosphere gave players an unprecedented level of immersion, making them feel not like detached commanders but as true heroes fighting for control of a living, breathing world."</p>
<p>Predecessor plays similarly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> as a lane-based strategic MOBA with over 40 heroes to play as, but with a third-person perspective and map verticality.</p>
<p>The Agora map will be playable for a limited time in Predecessor's new Legacy Mode, which arrives in the game's patch 1.7. This will also include a new hero, Renna (pictured above) - a powerful dark magic wielder.</p>
<p>Patch 1.7 will be available from 22nd July, and will also include new skins and gameplay fixes.</p>
<p>"There has never been a better time to play Predecessor," said Singh. "The game has evolved thanks to our incredible community, who constantly engage and share their feedback. We believe we've found a great blend of fast-paced action and deep strategy, doubling down on the things players care about most, like increased verticality and fluid combat, while introducing an augment system that gives players unprecedented freedom to shape their playstyle."</p>
<p>Singh also pointed to the regular addition of new heroes and the thriving competitive scene as key reasons for players to stick with the game.</p>
<p>Predecessor launched in August 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic). It's hoped the game will not only outlast Paragon, but will continue to compete against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-continue-to-dominate-accounting-for-40-of-time-spent-on-ps5-and-xbox-in-us-last-month">other popular live-service games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-moba-predecessor-follows-fortnite-with-return-to-original-map]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the project that CD Projekt RED just can't put down, as the studio has <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1945136315705467297">announced</a> that it is releasing yet another significant update for the game, with Patch 2.3, that'll be revealed in full tomorrow, Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in one of the studio's RED Streams livestream presentations. </p>



<p>It'll premiere at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST / 5pm CEST, and you'll be able to tune in either on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cdprojektred">Twitch</a> or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/aFLKoZaHak8">YouTube</a>. The stream will feature Paweł Sasko, the associate game director on the upcoming sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and Adrien Jouannet, the lead designer at Virtuos. </p>



<p>While we don't know exactly what this new update will include, the announcement post on the game's official X account includes a few hints that point to the update specifically dealing with cars in Cyberpunk 2077. "<em>We're driving into Patch 2.3 of Cyberpunk 2077 to check what's under the hood of the newest update</em>," the post reads. It then calls Sasko and Jouannet <em>"passengers," </em>and adds an emoji of a tire to cap everything off. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Beyond this new update, it's already a big week for Cyberpunk 2077, since the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-arriving-for-macs-this-week/">officially coming to Apple Silicon Mac users this week, on July 17, 2025</a>. Which is the second new platform for Cyberpunk 2077 this year, after it also arrived on <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> at launch.</p>



<p>The last time CD Projekt RED reported sales numbers for Cyberpunk, it had sold more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/">30 million copies</a>. It'll be interesting to see how many more copies it adds to that milestone, with two new platforms in the mix.</p>

It's being published by HypeTrain Digital, and it's due out on PC in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bizarre occult city is ruled by the Traum Family, whom you'll need to go undercover with and infiltrate after these overconfident aristocrats were foolish enough to open the Forbidden Red Door, after which they weren't the same when they returned.

                <p>A collection of Mario games received a surprise patch, but it mostly serves as a rude reminder that Nintendo stopped selling it over four years ago. The version 1.1.3 software update for Super Mario 3D All-Stars is specifically for its performance on Nintendo Switch 2, with the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/50552/kw/super%20mario%203d%20all%20stars" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo support website</a> saying that the update addresses "several issues" to "improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>The update notes do not detail what these issues were or how gameplay is improved when playing on Switch 2. 3D All-Stars also received an update on June 3, shortly before the Switch 2's launch, but Nintendo's website used identical language then, offering no specifics. 3D All-Stars is not on Nintendo's list of Switch 1 games that received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-switch-1-games-will-get-free-updates-on-switch-2/1100-6530570/" data-ref-id="1100-6530570">Switch 2 enhancements via free updates</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Super Mario 3D All-Stars Review</p>
      </div>
<p>An observer on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1m04l1y/super_mario_3d_all_stars_version_113_is_now/n36qdon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> who booted up 3D All-Stars after the Switch 2 update claims that it still runs at 1080p in docked mode, adding that the UI may have received a resolution upscale. Other users note that Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine still run at 30fps post-update.</p><p>Originally released in September 2020 for Nintendo Switch to celebrate Mario's 35th anniversary, Super Mario 3D All-Stars includes Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy. Infamously, the game was only<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-limited-time-availability-for-super-mario-3d-all-stars-other-games/1100-6485623/" data-ref-id="1100-6485623"> available for purchase for about six months</a> before being pulled from stores and delisted on the Nintendo eShop. Nintendo also gave the same treatment to a battle royale title called Super Mario Bros. 35, ending access to it after the company's 35th anniversary celebrations for Mario concluded at the end of March 2021.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-shoot-for-the-stars/1900-6417564/" data-ref-id="1900-6417564">8/10 review</a> of Super Mario 3D All-Stars called the compilation "a worthwhile collection" while admitting that it had "presentational shortcomings."</p><p>With the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. approaching in September of this year, fans are crossing their fingers that Super Mario 3D All-Stars will get a re-release, preferably with Switch 2 enhancements and the inclusion of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-2-is-mia-so-everybodys-sad/1100-6481777/" data-ref-id="1100-6481777">Super Mario Galaxy 2, which was oddly snubbed</a>.</p><p>But Nintendo is a strange and unpredictable company that could go in any direction without warning. Maybe Nintendo has something bigger planned for the 40th--or maybe it has nothing planned at all. If <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-next-nintendo-direct-it-could-be-coming-in-july/1100-6533149/" data-ref-id="1100-6533149">rumors about a Nintendo Direct this month</a> are true, that would be the next place to look out for any Mario news on that front.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="savage raven neogrip review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4aeadfc5a44a8/savage-raven-neogrip-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Skull &amp; Co. released a very nice NeoGrip for the OLED Switch back in 2021, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-skull-and-co-neogrip-for-switch-oled-review">we reviewed at the time</a>, coming away with the impression that, beyond a fiddly holding tab that could potentially get lost, the grips helped make long portable sessions much more comfortable.</p>
<p>With this Switch 2 update, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/Savage%20Raven%20by%20Skull%20&amp;%20Co.%20NeoGrip%20for%20Nintendo%20Switch%202">Savage Raven by Skull &amp; Co. NeoGrip for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which falls under the same 'Savage Raven' banner as the company's excellent Switch 2 carry case (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/savage-raven-edc-switch-2-carry-case-a-sleek-alternative-to-nintendos-official-offering">which we've also reviewed!</a>), not much has really changed.</p>
<p>Once again, you're treated to a well-made, high-quality plastic sheath which the console slides securely into, before being fixed in place with a little tab. Your choice from three sets of grip styles are then clicked into place to complete the deal.</p>
<p>The design here, whilst almost entirely the same as the OLED accessory, has seen a little bit of clever revision with how its fixing tab now clicks into place using a switch that should see it stay secure at all times. You could still lose the little tab, mind, if you take it off then misplace it, however the older design also had the potential to clip off when it hit against things, so at least that issue has been solved this time out.</p>

<p>There are also no separate screws or screw holes for the OG Switch across the back of the plastic brace for this revision either, so it's a cleaner overall product design - albeit one that'll only fit your Switch 2. You can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>As mentioned, this NeoGrip pack comes with the console brace/sheath itself and three different types of grip. The middle-ground grip, which is fitted as default on the accessory, has ended up being the one that I am now using most of the time, as its angular top gives me somewhere to rest my fingers comfortably.</p>
<p>However, both the larger grips and the smallest flat ones are absolutely improvements on the default Joy Con's little grip bumps. I always end up either slipping off those or getting cramp, so I'm happy with the upgrade, thanks.</p>
<p>Indeed, I'm currently mid-review of a game, and for reviews I naturally tend to try to play as much on TV as possible, because I have stupid adult hands that get cramped up and sore in portable mode on Switch, Switch OLED, Switch 2...and a bunch of other handheld consoles. The mid-grips here have my hands feeling fine, with zero pins and needles or cramps detected, and that's after a full-on morning of playing without stops. Result!</p>

<p>As you can see from the pics, the colour used for the grips and brace is also a very, very close match for the console's stylish finish, so you aren't ruining your new tech's vibe at all, and even the bigger grip, with its bulbously rounded tops, looks fairly slim and slick from a side profile. One of my pet hates, no matter how nice an accessory feels, is when it cheapens the look of the console overall by being an off-colour that doesn't quite match, and that's not an issue here. I'd leave it on permanently if it weren't for the fact the Joy Con need to come off so often.</p>
<p>Luckily, it's so easy to take on and off — yes, even for a genuinely ancient moron such as myself — that I can see myself sliding this on every time I'm relaxing on the sofa for some Nintendo time. Which happens about 17 times a day, you understand.</p>

<p>And with regards to the console's dock, with the grips and brace attached, there's no issue for the Switch 2 sliding smoothly in and out, so you can leave it on when playing on the TV.</p>
<p>Overall, then, this one's an easy recommendation if you are looking for a little more purchase on your Switch 2 Joy Con in handheld mode, and an upgrade that's genuinely got my console feeling more like a nice fancy controller when I'm playing on the go.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-tone-deaf-hiring-call-ai-slop-microsoft-layoffs/">Xbox</a> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/15/xbox-game-pass-july-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the next batch of games being added to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-spends-50k-50m-to-get-games-onto-xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscription service, with nine titles entering the service for subscribers for the month of July 2025, including Grounded 2, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Wheel World, RoboCop: Rogue City, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the games added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-factor-first-party/">Xbox Game Pass</a> this month aren't available today, as there are a few games launching directly into the service. The only 'new' game of sorts that players can jump into today with Game Pass, is High on Life, which is returning to the service after it was previously available and removed from the service. </p>



<p>Beginning on July 17, RoboCop: Rogue City and My Friendly Neighborhood are added to the service. For RoboCop, its arrival in Game Pass also lines up with the release of its brand new DLC, Unfinished Business, though the DLC is not available in the Game Pass version that subscribers will have access to. You'll still need to grab the DLC separately if you devour the base game before the month is up.</p>

<p>On July 18, RPG Back to the Dawn enters the service, followed by Abiotic Factor launching into Game Pass on July 22. Then on July 23, Wheel World, a new open-world bicycle game is also launching into the service, followed by yet another day-one launch into Game Pass with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on July 24.</p>



<p>Grounded 2 then launches into early access on Steam and Game Preview on Xbox consoles on July 29, and July's additions are capped off by Farming Simulator 25 joining the service on August 1. Here's the full list of games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the month of July 2025: </p>



<ul>
<li>High on Life - July 15 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>



<li>RoboCop: Rogue City - July 17 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>My Friendly Neighborhood - July 17 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>



<li>Back to the Dawn - July 18 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>

<li>Wheel World - July 23 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - July 24 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>Grounded 2 - July 29 (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S)</li>



<li>Farming Simulator 25 - August 1 (Cloud, Console, PC)</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with this new batch of games entering the service, there are a few games leaving Game Pass as of July 31. It's just three games this time, with Gigantic, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and Turnip Boy Robs a Bank, all leaving the service at the end of the month.</p>
