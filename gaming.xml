            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/go-media-kotaku-twitter-x-hack-memecoin-crypto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This afternoon, the Twitter account for the hollowed-out remains of a once-popular video game website began counting down to an announcement. "The best gaming token is coming... stay tuned for updates!" read a post from Kotaku’s Twitter. Some presumed that the site’s owner, G/O Media, had launched a new misbegotten scheme to staunch bleeding from the publisher’s countless self-inflicted wounds. But no, turns out the account had been&nbsp;hacked – as a result of one of the many aforementioned self-inflicted wounds.</p><p>G/O Media revoked writers’ access to sites' social media accounts years ago, following then-Kotaku sister site Gizmodo’s promotion of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/everyone-should-be-able-to-use-the-public-restroom-whe-1845504927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article</a> that happened to criticize G/O's handling of a situation involving a disabled employee (Disclosure: Everybody at Aftermath has worked for Kotaku in the past, and Luke, Riley, and I were still at the site when this occurred).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Kotaku / Twitter</figcaption></figure><p>Despite this apparent desire to preserve the sanctity of sites’ accounts, G/O was careless enough for Kotaku's to get hacked in service of the most embarrassing promotion possible: <a href="https://x.com/CabalTrackerBot/status/1886533482026783025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a memecoin</a> with the name $KOTA, which is either short for Kotaku or an acronym meaning “King Of The America,” depending on who you ask. The tweets remained up for over two hours before they were finally deleted. Admittedly, Twitter is a shitshow these days – a lawless land except when it comes to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/molly.wiki/post/3lhbropf4g22t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things that are actually legal</a> – but this situation was nonetheless largely if not entirely avoidable.</p><p>If you need a refresher, this is the same G/O Media that in early 2024 saddled Kotaku, a news site, with <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a guides-focused editorial edict</a> that caused its then-EIC to resign in protest. A pivot to guides has evidently done little to improve Kotaku’s flagging fortunes, with G/O <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing one writer and laying off two more</a> in November, leaving what used to be one of the most influential video game websites in existence with just six full-time staff.&nbsp;</p><p>We must conclude that there is simply no rake too obvious for these clumsy buffoons to avoid stepping on. It is inevitable that these pioneers of the ancient art of the self-own will find new ways to innovate in the coming months, and that is one of the only truly exciting prospects that remains in this dreary, imploding world of ours – or at least it would be, if it didn’t splash back on writers who actually know what they’re doing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tell-me-about-your-favorite-niche-simulator"><h3>Tell Me About Your Favorite Niche Simulator</h3></a><p>There is still some joy in this world, probably</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the recent LA wildfires.
</p>
<p>
Akemann's drone crashed into the Super Scooper firefighting plane - capable of carrying over 1000 gallons of water to dump on fires - on 9th January (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/local-news/ex-skydance-exec-piloted-drone-crashed-plane-palisades-fire-1236123911/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>). The impact resulted in damage to the aircraft's left wing, grounded it for several days and preventing it from participating in the LA firefighting operation.
</p>
<p>
At the time of the crash, the US Federal Aviation Administration had implemented temporary flight restrictions barring drones from flying near the Southern California wildfires. Despite this, Akemann is said to have launched a drone from the top floor of a Santa Monica parking garage in an attempt to survey the Palisades Fire, but eventually lost track of it a mile and a half from its starting point - at which point it collided with the firefighting plane.
</p>
<p>
Authorities eventually traced the drone back to Akemann, and he's now <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf">agreed to plead guilty</a> to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft - a misdemeanor offence that carries a prison sentence of up to one year. However, Akemann is hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane.
</p><p>
"This defendant recklessly flew an aircraft into airspace where first responders were risking their lives in an attempt to protect lives and property," acting US attorney Joseph T. McNally <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/culver-city-man-agrees-plead-guilty-recklessly-crashing-drone-super-scooper">said in a statement</a>. "This damage caused to the Super Scooper is a stark reminder that flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations. As this case demonstrates, we will track down drone operators who violate the law and interfere with the critical work of our first responders."
</p>
<p>
In a seperate statement, Akemann's defense attorneys said he is "deeply sorry" for the incident, adding he "accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment, and is cooperating with the government in effort to make amends." However, they also pointed to a "number of mitigating factors that will come to light during the court proceedings", including the supposed failure of a geo fencing safeguard feature on Akemann’s DJI Drone.
</p>
<p>
Akemann co-founded Treyach - the studio best known for its work on the Call of Duty series - in 1996, and more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive, which he joined in 2016. The Hollywood Reporter says Akemann "recently left his role" at Skydance, however.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mika-witchs-mountain-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was idly thumbing through my Bluesky feed last week when I saw someone mention a game they described as "<em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> meets <em>Wind Waker</em>". I don't know if I've ever rushed to install a game faster.</p><p>Turns out the game, <em>Mika And The Witch's Mountain</em>, is <em>fantastic</em>. You play as a young witch seemingly going to a school situated at the top of a mountain, but nope, about two minutes into proceedings you're cast down to the town below, broom snapped in two. You're stuck there working as a courier until you're able to afford a fancy enough broom to get you back to the top.</p><p>The whole game is built around being a courier, flying your magic broom around delivering stuff for people, and so for the whole game you're doing little else but running errands. </p><p>Imagine some of the worst parts of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>--take this thing here, only do it carefully, but also do it <em>quickly</em>--and that's <em>Mika</em>. But it's OK! Because here those delivery-based challenges are neither tedious nor stressful; the timers are generous, the damage limits manageable, and the packages are just an excuse to get you flying around a beautiful tropical island meeting everyone who lives there and learning all about their stories.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mika and the Witch's Mountain - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYeMFMlwLJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It's the meeting that's ultimately what's important. Everyone here has a story to tell, and they're all lovely little stories: some about spoiled kids with a struggling dad, others about the perils of licking the boots of a shit-heeled capitalist. What's more, helping everyone out all the time gives <em>Mika </em>such a wonderful <em>energy </em>to it; all you're ever doing is helping people, and that just makes you feel better every time you play it.</p><p>I've said it before but I'll say it again:<a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I love a small sandbox more than almost anything else in video games</a>. The island in <em>Mika </em>isn't very big, so it won't be long before you meet everyone and visit every location at least once. But that's great; it really helps the communal feel of the game that you grow to know every square inch of the place and everyone living on it.</p><p>Finally, I want to point out how charming the whole thing is. It has some wonderful animated cutscenes (including a lengthy, must-see outro), some crisp, airy visuals that are, yes, very <em>Wind Waker</em>, and a soundtrack that's the perfect accompaniment to an afternoon spent catching some sea breeze on a witch's broom.</p><p><em>Mika And The Witch's Mountain</em> is out now on PC, Switch, PlayStation and Xbox.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tell-me-about-your-favorite-niche-simulator"><h3>Tell Me About Your Favorite Niche Simulator</h3></a><p>There is still some joy in this world, probably</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last month, Microsoft held its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct</a> of 2025 and announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-from-team-ninja-and-platinum-games-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-drops-today-included-in-xbox-game-pass/1100-6528989/" data-ref-id="1100-6528989">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> among other titles. But fans won't have to wait very long to learn what else Microsoft's gaming division has planned for the future, as the next Xbox Showcase is scheduled to take place in February.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/idxbox-showcase-to-kick-off-ign-fan-fest-2025?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, this year's IGN Fan Fest will begin with an Xbox Showcase on February 24. Aside from the reveal of "the next big collaboration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/balatro-review-one-more-blind/1900-6418192/" data-ref-id="1900-6418192">Balatro</a>," details are scarce about what to specifically expect beyond trailers and gameplay footage. However, the announcement of the showcase does note that there will be several reveals from indie studios including Raw Fury, Team 17, Akapura, 11 Bit, and more.</p><p>During one of last year's Xbox Showcases, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">World Of Warcraft: The War Within</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-according-to-report/1100-6523727/" data-ref-id="1100-6523727">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, as well as 2025 titles including South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Fragpunk, and Fable. We can only speculate which titles will be showcased in February, but we'd certainly like to see more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, the upcoming prequel to the long-running shooter franchise.</p><p>With Microsoft's push to release more games on PlayStation 5, it's possible that some cross-platform announcements will also be a part of this Xbox Direct. Microsoft recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/" data-ref-id="1100-6529156">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PS5, and there have been rumors for months that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> may be going to Sony's console as well. Doom: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> are also headed to PS5 later this year.</p>

The SD cards the games were installed on were tiny while the plastic surrounding them was exponentially bigger. Most cases didn’t even come with anything else inside. I’ve enjoyed collecting them but they were a huge waste. According to a new leak, the Switch 2 cases might be even worse.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196181,196230" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The biggest takeaway <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">from the Switch 2 reveal last month</a></span> was that everything about the new console is bigger. Bigger Joy-Con controllers, bigger screen, bigger <em>Mario Kart</em> races. And it sounds like the game cases might be bigger too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.co/9p2UZtCGQI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.co/9p2UZtCGQI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Universo Nintendo</em></a></span> editor Felipe Lima <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1877464328762269832&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1877464328762269832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported in January</a></span> that French retailer FNAC had accidentally leaked the dimensions for a Take-Two Switch 2 game at 5.12 inches wide and 7.7 inches tall. </p><p>Then last week, Switch 2 subreddit user HertzBurst <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1icr469/switch_2_boxart_size_comparison_via_leaked/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1icr469/switch_2_boxart_size_comparison_via_leaked/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made an artistic rendering</a></span> to show just how much bigger this roughly 43-percent increase in case size would look. If these new dimensions are accurate, and not just an error or placeholder, they would make Switch 2 game cases even taller than PS5 cases, which are only 6.7 inches tall. Those cases hold Blu-ray discs, though. While they’re often similarly devoid of game manuals and other inserts, at least in that case the box is barely much bigger than the thing it’s holding.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, will presumably feature SD cartridges similar in size, if not identical to, the existing ones. What could Nintendo possibly need all of this extra space for? Is it really that afraid of people walking into GameStop or Walmart and accidentally buying a Switch 2 game for a Switch 1 or vice-versa? Or will the new console usher in a new golden age of game cases bursting with maps, posters, and other cool stuff?</p><p>I still remember buying games for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566">my original Switch on launch day</a></span>. I opened up <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and it was empty except for a small rectangular nugget of plastic. <em>The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+</em>, on the other hand, came with stickers and a beautiful little gold booklet directly inspired by the manual for the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em> on NES. It felt complete. My obsession with buying games physically was rewarded. </p><p>Somehow I don’t think the Switch 2 games will, on average at least, do the same. But if these really are the specs, then surely Nintendo has to shove something else in there, doesn’t it? The company wouldn’t just ship millions of bigger plastic shells all over the world with nothing but tiny cartridges inside? Right? Right??</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft's indie-focused ID@Xbox digital showcase returns on 24th February, promising "trailers, gameplay, and reveals" from the likes of Raw Fury, Don't Nod, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/11-bit-studios">11 Bit Studios</a>.
</p>
<p>
If that's piqued your interest, ID@Xbox more specifically airs from 6pm BST/10am PT/1pm ET on Monday, 24th February. It'll be viewable on unspecified "IGN platforms" (it's officially part of this year's IGN Fan Fest), but expect that to include the usual places such as YouTube.
</p>
<p>
As to what it'll feature, all that's been confirmed so far is a reveal of Balatro's next collaboration. But we do know at least 15 companies intend to show their games over the course of the stream, with the following studios and publishers set to appear:

<li>Curve</li>
<li>Akapura</li>
<li>Don't Nod</li>
</ul>
<p>
ID@Xbox has traditionally been a fairly long, meandering showcase so if history's anything to go by, expect it to last a few hours at least. There's usually some goodies in there, though, and this year's participant list suggests we might be seeing - among other things - more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-delays-second-half-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-for-optimisation-and-refinement">Don't Nod's imminent Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spiritfarer">Spiritfarer</a> developer Thunder Lotus' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spiritfarer-studios-33-player-co-op-roguelike-33-immortals-has-been-delayed-into-next-year">co-op action roguelike 33 Immortals</a>, and (hopefully) Panic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-day-of-the-devs-2024-indie-games-showcase">intriguingly bizarre Blippo+</a>.
</p><p>
ID@Xbox will, of course, be Microsoft's second showcase in as many months, with January having brought us the Xbox Direct - complete with some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> surprises, release dates for the likes of Doom: The Dark Ages, and more. And if you missed the big announcements, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-the-xbox-developer-direct-2025">convenient Xbox Direct round-up waiting for you over here</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98battlefield-portal%E2%80%99-is-returning-to-the-next-battlefield-with-classic-maps.1099155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlefield Portal, which was first introduced into Battlefield 2042 will be returning to the next title, DICE has confirmed.</p>



<p>The news came via the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOih6h3VeTE&amp;ab_channel=Flakfire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Flakfire</a>, who had an early online presentation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> reveal last week. In Flakfire’s latest video, he said that the developers confirmed the return of Portal, a gamemode which introduces classic maps, weapons, and more into the latest game.</p>



<p>“We had surprising confirming in the briefing that Portal will be making a return with the next Battlefield title,” he said. </p>



<p>“Portal could be one of those slices tested under the Battlefield Labs program,” he theorised. </p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is essentially a Community Test Environment, where players can give feedback of specific features in the next Battlefield game and presumably, future DLC, too.</p>



<p>Flakfire pointed out earlier in the video that those who sign up to the Battlefield Labs program will be under an NDA, whcih presumably will still not stop people from sharing footage and information.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While we currently don’t have the name for the next Battlefield title (unless it’s just Battlefield), it has been confirmed that the game will be for current-generation consoles only, meaning it will release on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. According to EA, the game will release later this year.</p>



<p>What remains to be seen is the announcement of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Battle Royale</a>, which has been in development at Ripple Effect for the past couple of years and was exclusively reported on by Insider Gaming in early 2024.</p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield Portal making its return in the next Battlefield game? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a> </p>

Hey, I might still look like an awkward teenager, but somehow I have been waltzing my way through this planet across four decades. It's truly hard to fathom that I've been writing about video games in some form since I was...14? That's 26 years, man. My career in video games can drink and is starting to worry about turning 30!

Well, lucky for Austin, he's headed back to the Super Bowl. Must be nice to root for a good team!</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>HauntedPS1 Demo-Disc: Flipside Frights</em><strong> – </strong>This stream fell through<strong> </strong>the cracks last month, but Cado and I are going to dive back into it.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Steam Vent </em>– We're headed back into the Steam mines again, scrolling through the "new releases" category to see what is often ignored on Steam.

Patch notes reveal everything players can look forward to when they log in, including a selection of units inspired by characters from the One Punch Man anime, such as Tatsumaki, Sonic, Metal Bat, Boros, and, of course, Saitama himself. It breaks down to two Secret units, seven Mythical units, two Legendary units, and one Epic unit, but <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16347800591/OPM-Anime-Royale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anime Royale update 5</a>’s changes don’t stop there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/31/anime-royale-one-punch-1738343679735.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">One Punch Man has come to Anime Royale players on Roblox.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Raid, Story, and Raid Shop, as well as new cosmetics, are also accessible to those who hop into the Roblox experience. The quality-of-life changes mostly focus on tweaking Meruem but also saved some room to deliver balance adjustments to Muzan and Aizen. Additionally, players will notice that the Killua blessing bug has been fixed, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Royale update 5 follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-royale-channels-hunter-x-hunter-with-update-45"><u>the release of update 4.5 last week</u></a>. That patch introduced Hunter x Hunter content for tower defense fans, including even more Mythical, Legendary, and Secret units. There is currently no release date for the next update, but at this rate, Roblox players likely won’t need to wait too long to learn more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can check out IGN’s full list of all active Anime Royale codes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-royale-codes"><u>here</u></a>.

                <p>In 2014, Sony showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/" data-ref-id="1100-6421676">the first look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-canceled/" data-ref-id="5000-306239">Wild</a>, an ambitious open-world PlayStation-exclusive game from the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel. Wild remained in development until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/" data-ref-id="1100-6495395">it was canceled in 2021</a>, almost a year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-retires-but-beyond-good-evil-2-will-go-on/1100-6482347/" data-ref-id="1100-6482347">Ancel retired from the video game industry</a>. Now, former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts about why Wild was canceled.</p><p>"There [were] lots of great ideas [that] didn't really materialize into the actual game structure," explained Yoshida during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax</a>. "It was very open kind of thinking... one of the earliest [pitches] was the map size of the game was the size of Europe."</p><p>As envisioned by Ancel, Wild would have taken place during prehistoric times as players stepped into a the role of a human whose shaman-like powers gave them the ability to influence or control animals. Smaller animals could be used to spy on other tribes, while larger animals could actually be possessed by the player to guide them to accomplish a specific goal or objective. Animals could also support the player in battles against rival tribes.</p><p>Following Ancel's retirement, Ubisoft opened an investigation into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-investigating-retired-rayman-creator-for-alleged-hostile-work-environment/1100-6482636/" data-ref-id="1100-6482636">whether he created a hostile work environment</a> for his employees at the company. Ancel denied the allegations and it doesn't appear that any action was taken against him. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rayman-is-in-development-with-creator-michel-ancel-consulting/1100-6527358/" data-ref-id="1100-6527358">a new Rayman game in development</a>, and Ubisoft rehired Ancel to serve as a consultant on the project. The next Rayman title was announced late in 2024, and it doesn't currently have a release date from Ubisoft.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> upcoming Spring Update will add its first new power weapon since launch, and it's one that will be familiar, yet different, to longtime Halo fans--the Fuel Rod SPNKr.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly the Fuel Rod Cannon first introduced as a usable weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2</a>, but rather a UNSC SPNKr rocket launcher that has been heavily modified by Halo Infinite's enemy faction, the Banished, to fire fuel rods.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZNxv526xa4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YZNxv526xa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the weapon shares many similarities with the franchise's classic Fuel Rod Cannon--like a large magazine and massive green bolts of exploding plasma--it does behave a little differently. Most notably, the Fuel Rod SPNKr's plasma bolts don't bounce off targets, acting more like Halo's traditional rocket launcher.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) is currently on a roll when it comes to adding new weapons to Halo Infinite. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-halo-infinites-dmr-style-m392-bandit-rifle-has-been-leaked/1100-6506883/" data-ref-id="1100-6506883">first new weapon, the Bandit DMR</a>, came three years after launch. However, Halo Studios added a new SMG, the MA5K Avenger, late last year and is now adding the Fuel Rod SPNKr just a few months later. In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/spring-update-2025-halo-infinite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> outlining all the other new additions coming as part of Halo Infinite's 2025 Spring Update on February 4, the developer confirmed it's working on another new weapon in the form of a Banished-themed shotgun. That weapon is slated to arrive as part of Halo Infinite's Summer Update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fuel Rod SPNKr may be the star attraction of the Spring Update, but Halo Studios is also bringing back a classic Halo 2 game mode in the form of the bomb-planting Assault. Other additions coming with the update include a remake of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-5-guardians/" data-ref-id="5000-182008">Halo 5</a> map Coliseum alongside weapon balance changes. The update will additionally overhaul the game's premium Operations Pass, adding more armor set to earn for those who decide to purchase it while making it so armor sets from old passes will be obtainable on The Exchange (Halo Infinite's in-game currency cosmetic shop) the season after they debut.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">multiple new Halo projects</a>, though the developer has not revealed what those projects are. The studio recently shifted to using Unreal Engine 5 to build future games in the series, in the process revealing Project Foundry, a prototype using Unreal Engine meant as a training tool that also shows what the future of Halo may look like. In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the shift (and the studio's new name), it was said the studio rebrand and move to Unreal was the start of a new chapter for the franchise. Given the move to Unreal is still early, a new game in the series was said to not be "imminent."</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors continue to circulate that older Halo games once exclusive to Xbox, as well as a rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-combat-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-2728">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">may release on PlayStation 5</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-is-optimistic-about-xbox-multiplatform-strategy/1100-6529186/" data-ref-id="1100-6529186">Microsoft's new multi-platform game release strategy</a>.

                <p>A co-founder of the Call of Duty studio Treyarch recently pleaded guilty to striking a firefighting plane with a drone during the recent LA fires. Under the plea deal, Peter T. Akemann will avoid the potential penalty of a year in prison and will instead perform 150 hours of community service, particularly in the area of Southern California's wildfire relief efforts. The deal also includes a $65,000 fine, the cost of repairing the firefighting plane in question.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plea agreement</a>, Akemann flew a drone over the area of the Palisades Fire while a "Super Scooper" water-dumping plane was conducting operations in the area. His drone struck the plane's wing, causing enough damage that it had to be grounded for a period of time.</p><p dir="ltr">US attorney Joseph McNally, one of the prosecutors on the case, released a statement noting that "flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations." He reiterated that those who do fly drones in those conditions will be arrested and prosecuted just like Akemann.</p><p dir="ltr">Akemann's camp released a statement stating that the co-founder is "deeply sorry" and "accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment." After co-founding Treyarch, Akemann parted way with the company more than 20 years ago. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604527/drone-crashed-into-la-wildfire-plane-plea-deal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge reports</a> that he recently departed his role as the president of Skydance Interactive and that his social media accounts have been scrubbed, including X and LinkedIn.  </p><p dir="ltr">Several major video game publishers have marshaled resources to help fight the LA fires, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-games-starts-in-game-event-to-raise-funds-for-la-fire-victims/1100-6528884/" data-ref-id="1100-6528884">Riot Games</a>, which implemented in-game fundraisers in League of Legends and Valorant.

This game will be available during February's Steam Next Fest, where players will get to take part in a multiplayer demo. The demo is expansive, offering players the opportunity to play five to six hours of the game. Lost Skies is home to ancient ruins that can be explored, a fully customizable skyship, and intricate puzzles that need to be solved. If this sounds like something you're interested in, you can choose to play the game on your own and go solo, or you can team up with up to six friends. Check out the gameplay trailer below to see what you can expect from Lost Skies.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Skies: Cinematic Trailer | Bossa Studios ☁️" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVgbYFWSOZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of building a base on a planet or island, you have your very own Skyship that you can customize and evolve over time. You get to take your base around the world with you as you explore, helping you explore safely and gather any resources you may need. It will also help keep you safe against the elements and threats in the skies.</p>
<p>Compared to other survival games, Lost Skies is considered a "Survival Lite," allowing you to get to grips with the survival elements of the game without feeling like you're punished for not doing things in a certain order or grinding materials off the bat.</p>
<p>There will be tons to explore, from ruins, ancient civilizations, and colossal creatures that you will have to take down. There will be plenty of variety across the many floating islands in the sky, where you can use a grappling hook to interact with the world around you, also providing you with a way to traverse and soar through the sky.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're interested in, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist the title on Steam now</a> or try out the free-to-play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Island Creator</a>, where you can design your very own floating island that can be played. You can create your own island full of puzzles, traps, and stories. It's entirely up to you how you decorate and create your island, and it can then be released to other players via the Steam Workshop.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking his mind and sharing his opinions lately following his exit from Sony, and now he's discussed his thoughts on the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> reveal.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=ZW7DhH1Gh0st-zxp&amp;v=HtiJlzs0xRE&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax podcast</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-on-switch-2-reveal-i-was-surprised-there-werent-many-surprises/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Yoshida said the Switch 2 reveal event was underwhelming and that the only major surprise was the event's lack of surprises.</p><p>"I was surprised there were not many surprises," Yoshida said. "The only surprise to me was the mice thing that they showed."</p><p>Yoshida is referring to the sequence in the Switch 2 announcement trailer that showed the Switch 2's new Joy-Cons sliding across a surface like a computer mouse would. Yoshida said he hopes Nintendo uses the mouse controls for "some more weird, amazing way" that people won't see coming, as opposed to the control setup being used to play a game like Call of Duty on Switch 2.</p><p>Yoshida said he hopes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo's big Nintendo Direct in April</a> will "reveal something that's still hidden to us about Switch 2." He also addressed the string of leaks that preceded Nintendo's official Switch 2 announcement, saying he felt "very sorry" for Nintendo for the "disappointing" situation. A leak can ruin a good surprise, and Yoshida said he hopes for no further Switch 2 leaks.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that Yoshida said he was a "huge Nintendo fan," but ultimately wished the Switch 2 announcement "could have been a larger reveal."</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a> Yoshida left Sony on January 15, 2025 after more than 30 years with the company.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-set-to-air-later-this-month-report/1100-6529189/" data-ref-id="1100-6529189">next State of Play event could happen very soon.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-acquires-tracabs-advanced-tracking-technology-for-ea-sports-titles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>it's been announced today that Electronic Arts has acquired TRACAB's Advanced Tracking Technology to help provide a more accurate and precise experience in its EA SPORTS titles. The company has reached an agreement to acquire TRACAB Technologies, a leader in advanced sports optical tracking and analysis solutions. This will prove to be highly beneficial for the future EA SPORTS titles, where it plans to leverage the power of TRACAB's technology, where it will be able to utilize advanced AI, machine learning, and real-time sports data to create realistic animation and provide an experience that is lifelike and similar to the real-world action of sports.</p>
<p>"Our EA SPORTS games are becoming living, breathing simulations of sport, and TRACAB's cutting-edge technology and expertise in real-time data capture and analysis will enable us to enhance realism, immersion, and engagement in all our experiences," says Cam Weber, President of EA SPORTS.</p>
<p>While the company has acquired the technologies, EA SPORTS is looking ahead at how it will be able to utilize TRACAB beyond games, looking into the company's vision for the EA SPORTS app to be the leading interactive sports platform in the world. It's been said by Electronic Arts that the acquisition is expected to close in EA's first fiscal quarter of FY26. The company's sports titles have been incredibly popular, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> being an instant hit.</p>
<p>"Joining EA SPORTS marks an exciting new chapter for TRACAB Technologies. Our mission has always been to push the boundaries of sports data and analysis, and with EA SPORTS' vast resources and vision for innovation, we're confident that we can create even more immersive and dynamic experiences for sports fans around the world," says Martin Brogren, GM of TRACAB Technologies.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with TRACAB Technologies, the technology utilized by the company tracks almost everything that is happening on the field or pitch at 60Hz per second. That means it's generating 600 million data points per game, as well as 65 unique data points per player and referee. It does this by capturing live skeleton data from 21 joints on each body on the pitch.</p>
<p>Doing this provides a new sense of realism for the player and can allow for more dynamic animation and real-time simulation, and it will prove to be incredibly beneficial for Electronic Arts when developing its new sports games.</p>
<p>Aside from the games being made by the company, combining the game engine with the work of TRACAB's Technologies aims to provide fans with new opportunities to create highlights and predictive simulations that they can upload on the EA SPORTS App.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-the-ea-sports-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA SPORTS App</a> is only available in Spain, but there are plans to expand it and make it available in other regions across the globe.</p>

Fighting huge mobs of enemies and grinding out rare loot is perfect for pick-up-and-play gaming, especially while you lay in bed listening to all those podcasts your friends keep bugging you to check out.

The good news is that it’s playable without any extra setup (assuming you own it on Steam, other clients may require some Desktop-mode finagling). In fact, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> directly supports the device and displays the Steam Deck’s buttons on your hotbar. The bad news is that, even after fiddling with the settings, <em>Path of Exile 2</em>’s performance wildly varies. Sure, when only a few monsters are on screen, you <em>can </em>achieve up to 60 FPS. However, when fighting swarms of enemies,<strong> the frame rate can dip as low as 20 FPS</strong>. All told, <strong>expect an average of around 40 FPS on the Steam Deck, with social hubs like towns typically running at around 25 FPS</strong>.</p><p>To be fair, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is an early access game. The fact that it’s already playable <em>at all </em>on the Steam Deck is kind of a treat, and it has plenty of room for optimization before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its anticipated full release in 2025</a></span>. For reference, <em>Diablo IV</em> was finicky on the Steam Deck during its pre-release betas too, but is now really smooth on the device. This isn’t to say <em>Path of Exile 2</em> will definitely run better in the future, but its shortcomings here should be put in context.</p><h2 id="h114264"><a id=""></a>The best settings for Path of Exile 2 on Steam Deck</h2><figure id="" data-id="222c1b7a90b9040dbbd687bf59ae8c53" data-recommend-id="image://222c1b7a90b9040dbbd687bf59ae8c53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Path of Exile 2 running on the Steam Deck.

Because the frame rate can dip harshly when the screen gets chaotic. You’ll want to pick up frames almost anywhere you can to compensate. <strong>Here are all the settings I changed to get the game to run smoother on my device</strong>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mode: Fullscreen</li><li>Upscale Mode: FSR</li><li>Max Image Quality: Ultra Performance</li><li>Lighting: Shadows</li><li>Sun Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Number of Lights: Low</li><li>Water Detail Level: Low</li><li>Dynamic Culling: On</li><li>Target Framerate: 38</li></ul><p>Because of the Steam Deck’s screen resolution of 1280 X 800, these low settings don’t actually impact the visuals <em>that </em>much. FSR upscaling will make everything look a bit blurry, but it’s still an upgrade from how the game looks without it. I’ve seen some recommendations that changing the Renderer from Vulkan to DirectX12 can improve performance, but I didn’t experience any noticeable change for the better during my testing.</p><figure id="" data-id="e2688f75433781e842ac900977144daf" data-recommend-id="image://e2688f75433781e842ac900977144daf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Path of Exile 2 running on the Steam Deck.

However, since this squishes text size down a lot, I’d only recommend this in emergencies. As it is, map text is practically unreadable at the Steam Deck’s resolution, and several windows in the menu already get cut off (such as the menu that pops up when using Skill Gems).</p><p>Also, since <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is an always online game, <strong>make sure your Steam Deck isn’t downloading anything in the background</strong>. You can toggle whether or not your Deck downloads games in the background by going to Settings &gt; Downloads and ticking the appropriate setting. An unstable connection will cause your game to lag, which is especially untenable in moments when the frame rate drops. You don’t need a wired connection for smooth performance, but you also can’t download every episode of <em>The Simpsons </em>or some massive RPG while you play, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="d9302c940fea186d457af546780403f4" data-recommend-id="image://d9302c940fea186d457af546780403f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Path of Exile 2 running on the Steam Deck.

Would I recommend endgame grinding on the Steam Deck? <strong>Hell no</strong>. But does it work well enough to casually progress the campaign? Sure, especially since throwing your character headfirst into packed crowds of enemies isn’t a good idea when you <em>aren’t</em> worried about performance issues. However, <strong>if the Steam Deck is your primary platform for PC gaming, I’d sooner recommend </strong><em><strong>Diablo IV</strong></em><strong> if you want a modern ARPG on the go</strong>. Blizzard’s game just runs a lot better on the Steam Deck as of writing, whether you own it via Steam or Battlenet. Even if you prefer the gameplay of <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, it just doesn’t hold a candle to <em>Diablo</em>’s performance right now.</p><p>Still, you’ll want to keep an eye on <em>Path of Exile 2</em> in the future. When asked about the game’s Steam Deck performance <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theouterhaven.net/2024/11/interview-path-of-exile-2-director-talks-development-gameplay-and-steam-deck/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theouterhaven.net/2024/11/interview-path-of-exile-2-director-talks-development-gameplay-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with The Outerhaven</a></span>, Grinding Gear Games’ Johnathan Rogers noted the team is “focused on ensuring that fans across all platforms get a great experience.” Additionally, the PC Handheld market is really taking off, with devices like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S</a></span> officially using SteamOS right out of the box. So whether the game gets optimized down the line or you wind up with better hardware in your hands, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> could become the premium portable experience it deserves to be. Just don’t buy into it on the promise that it’ll maybe run better for you in the future.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
