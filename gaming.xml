		<p>There was a pleasant surprise for fans of Nintendo’s biggest hit of 2020, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> update 3.0.0 went live a day early!</p>
<p>Update 3.0.0 for Animal Crossing: New Horizons brings a bunch of new features to the five year old game, alongside today’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> release and paid upgrade to bring more support for the new generation of Nintendo’s console. This update is all about the universal new features, with the paid DLC giving 4K support, Joy-Con 2 mouse mode and larger multiplayer lobbies to the game for Switch 2 players.</p>


<p>The free update has a major addition with a new resort hotel run by Kappn’s family, and your role is to help decorate the rooms to draw visitors to the island. Once a room is decorated you will get hotel tickets that can be used to exchanged for items in the hotel shop – it’s basically Happy Home Paradise DLC, but a free Hotel-based version.</p>
<p>Some amiibos will also be compatible and those characters can be invited as guests to the hotel, but there’s also a big old list of quality of life improvements that includes an increased storage capacity from 5000 items to 9000 items, and the ability to store flowers. Resetti will be available to clear up items that you do not want on display, and they can be put in storage to reuse at a later date. The action does not stop when your character goes to sleep. When they hit the hay they can be transported to Luna’s dream world which takes players to Slumber Island. Slumber Island can be decorated in whatever you want, terraform the environment, add bridges, change the time and weather, and add residents. Players can have up to three islands and choose from small, medium, and large sized islands. Players can be invited to each other’s islands and work together on making changes. There will be additional crossover items including consoles, and those who have a Switch Online membership will be able to play games on those consoles. There is also a collaboration with LEGO which will bring LEGO items into the game.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s now more! Nintendo hand-wave all of that previously announced stuff away and then include things like letting you craft using your home storage materials, purchasing up to 50 customization kits at once, additional Nook Miles tasks and more.</p>

<figure data-uuid="e88eb0d8b197c"><a title="Super Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e88eb0d8b197c/super-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've not seen a great deal of Kevin Afghani since the voice actor took over the envious role of Mario from veteran Charles Martinet. But this coming weekend, Afghani will meet his fans for the very first time when he attends <a href="https://www.charliescomiccon.com/">Charlie's ComicCon in Estero, Florida</a>.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Afghani recently caught up with <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/">USA Today</a> to chat about all things Mario, including his prior experience with Nintendo games, how he feels to voice the world's most famous plumber, and what it's like to follow up on the work done by Charles Martinet.</p>
<p>When asked whether he was nervous about stepping into the shoes that Martinet had filled for so long, Afghani confirmed this vehemently, heaping praise upon his predecessor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Look, Charles, as far as I'm concerned, IS Mario. He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn't nervous, then I'm the wrong guy.</p>
<p>"I'm the second guy who's doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We expected nothing less, but it's lovely to see Afghani paying his respects to Martinet. The latter is now acting as the official brand ambassador for the Mario series, and frequently attends events himself to meet fans and regale audiences with stories of his career.</p>
<p>Afghani also took the time to debunk an unsubstantiated rumour speculating that he previously took part in Nintendo Direct presentations as a narrator, confirming "I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario".</p>

            <p>We'll heave him up an away we'll go. 'Way, me Assassin's Creeda! We'll heave him up an away we'll go. We're all bound over to Ubisoft's official music YouTube channel! We'll heave him up from down below. 'Way, me Assassin's Creeda! Oh, this is where a bunch of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Black Flag</a>'s sea shanties have just been reuploaded, potentially providing yet another hint that we're all soon bound to be playing that long-rumoured remake of the pirassassin adventure!</p>
<p>This sudden influx of classic ditties might not have meant much in a vacuum, but it follows many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports about the badly kept secret that is the remake</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">PEGI rating</a> that's about as close as you can get to a seal of approval short of Ubisoft finally giving up the ghost anmd revealing the thing themselves.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you fancy filling your brain with these pervasive earworms from the Age of Exploration once again, the fact 18 of them have been reuploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbisoftMusic">Ubisoft's music channel</a> within the past 24 hours makes doing so easy. These cuts of tunes ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vkoDWgLAQ">Way Me Susianah</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syW8yEW1HRE">Billy Riley</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xgr3Ne6hNk">We Be Three Poor Mariners</a> appear to be the same ones originally released in the sea shanty compilation album released around the time of Black Flag's original 2014 release.</p>
<p>Their appearance on this Ubisoft channel doesn't just appear to be part of a regular cycle of randomly reuploading older material either - the other recent soundtrack excerpts uploaded there have all been timed up to mirror the release of new stuff by the publishers. For example, a lot of the most recent tunes prior to this Black flag deluge are from December's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> DLC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-mirages-allegedly-saudi-backed-dlc-valley-of-memory-releases-november-18">Valley of Memory expansion</a> from November.</p><p>So, while my personal favourite Black Flag sailing song The Worst Old Ship sadly isn't among these reuploaded shanties, they certainly look like another in the litany of Remake signs that even any vessels whose lookout desperately needs new spectacles have spotted by now.</p>
<p>Relatively recent reporting's alleged that said Remake, or Resync if the PEGI rathing has is name correct, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">set to arrive in March</a>. So, these tunes may be intended as something to help folks pass time while waiting out the last couple of months patrolling a deserted dock.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new rumor has emerged online suggesting that Fortnite may be collaborating with Minecraft.</p>



<p>Fortnite is a major player in the realm of collaborations within the gaming industry, partnering not only with various media franchises but also with different games. In the past, we have seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-rare-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from iconic games</a> such as God of War, Halo, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more appear in Fortnite. Now, it appears the devs may be collaborating with one of the largest games of all time, Minecraft.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-minecraft-seemingly-in-early-development">Fortnite x Minecraft Seemingly in Early Development </h2>



<p>The information about Fortnite’s Minecraft being in early development comes from <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2011541834959671372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> user (formerly Twitter) AdiraFNInfo, which was reposted by reliable Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2011542845010952494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. However, HYPEX’s post has the word ‘rumored’ in it, which means that they haven’t been able to confirm whether this is indeed true. At the same time, if this is true, it could go down in the books as one of the biggest Fortnite collaborations of all time. </p>



<p>Fortnite has definitely levelled up their collaborations game over time, from just introducing skins, to introducing mythics and special abilities, and now designing their Island inspired by the collab. If Minecraft gets a similar treatment, we might see the Island adopt Minecraft’s unique art style. We could also see skins like Steve and other items make it into the game. However, this is just speculation, and readers should take this information with a massive grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, another claim states that Fortnite could be collaborating with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>. Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a> for the January 9 39.20 update.

            <p>Earth Must Die, the new game by Dan Marshall's Size Five Game, has just been given a 27th January release date and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/">a Steam demo</a>.</p>
<p>Earth Must Die is the comedian-packed, point-and-click-style space comedy in which you play as the villain - a Ming the Merciless-style tyrant called VValak Lizardtongue - and where you have to decide "how much of a dick you're going to be". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/earth-must-die-is-a-comedian-packed-point-and-click-in-which-you-decide-how-much-of-a-dick-you-want-to-be">Those are the words of Dan Marshall</a>, by the way, who I talked to about the game when it was announced last year.</p>

<p>Like many of Size Five Games, it plays in the classic point-and-click, adventure game way, but also like Marshall's previous games, there's a twist. In this case, it's a point-and-click game without an inventory and in which the main character doesn't want to pick anything up, because he thinks it's beneath him.</p><p>Arguably the most eye-catching feature of Earth Must Die, though, besides the bright cartoon artwork, is the list of actors voicing the game. Leading it are Joel Fry (Hizdahr in Game of Thrones, if you watched it), Ben Starr, Martha Howe-Douglas (co-creator of Ghosts), Alex Horne (Taskmaster), Mike Wozniak (Man Down, Taskmaster, Three Bean Salad podcast), Don Warrington (Rising Damp!), Matthew Holness (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace), Tamsin Greig (Black Books, Green Wing!), and Stevie Martin, Julie Nolke, Sophie Duker, Emma Fryer, Alasdair Beckett-King, Rosie Holt, Jon Blyth, Sam O'Leary, Tom Lawrinson, Sally Beaumont, David Montieth and Inel Tomlinson. See what I mean?</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough of a recommendation, consider Size Five Games' previous work: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lair-of-the-clockwork-god-review-platform-meets-adventure-with-hilarious-consequences">Lair of the Clockwork God, a relentlessly hilarious point-and-click game merged with a platformer</a> that I'm still sore I didn't give five stars to instead of four. "Bottomless wit and some inspired design choices make this genre mash-up a joy to play," I wrote at the time (2020).</p>
<p>Publisher No More Robots added during the release date announcement that Earth Must Die will be roughly an eight-hour game.</p>

			<p>Much has been said about the underwhelming <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> PC performance ever since <strong>CAPCOM</strong> launched the game nearly a year ago.</p>



<p>Mere days after the release, renowned modder <strong>Praydog</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a new version of his <strong>REFramework</strong></a> to improve certain stuttering instances caused by the game's anti-tampering technology. In April 2025, a texture decompressor tool <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tool-improves-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released</a> to minimize the stuttering caused by the real-time in-game decompression process.</p>



<p>The developer also worked to improve the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance. One step was the addition of <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> and <strong>AMD FSR 4</strong> support, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were introduced with <strong>Title Update 2</strong> in late June</a>. However, that wasn't nearly enough, and a few days later, Capcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-cancels-monster-hunter-wilds-lecture-amid-player-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to cancel</a> a technical lecture it was scheduled to hold at the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference 2025 (<strong>CEDEC</strong>) event in Japan due to harassment from players.</p>



<p>The recent <strong>Title Update 4</strong> introduced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over a hundred additional performance improvements</a></strong>, which finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemed to address most of the remaining critical issues</a>. Still, there was at least one big issue left: the game <strong>apparently constantly checks whether you own every piece of released DLC, and for each DLC that you do not own, the performance gets worse</strong>.</p>



<p>Reddit User De Tylmarande, who already spotted a fairly similar oversight in CAPCOM's Dragon's Dogma 2 that the developer later patched, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered this phenomenon</a> through testing two Steam accounts on identical hardware:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Account 1:</strong> Base game only with severe FPS drops (20-25 FPS in hubs)</li>



<li><strong>Account 2:</strong> All DLC installed with smooth performance (80+ FPS)</li>
</ul>



<p>Every variable was controlled (character appearance, location, time of day, graphics settings, drivers). The only difference was DLC ownership, and the issue was consistently replicated. Switching between accounts consistently replicated the issue. De Tylmarande then created a small "mod" that <strong>tricked the game into recognizing all DLC as owned (without actually unlocking anything)</strong>, and the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance <strong>skyrocketed immediately</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MH Wilds DLC Presence Check Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uf5cICpDXX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Needless to say, it is a bit baffling that a modder had to discover this nearly a full year after a game (and a triple-A one, no less) had launched. De Tylmarande added that <strong>Digital Foundry</strong> had reached out and would conduct their own analysis, so we can likely expect more insights soon. However, the video above already appears convincing enough.</p>

            <p>A new job listing posted by MMO developer ArenaNet has reignited hopes about Guild Wars 3 being in development.</p>
<p><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/arenanet/jobs/7536965">The listing</a>, advertising a role for a senior writer / narrative designer, explicitly states this new employee would be working on an unannounced project,  though one aspect of the role would be editing: "the narrative of Guild Wars". This, alongside a stated desire for applicants with experience working on MMO and a familiarity with MMO narratives, has many Guild Wars fans excited.</p>
<p>It is true too that the existence of Guild Wars 3 has been whispered about for some time. Last year, <a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/news/guild-wars-3-confirmed-to-be-in-development-though-it-seems-its-still-in-its-early-stages-updated-2000130976">the game was mentioned explicitly in an NCSoft Shareholders meeting as an 'in-development project'</a>. At the time, ArenaNet stated: "the team's focus is on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a> development".</p>

<p>The job listing also requests a familiarity with Unreal Engine 5, indicating that the proprietary engine used in Guild Wars 2 (and the original Guild Wars) may be left by the wayside for this new ArenaNet project.</p>
<p>There has been some increased murmuring around Guild Wars as of late. Not only have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29720/Guild_Wars_Reforged/">Guild Wars: Reforged</a> and Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity been released recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpm2fBvrAbw">but an extensive documentary about Guild Wars</a> was created at the tail end of 2025 to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary.</p><p>It's true that the MMORPG space is in a bit of a weird spot right now, with older MMORPGs seeing a resurgence as new releases fail to entice genre fans. Guild Wars 2 itself has benefited from this, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1284210/charts/">seeing an all-time-peak of Steam players only two months ago</a>. Meanwhile the future of new MMORPGs looks somewhat sparse, save for whatever ArenaNet is working on and Riot Games' own MMO project.</p>

            <p>Amazon's live action God of War series has found its Kratos, and it's a name you may already recognise from the franchise.</p>
<p>Ryan Hurst has been cast as Kratos in the upcoming show from Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios. Along with his live action credits, which include as Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans and Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy, Hurst also portrayed Thor in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, for which he scored himself a BAFTA nomination.</p>

<p>Sharing the news of Hurst's casting, game developer <a href="https://x.com/SonySantaMonica/status/2011529734682010108">Sony Santa Monica said</a>: "We're excited to see his take on Kratos as he joins the legendary ranks of T.C. Carson and Christopher Judge who have each shaped this character in unforgettable ways."</p>
<p>Speaking of Judge - who played Kratos in God of War 2018 and its sequel - the actor also sent his congratulations to Hurst. "You're gonna be great… BOI !!!" he <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/2011575459436454176">wrote on social media</a>, with an accompanying heart emoji. Of course, Judge's booming call to Kratos' son Atreus with a simple "Boy!" is one of God of War's most memorable lines.</p><p>As for the series, it will follow the path of Santa Monica's most recent Norse-based God of War games. "God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/ryan-hurst-tapped-to-play-kratos-in-prime-videos-i">reads the show's official logline</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series</a>. Toye's works include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">Amazon's acclaimed Fallout series</a>, and The Walking Dead. Meanwhile, in 2023, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for his work on Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.</p>
<p>The director joined showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on the upcoming series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of 2024</a>, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>. Now I just wonder who will play Atreus…</p>

			<p>The giant inflatable multi-coloured spider demon looms towards us. My co-op partner and I unleash a barrage of bubbles towards the beast, each bubble affixing to the ball-like structure of the creature, distorting it into a misshapen nightmare version of Bertie Bassett. Once three coloured bubble balls meet, in a match-3 style, they burst, leaving our opponent missing several legs and spasming on the ground. Akin to a daddy-long-legs that just fell afoul of a particularly vindictive three-year-old. With a final whimper, the boss explodes in a brightly coloured eruption. This is totally bonkers. This is Popucom.</p>
<p><iframe title="POPUCOM Nintendo Switch Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kDm9YuO8y1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A third-person puzzle shooter, Popucom is intended to be played with a buddy in split-screen co-op. There’s a plot, but it amounts to little more than establishing the mission of rescuing dozens of little fried egg looking aliens. To do this, the players must navigate linear levels cram-packed with rather ingenious puzzles and colour coded bad guys made up of a load of balls.</p>


<p>With a series of bizarre inventions – including a drone flown by a kitten, force shields, teleportation devices and the ability to transform into a Nintendo-lawyer baiting Samus Aran ball – the two of you must work with something resembling synchronicity to overcome countless physics-based traps. Proceedings are tremendous fun, and all constructed around the simple premise of each player being able to switch between two colour types, and every interactable object or enemy to shoot being one of those corresponding four colours.</p>


<p>One moment, you’ll be in a purple colour configuration, walking along a purple path, holding aloft your force shield with your partner stood on top. They, in turn, are using their blue force shield to deflect blue laser beams, before switching to yellow mode to blast some yellow light-sabre wielding minion-looking dude. Suddenly, both the path and the laser beams change colour, and you and your buddy must quickly switch roles to prevent death by touching the wrong colour. It’s frenetic, furious, and often demanding, yet oh-so satisfying when you finally manage to clear a challenge that’s take several attempts.</p>
<p>The game starts off simple enough, but through the twelve hours of content, the difficulty soon rockets up, demanding swift reactions and expert off-screen communication to beat later levels. Thankfully, frustration is mostly alleviated by frequent and smartly placed checkpoints, though there will be some teeth-gnashing when a handful of particularly nasty challenges respawn you too far back, forcing you to get through a particularly tricky bit just to have another go at the trap that killed you.</p>

<p>Collision detection can be occasionally poor, with players slipping from a platform even though they just successfully made that tricky final leap. Indeed, jumping in general feels a little woolly, often failing to provide the responsiveness the game demands. Still, with numerous accessibility options to tweak, including activating temporary invulnerability and granting auto-aim, this is perfect family gaming, and something people of varying gaming abilities can enjoy.</p>
<p>Other than some notable frame rate drops when things get busy on screen, this is bright, bold, over-the-top brilliance. The sort of sunny fun that will effortlessly pass a rainy Sunday afternoon or two.</p>

		Unlike anything you’ve ever played before, Popucom is the inventive family fun the Switch was made for. With a unique charm and smart accessibility choices that mean everyone can join in, this third-person puzzle ‘em up is going to keep our family occupied for some time to come.	</p></div>

			<p>Earlier this week, <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> launched a new digital storefront called '<strong><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cfx Marketplace</a></strong>'. This is a modding store where <strong>FiveM</strong> and <strong>RedM</strong> creators can sell their mods for the modding frameworks created for <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>, respectively. The announcement post lists the creators who have already signed up to be a part of Cfx Marketplace:</p>



<h2 id="h-launch-creators">Launch Creators</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Ambitioneers</li>



<li>Blue's Syn Scripts</li>



<li>BrunX Mods</li>



<li>Codesign</li>



<li>DirkScripts</li>



<li>Electus Scripts</li>



<li>KuzQuality</li>



<li>Lixeiro Charmoso</li>



<li>Loaf Scripts</li>



<li>London Studios</li>



<li>NTeam Development</li>



<li>ONX</li>



<li>Razed Mods</li>



<li>rcore</li>



<li>Retronix Development</li>



<li>RicX Scripts</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="coming-soon">Coming Soon</h2>



<ul>
<li>CodeM</li>



<li>LB Phone</li>



<li>Tiger Scripts</li>



<li>NoPixel</li>



<li>Wasabi Scripts</li>



<li>Pickle Mods</li>
</ul>



<p>It's yet another sign that Rockstar is indeed pushing hard toward user-generated content and perhaps will do that even more in the upcoming <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-reportedly-planning-fortnite-roblox-style-ugc-push/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per an earlier report</a>. As a reminder, the studio acquired <strong>Cfx.re</strong>, the team behind both FiveM and RedM, <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in August 2023</a>.</p>



<p>One of the mods available on the Cfx Marketplace is a server-side version of the stunning graphics overhaul, <strong>NaturalVision</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-natural-vision-enhanced-mod-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we've often featured as it evolved over time</a>. With the <strong><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7217721-naturalvision-fivem-server-graphics-pack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NaturalVision Graphics Pack</a></strong>, FiveM server owners can get a visual mod that works for everyone on the server, transforming weather, lighting, ambient colors, tonemapping, and more. The pack is priced at $12.19/month.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the Marketplace also includes filters for mods that enhance the single player versions of Grand Theft Auto V or Red Dead Redemption 2. There are no such mods available at the moment, but the mere existence of these filters suggests that Rockstar and the Cfx team believe they will be added over time by creators.</p>



<p>For the record, the most expensive item currently available on the Cfx Marketplace is the <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7221601-mrpd-hospital-mechanic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>MRPD/HOSPITAL/MECHANIC</strong> bundle</a>, which includes full maps for the Mission Row Police Department, a Hospital, and a Mechanic. The bundle is priced at $201.29.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> launches for the Switch 2 next month, and in case you missed it, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio will be adding a variety of retro games.</p>
<p>Our colleagues at Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sega-classic-emergency-call-ambulance-comes-to-ps5-ps4-via-yakuza-3-remake">covered one of these reveals</a> in December, and more recently, Sega lifted the lid on the inclusion of Game Gear titles.

<p>Now, in another development, it's been announced Game Gear versions of three Bandai Namco titles will also be playable. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pac_man">Pac-Man</a>, the action platform title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_mappy">Mappy</a> and the space shooter <strong>Galaga '91</strong>.</p>

<p>These games will join the previously revealed Game Gear title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_chaos">Sonic Chaos</a>. <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/sega-classic-emergency-call-ambulance-comes-to-ps5-ps4-via-yakuza-3-remake">Emergency Call Ambulance</a></strong> is also breaking free from arcades, and it's been confirmed the arcade beat 'em up <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/arcade-beat-em-up-slashout-joins-emergency-call-ambulance-in-yakuza-kiwami-3-on-ps5-ps4">SlashOut</a></strong> will also be included in the retro line up.

This charming café, located on the first floor to give the girls real-world experience, becomes a place where he shares the sweet and sour moments of work life alongside them in their cute uniforms.</p><p>His tireless efforts do not go unnoticed, and the heroines come to hold his kindness deep in their hearts.

The pure-hearted, carefree gyaru who wears her heart on her sleeve. The mature older woman who has seen it all.</p><p>No problem! I’ll make sure to take good care of every single one of them!</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Omi Nozomi</strong> (voiced by Nekota Mike) – “Good morning, sunshiiine!” Nozomi is the perfect senpai, admired by everyone at Hoshikuzu Dormitory. <a title="Games > Beneath [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a> that polished exterior, though, lies a girl with an unshakable will and a secret she’s kept close to her heart: the dorm mother (ơ) changed her life when they were kids. Reunited under the same roof, her long-held gratitude transforms into something far more complicated… and she’s determined to use her courage-and her curves-to finally make him notice her.</li><li><strong>Yaotome Suzuka</strong> (voiced by Moriya Kokoro) – “You don’t need to baby me, Oniichan.” After losing her home in a fire, Suzuka is set to be separated from her beloved Oniichan as she moves into Hoshikuzu Dormitory. Luckily for her, however, the dorm gets a new mother (8) and it happens to be… her brother?! A sweet girl who’s also a bit of a brocon, Suzuka must learn to become independent and cope with her new environment. Will she learn to rely on her brother less, or will their bond grow ever stronger?</li><li><strong>Kinugawa Miu</strong> (voiced by Hazuki Hikari) – “Hey, do you really not know who I am?” Miucha is the hottest up-and-coming influencer on Inshta, hoping to inspire young girls everywhere. Behind the filters and followers, however, she’s secretly a needy, attention-starved brat with a fragile ego… and a burning desire to prove herself. The dorm mother (o) is entirely unimpressed with her antics. Can he knock some sense into her, or will they just drive each other insane?</li><li><strong>Kotobuki Tamaki</strong> (voiced by Hara Popoko) – “Perserverance is admirable and all, but try to take it easy.” Tamaki’s the perfect president for Hoshikuzu Dormitory. She’s diligent, well-mannered, and takes her responsibilities very seriously. However, due to her short stature and her babyface, many people treat her like a kid. She’d never admit it, but deep down, she doesn’t mind being spoiled… and the dorm mother (ơ) is ready to dole out some pampering.</li><li><strong>Okai Tanpopo</strong> (voiced by Tsukishiro Mahiru) – “Just sit back and chillax! Mamarin’s the pride of our cafe!” Tanpopo is a carefree gyaru at Hoshikuzu Dormitory with a personality as easygoing as her smile. She’s friendly with everyone, and a little bit silly, and doesn’t bother with formalities-especially not with the dorm mother (o), whom she’s dubbed “Mamarin.” Her innocent, spacey nature makes her impossible to hate, but when Mamarin starts indulging her whims, things start spiraling out of control. After all, once Tanpopo decides something’s “fun,” there’s no telling where she’ll take it next…</li><li><strong>Urushihara Ayako</strong> (voiced by Aono Musubi) – “We goody two-shoes are only good for being gears in the grander machine of society.” Ayako is the manager of Honey &amp; Beary, the cute café attached to Hoshikuzu Dormitory. She keeps everything running smoothly, including managing a gaggle of girls from the dorm. She’s sharp, capable, and endlessly dependable… until someone pushes the wrong button. Beneath all this, though, she’s vulnerable, and lately, a certain dorm mother (ơ) has caught her eye.</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li>Become the dorm mother (male) of an all-girls dormitory.</li><li>Live together with a diverse cast of heroines and work with them at a crepe cafe.</li><li>Get to know each girl through heartwarming and hilarious daily interactions.</li><li>Unlock sweet romantic events and guide the story toward a happy ending with the one who captures your heart.</li><li>Get a unique perspective by viewing the girls’ thoughts.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the opening movie below.

<p>Nintendo has announced its first Switch Online game trial of 2026 for North America. It's also apparently the first time a trial has been exclusive to the Switch 2.</p>

This game trial is available between now and <strong>21st January 2026</strong>, and gives players access to the "full" game. If you don't have a subscription, Nintendo is also currently offering a free 7-day online trial in this region.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re in the mood for some ’80s and ’90s nostalgia, grab some Dunkaroos and get ready to be transported back to the world of Disney Afternoon cartoons on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, Capcom released the Disney Afternoon Collection. Originally developed by Digital Eclipse, the game featured six classic NES games based on Disney cartoons from the 1980s and 1990s. The six included games were: Darkwing Duck, TaleSpin, two Chip’n Dale Rescue Rangers games, and two DuckTales games. Now, nine years after its original release, the game could finally come to the Nintendo Switch</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-esrb-rating-has-surfaced">A New ESRB Rating Has Surfaced</h2>



<p>Atari, which now owns Digital Eclipse, has an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41099/the-disney-afternoon-collection/">ESRB rating</a> for the collection of games specifically on the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2. It’s not shocking that any Disney game would receive an E for Everyone rating, but fans can read the full rating description below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Disney Afternoon Collection is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB with Mild Fantasy Violence and Use of Tobacco. This is a collection of action platformer games from classic Disney franchises. Several games depict instances of mild, fantastical violence: players stunning enemies; characters shooting enemies; players throwing objects (e.g., boxes, rocks) at enemies; a plane shooting down enemy planes. Some games contain larger bosses and boss rush modes. One boss is depicted holding a cigar.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>There is no proposed Switch release date for the NES game collection at this time. However, it is available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, for anyone looking to scratch that nostalgic itch right now.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to follow the story and report any updates.</p>

<p>A "shared commitment" to improve player safety</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7cb1d126e56a6"><a title="Nintendo, Sony, Xbox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7cb1d126e56a6/nintendo-sony-xbox.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>In 2020, the major players in the console space Nintendo, Sony and Xbox announced a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/nintendo_playstation_and_xbox_announce_a_shared_commitment_to_safer_gaming">"shared commitment to safer gaming"</a> to "improve player safety" across each platform.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this year, and these shared principles have now been updated to ensure they represent the "constant efforts" to keep each of these game communities safe. Here's a bit more about this via Nintendo's official news release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"We believe gaming is for everyone and strive to provide experiences that are positive and enjoyable for all, especially for our youngest players. We work to accomplish this by pursuing a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced technology, research-driven insights, supportive community efforts, and skilled human oversight...Our latest shared principles reflect new innovations in player safety that have evolved with technological advancements, and new ways in which we collaborate through key industry initiatives and with trade associations."</em></p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xqlniu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The safer gaming principles cover <strong>Prevention</strong>, <strong>Partnership</strong> and <strong>Responsibility</strong>. Here's the rundown of each category:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prevention: Empower players and parents to understand and control gaming experiences</strong></p>
<p>- We provide controls that let players customize their gaming experience. We support parents with the tools and information necessary to help them customize appropriate gaming experiences for their children.</p>
<p>- We recognize that for safety features to be useful, they must be easy to use and understand. We promote the availability of our safety tools and provide guidance on how to use them through our platforms, support channels, services, on our websites, and in retail stores to reach more players and parents.</p>
<p>- We inform our parents and players about our codes of conduct and terms of use to support positive gaming experiences for everyone. We enforce these policies through a variety of preventive and remedial measures. We design our products with transparency and player empowerment at their core, aiming to make experiences that are intuitive and respect players’ choices.</p>
<p><strong>Partnership: We partner with industry peers, publishers, regulators, law enforcement, and our communities to advance player safety</strong></p>
<p>- Our commitment to safety is central, and we believe collaboration benefits the video game industry and all players by fostering safe gaming experiences.</p>
<p>- We partner and engage with global and regional industry trade organizations, industry members, regulators, law enforcement, non-profit organizations, and experts to develop and/or advance online safety initiatives. These include <a href="https://thrivingingames.org/"><strong>Thriving in Games Group,</strong></a> the <a href="https://fosi.org/"><strong>Family Online Safety Institute</strong></a>, and others.</p>
<p>- We conduct shared research to inform policy decisions and to drive industry innovation. Individually, we have engaged with external research centers that study play and wellbeing.</p>
<p>- We partner with our community to promote safe gaming behavior and encourage the use of reporting tools to call out bad actors, and we have tools and processes in place to support rapid response to emerging incidents.</p>
<p>- We collaborate with ratings agencies such as the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/"><strong>ESRB</strong></a> and <a href="https://pegi.info/"><strong>PEGI</strong></a>, among others, to ensure that our games are rated for the appropriate audience, and work closely with the Entertainment Software Association and other trade associations to share <a href="https://www.theesa.com/trust-safety/"><strong>trust &amp; safety information</strong></a> designed to educate and promote positive play experiences.</p>
<p>- We invest in leading technology and proactive collaboration to help thwart improper conduct and content. We participate in key industry initiatives, including the <a href="https://technologycoalition.org/"><strong>Tech Coalition</strong></a> and its <a href="https://technologycoalition.org/programs/lantern/"><strong>Lantern</strong></a> program, that are dedicated to enhancing child safety through technology, knowledge-sharing, and transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility: We hold ourselves accountable for making our platforms as safe as possible for all players</strong></p>
<p>- We make it easy for players to report violations of our codes of conduct and community guidelines, which we work to refine and evolve to support our player communities.</p>
<p>- In addition to removing content not suitable for our services, we take appropriate enforcement actions for violations, including restricting players from using our services for misconduct, with escalating restrictions for egregious or repeat violations. We engage in responsible and transparent practices, including the ethical use of all data, and deploy process enhancement technologies with skilled human oversight.</p>
<p>- We comply with all applicable laws in the places we do business and respond to legitimate requests from law enforcement. We promptly notify law enforcement if we observe unlawful conduct or where we believe a player is at risk of imminent harm.</p>
<p>- We publish our rules and requirements, and we ensure that players who have been reported understand the requirements for continued engagement with our platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's reiterated at the end of this update how this partnership is about "collaborating on solutions" to enhance player safety and ensure games continue to be welcoming to everyone. It also invites others to "commit to the safety and well-being of players everywhere".</p>

<p>Xbox has provided an update to its “Shared Commitment to Safer Gaming,” which it has partnered on with Nintendo and Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>



<p>Xbox first announced the collaboration in 2020, noting that it partnered with its traditional competitors because it believes more can be accomplished when working together. Gaming, like any major community, is an excellent way for people to connect, but it also raises safety concerns.</p>

<p>In the update, written by Kim Kunes, the Vice President of Gaming Trust and Safety, the latest guidelines agreed upon by the three organizations were outlined. Fans can read the complete outline on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/14/online-safety-principles-xbox-nintendo-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox Wire website,</a> but below are some highlights:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Partnership: We partner with industry peers, publishers, regulators, law enforcement, and our communities to advance player safety.</p>



<p>We partner and engage with global and regional industry trade organizations, industry members, regulators, law enforcement, non-profit organizations, and experts to develop and/or advance online safety initiatives. These include Thriving in Games Group, the Family Online Safety Institute, and others.</p>



<p>We invest in leading technology and proactive collaboration to help thwart improper conduct and content. We participate in key industry initiatives, including the Tech Coalition and its Lantern program, that are dedicated to enhancing child safety through technology, knowledge-sharing, and transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Roblox is one of the games that have recently come under fire <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-safe-for-kids-truth-parental-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for child safety concerns</a>; in fact, the state of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-child-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Louisiana is suing Roblox</a> over these concerns.</p>



<p>Xbox is not just working with Nintendo and Sony on player safety. More of the Microsoft console’s exclusive games are appearing on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms as<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/4th-game-during-xbox-developer-direct/"> Xbox continues to push the narrative that everything is an Xbox. </a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a> revolves around your ability to discover new resources and craft items using those resources. You can craft blocks for building a base, gear to fend off mobs, and weapons and tools to progress into more advanced biomes on the map. However, most of the items you're able to make in Hytale are crafted at different workbenches.</p><p>Workbenches are like Crafting Tables from Minecraft, but Hytale is different in that certain workbenches can craft specific items and materials. Whether you're playing solo or in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-multiplayer-in-hytale/1100-6537377/" data-ref-id="1100-6537377">Hytale multiplayer</a>, if you want to craft all sorts of items in Hytale, you'll need to know the recipes for every single workbench in the game.</p><h2 id="How_to_unlock_workbenches_in_Hytale">How to unlock workbenches in Hytale</h2><p>When you start Hytale, you won't be able to immediately make all of these crafting stations. Instead, you have to unlock your first workbench, which is done by using the crafting recipe for the regular workbench (3x Stones, 4x Tree Trunks).</p><p>This is done by going to your inventory by pressing "Tab" and selecting the workbench from the crafting menu. With the required resources in your inventory, you can click "Craft," and your first workbench is now ready to be placed down.</p><p>A regular workbench is how you craft all other workbenches in Hytale, so you always want to ensure you have one readily accessible. Fortunately, all it takes is any Stone and Tree Trunks to craft, which are always around you, regardless of what biome you're wandering around. Oak Logs are likely to be the first Tree Trunks you can get after leaving the spawn cave.</p><h2 id="How_to_craft_all_workbenches_in_Hytale">How to craft all workbenches in Hytale</h2><p>In total, there are eight craftable workbenches in Hytale, and each one has a different use when it comes to crafting certain items, materials, etc. To have a fully functioning base that can produce any kind of item in the game, you'll want to ensure you have a spot for all eight workbenches.</p><p>Of course, knowing what the workbenches are is only half the battle; you'll also need to know how to craft them and what is craftable at the workbench itself. Below, you can see every workbench, its crafting recipe, and what the workbench is able to produce.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Workbench Name</th><th scope="col">Crafting Use</th><th scope="col">Crafting Recipe</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Workbench</td><td>Starter tools and weapons</td><td>3x Stones<br>4x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Armorer's Workbench</td><td>Armor</td><td>2x Copper Ingot<br>5x Stones<br>10x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Builder's Workbench</td><td>Base-building items</td><td>3x Stones<br>6x Tree Trunks</td></tr><tr><td>Farmer's Workbench</td><td>Food/crop items</td><td>6x Tree Trunks<br>20x Plant Fiber</td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist's Workbench</td><td>Potions and healing supplies</td><td>5x Gold Ingot<br>10x Bone Fragment<br>10x Venom Sac<br>20x Stones</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture Workbench</td><td>Base furniture and decorations</td><td><p>4x Stones<br>6x Tree Trunks</p></td></tr><tr><td>Arcanist's Workbench</td><td>Teleporters and magical items</td><td>10x Thorium Ingots<br>20x Essence of the Void<br>30x Linen Scraps</td></tr><tr><td>Salvager's Workbench</td><td>Used to salvage and destroy items</td><td>5x Tree Trunks<br>5x Stones<br>6x Iron Ingots</td></tr></tbody></table><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635460" data-ratio="0.53686274509804" data-width="2550" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635460"></a><figcaption>Some of the craftable Workbenches in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4635460-4bdebd6ec1c85a7c3be45231a86dc5ca.jpg"></figure><p>There are also four other crafting stations in Hytale that aren't clearly marked as workbenches, but they perform very similarly and are able to craft additional items.

      <p>Yesterday, news broke that as part of layoffs affecting around 10,000 people at Meta, the company had <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><u>closed three VR studios</u></a>: Sanzaru, Armature, and Twisted Pixel. Now former Meta employees tell Aftermath that <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> developer Camouflaj has suffered heavy layoffs as well, and that in-development game projects have been canceled.</p><p>Speaking under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, former Meta employees said that Camouflaj is now made up of “just a handful of employees” who are working on "the new user experience for upcoming hardware." Studio heads, they told Aftermath, have been let go, and active game projects under development have been shut down. Additionally, they say, a sequel to <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> was in development at Sanzaru – rather than Camouflaj – but as of yesterday, Sanzaru no longer exists.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Meta for additional details, but did not receive a response as of this publishing. A Meta spokesperson <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376?ref=aftermath.site"><u>told Kotaku</u></a> that Camouflaj was affected by layoffs but is not shutting down.</p><p>While Camouflaj is best known these days for Batman: Arkham Shadow, it got its start with <em>Republique</em>, a 2013 stealth action-adventure that drew on studio founder Ryan Payton's history as a producer on the <em>Metal Gear</em> series. Camouflaj also released <em>Iron Man VR</em> in 2020.</p><p>A handful of Camouflaj employees have taken to LinkedIn to mourn what they’ve lost.</p><p>"I was a part of the recent Meta layoffs that hit Camouflaj," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kaitlinspangler_hey-everyone-i-was-a-part-of-the-recent-activity-7417305593205403648-l6wM?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGs78MBAu8ABzhFGUjynFfCNjxCGUPune0"><u>wrote</u></a> senior animator Kaitlin S. "It's been an incredible 12+ years with the team, and I am so proud of what we accomplished in that time! I will miss the Camouflaj team a great deal. It was an incredible group of game devs."</p><p>"Like many folks in the industry right now, I was recently impacted by layoffs at Meta and Camouflaj," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-santiago-pearson_like-many-folks-in-the-industry-right-now-activity-7417335554993860608-keUE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGs78MBAu8ABzhFGUjynFfCNjxCGUPune0"><u>wrote</u></a> cinematic and level designer Jordan Pearson. "I can’t begin to describe my gratitude for my time there. I initially joined the studio early in my career and had the opportunity to grow from intern to production assistant, then into level design, and before I knew it I was taking the lead on cinematic design &amp; implementation in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>. Camouflaj gave me space to take ownership and follow my passion for storytelling. I'll always be thankful to the teammates who trusted me and mentored me. I’ve never before worked with such talented, compassionate people."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><div><p>Bad Day</p><p>Two weeks into the year, too many layoffs</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>Oh God, it’s happening…. perhaps.</p>



<p>Recently, Shiina posted a roundup of the latest Fortnite news in a short YouTube video. One rumor suggested that a nostalgic duo from a live-action TV show could be coming to the game as early as next week.</p>



<p>Shiina said that if that is true, it could be The Office, as they had heard the collaboration within the works. Their tone made it clear this was not a lock. Whether Jim Halpert and Pam Beesley or Dwight Schrute and Michael Scott, The Office has no shortage of iconic duos that could be added to the game.</p>

<h2 id="h-fortnite-continues-to-partner-with-popular-classic-tv-properties">Fortnite Continues To Partner With Popular Classic TV Properties</h2>



<p>Fortnite recently announced a collaboration with South Park, which includes map exchanges, new skins, and limited-time Quint (5-Player) playlists. Over time, Fortnite has also partnered with The Simpsons, Adventure Time, WWE, and more.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming will continue to monitor the story and report whether or not The Office is officially coming to Fortnite, but as we all know, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. Michael Scott said that Wayne Gretzky said that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Months Later, Only 10,000 Escape from Tarkov Players Have Finished the Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-finished-game/</link>
            <guid>1406497</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two months ago, Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 and was officially released as a <strong>full game</strong>. It was the most monumental milestone in the studio’s history, and the game’s director called it the most significant moment of his life. The release of Tarkov 1.0 introduced the game’s ultimate ending, achievable after completing an all-new campaign.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and just <strong>10,489 players </strong>have managed to complete the game. It’s not known exactly how many people <strong>play </strong>Escape from Tarkov, but on Steam alone, you typically have around 25,000 concurrent players at peak times – and that’s the minority platform <strong>by far</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-have-completed-escape-from-tarkov">How Many People Have Completed Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, confirmed that, at the time of writing, 10,489 players had <strong>escaped from Tarkov</strong>. When Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 in November, this became the ultimate goal for fans worldwide, but also emerged as one of the toughest challenges ever presented in the extraction shooter space.</p>



<p>To make it to the game’s ending, an entire campaign with some hefty quests must be completed, and players then need to contend with a final ‘gauntlet’ through a new map, Terminal. This is the final mission and arguably the toughest thing Tarkov players have ever faced.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10489 players escaped fromTarkov so far. Beasts! 🫡</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/2011537504126845148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>If that wasn’t enough, players need to escape from boarding a boat, but depending on their squad size, <strong>not everyone </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-ending-zubr-seats-changes-battlestate-games/">is guaranteed a spot</a> on said vessel. That means that, for one or two players, it’s a trip back to the lobby and a second go at the final gauntlet.</p>



<p>It took <strong>two weeks </strong>for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">first player in the world</a>, <strong>Tigz</strong>, to successfully escape from Tarkov. He did this while streaming live, and the broadcast was tuned into by several Battlestate Games employees, including Buyanov himself.</p>



<p>Many players have followed in his footsteps, but 10,489 users represent a serious minority group in the assumed <strong>millions </strong>of Escape from Tarkov owners. In August 2025, Nikita gave fans a glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-how-many/">how many people were playing</a> Escape from Tarkov <strong>PvP </strong>on a random Sunday evening, and the number was around 45,000.</p>



<p>That doesn’t include PvE, which should equal another 30,000 – 40,000 (if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">Nikita’s PvE player count</a> claims are accurate). That means almost 100,000 concurrent players were enjoying Tarkov on a Sunday evening, and extrapolation means that just 10% of those players would have completed the game, two months after the opportunity became available.</p>



<p>We can safely say very few Tarkov players have managed to accomplish the ultimate goal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Legacy of Kain Creator Reveals New Game ‘Deadhaus Sonata’ 30 Years Later]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-creator-reveals-deadhaus-sonata/</link>
            <guid>1406482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In 1996, Denis Dyack created Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, a game that would go on to spawn another four titles over the next seven years. The series license was secured by Crystal Dynamics in the late nineties, pulling control away from Dyack, who would then go on to direct and produce Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem, Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes, and Too Human.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Denis Dyack will be fully unveiling his new game, dubbed a spiritual successor to Legacy of Kain arriving 30 years later. It’s called Deadhaus Sonata, and it’s an action RPG being pieced together by Apocalypse Studios. On social media, the team shared a short trailer, and the title is available to wishlist and <strong>examine closer </strong>on Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadhaus-sonata-the-dead-do-not-sleep-forever">Deadhaus Sonata – ‘The Dead Do Not Sleep Forever’</h2>



<p>The Deadhaus Sonata team published a short trailer for their upcoming narrative-driven RPG on social media, showcasing some of the gameplay mechanics. The account was established way back in 2018, so the game has been in development for quite some time.</p>



<p>Fans of a vampiric tale will be enthused by Deadhaus Sonata’s blurb:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The creator of Legacy of Kain is back. Become the undead in a third-person narrative-driven action RPG where your choices shape your legend and the world around you. Feed to grow stronger, embrace powerful classes, and carve your path alone or in co-op through a dark realm filled with secrets.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/#app_reviews_hash"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no release date yet for Deadhaus Sonata, but the game is being more fully unveiled tomorrow. What we do know is that it’ll be coming first to early access, allowing players to ‘become the undead’ and assume control of a powerful vampire with supernatural abilities.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The marketing spiel for Deadhaus Sonata is ambitious and promises a lot:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Deadhaus Sonata is a new dark fantasy world shaped by psychological depth, interconnected lore, and player-driven consequence. Every choice leaves a mark on your character and the world around you, with sentient gear, persistent events, and outcomes shaped by time, place, and action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the game can be wishlisted on Steam <strong>now</strong>, the title’s website stresses that it’ll be available on ‘all major platforms.’</p>

Look. This is almost as exciting as when we all learned New Horizons would give us the ability to sit down on the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as a part of Animal Crossing: New Horizon's 3.0 update, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">which dropped a day early today</a>, giving access to a new Hotel area, loads of new decorative items, some quality of life features like bulk crafting, and Dream Islands you can build alongside friends. But as players have discovered since, it's also added a subtle new feature to aid in construction and placement: essentially, a controlled way to step in the cardinal directions in very precise ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This feature is now tutorialed as part of obtaining the Construction App, though it's possible it may be available prior to that, and it's very easy to activate. You can use it any time by pressing the L button. Pressing it once will snap your character into place with a tiny little hop. Holding it down and moving the stick in a direction will let you take exactly one step in that direction, effectively the size of one "square" of space.

		<p>Amazon have found their Kratos and he is not new to the God of War universe.&nbsp; Ryan Hurst will be playing the PlayStation icon, having previously voiced Thor in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok.</a></p>
<p>The show has had two seasons ordered before the first scene has been filmed, with pre-production currently underway. The series will be skipping the Greek games and beginning in Norse mythology, but one would assume they are going to have explain why Kratos is covered in white ash and has giant chains wrapped around his forearms.</p>


<p>Ryan Hurst is best known for playing Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and will be seen on the big screen later this year in Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey.</p>
<p>Amazon’s TV adaption of Sony’s God of War games landed an Emmy award-winning director for the first two episodes. Frederick E.O. Toye has signed up and should be familiar with historical violence, having directed Shogun for Disney, and also The Boys for Amazon.</p>
<p>He joins Ronald D. Moore, creator of the highly acclaimed Battlestar Galactica remake, who will be the showrunner. The series was announced in 2022 with Rafe Judkins as the showrunner, but he left the project in 2024 due to creative differences.</p>

<p><em>“’God of War’&nbsp;is a compelling, character-driven franchise that we believe will captivate our global customers as much with its expansive and immersive worlds as its rich storytelling,”</em> Vernon Sanders, head of global television at Amazon Studios, said. <em>“We are honored to share in the adventure of exploring the&nbsp;God of War&nbsp;mythology in such a momentous way with Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Santa Monica Studio.”</em></p>
<p id="caption-attachment-467828">Ryan Hurst</p>
<p>Sony has a Horizon Zero Dawn movie in the works and a sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced years ago, but that seems to be dead in the water, perhaps due to Tom Holland’s busy schedule.&nbsp; Sony Pictures are also producing the Metal Gear Solid movie.</p>

            <p>
It's kind of baffling how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> came out almost two full decades ago, and there's hardly a whisper of a game that's managed to match its art direction. The thing is just too clean, too specific, there's a purpose to every detail. It feels like the future distilled into digital form, though no one really followed suit in the years since, opting for drab, lifeless realism instead. Except, as it turns out, that's almost what Mirror's Edge looked like too.
</p>
<p>
Over on <a href="https://www.designroom.site/mirrors-edge-an-oral-history/">Design Room</a>, as part of an oral history of the game, some of the game's original senior devs shared a lovely assortment of details. As it turns out, when Mirror's Edge was still in development, it was originally going to look more like other Unreal Engine games of the time (brown), with senior producer Owen O'Brien noting how not particularly unique it looked. "But we found that when you were moving very fast through the world, you got simulation sickness very quickly," O'Brien explained. "discovered that it was lessened if you made the world cleaner and less detailed."
</p>
<p>
Art director Johannes Söderqvist also took part in the interview, saying how it was just your generic, run-down New York style rooftops kind of look. "It wasn't bad; it looked good, actually," he said. "But there was no style to it, or a fairly generic style." It was O'Brien who wanted the game to stand out a bit more visually, noting that you couldn't tell the difference between games like Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Rainbow Six. "I said to the team, 'I want to look at a screenshot of Mirror's Edge in a magazine and know it's our game,'" O'Brien said.
</p>
<p>
So, Söderqvist worked with his art team to figure out how to get that striking look, drafting up a visual target, ultimately deciding to just strip out all of the colours from the textures, leaving most of the environments as pure white, the occasional block of colour to guide you.
</p><p>
I quite like lighting artist Oscar Carlén's take on what the world of Mirror's Edge is ultimately like too because of this decision: "Even though Faith is living in this very dystopian society where everything is controlled and monitored, she has such a hopeful spirit, a bright view of life. I think the lighting does a great job of making you feel that perspective."
</p>
<p>
If you haven't already, do give Design Room's full piece a read. Great stuff they're doing over there! And play Mirror's Edge too, still one of the best to do it.

<p>Meta recently canceled a Harry Potter VR game following multiple studio closures and layoffs.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OeL516hJzw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamertag VR on YouTube</a> claimed that one of the games affected by the recent shake-ups in Meta’s gaming department was the Harry Potter game, which would have been developed by Skydance.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Meta cancelled several exclusive games, one of which was going to be a Harry Potter official VR game,” he said. “It was being made by Skydance.”</p>

<h2 id="h-the-future-of-harry-potter-games-is-safe">The Future Of Harry Potter Games Is Safe</h2>



<p>Although the VR game has been canceled, the world of Hogwarts will continue in video games, as the sequel to Hogwarts Legacy, a Harry Potter-inspired MMO, is in development. To date, Hogwarts Legacy has sold over 40 million copies. The upcoming sequel could feature online multiplayer elements, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-job-listing-suggests/">according to a new job listing.</a></p>



<p>It was previously announced that four Meta Studios had faced either closures or layoffs: Twisted Pixel, Supernatural, Armature Studio, and Sanzaru Games. Across those four studios, more than 200 people were laid off. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meta-closes-multiple-studios-lays-off-staff/">here</a>.</p>
