		<p>The next chapter for Destiny 2 has been revealed by Bungie along with details of the upcoming year.&nbsp; A new trailer shows The Emissary, who is a friend of Drifter,&nbsp; being lectured to by The Nine and eventually transformed into a cybernetic body.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buh6WERf-zY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Without writing a million pages of Lore, The Nine are extra-dimensional beings that existed before The Traveller, before Ghosts and essentially before Destiny started. They have been mainly background characters during the first chapter of the game, but it seems they are going to be the new bad guys in The Fate Saga, which is going to be running over multiple years. They are individual characters, they are not a collective, so that would give the game plenty of new end of chapter bad guys to fight.</p>
<p>A gameplay trailer for The Edge of Fate was released that shows new weapons, new expansions and new powers. It begins with an invitation to a moment in time “for a very specific” reason,&nbsp; and you will be heading to Kepler, a tiny planet in the Oort cloud on the edge of our Solar System. We are also told that parts of Earth’s past have been pulled in to Kepler, which explains the subway trains and could be the rumoured level based on Chicago.</p>

<p>The new expansion will have ‘World Tiers’ with varying difficulty levels, with puzzles and events changing depending on the level. There’s also a new ability called “Matterspark” that allows you to turn in to Sonic the Hedgehog, or at least the Destiny 2 version, which is a sparkling ball of death.&nbsp; Matterspark is powered by Dark Matter (which is what The Nine are made of) and lucky for us there’s completely made-up thingy that allows everyone to see it.</p>

<p>The Edge of Fate launches on July 15th, with Renegades launching in Winter, followed by Shattered Cycle and The Alchemist in 2026, but before that we have The Right of the Nine, a free prologue event that reuses some dungeons but with a new twist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you’ve probably heard, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI </em>just got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-new-trailer-rockstar-1851779300&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-new-trailer-rockstar-1851779300">a brand new trailer</a></span>, giving us our best look yet at the world, characters, and story of Rockstar’s upcoming crime epic. The trailer tells us a lot more about the game’s leading couple, Lucia and Jason, and takes time to emphasize the atmosphere of <em>GTA VI</em>’s Florida-inspired setting, at one point showing Jason cruising down the highway listening to “Everybody Have Fun Tonight” by Wang Chung as an airplane flies overhead. And man, am I here for it. However, I see some folks on social media criticizing the trailer for not showing gameplay, suggesting that we can’t know if <em>GTA VI </em>is actually worth our interest until we see what it’s like to play it. I don’t fault anyone for feeling that way, but it’s not an argument that lands with me. For me, at this point <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>is probably more about vibes, environment, characters, story, and immersion than anything else. We know Rockstar can handle the gameplay stuff. It’s everything else I still need to be sold on.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,197554,196424" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When I think back on my favorite moments with the <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>series, I find that most of them are about just being in the worlds the games offer. My most vivid memory of <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em>, for instance, isn’t of any wild crime caper during one of the game’s structured missions or of going on a freeform rampage with a tank or a sniper rifle; it’s of driving some big American clunker of a car through the rain while “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/eOI6f83YizA?si=on8hDVNBTO8HSKYq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/eOI6f83YizA?si=on8hDVNBTO8HSKYq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fade Away</a></span>” played on the radio. Similarly, the moments that have stuck with me most from all my time with <em>Vice City </em>are because of the immaculate vibes they created: one is all about the delicious tonal contrast I experienced as I dropped bombs on enemies with an RC helicopter while the sunny sounds of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/4N1iwQxiHrs?si=bo2ncSBraJPTQWpe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/4N1iwQxiHrs?si=bo2ncSBraJPTQWpe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Love</a></span>” by The Outfield played on the radio, and another is about the tranquil beauty of flying over Vice City by night to the sounds of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/DCkJ5lGPqFs?si=XLskz0nRJHK-pl28&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/DCkJ5lGPqFs?si=XLskz0nRJHK-pl28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Out of Touch</a></span>” by Hall &amp; Oates. I could go on but you get the idea.</p><figure id="" data-id="338da74a7d804e3859b8d38b7ee6070f" data-recommend-id="image://338da74a7d804e3859b8d38b7ee6070f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man and a woman sit on a dock at sunset in an image from GTA VI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man and a woman sit on a dock at sunset in an image from GTA VI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Just give me the vibes.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="338da74a7d804e3859b8d38b7ee6070f" data-recommend-id="image://338da74a7d804e3859b8d38b7ee6070f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man and a woman sit on a dock at sunset in an image from GTA VI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And when I think about <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, the big question in my mind is not “How will its gameplay move the series forward?” Of course I’d love to see that there are some cool new aspects to the gameplay, and I suspect that at some point before the game releases, we’ll get one of those trailers that have become all the rage in recent years, like the one below for <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, in which a woman calmly narrates the various gameplay features of <em>GTA VI </em>as if she’s trying to sell us on a fancy new refrigerator.</p><p>But no, what I wonder most is: What will the vibes be like? What will the characters be like? Will I enjoy driving to the beach just to watch the sunset? Will I encounter unexpected moments of beauty in its violent world? Really, <em>GTA VI </em>could play pretty much identically to <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and as long as it offered a world and a story that I found more compelling than the ones that  game gave me, I’d still be thrilled.</p><p>And because these are the things that matter most to me, I found today’s new trailer thrilling. Yes, I want to see Jason just bumming around the place on the couch when Lucia comes home and collapses into his arms after a long day at work. I want to see Jason just cruising down the highway listening to the radio. Give me those lived-in moments. Those are the things that are gonna sell me on this game. If you need to see gameplay, I get it, and I don’t doubt that the trailer you’re waiting for will come eventually. But for me, when it comes to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, the vibes <em>are </em>the gameplay. Let me have this. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the trailer he’s on the TV as part of a gun store commercial. </p><p>Now, this is odd because Phil is from the <em>GTA</em> 3D universe (which is all the games between <em>GTA III </em>and <em>Vice City Stories) </em>and hasn’t been a part of the HD universe—the 3D and HD timelines are separate, beyond some stuff crossovers like brands, radio stations, etc. So does this mean <em>GTA 6</em> is set in the 3D Universe? No, I don’t think so. Instead, I think Rockstar is either teasing fans, and this guy will be named Phil Willy or something different, or the studio is willing to create new versions of past characters for its HD timeline. </p><p>Either way, it is very interesting. Will Tommy from<em> Vice City </em>appear in this game? We’ll find out when<em> GTA 6 </em>launches on PS5 and Xbox in May 2026. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Nvidia will release the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/even-more-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-and-updates-released/">GeForce RTX 5060</a> on May 19 starting at $299, the company announced via press release today. The new card, a successor to popular past GPUs like the GTX 1060 and RTX 3060, will bring Nvidia's DLSS 4 and Multi Frame-Generation technology to budget-to-mainstream gaming builds—at least, it <em>would</em>&nbsp;if every single GPU launched by any company at any price wasn't instantly selling out these days.</p>
<p>Nvidia announced a May release for the 5060 last month when it released the RTX 5060 Ti for $379 (8GB) and $429 (16GB). Prices for that card so far haven't been&nbsp;<em>as&nbsp;</em>inflated as they have been for the RTX 5070 on up, but the cheapest ones you can currently get are still between $50 and $100 over that MSRP. Unless Nvidia and its partners have made dramatically more RTX 5060 cards than they've made of any other model so far, expect this card to carry a similar pricing premium for a while.</p>

<p>Compared to the RTX 4060, the RTX 5060 adds a few hundred extra CUDA cores and gets a big memory bandwidth increase thanks to the move from GDDR6 to GDDR7. But its utility at higher resolutions will continue to be limited by its 8GB of RAM, which is already becoming a problem for a handful of high-end games at 1440p and 4K.</p>
<p>Regardless of its performance, the RTX 5060 will likely become a popular mainstream graphics card, just like its predecessors. Of the Steam Hardware Survey's top 10 GPUs, three are RTX xx60-series desktop GPUs (the 3060, 4060, and 2060); the laptop versions of the 4060 and 3060 are two of the others. If supply of the RTX 5060 is adequate and pricing isn't out of control, we'd expect it to shoot up these charts pretty quickly over the next few months.</p>

<p>Last month, Nintendo and its third-party partners revealed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">many</a> of the "physical" games on the Switch 2 would be made available <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">only as "Digital Key Cards."</a> Unlike traditional physical Switch games—which contain flash memory with the necessary data to play the game on the card itself—these key cards will simply enable the holder to download a copy of the game to their system and play that copy if and when the transferable key card is inserted in the system.</p>
<p>Already, many players are thinking ahead to what this means for their ability to play Game Key Card releases well into the future. It's not hard to find potential Switch 2 owners publicly worrying about games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendo%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cgame-key-cards%E2%80%9D-for-the-switch-2.1506662/#post-43644552">"disappear[ing] into the void"</a> or becoming "effectively a worthless piece of plastic/e-waste" when Nintendo eventually disables its Switch 2 game download servers. Some go even farther, calling a Game Key Card <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jtpjiy/comment/mlvyf6h/">an "eighty dollar rental"</a> rather than a real game purchase.</p>
<p>While these are valid long-term concerns, I think some players are underestimating the likely timeline for when Game Key Cards will become "useless e-waste." As it stands, we already have an example of Nintendo supporting continued downloads of games purchased nearly two decades ago and counting.</p>

<p>When Nintendo launched the Wii in November 2006, it also launched the Wii Virtual Console <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/11/8124/">with 30 downloadable titles</a> ranging from <em>Super Mario 64</em> to <em>Urban Champion</em>. And it may surprise you to learn that Virtual Console purchases made the day the Wii launched can still be redownloaded from Nintendo's servers to this day.</p>
<p>I know it surprised me when I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/nintendo-switch-2%E2%80%99s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common.1507000/page-2#post-43684635">read about it</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wii/comments/17pxta1/can_you_still_redownload_wii_games_on_the_digital/">various forum threads</a> in recent weeks. I've been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/04/end-of-an-era-many-wii-online-services-shutting-down-in-june/">writing</a> about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/">the shutdown</a> of the Wii's various online services for years, not to mention <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/why-game-archivists-are-dreading-this-months-3ds-wii-u-eshop-shutdown/">the high-profile shutdown of the 3DS and Wii U eShops</a> in 2023. By now, I figured that Nintendo had pulled the final plug on whatever aging server was letting Wii Virtual Console (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/wiiware-review/">WiiWare</a>) downloads limp along.</p>

<p>True, Nintendo shut off <em>new</em> downloadable game purchases on the Wii in 2019, likely to avoid the financial and customer support hassles of providing payment services for a vanishingly small market of players still actively buying games on the Wii. But when it comes to downloading old purchases, the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Wii/Troubleshooting/Wii-Shop-Channel/Missing-previously-downloaded-games/Missing-previously-downloaded-games-241877.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo1cZU7wGwS4tffto7ToGLE0CMmwIiS2rBi6yVDVEJAN5tkr0u5">official support site</a> still says that "as long as you are using the same Wii console you used to originally download the game, you will be able to re-download it should the game be lost or deleted."</p>
<p>Sure enough, just yesterday, I was able to plug in my aging Wii U, flip over to Wii mode (which still contains <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/12/the-long-frustrating-road-to-recovering-my-wii-downloads/">my recovered and transferred Virtual Console games licenses</a>) and download fresh copies of games like <em>Actraiser</em> and <em>Bonk's Adventure</em> like it was still 2006 (the same goes for redownloading previous Wii U and 3DS game purchases on those consoles, by the way).</p>
<p>When it comes to the longevity of a downloadable purchase, Nintendo now comes close to rivaling Steam, where players can still redownload <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">the copy of <em>Half-Life 2</em> they purchased over 20 years ago</a>. And while those Wii downloads are frustratingly tied to the original hardware used to make the purchase, the Switch 2's Game Key Cards ensure any future downloads will be easily portable to different hardware units.</p>

<h2>Past performance, future results</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that Nintendo has kept the game download servers for the Wii active even though it hasn't <em>sold</em> any new downloadable Wii games for roughly six years. At this point, any server hardware and bandwidth Nintendo is using to support Wii downloads is nothing but a financial loss for the company (unlike Steam, where Valve is at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">still selling fresh copies of <em>Half-Life 2</em></a> to new generations of PC gamers). The fact that Nintendo is still willing to provide those downloads with no direct financial upside suggests good things about its future commitment to Game Key Cards.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>You could even argue that Nintendo is <em>more</em> likely to offer longer-term support for Game Key Card downloads since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">backward compatibility seems to be a priority for the Switch hardware line</a>. If we presume that future Switch systems will remain backward compatible, we can probably also presume that Nintendo will want players on new hardware to still have access to their old Game Key Card purchases (or to be able to use Game Key Cards purchased on the secondhand market).</p>

<p>There are no guarantees in life, of course, and nothing lasts forever. Nintendo will one day go out of business, at which point it seems unlikely that a Game Key Card will be able to download much of anything. Short of that, Nintendo could suffer a financial malady that makes download servers for legacy systems seem like an indulgence, or it could come under new management that doesn't see value in supporting decades-old purchases made for ancient consoles.</p>
<p>As of this writing, though, Nintendo has kept its Wii game download servers active for 6,743 days and counting. If the Switch 2 Game Key Card servers last as long, that means those cards will still be fully functional through at least October 2043.</p>
<p>I don't know what I will be doing with my life in 2043, but it's comforting and extremely plausible to imagine that the "eighty dollar rental" I made of a Switch 2 Game Key Card back in 2025 will still work as intended.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, I think it's highly likely that I will become "e-waste" long before any Switch 2 Game Key Cards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-shows-off-six-major-areas-of-vice-city-in-grand-theft-auto-vi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">There's a new Grand Theft Auto VI trailer</a>, and even though <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">the game was recently delayed to May of next year</a>, developer Rockstar opened the floodgates today with new information. Vice City, where the game takes place, has a personality of its own. In addition to new details about the game's story and characters, the GTA VI website has loads of information about the game's new major areas, along with plenty of new screenshots. Here's a breakdown of what we know about each of them.</p>



<p>According to Rockstar's website, the game's central metropolis has "the glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city." Notable locations include Ocean Beach, Little Cuba, the Tisha-Wocka flea market, and the VC Port.</p>



<h2>Leonida Keys</h2>

<p>A clear parody of the Florida Keys, the Leonida Keys are a beachside tropical paradise, complete with retirees, casual boating, and sea turtles. The site's description also describes it as some of the most "dangerous waters in all of America."</p>



<h2>Grassrivers</h2>

<p>This swampy biome is full of danger. Rockstar says it's got even "deadlier predators" than the state's infamous alligators, and based on the screenshots, I can only assume those predators are the wetlands' intimidating, heavily armed residents.</p>



<h2>Port Gellhorn</h2>

<p>This sketchy area used to be a popular vacation spot, but now its stores have been abandoned and its parking lots are filled with "malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks." As a tourist, I'd be scared, but seeing as I'll be playing as two lovers with a penchant for the illegal, it seems like a great spot to make some money.</p>



<h2>Ambrosia</h2>

<p>The "heart of Leonida" is known for its "old school values," factories, and local biker gang. Based on the screenshots, it also looks like the economy partially relies on farms (even if this one is on fire), and the locals rely on some particularly patriotic women to wash their cars.</p>



<h2>Mount Kalaga National Park</h2>

<p>Full of wildlife and wilderness, the National Park is lush with greenery. Rockstar says the park will have "prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails," potentially hinting at some of the series' numerous elaborate minigames.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/startplaying-and-roll20-partner-up-for-daggerheart-launch-event<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roll20 and StartPlaying are partnering for a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> launch event. Darrington Press' highly anticipated fantasy TTRPG, set to release sometime this year, will have the support of one of the industry's largest VTT platforms and professional GM services.</p>

<h2>The <em>Daggerheart</em> Launch Event Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Roll20 and StartPlaying have put together an extensive <em>Daggerheart</em> launch event. StartPlaying has provided over 150 officially vetted Game Masters with advance copies of the <em>Daggerheart</em> Core Rulebook via the Demiplane Nexus. This means once the TTRPG launches, those wanting to experience it as intended can do so through StartPlaying.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-frog-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=eJq9SsX9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-frog-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=31ODN-VT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This won't be a single day event either. The entire launch month of Daggheart will be packed with exclusive online game sessions hosted by StartPlaying. Registration for these gaming tables are limited, so if you are a fan of Critical Role or have been enjoying the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">past playtests</a> of the game, it is best to register now while you can.</p>

<p>The press confirmed that the Daggerheart Demiplane Nexus will offer everything needed to play the game. This will include a digital reader, compendium, character builder, and GM tools. Furthermore, courtesy of the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-roll20-demiplane-integration-feature-is-now-in-beta" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platform integration</a> feature, these tools will be completely compatible with Roll20.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is an incredible opportunity for fans who have been eagerly awaiting Daggerheart’s release," said Jayme Boucher, Senior Marketing Manager at Roll20, the parent company of Demiplane. "Being able to learn and enjoy a brand-new TTRPG on launch day with professional GMs is not a typical day one experience, but it’s one that Roll20, StartPlaying, and Darrington Press are delighted to offer the community.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daggerheart is Darrington Press' latest TTRPG. The publishing arm of Critical Role has produced several high-quality TTRPG books and products. These include official supplements for the fantasy setting of Exandria like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tal'Dorei Reborn</em></a> and its gaslamp fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>More than a year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">Microsoft announced plans to start releasing games on rival platforms</a>, the publisher seems to have hit its stride on PlayStation. Sony released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/05/playstation-store-april-2025s-top-downloads/">its monthly most-downloaded charts for PS5 games</a>, and for April, the top three titles in both Europe and North America all came from Microsoft. No sales numbers were included, but the top games were <em>Minecraft</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda">the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster</a>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> charted as well.</p></div><p>This, of course, is a great thing for players, with major game releases available on more platforms. But it’s also part of a slow and steady shift for the platform holders, which once heavily relied on exclusives as a means to move hardware. That’s still largely the case for Nintendo — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">don’t expect to see <em>Mario Kart World</em> anywhere but the Switch 2</a> — but Microsoft and Sony have been steadily pushing in another direction.</p><p>While Sony has yet to release a first-party game on a rival console, it has made the PC a major part of its current strategy, with notable releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273919/spider-man-2-pc-release-date"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340000/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-playstation-network">soon <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> launching on PC after their PlayStation debuts. Part of the goal, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">according to Sony</a>, is to use these PC games to eventually lure players back to their console.</p><p>Microsoft’s strategy has similarly been gradual, but more expansive. It started with four smaller titles, including <em>Grounded</em> and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, last February, and covered both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">at the time Xbox chief Phil Spencer told <em>The Verge</em> that</a> “I don’t want to create a false expectation on those other platforms that this is somehow the first four to get over the dam and then the dam’s going to open and that everything else is coming, that’s not the plan today. I also don’t want to mislead customers on those other platforms.”</p><p>Well, the dam seems to have burst. Major Xbox releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606102/xbox-ps5-age-of-empires"><em>Age of Empires</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><em>Indiana Jones</em></a> have made their way to the PS5, while upcoming games like <em>Doom</em>, <em>Gears</em>, and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> are also launching on Sony’s console. Not every first-party Xbox game has been announced for the PS5 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/611255/avowed-review-xbox-pc"><em>Avowed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games"><em>South of Midnight</em></a> are still Xbox exclusives, for now, as is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"><em>Starfield</em></a> — but many of the heavy hitters have, including the likes of <em>Gears</em>, which has long been heavily associated with the Xbox brand.</p><p>It seems pretty clear that Microsoft is still in something of an experimentation phase, seeing how different kinds of games perform on different platforms. And as selling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">increasingly expensive hardware</a> becomes less of a focus for the publisher, the success of those games will be key. Last year, when this initiative was still getting started, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074166/microsoft-xbox-strategy-multiplatform">Spencer said that the long-term goal was</a> “a future where every screen is an Xbox.” Based on the current sales charts, it seems that now includes a PlayStation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> is one of those forever games where occasionally I'll see that it's released something new and think "dang, that old dog is still truckin' along?" It seems to be that time of year again, as both a big update for the game as well as a new expansion dropped yesterday. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/paradox-interactive">Paradox</a> previously described this as a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-date-stellaris-40-a-phoenix-update-to-attract-new-players-and-improve-performance">phoenix update</a>" to try and sort out a bunch of the game's long-running issues, as well as make some tweaks to help bring in new players.
</p>

<p>
Ironically, based on some recent Steam reviews since the update dropped, a lot of people seem to be saying it's kind of done the opposite, at least in terms of making the game run better. I'm sure that'll get fixed eventually, the game's nearly 10 years old, I doubt one dodgy update will sink this spaceship. In terms of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502823294872846886">update's big changes</a>, the game now groups singular populations by species, strata, and ethic. These groups then produce Workforce, which then get assigned to jobs on your planets.

<p>
DLC wise, there's lots of additions there too. You'll find a couple of new biological shipsets, which kind of look like different species of deep sea squid. There's also a new origin called the Wilderness, a "Hive Mind exclusive origin" that requires you to play with a biological ship set.
</p>
<p>
Godzilla and giant space creature lovers alike may also be interested in the new player crisis scenario which lets you breed your very own giant monster. Existentially terrifying, but makes for some cool gameplay.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's new civics like genetic identification and civil education, a new deep space citadel megastructure, an overhauled genetic ascension, and a lot more. Big DLC! Too much to cover here, but that's ok, it just leaves plenty more for you to discover. Or to just read about in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502823913043001850">Steam post</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-and-website-still-lists-release-date-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-with-no-mention-of-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-released-rockstar-tells-fans-to-explore-vice-city-and-beyond">the release of Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2</a> and a significant update to its official website, all eyes were on the launch platforms accompanying the new release date of May 26, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the trailer, we see the release date alongside the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, confirming the consoles remain part of GTA 6’s release. Indeed, Trailer 2 was captured on a PS5 (the trailer specifically mentions PS5, as opposed to PS5 Pro).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does this mean for the inevitable PC launch, or perhaps even a release on the Nintendo Switch 2? Some had wondered, perhaps even hoped, that GTA 6’s push to May 2026 would cause a rethink at Rockstar and parent company Take-Two and spark a simultaneous release on PC. The lack of mention of PC here perhaps suggests otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 and certainly in 2026 it feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick in an interview in February</a>, and in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/gta-6-main-1746545044332.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 is still set to launch on console only.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. If not May 2026, then when? Fall 2027? Early 2027? A year later, in May 2027?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how big of a missed opportunity could skipping PC for GTA 6’s launch be? Zelnick told IGN that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there’s no Nintendo Switch 2 logo on GTA 6 Trailer 2, which is perhaps expected. While we still don’t know exactly what the Switch 2 is capable of, it is set to get CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk 2077, so there was some hope that GTA 6, which, let’s remember, is still down as coming to the less powerful Xbox Series S, could make its way to Nintendo’s next-gen console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's similar to the spell that Delve NPC companion Brann Bronzebeard occasionally busts out when players are injured. The spell's healing properties, Wowhead notes, are actually stronger than the best cooking profession foods available, and it can also be used inside dungeons and raids.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's a nice little addition that in many ways feels overdue. Having to buy food from a vendor or eating just to regain lost health is definitely a core part of early WoW but hasn't been especially relevant as a mechanic for many, many years at this point. That's particularly true for characters with mana who have healing spells. Since running out of mana is almost unheard of in modern WoW unless you are in a lengthy PvP battle or extended raid encounter, classes with access to a heal can easily use that to restore their health fast instead of taking the time to eat.</p><p dir="ltr">Just because Blizzard is giving every player an easy way to heal up after encounters doesn't mean cooking or buying consumables from vendors will be obsolete. Recuperate, notably, does not restore mana. It also doesn't provide any stat-boosting buffs--the primary reason players sit down and eat a snack before a fight. That makes the game's cooking profession still relevant.</p><p dir="ltr">Recuperate is just one of many interesting additions coming as part of the game's next patch, titled Legacy of Arathor. It's also introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-patch-11-1-7-will-add-a-new-story-focused-way-to-level-characters/1100-6531276/" data-ref-id="1100-6531276">new story-focused way to level characters</a> called Lorewalking and adding a rotation assist tool that can even go so far to turn a class' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-one-button-rotation-tool-will-basically-play-the-game-for-you/1100-6531244/" data-ref-id="1100-6531244">damage rotation spells into a single button</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 11.1.7 doesn't yet have a release date, but Blizzard in the meantime continues to share more details about how the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">MMORPG's upcoming housing system will work</a>.

Alongside the trailer, Rockstar overhauled <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the game's website</a> and added all kinds of new details about the the game's locations and some of the characters you will meet in the game, including its protagonists.</p>



<p>Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos are the aforementioned protagonists. Jason an army vet who works in the Keys for local drug runners, but wants to try something new. Lucia's father trained her as a fighter her whole life and it was apparently fighting for her family that landed her in jail. But in both the GTA VI trailers, we see her regaining her freedom.</p>



<p>Brian Heder is the other character we see early in the trailer. He is an older gentleman that Jason apparently works for. Apparently he and his wife Lori manage the drug running business together. Though it was not confirmed in the trailer, Brian sounds like he is voiced by Stephen Root (<em>Barry</em>, <em>King of the Hill</em>).</p>



<p>Cal Hampton is also seen speaking periodically in the trailer. He is apparently a friend of Jason's and also works for Brian. Though similarly not confirmed in the trailer, it sounds like he is voiced by <em>Saturday Night Live</em>'s Bobby Moynihan.</p>



<p>Boobie Ike is a well-known and successful Vice City entrepreneur who built a number of legitimate businesses from his crime roots.</p>



<p>Dre'quan Priest is a musician who is "more of a hustler than a gangster" according to his bio.</p>



<p>Bae-Luxe and Roxy together go by Real Dimez. They are high school friends and are heavily invested in social media.</p>



<p>And finally,&nbsp;Raul Bautista is a charming and cunning bank robber.</p>

<p>There will be undoubtedly be many more characters in Grand Theft Auto VI when it releases May 26 of next year, but for now, this is a substantial look at who we can expect to meet in the game.&nbsp;For more GTA 6, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-revealed-with-first-official-trailer-alongside-2025-release">rewatch its reveal trailer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/humor/2023/12/05/watch-two-florida-men-analyze-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">see what Game Informer's resident Floridians thought about Rockstar's adaptation of their home state</a>.</p>

<p>TechRaptor was given an exclusive sneak peek at four of the Environments that will be available in the full rulebook when it releases physically and digitally at the end of the month. We also had a chance to talk about Environments (among other things that will be saved for a later date) with Lead Designers <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b50b662-11ad-4fba-8903-ff76c59dea55" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/spenser-starke-is-bringing-cinematic-gming-to-candela-obscura-chapter-2" rel="nofollow">Spenser Starke</a> and Rowan Hall.</p>

<h2>Environments Help A GM Consider The World</h2>

<p>Environments are locations that a GM can put in play that will not only affect the story by posing potential challenges for the players to overcome, but also offer unique mechanical obstacles to engage in.</p>

<p>The four Environments that TechRaptor can exclusively reveal are the Cliffside Ascent, Local Tavern, Outpost Town, and Raging River. Each is a Tier 1 event, which means it's intended for a party of level 2-4. Set for a lower level of play we're able to see how each of these are able to impact the party, and how these can be scaled up.</p>

<p>Each Environment is comprises of the following features:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the Environment</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Tier and Style of Environment: </strong>Here we see both Traversal and Social giving you fast information for where you might want to include it</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Impulses: </strong>Describing the way that you could provoke your players with the Environment to help them more readily engage</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Difficulty: </strong>This indicates the average difficulty check that the area would have, the GM can then further scale this up or down based on the relative safety or danger of the character's actions</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Potential Adversaries:</strong> A list of creatures or monsters that a party might find while exploring that area</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Features: </strong>Key gameplay elements tied to the Environment, these can be related to social interactions, rules for how to overcome an obstacle, but also can be related to ways things like combat may change</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>"We like Environments because they allow you to create a stat block, but for a place" - Spenser Starke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting to talk with Starke and Hall they explained they wanted to create a way that you could have stats about a location, that were available for you next to Adversaries. In <em>Daggerheart</em>, as play moves back to the GM it's important that you're able to understand all of the moves you can make.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-environments-exclusive-page-spread.jpg?itok=3oE4lfMJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-environments-exclusive-page-spread.jpg?itok=kf9-RpNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Environments Enhance <em>Daggerheart </em>Combat</h2>

<p>Hall gave an example of how an Environment could be used "say you're taking your players to a graveyard, you know there's a big bad evil Necromancer raising a bunch of zombies, you've got maybe a horde statted up, but you also want to have hands reach up from graves and grab your players and restrain them. It could be a lot of work to stat up a bunch of zombies, but if you have an Environment you can make an Environment Action where on a certain trigger hands restrain your players"</p>

<p>In <em>Daggerheart</em>, the combat isn't linear in that every character and adversary has a turn in order before it all resets. There's a player's turn and a GM's turn. For the players, this promotes playing collaboratively to strike together, for the GM, that means when it's your turn, any of the Adversaries at your command can go at any time. So many abilities at any point in time can be difficult to track, letting an Environment clearly be part of your list of actions is simply helping the GM have less to manage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Being able to pair down and streamline [combat], we're always looking for ways to give GMs all of the support that they need and also open enough doors that they might expand with their own narrative, their own choices, and have flexibility" - Rowan Hall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starke did highlight that Environments shouldn't be used everywhere "but if there's a place where you're like 'I can see how this environment itself really impacts the narrative, let me write down what this place is really about."</p>

<h2>An Environment Doesn't Have To Be A Place</h2>

<p>While the four that TechRaptor has been able to reveal were specifically places, Starke expanded that there were also Environments that it may not be "a particular place, it isn't like, an outpost but it is an Ambush. That can be placed anywhere, but it can give you the framing of what mechanically an Ambush might look like in <em>Daggerheart </em>for a scene you're interested in running."</p>

<p>When I asked what kinds of GM tools would be available for crafting their own Environments Hall paused for a moment before saying "One of my favorite parts of the book is a section where we go through how we build different adversary types and why we make the choices we do."</p>

<p>Describing it as 'popping open the hood' Hall continued to explain "We hope it's a conversation with the designers, the goal there was to make it as approachable as possible with as many examples as possible to people can refer to it almost like a recipe book. We have all different ways that people can approach that."</p>

<p>It's these kinds of behind the scenes looks and conversational understandings about why things are designed the way that they are that Starke and Hall are hoping it will make GMs crafting their own Environments possible.</p>

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Feven-more-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-and-updates-released%2F" rel="sponsored">has announced</a> a May 19th release date for its $299 RTX 5060 graphics card and the first laptops, which start at $1,099, that will feature it. The company says they’ll be available to buy from retail partners starting at 9AM PT / 12PM ET.</p><p>At 3,840 CUDA cores, the RTX 5060 has nearly 800 fewer cores than the 5060 Ti Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">released last month</a> and is the most basic of the RTX 50-series. But like the Ti version, the 5060 has GDDR7 memory, supports DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and gets the latest ray tracing and tensor cores. The company says more games are being updated with support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation before the 5060 launches, including <em>MechWarrior 5: Clans </em>on May 7th and <em>New World: Aeternum</em> on May 13th. </p><p>Whether the card is worth picking up, though, is another story. The RTX 5060 is limited to just 8GB of VRAM, and chances are good it’ll cost more than its suggested $299 retail price. Retailers started selling GPUs, including the other RTX 50-series cards, at a premium even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping">before President Trump’s tariffs took hold</a>. And as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again"><em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister</a> noted recently, Trump’s removal of the de minimus exemption last week could also impact pricing via extra import taxes on shipments valued at or under $800.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rockstar have released a second trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It's one of those cinematic clip shows of scenes from the game, setting up the story and relationship between dual protagonists Jason and Lucia. It's horny and boring at the same time. Nope, there's still no word on a PC release, sorry. </p>

<p>In the video we see Jason "Do You Even Lift" Duval going to collect his partner in crime (and life) from her stint in prison. Once free, Lucia "Okay One More Butt Shot" Caminos fires many weapons, kicks people, and makes kissy faces at her criminal bae. This is all set to 1986 pop hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NnMl7NUmS8">Hot Together by the Pointer Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them," say Rockstar on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the studio's website</a>, where they're finally sharing more about the game's story. "But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."</p>
<p>Other characters include conspiracy theorist pal Cal Hampton (basically Jack Black), bank robber Raul Bautista, gangster-to-musician Dre'Quan Priest, and two social media rappers known as Real Dimez. The developers have dumped a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads/screenshots">ton of screenshots</a> of these characters and more.</p>
<p>The trailer follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">the game's recent delay</a>, which pushed the open world crime sim's release date back to May 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the film itself, the name “Thunderbolts” refers to a soccer team Yelena (Florence Pugh) was part of as a child, which her father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), uses as a placeholder name for their team of misfit toys. At the very end, the group is rebranded as the “New Avengers,” officially relaunching the superhero team after its previous lineup disbanded following the events of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) leads the team, which makes sense considering he’s the only person who was around as part of the initial group when Thanos was destroying half the known universe, but as seen in the post-credits scene, not every Avengers alumnus is thrilled by this development. Captain America (Anthony Mackie) is suing the group for copyright infringement after he was shown to be in talks to lead a new team under the Avengers banner in <em>Brave New World</em>. So it seems like there will be some tension between the group and other heroes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><em>Avengers: Doomsday</em></a></span><em> </em>next year.</p><p>Once the group is deemed the New Avengers, the end credits sequence reveals the film’s new, true title: <em>The New Avengers</em>. It’s a clever gimmick that finally contextualizes the asterisk in the movie’s original title. However, it wasn’t enough for Marvel to introduce a New Avengers team through the back door of what appeared to be more of a B-plot film about some of the outcasts of the MCU; the company is also making this a marketing beat and spoiling the movie after one weekend. This isn’t just sequestered into trailers or social media videos; real-world billboards for the film are being updated for people to stumble upon out in the wild.</p><p>I’m torn because, as a marketing campaign, it’s pretty great. From the outside, <em>Thunderbolts* </em>was already fighting an uphill battle as a team-up movie of mostly side heroes in a franchise that no longer has the same cultural cache it once did. So it’s fun to see the movie rebranded as something more seemingly central to the overall MCU as a cheeky acknowledgement of the “oh, you thought you could skip this one?” feeling that has followed it. But also, this movie is only days old, and Marvel is using its massive platform to just spoil it outright for anyone who didn’t have the time or cash to swing by the theater on opening weekend. I’m staunchly against a company trying to control the narrative and tell people not to talk about something they paid money to see (within reason), but I feel even weirder about Marvel making that executive decision collectively for its audience.</p><p>Spoiler culture has gotten out of hand, and people’s almost phobia-like aversion to even pretty basic narrative details has made it almost impossible to talk about media without a comical amount of self-policing in public spaces. But I don’t know if Marvel is the company to take a big, subversive swing on the matter just 72 hours after a movie launched. Maybe there’s something to be said about how the “Thanos demands your silence” nonsense was a trailblazer and that other companies have followed suit in the years since. Maybe <em>Thunderbolts* </em>could be a pivot point that encourages people to stop taking spoiler culture so seriously. But maybe it could have waited one more week or so. Some of us were busy last weekend, Kevin Feige. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After last week revealing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Grand Theft Auto 6's delay to May 2026</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">Rockstar has today released the second trailer</a> for its highly-anticipated open world game. 
</p>
<p>
Much of the new footage focuses on co-protagonist Jason Duval, glimpsed in Rockstar's first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> trailer alongside his partner in crime Lucia. Today's trailer expands on his life, the couple's relationship, and introduces a few more faces from the game's cast. 
</p><p>

Alongside the trailer, Rockstar has also released a brief synopsis of the game's plot: "Set in Vice City, Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida - forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."

</p><p>
Let's dive in.
</p>

<p>The trailer opens with a look at this picturesque seafront area - vastly different to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s Los Santos.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's here we meet Brian Heder, who Rockstar desrcibes as a "classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling". He owns the property where Jason's living, rent-free, in exchange for help with his schemes.
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Brian's vaguely upset that Jason is living easy, when he should be off collecting rent from Brian's other, paying tenants. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jason's line here, "love you, Jason" is the first time his name has actually been confirmed - previously we just knew the name of his partner, Lucia. Jason's name now gets said a bunch more times in the next 30 seconds, just so you definitely know what it is.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Indeed, Jason is shown to be something of a popular guy around these parts. Jason doesn't seem too bothered.
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
As you'd expect, rent collection requires a bit of convincing from some folk. Here, Jason slaps a weed store owner and helps himself to the money from the cash register.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I can hear the GTA 6 mapping enthusiasts scribbling notes from here. We're headed along the freeway with a left turn to Vice City airport and Ambrosia, a location beyond the city fans have suspected may represent Orlando. Straight ahead lies Vice City's Downtown area. To the right is the city's Southside, and then Peacock Bay. Bumper stickers on the car in front read "MyWays" and "#Unbuckled".
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Yep, Jason is definitely buff.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But he also likes beer! His T-shirt here reads Leonida Marine Center, reflecting his former service. The slogan reads "We support all marine life!", while the design sports a cigar-smoking eagle brandishing a gun with each wing. You can also buy lottery tickets for a prize draw declaring "a new billionaire every week!" And finally - note the cat on the right. Cats in GTA 6 confirmed. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jason's off somewhere - past cops pushing people around - to the jail we saw Lucia inside during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Grand Theft Auto 6's first trailer</a>. "I'm here for Lucia Caminos," Jason says. "She's supposed to be getting out." The prison guard recognises Jason, establishing that he has visited Lucia often. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
And here Lucia is, GTA 6's other main character. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's safe to say Lucia and Jason have some things to catch up on. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Is this a flashback, or does Lucia get straight back to work? Masked, we see her threatening two men in suits. Jason is involved too.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"To new beginnings," Jason says, finally cracking open that beer with Lucia. (They're drinking a brand of cerveza named "Dayho".) The pair reminisce at sunset, seemingly remembering an occasion where one of them broke someone's nose. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Contrast that talk of new beginnings and bright sunset with two nighttime shots of reality. Back at Brian's, Jason helps load something (presumably drugs) onto a small plane. Meanwhile, Lucia sports a fluorescent jacket picking up litter by the side of the road.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Trust me, this place is just a start for us," Lucia tells Jason, who looks unsure. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Ring the bells!" shouts Cal Hampton, a friend of Jason's, in a seedy-looking bar where the pair do shots. Cut to Lucia, now in a gold sequined dress, at a far more upmarket establishment, showing off her outfit to Jason.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"If we're doing this, we do it right," says Jason, as we see our characters holding hands, partners in... crime? A new life? Cut to Jason and Lucia, presumably later that night, dancing in a club. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In another scene, Jason and what looks to be new character Dre'quan Priest approach a contact. "Yo D, this fool a Fed?" the contact asks. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's unclear what happens next, but these gentlemen do not look happy. Is this the easy score that goes wrong? Jason and Lucia are shown escaping from a window, as Brian remarks that their name and address are now known. But by who?
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
We're introduced to a cop character, prowling through a building toting a gun. "Us cops, we gotta protect each other," he tells someone in a boiler suit, presumably undercover.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
A succession of quick shots shows, among other things, Jason shoving someone into a car while Lucia fights in a kickboxing match. "You and me Lu, we got this," says Jason. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Cut to a police convoy exploding after someone fires a grenade launcher. It's safe to say they have not got this as much as they expect. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
More quick shots, including someone (Lucia?) wrestling someone else on the open cargo doors of a taxiing plane, a car chase where someone steals an ATM machine that was mentioned in an earlier leak, and various shots of people dancing/showing that Vice City is aptly named. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In the trailer's final sequence, Jason sits on the couch watching a commercial for Phil's Ammu-Nation, beer bottles and a fake PS5 in view. Lucia's just home from her litter picking job (her vest sports the letters LDC, presumably Leonida Department of Corrections). 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But there's no time to sleep. Jason's on a jetski! A motorboat shooting at a helicopter! A motorbike! 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Hey, if you got friends can you hook me up please?!" shouts Cal - a question hopefully the audience is also now saying of GTA 6, before we're reminded that the game is still over a year away. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And that's it - what did you think?</p>
<p>
Accompanying the trailer, Rockstar has today also released new information further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">detailing GTA 6's large cast of charaters and some of the various regions you'll visit around Vice City and beyond</a>.

			<p>Getting Cyberpunk 2077 to run on Nintendo Switch 2 did not require a gigantic effort, although getting it to play well was among the challenges CD Projekt Red had to face during the port's development.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>, CD Projekt Red SVP of Business Jan Rosner revealed that the team managed to get the game running on Nintendo Switch 2 fairly quickly and without a gigantic effort. However, bigger challenges were to ensure the game would play well, use some of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features, and that it suited the handheld format. With the game's disastrous launch on previous generation consoles in mind, CDPR wanted to ensure the game played well on the system, even with some visual compromises that, according to Rosner, don't impact the game's artistic vision. In this regard, the CDPR SVP of Business feels the team achieved their goal of having a big AAA RPG on the go playable from start to finish without making any <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch2-surpass-ps4-graphics/">significant compromises</a>.</p>
<p>The attention CD Projekt Red placed on the Nintendo Switch 2 release of Cyberpunk 2077 and the console's audience is well highlighted by the fact that the retail edition will include the full game on the cartridge and won't require any additional download. The team made this decision based on their experience with The Witcher 3 on the original Switch, which proved how important physical editions are for the Nintendo audience, and, as such, putting the entire game on the cartridge to offer a plug-and-play experience was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console debuts worldwide, with a few exceptions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2340520/view/535474378243048018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on PC via Steam Early Access on May 21st, and yes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">unlike&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, that's May 21st this year, not next.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>, you'll be building your dream farmhouse, all while shapeshifting into various yokai forms in order to make exploration and day-to-day life easier. Think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spirittea" rel="nofollow"><em>Spirittea</em></a>, but where you get to transform into the creatures, and you're not a million miles away.</p>

Together with your sister Kon, you'll build a life among these mythical beings.</p>

<p>Forms you can shapeshift into over the course of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>include the Crow Tengu, which grants you flight, as well as the water-dwelling Slime and the farmland-tending Boar.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from a life sim like this, you can grow and tend to crops, raise livestock, and build your homestead, kitting it out with custom-crafted furniture to add that all-important personal touch. Of course, you can also cook meals from the ingredients you grow and source from the local area.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>also features a romance system, with "a variety of romanceable partners" available, each of whom has "their own unique personalities and heartwarming stories". The game's "extraordinary" villagers will have a range of quests for you to complete as well.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 21st.

Again, how reflective that is of the finished game remains to be seen, but Rockstar Games has certainly earned itself the benefit of the doubt in many quarters over the years, especially between <em>GTA V </em>and <em>Red Dead Redemption VI</em>. The footage was running on a PlayStation 5, which is also a boon to those worried the game might only really pop on a PS5 Pro (it’ll also be on Xbox Series X/S but a PC port won’t be ready at launch).</p><p>We’ll see if that widespread enthusiasm remains once the game’s price is announced. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">With Microsoft</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">and Nintendo</a></span> both moving to $80 for their most premium games, it’s not inconceivable now that <em>GTA 6 </em>could blow past that and come in at $100 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553">as some analysts have speculated</a></span>, potentially with an even higher price tag for early access or other deluxe edition bonuses. With the launch still more than a year away, after being delayed out of fall 2025, there’s plenty of time for Rockstar to trickle out more of the details and for <em>GTA 6</em> to continue dominating the fan theory and rumor mill for a while longer. </p><p>Who knows if it will live up to its unprecedented hype. All things considered it’s looking pretty incredible right now, though. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
