		<p>Ubisoft have released version 1.23 of The Division, a game released ten years ago and superseded by the cunningly named The Division 2. The new patch does absolutely nothing apart from give PS5 players a 60fps mode. That’s it, nothing else, just a nice 60fps update for the *checks notes* five people still playing the game on PS5.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a>&nbsp; was meant to be the next game in the series but was cancelled by Ubisoft in 2024, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>. The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects.</p>


<p>That didn’t work out too well as XDefiant, Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter, officially shut down on June 3, 2025, just over a year after its May 2024 launch.</p>
<p>Since then Ubisoft have been busy restructuring their business, starting by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/27/ubisoft-sell-five-old-games-to-atari/">selling off five games</a> to Atari, the games being Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Child of Eden, Grow Home, and Grow Up. They have also<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/15/ubisoft-delays-its-biggest-productions-after-ac-shadows-delay-led-to-a-better-game/"> delayed all their “big” games</a> to allow them to be more polished, although they did not say which games these were,</p>

<p>They have also been cuddling up with Tencent to<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/"> create a subsidiary</a> that will look after three of it’s biggest franchises, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry..</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-genai-more-interested-in-using-ai-in-the-control-systems-than-using-it-to-make-visuals/</link>
            <guid>1388440</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ever since <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">Larian Studios' chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, admitted that the studio is using GenAI technology in its development pipeline for Divinity</a>, the use of GenAI tech in video game development has roared back to the front of the line in the industry's discourse rolodex. Amidst the GenAI conversation Larian started, it appears that renowned creator Hideo Kojima also offered his perspective on GenAI in a recent interview.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/12/style/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2-hnk-intl-dst">In an interview with CNN</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109413/kojima-wont-use-ai-to-create-art-thinks-it-could-be-useful-for-responsive-enemy-design/index.html">TweakTown</a> (that actually went live a few days before Bloomberg's interview with Vincke), Kojima, perhaps unsurprisingly, said that he's not exactly interested in using GenAI technology to create anything visual. He doesn't dismiss it entirely, though, as he says he's more interested in how it could be used within the "<em>control systems</em>" of a game than anything else.</p>



<p>"<em>Rather than having AI create visuals or anything like that, I'm more interested in using AI in the control systems</em>," Kojima began. "<em>For example, if you have 100 players, each of them will have their own habits and tendencies, their sense of control, how they move - all of that differs from person to person.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>By having AI compensate for those differences, the gameplay can gain more depth. And in most games, the enemies don't behave very much like real humans. But by using AI, enemy behavior could change based on the player's experience, actions, and patterns. That kind of dynamic response would make much deeper gameplay possible</em>."</p>



<p>The kind of AI Hideo Kojima is discussing here, particularly with enemy behaviors, is the kind that we are more than used to seeing in video games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/alien-isolation-is-way-too-long-because-its-xenomorph-got-way-too-smart-at-the-time-it-didnt-seem-that-long/">Alien: Isolation famously has an incredibly sophisticated enemy AI system built for the Xenomorph</a>, which was a key element of its gameplay that elevates it to being a truly terrifying horror game.</p>



<p>His statement to CNN is also in line <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">with the last time he was asked about GenAI</a>, where he said he'd use it for "<em></em><em>the tedious tasks</em>" while he handled all the actual art.</p>



<p>While some studios, Larian included, are comfortable using GenAI for art and visuals as part of the process, it seems clear that Kojima would much rather have it make the systems and the nitty-gritty elements of development run smoother, so he could focus on what he loves to do, and the thing that actually makes his games iconic.</p>

            <p>Sony and Naughty Dog appear to have brought back the festive videogame industry tradition of mandatory overtime. According to reports, the Last Of Us and Uncharted developers have been crunching for the past seven weeks to finish an internal demo for their new sci-fi action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic">Bloomberg</a>’s Jason Schreier (paywall), who claims that team members at the Santa Monica-based studio have been asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week since late October. To enforce this, Naughty Dog have also allegedly required staff to work in office five days a week - up from three - logging their overtime in an internal spreadsheet. Some staff have had to make hasty short-term care arrangements for children and pets. Naughty Dog have, at least, told staff not to work more than 60 hours a week.</p>
<p>This overtime period is apparently an attempt to get Intergalactic back on track after several missed deadlines, with the game currently slated for console release in mid-2027. Naughty Dog have long had a reputation for crunch, with staff sometimes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">needing hospital care as a result</a>, but the Bloomberg piece says that this is the first time in “recent years” that overtime has been mandated across the “bulk” of the studio.</p>
<p>Schreier writes that Naughty Dog introduced a squad of producers in 2021 who were tasked with lessening the load on developers (among other responsibilities), following the gruelling development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>: Part II. According to “people familiar with the situation”, however, many of those producers are now gone.</p><p>As of this week, most Naughty Dog staff are reportedly now back on normal hours, and management have said that people will once again be able to work two weekdays at home through the end of January, with a more detailed working schedule for 2026 to be presented after the holiday break.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, it’s about a stranded bounty hunter investigating the mysteries of a forgotten planet. It’s Naughty Dog’s first non-sequel videogame in a while, which suggests that there will be a lot of pressure from Sony to deliver results.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Carrying a separate charger for all your devices – from smartphones to laptops, tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches – can be inconvenient, especially if you’re trying to travel light. This is where a multi-port charger can come in handy, and today is a great time to grab one.</p>
<p>Anker makes some of the best portable charging solutions around, as right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6524/">you can snap its 67W Anker Prime USB-C charger with 3 ports for just $37 at Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice 25% discount. The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, plus shipping is free for all shoppers!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power Multiple Devices at Once</h2>
<p>It’s a compact block that’s around 51% smaller than the original 67W MacBook charger. The prongs fold in when not in use, which makes the thing quite easy (and safe) to carry around with you on the go. Small size doesn’t mean a compromise on performance, though.</p>
<p>The charger comes with a total of three ports, including 2 USB-C ports and 1 USB-A port. These are enough to juice all your essentials up at the same time, whether it’s your phone, laptop, or headphones. Connecting a single device lets you enjoy an efficient output of 67W, while the 65W max two-port charging cuts down on charging time by up to 34%. You won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long, even when powering multiple devices at the same time. The maximum output of 65W is available whether you’re using both USB-C ports or a mix of USB-C and USB-A. Compatibility-wise, the charger plays nicely with a wide range of devices, from iPhone Series 12 to 17, Samsung Galaxy phones, MacBooks, Pixel phones, iPads, and more.</p>



<p>Stability comes from the combination of partially covered pins and an innovative stacked design that keeps the charger firmly in place. GaNPrime Tech, paired with an upgraded ActiveShield 2.0 system, allows for better heat management and increased security, so you won’t have to worry about dealing with overheating, either.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this charger to anyone who is looking for a no-fuss power solution that can juice multiple devices at once. It’s going to be a great addition to work stations. The compact size makes it just as easy to carry around; simply plug it into an outlet in a cafe, coworking space, or the airport, and keep your devices up and running. This deal brings its price down to just $37, which is nothing considering the convenience and peace of mind it gets you. The box comes with the charger itself, a welcome guide, and a worry-free 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>Getting your orders in today will help get the charger delivered before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to go on a well-deserved trip during the holidays, and don’t want to carry multiple adapters for a bunch of gadgets.</p>

<p>A 2026 Roadmap for Battlefield 6 has already been laid out, and it includes news on a RedSec Battle Royale Solo mode, and other changes to the core multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-uss-best-selling-game-of-2025-year-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> worked, and the series is back with all sorts of bangs. Call of Duty needed competition, and Battlefield 6 stepped up to the plate with a welcome return to full-scale military warfare. The game’s launch, the addition of RedSec, and Season 1 injected Battlefield goodness into everyone’s veins, but there’s plenty more scheduled for 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-2026-battlefield-6-roadmap-features-new-redsec-amp-multiplayer-content">2026 Battlefield 6 Roadmap Features New RedSec &amp; Multiplayer Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another great year beckons. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ‘Battlefield 6 – Community Update – Holiday Wrap-Up’ spoke to the BF community going into Christmas. The player base is expected to grow due to the presence of ‘Xmas noobs,’ and the developer wanted to celebrate ‘an incredible year for the team.’</p>







<p>The blog runs through some obligatory thank you messages to all players—give yourselves a pat on the back—and shares some fascinating numbers. Check out some right here:</p>



<ul>
<li>Played over 1.7 billion matches and logged 383.5 million gameplay hours.</li>



<li>Delivered 12.4 billion kills and 871 million revives.</li>



<li>Destroyed 102 million helicopters and jets.</li>
</ul>



<p>After running through community highlights, it was time for the lowdown on what to expect from 2026.</p>



<p>The team will be “Refining core gameplay, balance, and quality-of-life improvements across Multiplayer, REDSEC, and Portal,” there will be new maps to “introduce fresh tactical opportunities and keep the experience evolving in meaningful ways,” and the developer wants to “Expand Battlefield Labs by bringing more of its experimentation into the live experience.”</p>



<p>Battle Royale players might be interested to hear that BR Solos is still in the pipeline: “We are working through the technical details to deliver it at a quality level that feels right for Battlefield. Once we are confident in the plan and timing, we will share more.”</p>



<p>It’s not a guarantee that it’s happening, but its arrival is likely happening.</p>

<p>This time of year is always an exciting time for those with oodles of subscriptions or memberships to various online platforms, because it’s when all the ‘wrapped’ presentations drop. From Spotify to PlayStation and from LinkedIn to YouTube, many platforms partake in the annual wrapped festival, offering key insights into your year as a subscriber or member.</p>



<p>That is, all except for Xbox. In a recent report, it was claimed that Xbox isn’t providing an ‘Xbox Wrapped’ presentation this year because the company has better things to spend its marketing budget on.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-xbox-wrapped-unfortunately">No Xbox Wrapped, Unfortunately</h2>



<p>There were <em>wrapped </em>presentations hailing from all corners of the gaming world this year. The likes of PlayStation, Steam, Discord, and even Nintendo have provided <strong>some kind </strong>of recap for 2025 in gaming. It was a veritable plethora of data for gamers to absorb, but it’s important to stress it’s all just a bit of fun, with some potential bragging rights tacked on.</p>



<p>In a recent report from Windows Central, it was claimed that Xbox isn’t doing a wrapped celebration this year because there’s far too much happening <strong>next year, </strong>and the marketing budget wouldn’t cover it.</p>



<p>Here’s the snippet <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Jez Corden</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My sources suggest that (as you might expect given that it’s now the 18th), that Xbox is not doing a “Wrapped” this year.</p>



<p>A lot of the “marketing budget” that would’ve typically been allocated to something like an “Xbox Wrapped” is being poured into efforts to celebrate these major milestones for Xbox, its brands, and some of its games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As professed recently by Xbox ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-developer-direct-promises-huge/">upcoming Developer Direct</a>, there are stacks of milestones landing in 2026. For instance, Xbox is celebrating a quarter-century in the business, while Bethesda is ticking off its 40th birthday.</p>



<p>If you were holding out hope that Xbox was just waiting a bit longer than everyone else to release Xbox Wrapped this year, you’re out of luck.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how <strong>you think </strong>you did this year within the Xbox ecosystem.</p>

                <p>Generative AI has been at the forefront of the conversation for the past few years, with companies becoming divisive on how to implement it, if at all. Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations</a>. After a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">quick retraction and explanation</a>, along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking. Vincke has admitted that Larian uses AI for tasks nobody wants to do, but does AI--even at the concept art stage--help actual concept artists?</p><p>According to a handful of video game concept artists, it can actually make things harder. Talking to Edmond Tran from <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/feature/concept-artists-in-games-say-generative-ai-references-only-make-their-jobs-harder/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This Week In Video Games</a>, artists said that it complicates their workflow and doesn't help them creatively.</p><p>"I'm seeing more and more clients generate something approximating their desired outcome and essentially asking me to make 'something like this,'" said Paul Scott Canavan, an artist who has worked as an art director and concept artist for projects like Destiny 2, Heroes of the Storm, Guild Wars 2, and Netflix's The Witcher. "It sucks. This practice absolutely invalidates the entire creative process, in my opinion, and makes my job harder and more frustrating. The job of an illustrator or concept artist is to draw from their years of experience to interpret a brief in a creative way."</p><p>Another freelance designer and illustrator, Kim Hu, who worked as the lead artist on Rollerdrome (and possible the world's biggest fan of Marvel's Taskmaster), says even starting with AI images "robs you of discovery, as it will likely more or less give you exactly what you asked of it", and says that looking at the real world and references helps with creation and maybe adds on something you didn't think of before, "informing and branching out your ideas further." She adds that going down these accidental rabbit holes is a pivotal step in concept and world-building for her.</p><p>A senior concept artist, who asked to remain anonymous due to their position at a major game developer, told Tran that studio leadership now asks them to work from AI-generated reference material. They said that this often requires "reverse engineering where the pieces of the image composite came from, and working off what I'm able to find through careful searches on the internet--things like hairstyles, clothing, props, and so on."</p><p>Beyond protecting the company from potential legal risk, particularly given that the project involves a well-known IP, the artist said they feel a principled obligation to take on this extra work for the benefit of their colleagues. "When I'm putting a design package together for a 3D artist, either in-house or offsite, they need actual references they can use instead of wasting time deciphering what's in the output image 'references.' I feel responsibility for the others I work with on my projects--this is a normal part of my job."</p><p>AI implementation has polarized the industry, with some studio heads more than willing to move forward with it. Netflix was even looking for an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-hiring-a-new-genai-gaming-boss-with-a-huge-salary/1100-6535200/"> AI leader for its games department </a>over the fall, and at the beginning of the year, Microsoft invested $80 billion--while still admitting that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">tech will lead to job losses</a>.</p>

            <guid>1388407</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s often said that you don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, but this is precisely what developers Spiders are hoping to do with the most recent overhaul to their prequel to the cult favourite RPG, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/09/greedfall-review/">Greedfall</a>. When it first launched in Early Access late last year the initial response was fairly negative, with many players left confused by its title suggesting a sequel, and many others left underwhelmed by the switch to a tactical turn-based combat system. To their credit, Spiders took this criticism on board and suspended their proposed roadmap in order to address the most pressing issues raised by players. I got the chance to have a hands-on look at the most recent build and can report that it is definitely improving.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 |  2nd Major Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPhs61akKWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, I have to confess that my time with the new build was not the most optimal of experiences, playng remotely and with my connection suffering from frame rate drops and technical issues. I’m obviously looking past these hiccups, but it did mean that I didn’t really get to enjoy some of the later parts of the demo. That being said, I got to see enough to be cautiously optimistic that The Dying World can find an appreciative audience.</p>


<p>The demo build contained three main areas for me to explore, with the opening section and two saves at crucial later parts in the story. The opening section of the game plays out similarly to the original version, with you playing the role as a native Teer Fradee. You get to familiarise yourself with the basic mechanics and immerse yourself in the traditions and beliefs of the tribes before coming into conflict with the colonial forces that are just starting to exploit the land.</p>


<p>This introduction works well as a tutorial and my second time experiencing it highlighted the more streamlined and intuitive combat system. The most important change here is that you can now control your companions in a far more traditional style and queue up attacks to take advantage of their skills and abilities. Each character and class has a distinct set of skills, but it looks like you can diversify or specialise to your heart’s content as you level up.</p>
<p>The setting and atmosphere of The Dying World are one of the real highlights as there is a rich and detailed sense of world-building here. Reams of optional lore and conversation choices are available for those who want to explore as much as they can and the game is not shy in highlighting the contrasts between the tribal traditions and the colonial powers that invade. This contrast comes into direct conflict at the end of the opening section and your player character is thrust into an entirely new environment.</p>

<p>The two later sections showed different areas and recruited companions that really emphasised the game’s focus on cultural conflict and exchange. Each companion seemed to have an interesting set of characteristics and motivation for joining your adventure. Obviously the finer details were not available as I was thrust into the middle of quests and storylines, but it left me intrigued as to how the story would develop. Deeper into the game, combat felt more developed as the characters were appropriately levelled and had more abilities to balance and tactical approaches to take.</p>
<p>The final section in the demo saw me return to the lands in which you grew up and this seems to suggest a clear connection between the conclusion of this game and the world of Greedfall. Unfortunately it was here that my connection to the stream became untenable, but in retrospect this wasn’t a bad thing since it leaves me itching to find out how the story develops.</p>

<p>All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Action games have been in a remarkably strong position for several years now. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">While standout surprises and new hits defined 2024</strong></a>, 2025 felt like the year when many of the genre’s most anticipated projects finally released. It was also the year when legendary franchises finally returned, and established formulas were refined to greater polish.</p>



<p>With so many great action games coming out in the past 12 months, deciding which five should be considered the best wasn't an easy task. However, our top picks have that little something that puts them above every other game, making them a must-play for all fans of the genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-8-7">Ninja Gaiden 4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">8.7</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ninja-Gaiden-4.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 is an excellent return for the series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After having been on hiatus for many years, and with Team NINJA focusing on action RPGs like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh series</strong></a>, it seemed like the Ninja Gaiden franchise was done. However, 2025 proved that this wasn't the case. One of the premier character action series is not only alive, but is also doing very, very well.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is notable not only for bringing back the franchise but for being the result of a collaboration between PlatinumGames and Team NINJA, a dream collaboration for all fans of the genre. And while some of the typical PlatinumGames gameplay mechanics may have diluted what hardcore Ryu Hayabusa fans believe is the real Ninja Gaiden, the game is undoubtedly one of the best action games of the year, and a great title to celebrate the legacy of Tomonobu Itagaki, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/"><strong>who sadly passed away this year.</strong></a></p>



<p>Kai Tatsumoto highlighted well the game's strengths and minor flaws, saying in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Some of PlatinumGames' best character action to date is muddled with a bloated first half and an otherwise uninteresting protagonist. However, as the narrative picks up, this ninja doesn't stop until long after the credits roll.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-8-5">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/">8.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The long wait for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was well worth it</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was announced so long ago</a></strong> that the many years of silence made most fans of the series lose hope that the game would ever be released. The little information that filtered through the grapevine wasn't very promising either, but the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/">eventual return of Retro Studios to the franchise</a></strong> provided that little spark of hope fans needed.</p>



<p>In 2025, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond finally launched, and it met expectations, for the most part. While the story is a little forgettable, and its conclusion a little flat, the game does well everything that makes the series what it is: great level design, engaging combat, and a fantastic atmosphere powered by some of the best visuals seen on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>In his review, Nathan Birch highlighted how these elements come together to offer a compelling experience that is just a little short of excellence: <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond ascends to higher peaks than any previous Prime entry, delivering an impressive sense of scale, breathtaking visuals, and classic Metroid level design at its most immersive and riveting, but a few missteps, including an unengaging story and flat final act, may exclude it from best-of-series conversations. </em></p>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-8-8">Ghost of Yōtei (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">8.8</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ghost-of-Yotei-Key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Ghost of Yōtei enhances the foundation of its predecessor considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei had some rather big shoes to fill this year. Despite not innovating open-world games significantly, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ghost of Tsushima delivered a very engaging experience</strong></a>, with protagonist Jin Sakai's struggles to maintain a shred of samurai honor as he battled the Mongols out of Tsushima being the absolute highlight.</p>



<p>Although the story may not be as engaging for those seeking total historical accuracy, Ghost of Yōtei has refined its predecessor's experience to deliver yet another engaging open-world experience. With improved gameplay expanding both combat and exploration, which moves away from the waymarker-filled approach of its predecessor, spectacular boss fights and striking visuals, the second entry in the series is a game worth experiencing for all fans of the series.</p>



<p>Alessio Palumbo put it well how Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to its predecessor in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-9-0">The First Berserker: Khazan (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">9.0</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The-First-Berserker-Khazan.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The First Berserker: Khazan provides an excellent action game experience with an intricate web of deep mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan made a few head turns when <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-is-a-single-player-action-rpg-based-in-the-dnf-universe/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">it was announced in 2023</strong></a> with its great-looking cel-shaded visuals and charismatic protagonist voiced by Ben Starr (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy XVI</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a>). The prospect of another soulslike in 2025 did not make many too excited about it, but the game developed by Neople surpassed all expectations.</p>



<p>More than a soulslike inspired by FromSoftware games, The First Berserker: Khazan is more akin to an action game developed by Team NINJA, sporting a web of interconnected gameplay mechanics enhanced by a deep loot system that makes the game's high-speed, high-intensity combat even more engaging.</p>



<p>Being a massive fan of Team NINJA, I couldn't help but enjoy The First Berserker: Khazan<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> </strong>a lot, as I highlighted in my review:<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> "With its excellent combat system, complementary mechanics, solid level and enemy design, and engaging story, The First Berserker: Khazan stands out as one of the best action RPGs in recent years.</em>"</p>

<p>Following Hideo Kojima's departure from KONAMI, the Metal Gear series seemed all but done. However, Naked Snake stealthed his way onto modern-day gaming hardware with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake of the beloved third entry in the series.</p>



<p>In an era where remakes usually change much of the games they are based on, with mixed results, KONAMI opted to be as faithful as possible to Hideo Kojima's creation, introducing only <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a slew of gameplay improvements that enhance the experience</strong></a> while offering players the chance to experience the game mostly as it was via the Legacy Style controls. And while something more could have been done to modernize the experience, the developer's choices proved to be the right ones.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">"KONAMI</em><em> </em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">has promised (and delivered) a faithful reproduction of Snake Eater, brought forth into a new console generation without deviating from the title it was based on,"</em> said Kai Tatsumoto in his review</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you could turn the clocks back a week from today, you'd return to a world where no one (at least publicly) was hurling vitriol and hate towards Larian Studios. Everyone was actually quite excited about what the studio had coming, since it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">just announced a new Divinity game</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, which was inarguably one of the biggest announcements of the night.</p>



<p>In the week since that reveal, things have looked quite different from Larian, <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">after an interview with Bloomberg (and several other outlets)</a> with Larian's chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, revealed that Larian Studios was using generative AI technology in its development pipeline for Divinity. That admittance was the reason players criticized and chastised Larian Studios online, and the reason behind the recent stir of discussion of generative AI use in game development.</p>



<p>Vincke has since<a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/"> responded to the backlash with a more formal statement sent to IGN and a less-formal statement posted to his account on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where he exclaimed, "<em>Holy f*** guys,</em> <em>we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI</em>."</p>



<p>Amidst the backlash, former developers who worked at Larian also stood up to comment on what the introduction of GenAI tech did for their experience working at the studio. Game writers and narrative designers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/">also stood up to call out Larian for its poor hiring practices</a>, taking the chance to voice concerns they had held for some time, but refrained from speaking out against for fear of burning future professional opportunities and/or out of respect for the writers still working at Larian.</p>



<p>On the other side, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">Warhorse Studios founder and creative director Daniel Vávra stood up to defend Larian,</a> saying, <em>"</em><em>Larian said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy sh*tstorm</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in what appears to be a final statement on the issue for 2025, Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">took to his personal X (formerly Twitter) account to speak on the matter</a> once again.</p>



<p>"<em>It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation</em>," Vincke began. "<em>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make."</em></p>



<p>"<em>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes."</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Vincke goes on to say that the company will host an AMA event in the new year, giving those with concerns over Larian Studios using generative AI technology the chance to directly ask the studio whatever they want. No doubt that Vincke and he rest of the team at Larian would also hope that the AMA will be where they can explain themselves in a way that quells the vitriol we've seen towards Larian this past week.</p>



<p>For additional context, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who authored the interview with Vincke that started this whole controversy, shared the rough, unedited transcript of his conversation with Vincke. You can read it below.</p>

			<p>[<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">UPDATE - December 19, 10:23 AM</strong>] Though an official confirmation has yet to be provided, it's all but confirmed that more Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge options are being offered to publishers. According to ININ Games, two new, smaller cartridge sizes were announced this week by Nintendo, allowing the publisher to release R-Type Dimensions III on a physical cartridge in Europe.</p>



<p>The downside is that the price of the game will increase by 10€, essentially confirming that some publishers will still prefer using Game-Key Cards to keep costs down.</p>

<p>Original story follows.</p>



<p>[<strong>Original Story</strong>] The launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 earlier this year was accompanied by a radical change for retail releases with the Game-Key cards, which essentially act as a bridge between a retail and a digital release, requiring users to download the full game on their systems to play it using said cards as a sort of access license.</p>



<p>Although the community has been very vocal about their dislike about these releases for justifiable reasons, it seems like Game-Key Cards are here to stay, even with Nintendo attempting to address the issue that made many developers pick this format over a traditional cartdrige.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:porwhxzwut6vszlqjcvnmmag/post/3ma6x4jlgkk2u?ref_src=embed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendeal on Bluesky</strong></a>, the Japanese company is seemingly producing smaller-capacity Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges that would allow more developers to publish proper retail releases of their games.</p>



<p><em>"Due to chip shortages it will take time before we see widespread availability,"</em> Nintendeal added, but this won't be the only reason why it may be more time until more Switch 2 games receive traditional retail releases. <em>"Despite the smaller capacity, these cards will still be expensive due to rising cost of materials,"</em> the user continued, predicting that <em>"Game-Key Cards are not going away."</em></p>



<p>The widespread use of Game-Key Cards for Nintendo Switch 2 games' retail releases is reportedly caused by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/"><strong>physical cartridges coming with a single 64 GB option</strong></a>, which could be too expensive for games coming in smaller sizes and are simply not enough for larger games. </p>



<p>Nintendo's reported decision to produce <span>smaller-capacity cartridges is definitely a step in the right direction, but under the current circumstances, developers may continue to prefer using Game-Key cards to keep costs down and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-are-necessary-to-overcome-cartridge-limitations-ffvii-rebirth-director-says/" target="_blank"><strong>overcome some technical limitations</strong></a>, to the disappointment of every fan of physical game releases</span>.</p>

              <p>A great pair of headphones can change the way you enjoy your favorite media. You can drop a lot of cash on one, but you need to make sure you get a brand that can actually deliver. And you’ll also want to find some that you won’t have to spend an arm and a leg on. We found some great Sony headphones that are not only discounted, but they’re lightweight, cushioned, and built to fit well for long listening sessions. And best of all, you can get them on sale right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6523/">The Sony ULT WEAR Over-Ear Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones are up over at Amazon for just $148, down from their usual price of $250.</a> That’s a discount of $102 and 41% off. Not too shabby for a pair of great headphones from a reputable brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6523/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable headphones perfect for just about any use case</h2>
<p>These headphones are prided on how comfortable they feel. The ear cups offer extremely soft padding so you can wear them for hours without discomfort. If you’re used to earbuds that can sometimes pinch the insides of your ears, that could be a major game-changer. The headband is adjustable too, so you can find a fit that feels right for you. They won’t squeeze your head or ears too tightly either, something that ends up happening with far too many models.</p>
<p>The active noise canceling feature really stands out. It helps reduce background noise from things like traffic, conversations, or airplane engines so you can enjoy cleaner sound. Whether you want to concentrate on a podcast or just enjoy silence during a busy commute, the noise canceling makes a noticeable difference. You also have the option to let in some ambient sound without removing your headphones if you need to be aware of your surroundings.</p>

This pair also recharges quickly, so you don’t have to sit around waiting for long to get them back up to a level that you can listen at.</p>
<p>Overall, the Sony ULT WEAR Over-Ear Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones deliver comfort, quality, and quiet listening in a package that works for many situations. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6523/">And at the current price of $148 on Amazon, down from $250, these headphones are a solid value.</a> They’re a great pick for anyone who needs great sound, a lengthy battery life, and plenty of features that make them a fantastic-sounding pair of headphones. Don’t miss out and snag the deal while you still can.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Discounted by 50% Just One Month After Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-discount-by-50-percent-month/</link>
            <guid>1388383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 did not land well with fans. It emerged amidst a <strong>packed </strong>schedule that included titans like ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6, a fact that might have hindered the game’s success beyond all belief. It doesn’t help that the campaign was seen as lacklustre, and the multiplayer platform isn’t what most fans were clamouring for.</p>



<p>In what seems like a bout of recognition of the poor review scores and lack of hype around the latest Call of Duty title, Best Buy has slashed the price. Right now, for one day only, you can get Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for just <strong>$34.99</strong>, barely five weeks after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-mighty-are-falling">The Mighty Are Falling</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has been on a generational run of bad luck of late. Last year’s Black Ops 6 was pretty good, but the success found at launch tailed off very quickly. It proved to be a good year across the board for activations and the game’s esports scene, but the series floundered hard and continues to do so, with this year’s release.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 just didn’t hit the mark with fans. It fell short in early reviews and managed to dredge up a Metascore of just 67, with a woeful user rating on the same platform of just 1.6. Those are some of the lowest numbers <strong>ever achieved </strong>by a Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>When you align that with the surrounding titles, such as the uber-impressive ARC Raiders and the revitalization of a franchise in Battlefield 6, you paint a clear picture for Activision and Call of Duty.</p>



<p>COD fatigue is alive and well in late 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-already-half-price-at-most-retailers-barely-a-month-after-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> noticed that Best Buy is selling Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for <strong>one day only </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-playstation-5/JJGXPXZ5GX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for just $34.99</a>. That’s a 50% discount, but it’s not too far from what other retailers are selling the game for.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>also </strong>only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-g2a-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$35 <strong>right now </strong>on G2A</a>, and that’s not a one-day sale. It’s one of the cheapest places to buy Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Even Activision recently came out and stressed that, going forward, the Call of Duty sub-franchises will not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-back-to-back-releases/">see back-to-back releases</a>. It failed with Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III, and it has now failed again with Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently spoke about his upcoming horror title, OD, asking fans to watch the trailer numerous times just to get a hint of what it is about. </p>



<p>For those curious, OD is the upcoming game from Hideo Kojima, developed for Xbox Game Studios. The only information we have about the title is that it will be a horror game, along with additional hints revealed in the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knock</a>‘ teaser earlier this year. However, it appears that the teaser contained more clues than players initially realized.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-talks-about-a-big-hint-in-od-s-trailer">Hideo Kojima Talks About a ‘Big Hint’ in OD’s Trailer</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/hideo-kojima-says-watch-the-od-teaser-trailer-100-times-and-youll-get-a-big-hint-about-what-his-new-horror-game-actually-is-i-cant-say-anything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima spoke about rewatching OD’s trailer for hints. Kojima first talks about the game being unlike any other and how, at first glance, OD looks like horror: “but the system it uses isn’t ordinary.” The game director adds that everything is made in a game engine, but it’s a “system like no other”, which is why they built “a completely new medium together with Microsoft.” </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima then went on to say that he can’t reveal more details about OD, or “Mr Phil will be mad at me.” However, if players “watch the teaser trailer many times there’s a hint.” Kojima will not be able to reveal what it is, but if players “watch it 100 times… At the end of the trailer it reads ‘for all players and screamers’. That’s also a big hint.”</p>







<p>In other news, Hideo Kojima isn’t sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether OD will work out</a>. Additionally, the game director has compared AI to smartphones, stating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-compares-ai-to-smartphones-says-theres-no-going-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s no going back</a>.

The bad news? You're going to have to pay a little bit extra for that side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, as the price is going up to €70.</p><p>It's worth noting that those who already preordered the physical Special Edition will not see their price change.</p><p>Publisher Inin Games had <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/regarding-the-physical-format-on-nintendo-switch-2-please-read-carefully" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previously explained</a> that switching the entire run to standard cartridges would have resulted in manufacturing costs increasing by "at least" €15 per game copy, which is why it chose the Game-Key Card option. Inin Games pledged to look for a way to release the full game on a Switch cartridge, <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leading to today's news </a>about the costs increasing, but not as much as it anticipated.</p><p>"There is no better timing," the publisher said in an update. "Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that wasn’t possible before."</p><p>Nintendo has not officially confirmed the existence of smaller-sized cartridges for the Switch 2, <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/2001264866632372548" rel="nofollow ">but it's rumored</a> that developers will soon be able to choose between 16GB and 32GB cartridges, instead of the expensive 64GB cartridge.</p><p>Game-Key Cards function as physical authentication keys for the Switch 2, as you'll still need to download the full game to the console. Storage capacity is limited, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">microSD Express cards can be expensive</a>, which is one of the reasons why the system has been criticized. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/">While they can be resold and aren’t console-locked</a>, critics have argued that they do pose potential issues for long-term games preservation.</p><p>Game developers have spoken in defense of Game-Key Cards, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-key-cards-may-be-controversial-but-ubisoft-defends-them-for-star-wars-outlaws/1100-6534502/">with one Ubisoft dev explaining</a> that technical limitations made it necessary to release Star Wars Outlaws in this format.

<p>We thought developers and publishers would be winding down right before the holidays, but <a href="https://x.com/PATAPON__REPLAY/status/2001957426724282697">Bandai Namco has dropped</a> a little teaser for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, the collection of the two classic PSP games, for some brand new content on <strong>22nd December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the teaser gives us nothing but a cute little animation, before capping it off with the news. The update will give us a brand new game mode, with more details to come, giving us the perfect opportunity to dive back in next week.</p>
<p>And hey, if you haven't picked up Patapon 1+2 Replay yet, in the UK it's currently on sale for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/PATAPON-1-2-REPLAY-2804105.html"><strong>$19.99 on the eShop</strong></a> (until 31st December).</p>
<p>Releasing back in July of this year, Patapon 1+2 Replay bundles together two iconic PSP rhythm action games where you have to command an army of Patapons by beating drums. The key is timing each of your commands to the beat and knowing when it's best to Don or Pata. If you know, you know.</p>
<p>We had a pleasant time with the Switch version of the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/patapon-1plus2-replay">scoring it a 7/10</a>: it's "a real blast from the past and more than proves why this series was such a hit for Sony."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Honda Mobility has announced that Afeela will become the world’s first vehicle to introduce PS Remote Play, and it will arrive in California next year. </p>



<p>Yes, cars are being integrated with gaming capabilities over time. We already saw that Xbox Cloud Gaming is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/your-car-can-soon-be-an-xbox-thanks-to-lg-and-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to select internet-connected vehicles</a> thanks to a new partnership with LG. Now, Sony Honda Mobility’s first car is ready to arrive with PS Remote Play next year. </p>







<h2 id="h-remotely-use-your-ps5-or-ps4-through-afeela-s-infotainment-system">Remotely Use Your PS5 or PS4 through Afeela’s Infotainment System </h2>



<p>Announced in a new <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Afeela will begin deliveries in California in 2026, becoming the first vehicle with PS Remote Play, allowing users to play their PS5 and PS4 games through the car’s infotainment system. The games are not like cloud gaming; instead, they let players play remotely from their console via the vehicle’s integrated display and premium audio system. Check out what the Representative Director, President, and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc., Izumi Kawanishi, had to say: </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies AFEELA’s vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one. Through this integration, we are elevating the customer’s entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The blog post also reveals that players will need a broadband connection of at least 5 Mbps, and a stable connection of at least 15 Mbps is recommended for a smooth PS Remote Play experience. Additionally, players will require a PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4 to access Remote Play. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima has made new comments about AI, stating there’s no point in saying things like ‘We shouldn’t use AI’ or ‘AI is useless.’</p>



<p>&nbsp;AI in the gaming industry has been a subject of contention since the community started learning about the new tech. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larian Game Studios has been under fire</a> for using AI. Now, a highly regarded game director has shared his thoughts on it, revealing there’s no running away from it. </p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-talks-about-embracing-ai-as-there-is-no-going-back">Hideo Kojima Talks About Embracing AI, As There is No Going Back</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/metal-gear-solid-and-death-stranding-creator-hideo-kojima-thinks-we-cant-go-back-to-a-world-without-ai-smartphones-were-the-same/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima shared his thoughts about AI. Kojima first noted that smartphones were also ‘slated’ by everyone when they first came out, and now we live in a world where “there are so many people who can’t live without their smartphones.” Kojima added that AI is similar to that, and it’s essential “to use technology in a way that will make us happy.”</p>



<p>Kojima also added that there is no point in saying things like ‘We shouldn’t use AI’ or ‘AI is useless.’ There is no going back, and smartphones were the same. Kojima also spoke about the possibility of AI changing how we communicate, helping people who aren’t the best at face-to-face interactions. In the same vein, Kojima also talked about how AI could make humans spoiled, so there should be measures to ”&nbsp;reduce the AI’s involvement, or have days where we don’t use it.”</p>







<p>In other news, Kojima had joined the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zootopia 2 cast</a> just days before the release. Additionally, the director <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-matrix-game-konami-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could have made a Matrix game</a>, but Konami shut it down.

                <p>Gaming on the go has been popular among players for decades, and now Sony and Honda are teaming up to bring the power of PlayStation 5 to the road. The two companies formed a joint venture, Sony Honda Mobility, in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. Their first car, the Afeela 1, will be released next year and it will include the capability of playing PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 games.</p><p>However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work. That means Afeela 1 owners will also need to have either a PS5 or a PS4 at their homes in order to connect with the systems to play games. Sony notes that this use of Remote Play is separate from streaming PS Plus games from the cloud.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163"></a><figcaption>The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg"></figure><p>This setup includes integrated display and premium audio systems for passengers. It's unclear if the cars come with a PlayStation controller or if players have to bring their own from home.</p><p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Sony Honda Mobility COO Izumi Kawanishi <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in a statement</a>. "Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p><p>Afeela 1 will be available in California first before it goes nationwide. But aside from a 2026 release window, it doesn't currently have an on-sale date.</p>

                <p>Overwatch developer Blizzard has teased that 2026 will be the year when the studio's "boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>"We're eager to take creative steps that will allow the game to lean further into storytelling and character development, and we can't wait to share these new experiences with our community," Blizzard said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "There's a real sense of momentum and optimism within the development team, and we believe 2026 will be a year where our boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>Blizzard did not share any further details, but 2026 marks the 10th anniversary of Overwatch, and the studio presumably has some anniversary plans in store for the milestone.</p><p>Also in the post, Blizzard ran through some reflections of the past year, saying 2025 "brought out the best in the Overwatch team."</p><p>"Inspired by the evolving landscape of the industry, we embraced the opportunity to take bold risks and focused on making impactful changes rather than playing it safe," the developer said. "The response from our community has been amazing, and we feel our relationship with our players is stronger than ever."</p><p>Blizzard also called out how Overwatch 2 relaunching in China was a "standout moment" for the game in 2025. "Despite the absence, the community’s passion remained strong, with fans organizing offline events, creating art, and supporting esports. This enduring passion for the Overwatch universe highlighted how the game brings people together and means so much beyond just gameplay, reinforcing our excitement for the future," the developer said.</p><p>2026 marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and studio president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/" data-ref-id="1100-6537061">Johanna Faries said it will be the "biggest year yet" for the company.</a> The company is bringing back BlizzCon in September 2026 to share a number of "major" announcements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Photo by Colton "Anarche99" Childrey via UVW-CWA</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last week </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://uvw-cwa.org/">United Videogame Workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (UVW-CWA) made quite the splash with a showy protest at the 2025 Game Awards in downtown Los Angeles. Armed with signs, fake tombstones, and leaflets, they briefly turned the celebration into a funeral for the video game industry. The Grim Reaper made an appearance. A digital billboard on the back of a cube truck drove up and down Figueroa St. And even an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crew member stopped by to grieve all those lost.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't worry, this wasn't a case of critical misdiagnosis. Speaking to Game Developer as the sun went down and the ceremony was about to begin, the protest organizers explained they put on the show to spotlight the thousands of workers laid off by studios large and small in 2025, and to cast a spotlight on the CEOs and executives who ordered the cuts, many of whom were at the show. (I think I saw Matt Booty sprint by while I conducted my interview).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The gathering was an unconventional twist on the many protests staged outside the awards over the last few years. With no ongoing strike or recent major news event to peg the protest to, the group brainstormed a creative way to get their message across—and their process and motivation shone a light on where game industry unionization may be headed in 2026 and beyond.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-the-trends-that-made-and-plagued-this-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">The 10 game industry trends that made (and plagued) this year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A dirge for executives and a party for players">A dirge for executives and a party for players</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The UVW protestors set out that evening to creatively catch the eye of two groups: attending executives and senior developers, along with players footing hundreds of dollars to attend the awards in-person. "It's important to remember that we are the reason why they have a show," said UVW secretary Kaitlin "KB" Bonfiglio. They sported "wanted" posters with the faces of Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav, EA CEO Andrew Wilson, and Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, along with their salaries presented against what the average game developer makes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Planning for the spectacle began a few months ago and emerged out of a voting process by UVW members—everything from the budget to the strategy came about through worker consensus. Despite the dour theming, UVW treasurer Sherveen Uduwana said the goal was not only to "acknowledge the harm" but also to "build excitement" for what can be done through unionizing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Silly protests with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/opinion/no-kings-protest-chicago-tactical-frivolity.html">costumed characters have been quite mainstream in 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with commentators like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/802315/portland-no-kings-october-ice-protests-frog-antifa">Sarah Jeong</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> observing that they helped turn protests like the No Kings Rallies into joyful affairs that felt more like Disneyland than hellish warzones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most major industry figures had easier ways in and out of the Peacock theater (LA Live security only let them approach the small ice rink near the theater's edge after attempting to keep them off the property), so it's unlikely the three men would have seen their own faces. But, in a bit of luck, the increased number of non-professionals attending the show worked out in UVW's favor. As the line to enter the venue snaked around the corner, many got to speak with union organizers face-to-face.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fifa-and-netflix-partner-for-a-new-football-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">FIFA and Netflix partner for a new soccer game</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This ties into what players and the gaming audience might be interested in," commented Uduwana. "A lot of that overlaps with what they care about [like] rushed and buggy launches, games that are suddenly canceled without warning, launches that make it clear these companies are just trying to take your money and don't care about the quality of the product."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those negative events are, according to the group, driven by executives pursuing profits at the expense of workers. "We want to be able to do our jobs at a high level of capability. We want the bosses to get out of the way and let us do those jobs. Allowing us to get our organizing wins is going to make higher quality, more exciting, and more ambitious games possible."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A bill of rights, firing protections, and agency over the way games are made">A bill of rights, firing protections, and agency over the way games are made</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/tencent-and-sony-settle-horizon-cloning-lawsuit" target="_self" data-discover="true">Tencent and Sony reach 'confidential settlement' on Horizon cloning lawsuit</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going into 2026, the Uduwana said the organization is preparing a "bill of rights" for game workers that workers can use to identify immediate terms to raise in unionization drives. "That is basically us talking to workers this whole year, understanding what the high-priority asks are going to be, and putting together...essentially an organizing floor that we can use for future campaigns."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Workers looking for additional demands from their employers can build off of these terms for what their studio specifically needs. For instance, if developers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development">wanted some ability to participate in high-level decisions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about a game's direction or production process, they could add that to their individual negotiation terms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But one key line item in the bill of rights developers will want to be aware of is expanded "Just Cause" rights in worker contracts. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nelp.org/explore-the-issues/worker-power/just-cause/">Just Cause</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> terms are meant to protect against a wide range of unfair firings, but the union representatives discussed how developers need special terms for disciplinary action over what's posted on social media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2025 several game industry workers were fired for posts made in the wake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-fires-ghost-of-yotei-artist-after-posts-joking-about-charlie-kirk-killing">the murder of Charlie Kirk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, sometimes following backlash from right-wing agitators on X. Strongly-worded terms about what action employers may take for what employees post on their personal social media accounts can shield workers from harassment campaigns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That has been one of the concerns we've had since the founding of UVW," said UVW vice president "Audrey" (who requested to go by their first name) in regards to online harassment of developers. "That was one of the topics brought up in our founding documents."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Uduwana invited workers who want a say in the bill of rights to reach out to the union, saying the organization's success is representative of how workers in the industry come together to make games. "United Videogame Workers is a resource for [developers]—especially younger game developers—coming into the industry to see we are capable of solving complex problems with large groups of workers coming together and democratically solving things."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> fans are concerned Jonathan Bailey, this year's People's Sexiest Man Alive, may have been recast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s MMORPG - or at least has recorded under unfavourable conditions.</p>
<p>Bailey has voiced fan-favourite cat boy G'raha Tia since the Stormblood expansion, released in 2017. But this was before he starred in the likes of Bridgerton, Wicked, and Jurassic World Rebirth, from which his fame has risen considerably.</p>
<p>This week, the 7.4 update was released for Final Fantasy 14, bringing an extension to the story and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-morello-final-fantasy-14-interview-everything-burns">new song from Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello</a>. Yet fans have noticed G'raha Tia's voice sounds a little off.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1pnzr6b/jonathan_bailey_in_74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit thread posits</a> either the character is no longer voiced by Bailey, or he's been recording away from the studio - likely between other major projects he's worked on.</p>
<p>"It also feels like they're minimising his speaking - he had a total of two lines in the first two quests, and at one point just emoted a thumbs up," the post reads. "He felt conspicuously silent for G'raha, someone who is way too sentimental to barely say anything at a goodbye."</p>
<p>The poster later added they think it is still Bailey, but a combination of hoarse throat and a subpar microphone "adds some gruffness to his voice".</p>
<p>Fans have also been sharing comparison videos on social media, to highlight the differences in the voice work.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">So I did a quick little comparison between 7.0 and 7.4 G'raha Tia, it seems that he HAS NOT been recast, I just think he's recording his lines from his phone or a subpar mic setup, the EQ is sorta way more treble-y, when his voice is usually bassy with the studio mics they use. <a href="https://t.co/AYYZYadgWU">pic.twitter.com/AYYZYadgWU</a></p>— Josefumi 🎙️ (@JosefumiVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/JosefumiVO/status/2000983922734457059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>In an interview with BAFTA last year, Bailey recognised Final Fantasy 14 alongside his other voice work, and how important the character is to the fanbase.</p>
<p>"I'm aware of how important this character is to so many people," he said. "I was so determined to not step away from this character, that when I was doing Company [in the West End in 2018] I had to record this in the day for about a week doing eight shows a night and my tongue inflamed. So I think, any die-hard fans out there, there's a few hours of playing where I sound a bit lispy, that's because of that. So I apologise."</p>

<p>As such, fans hope he is still working on the game, despite the apparent changes in quality.</p>
<p>That said, a representative for Bailey told <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-jonathan-bailey-graha-tia-voice-recast-2000654279">Kotaku</a> he "won't be commenting or participating in any interviews regarding Final Fantasy 14" at this time. Square Enix has not responded to Eurogamer's request for comment.</p>
<p>What is clear is the size of the role of G'raha Tia has certainly reduced since the highs of Shadowbringers, though whether that's due to Bailey or simply storytelling is unknown. Indeed, one criticism of latest expansion Dawntrail is that multiple popular characters don't receive enough screen time.</p>
<p>"With regards to the Scions playing a more active role only later on in the story, truth be told this is something I intentionally wanted to try out," director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Naoki Yoshida told me last year</a>.</p>
<p>"I do understand there are people who always want the Scions to be at the centre of the story, but at the same time there are people who are also requesting something new instead. So it was a conscious effort on my part to experiment and see how the balance would play out."</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, then, whether G'raha Tia or other popular characters could be written out of the game in future. No doubt we'll get answers at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-dates-announced-so-when-is-the-next-expansion-due">Fan Fest events next year</a>.</p>
