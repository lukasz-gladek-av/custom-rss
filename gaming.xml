		<p>Playtonic Games has announced that Yooka-Replaylee is Steam Deck verified, so there is now another option to take the game while you are on the move. There is a demo available on Steam for Yooka-Replayee so you can test it out before the game’s full release on October 9th. In a statement on Steam, Playtonic said, <em>“Howdy folks! With only a week to go until Yooka-Replaylee launches, today we’ve gotten the shiny green checkmark from Valve to tell us and you that the game is Steam Deck Verified!<wbr>You can officially enjoy this 3D platforming epic at home or on the go! See you next week”</em><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1As5O96S4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a>&nbsp;to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

<p>Yooka-Replayee launches on October 9th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. A physical edition will launch on December 18th, and include a collectible game map poster, and an exclusive character sticker pack. The Switch 2 version will have a physical cartridge.</p>

            <p>Ok, so if you're one of those high-vis types who can be driven up the wall by health and safety code violations, you might want to look away. Crashout Crew, a co-op chaos-generator all about forklifts, has been revealed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> co-developers Aggro Crab, with sights set on a 2026 release preceded by a Steam demo this month.</p>
<p>I told you to look away, high-vis types! Why are you already running to management with a written demand that all heavy machinery can't be drifted around at top speed and slammed into boxes?</p>

<p>Anyway, forget about them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583210/Crashout_Crew/">Crashout Crew</a> looks like a great laugh. You can up to four mates are strapped into forklifts that can boost and drift, with the mission of grabbing various good strewn around a warehouse, and pushing a big red button to jet them off on the right conveyor belts. Failure to do so results in quotas not being hit, and presumably a telling off. As you progress, you can add extra quirks or wrinkles to the action via safety violations, much like in real life.</p><p>"After the recent cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/going-under">Going Under</a> 2, the studio decided to explore the whimsy multiplayer side of game development," Aggro Crab wrote of how it came to be. "While some of Aggro Crab developed PEAK with Landfall, the rest of the studio locked in to produce Crashout Crew!"</p>
<p>A full release in 2026 is being aimed for, but ahead of that Crashout Crew'll be getting a demo on October 13th, as part of the upcoming Steam Next Fest. You'll be able to give the first three levels a go and see if the chaos offered is up to snuff.</p>
<p>Aggro Crab have also made clear that Peak, the co-opper based around going for hikes up big hills developed by themselves and Landfall Games, will still be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-wants-you-to-waste-your-time-on-silly-things-like-basketball-and-chess-in-its-latest-climbing-averse-update">getting updates</a>. The studio plan to dual wield goofy creations in their quest to ensure that every being on Earth must have at least one chuckle with their colleagues while playing a video game.</p>
<p>It's a noble cause, and also a formula that's yielded Peak a considerable amount of success so far. So, let's see if doubling down will rocket Aggro Crab's forklift to even greater heights.</p>

            <p>The forthcoming remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> will be "enjoyable in a new and different way", according to P Studio director Kazuhisa Wada.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/933/G093322/20250926041/">4Gamer</a> at this year's Tokyo Game Show (translated by <a href="https://personacentral.com/p3r-tgs-2025-interview/">Persona Central</a>), Wada discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> alongside its director Shigeo Komori, but also touched on the highly-anticipated Persona 4 Revival.</p>
<p>"Persona 4 already packed a ton of content in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4-golden">Persona 4 Golden</a>, so when it comes to creating the next 'R', it's not just about adding more - we have to create an experience that's enjoyable in a new and different way," said Wada. "And this includes the sheer volume of content, so to be honest, it's a tough challenge. But it's shaping up nicely!"</p>

<p>As with every mainline Persona game, Atlus released a revised Golden version of Persona 4 a couple of years after the original, which added new social links, new scenes, new difficulty levels, and other bonus content.</p>
<p>It's unclear if this version will form the basis of the remake, or if Atlus has gone back to the original release. And just how different will it be?</p>
<p>Indeed, Atlus had a job on its hands with Persona 3 Reload. The original version of P3 was later revised as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a> FES that added a new epilogue, while Persona 3 Portable added a female protagonist option.</p>
<p>When Persona 3 Reload was released last year, it took inspiration from the more modern Persona 5 Royal, but as it lacked all options from previous versions, for some fans it still didn't offer the complete experience.</p>
<p>Still, in an interview with Denfaminicogamer (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/persona-3-reload-devs-havent-changed-their-minds-about-adding-portables-female-protagonist-we-have-a-mission-to-tackle-new-things/">Automaton</a>), Wada stood by the decision not to add the female protagonist to Persona 3 Reload, stating the cost and time needed would've been several times the resources that went into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-gets-the-answer-after-all">Episode Aigis DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Persona 4 Golden is thoroughly beloved by series fans, so with the remake Atlus must be careful to offer something new while still appeasing its harshest critics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumoured-persona-4-remake-officially-revealed">Persona 4 Revival was finally officially revealed at this year's Xbox Games Showcase</a> in June, following multiple leaks and teases.</p>
<p>"We are currently working on this project with all our passion and love," said Wada at the time. "We are confident that this will be a fresh and surprising product for both newcomers and long-time fans and we look forward to sharing it with you all."</p>

		<p>There’s tons of big games arriving a moment to appeal to all sorts of gamers, whether it’s Ghost of Yotei’s launch for PlayStation fans this week, picking up on the excellent Hades 2 from last week, celebrating Mario’s 40th with the Galaxy and Galaxy 2 remaster, or hopping into shooty bang bang stuff with the Black Ops 7 beta, just ahead of next week’s Battlefield 6 launch.</p>
<p>It’s quite the time, and I’ve been playing some of these headline-grabbing games this past week!</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> jumped between two strikingly different games, with his review of the sportball-filled EA Sports FC 26 and the toon-filled action RPG Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny. Another huge shift comes with Jim’s gaming, who wrapped up a review of UBOAT, which put him in command of a German submarine during WW2 –&nbsp;“It’s a fascinating sim though one that comes with a steep learning curve, requiring patience and attention to detail.” He’s now moving on to Ghost of Yotei and the Black Ops 7 beta for this weekend’s gaming action.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been hoovering up slime poops otherwise known as “plorts”, and then selling them for cold hard cash and upgrades in Slime Rancher 2. She’s also been “finding every opportunity to launch myself across the screen”, while playing Absolum for review alongside <strong>Ade</strong>. Her other half has added Marvel Rivals and Hades 2 alongside that, the latter of which he reckons is both bigger and better than the original.</p>


<p><strong>Jason</strong> thoroughly enjoyed his time reviewing Digimon Story Time Stranger –&nbsp;why did they ditch the colon for the middle of that game name? I don’t know –&nbsp;and has also falledn back into Vampire Survivors to go along with more lootering and shootering in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It was a big bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics this past week for <strong>Nic</strong>, but he has also been jumping into a different tactical game for review, and is looking forward to telling everyone a bit more. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got a few hours in with Robocop: Rogue City Unfinished Business and finds it still to be both very enjoyable and old fashioned. “You don’t need to think too much,” he said, “it’s just reactions and exploding heads, and sometimes that’s all you need.”</p>

<p>While he continues his recovery, <strong>Steve</strong> has been building up his gaming stamina with a little bit of Silent Hill f, “which is brilliantly atmospheric”. He also finished Breath of Fire II and made a start on III, which is tickling the nostalgia bits of his brain.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Dom</strong> returned to the UK and has been playing a bunch of Final Fantasy Tactics for himself, mixing in some NBA 2K26 and Madden 26, and making a start on Hades 2!</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you been playing?</em></p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake will finally launch on Xbox Series S and X and Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on January 22, 2026</a>. These versions of the game will include, from day one, a new feature called Streamlined Progression that essentially lets players enjoy the narrative without having to worry about difficulty, thanks to the ability to keep health and/or mana constantly full, to max out damage dealt, etc. </p>



<p>Streamlined Progression (which will also be added to the existing PC and PlayStation 5 versions of Final Fantasy VII Remake with an update) was recently discussed once again by Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-boosts-and-sped-up-cutscenes-can-reduce-playtime-to-under-10-hours-director-hamaguchi-tells-us-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with AUTOMATON Japan</a>. Hamaguchi claimed that players should have the choice in how they wish to interact with game content.</p>



<p><em>The biggest reason was that we were finally able to announce the FFVII Remake trilogy’s multiplatform expansion. That timing was what really led to the decision to include Streamlined Progression. Personally, I like to try many different games just to keep myself up to date, but I don’t really have the time, so I only get so far. Sometimes it makes me wish I had access to debug functions so I could cover more.</em></p>



<p><em>Naturally, when we announce features like these, we get responses like ‘This is sacrilegious!’ Even within the dev team, there are people who feel that way. But unless someone takes the initiative, it doesn’t happen. I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content. That’s why I pushed for it.</em></p>



<p>Hamaguchi added that Square Enix wouldn't add such a feature at launch for the third installment of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. In this context, though, with the game out for more than five years, they felt like it was an option they could provide. With Streamlined Progression, the game should be much quicker to complete: the developers estimate around 10 hours or even less for a playthrough, whereas a standard Final Fantasy VII Remake playthrough lasts between 40 and 50 hours.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-offline-mode-officially-canceled-starbreeze-announces.1315528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has announced it's canceling one of the heist shooter's most-requested features, namely the ability to play the game without an online connection.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-celebrates-2nd-anniversary-by-canceling-promised-offline-mode.1314967/#post-145945057" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user Santar</a>, Starbreeze revealed the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode during a second-anniversary livestream yesterday. The studio claims that the offline mode is "not feasible" for the "direction" in which it's heading with&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>.</p>

<p>The announcement that you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>offline comes after Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-project-baxter-canceled-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced a major company policy shift</a> yesterday, resulting in the cancellation of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game</a> and a pivot towards the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise as the studio's primary focus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled-lasers.jpg?itok=sr0k3jYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled-lasers.jpg?itok=yTqIpvvI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode has officially been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>That shift will also seemingly mean more games in the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise, as well as a sharper focus on the heist genre in general, so we may be about to see a slew of new&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>spinoffs and sequels in the future.</p>

<p>Of course, that's assuming that Starbreeze can turn&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s fortunes around. The game has had a pretty hard time of things since launching back in 2023; just a few months after its launch, Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">admitted it was operating at "significantly lower levels"</a> than the studio was hoping for.</p>

<p>Following that, in March 2024, then-CEO&nbsp;Tobias Sjögren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a>, and in September last year, game director&nbsp;Miodrag Kovačević followed suit, although he's still working on&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em> as a designer.</p>

<p>Starbreeze's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">financial results in February this year</a> showed that sales dropped significantly when compared to the same period a year prior, but the studio still called the year as a whole "successful".</p>




<p>The dropping of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode also comes just a few days after Starbreeze <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/payday-2-dev-adds-dlc-subscription-to-its-12-year-old-game-as-a-cost-effective-alternative-after-price-hike-admits-we-messed-up-as-players-torch-its-steam-reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ran into controversy</a> following the introduction of a subscription model for predecessor&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s DLC, which itself followed on from a price hike for the premium one-off purchase for said DLC.</p>

<p>Starbreeze has insisted that the timing of the subscription service's introduction was coincidental, but whether that's the case or not, I'd imagine that what the studio needs now is quick and easy wins, not to upset its fanbase further. We'll see whether it can achieve that in the coming months, I suppose.</p>

The warning has come with just days to act, and arrives on the eve of the game's 10th anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On Sunday, October 5, 2025, Rock Band 4 turns 10," reads the team's statement. "What a ride it's been."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this milestone comes one big change: the original licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring. Because of that, Rock Band 4 will be removed from the PlayStation and Xbox digital stores. If you already own the game, nothing changes — you'll keep full access and still be able to download the game and songs to any new, compatible devices. The same applies to Downloadable Content (DLC): songs will come down as they hit the 10-year mark, but anything you've purchased will remain in your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're so grateful for the passion this community has shown. From the team, it's been a special experience to serve you with Rivals challenges, a super deep DLC library and a best in class band sim. If you've been meaning to grab a few last songs, now's the time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of Sunday, Rock Band 4 and the Rock Band 4 DLC songs that were specifically released on its launch day will no longer be available to purchase. It has been clarified on Discord that DLC tracks from <em>prior </em>Rock Band games (released before Rock Band 4) are not being delisted "yet", but the team "will be figuring those out over the coming months."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rock Band's unique approach to DLC has resulted in the ability for owners to carry their libraries of songs (plus exports of the tracklists of past Rock Band games) across three generations of console hardware. The approach has seen thousands of pieces of bespoke DLC released for the series since 2007, almost all of which can be played within Rock Band 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last DLC of the Rock Band 4 era was released in January 2024, after eight years of weekly content. The news that the axe is now looming for all Rock Band content, however, marks a sad moment in the history of the 18-year-old series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> director Takayuki Nakayama has shared his surprise at Capcom's decision to charge for the game's upcoming esports tournament finals and has apologised "for any concern this may have caused".</p>
<p>At last week's Tokyo Game Show, Capcom revealed the finals for its Tokyo-based Capcom Cup and Street Fighter League 2025 World Championship would be viewable globally online only via a pay-per-view model, when usually fans can watch for free across YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>The finals for both the Capcom Cup 12 Finals and SFL World Championship will cost ¥4,000 each (around £20), or a bundle of both is available for ¥6,000 (around £30). The earlier qualifying rounds remain free.</p>

<p>The prices are comparable to being in the venue in-person, though prices range from ¥2,000 (£10) to ¥20,000 (£100) for SSS box seats.</p>
<p>The decision has been met by considerable backlash, but now the game's director has responded on social media.</p>
<p>A fan asked Nakayama if it was strange that Capcom's esports division and the Street Fighter 6 development team seem so disconnected.</p>
<p>"It may sound strange, but it's true," he said. "Revenue targets and assigned tasks differ fundamentally by department."</p>
<p>He continued: "Even the development team was surprised by this announcement (At least Matsumoto and I were shocked at the venue). That said, since this matter occurred within the same company, we are currently discussing it. We apologise for any concern this may have caused."</p> <div>

            <p>Even the most fervent Super Earth bootlicker wouldn’t deny that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has been suffering some technical problems, especially after the performance-sapping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">Into the Unjust update</a>. Developers Arrowhead say a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-update-targeting-key-performance-issues-arrives-next-month-arrowhead-reckon-itll-be-a-noticeable-improvement">patch is coming,</a> and in the meantime, have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">shared the first</a> in a series of techy blog posts burrowing into the engineering side of how the co-op bugshooter comes together. Entry number one doesn’t deal with framerates, though: instead it explains the game’s longer-running issue with its increasingly gargantuan, 150GB-ish install size.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Earlier this year, players had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mw3qcx/why_the_game_is_130_gb_install/">already discovered</a> the most immediate cause of Helldivers 2’s swelling: its installation is stuffed with duplicate files, spanning weapon models to tree and rock textures. This had not only ballooned the install size over time, as successive updates added more and more assets, but left PC players with the unanswered question of <em>why</em> their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSDs</a> were filled with photocopied rocket launchers. Especially as the PS5 and Xbox versions, weighing in around a third of the size, exhibited no such duplication.</p>
<p>As the post (credited to deputy technical director Brendan Armstrong) now explains, including multiple file copies was Arrowhead’s solution to the slow loading times of creaking old hard drives. A lingering inconvenience to some PCs, but not the exclusively SSD-equipped consoles.</p>
<p>"The main issue with a mechanical HDD is seek time," Armstrong writes. "An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data. The time it takes for this arm to "seek" or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck.</p><p>"Imagine a large game level with various objects – trees, rocks, buildings, props. If the data for these objects is scattered all over the hard drive, the read head has to physically jump around the disk, which adds a lot of time to the loading process."</p>
<p>I know the feeling – I recently flooded my flat with spare scissors, having tired of never remembering where I put our sole original pair. Hard drives might have more reliable memories than me but when it comes to Helldivers 2, Arrowhead evidently don’t consider the time they would spend searching for individual, non-duplicate files to constitute an acceptable loading speed.</p>
<p>The post also considers alternate solutions, including removing or repacking certain duplicates – which would make HDD loading slower, but potentially cut the file size – or split off 4K textures as an optional download, something Armstrong says is not "natively" supported by the game’s engine but could still be made possible.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to mutter "Or everyone could just be sensible and get an SSD." I’d probably be muttering it myself, had almost every facet of gaming PC building and ownership not become so miserably expensive in the past few years, in turn making cheap mech drives genuinely harder to upgrade from on tight budgets. Hopefully Arrowhead can find a fix that works for everyone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake is supposedly in co-development with a Virtuos game development studio, according to new rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, Rebs Gaming, a source who has been consistently reliable with past Halo series rumors, revealed that <a href="https://abstraction.games/">Abstraction</a>, a Virtuos game development studio, is the team that's working on the remake together with Halo Studios.<a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/02/rumor-halo-ce-remake-co-devleoped-by-a-virtuous-studio/"> XboxEra</a> later corroborated the news, adding that the series' developer is the lead development studio of the project, so this isn't an external project.</p>



<p>In addition, Rebs Gaming also reiterated that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-ue5-blam-engine-gameplay-tweaks/">Halo Combat Evolved remake will use both Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay</a>, highlighting again how the remake will combine a faithful gameplay recreation with some gameplay additions and modern visuals.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Rebs Gaming proved to be extremely reliable in the past, we have to take everything they have revealed about the Halo Combat Evolved remake with a massive grain of salt. However, considering Virtuos proved to be specializing in this hybrid-engine development this year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, it wouldn't be surprising for the developer to be attached to this project as well.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it won't take long to learn if the Halo Combat Evolved remake will be part of the series' future. Halo Studios will talk about what's next for their franchise during the<a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-sept"> Halo World Championship later this month</a>, on October 24.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has earned its reputation for being fiercely protective of its IP, including the Mario characters and the Pokémon universe. However, OpenAI's newly released Sora 2 has included so many Nintendo characters that it almost seems like it's inviting a legal response from the Japanese gaming publisher.

It's not clear if a similar effort was made to reach out to Nintendo, but the sheer volume of Pokémon and Mario-inspired Sora 2 content suggests that the AI model was heavily trained on Nintendo's IP.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/GeorgeCrudo/status/1973531769535340950?" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">i got into sora 2 and the only conclusion I can draw is openai is trying to get sued. this is like 99% of what it shows you immediately upon entering the app <a href="https://t.co/BkAXqchK2T" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/BkAXqchK2T</a></p>  — George Crudo (@GeorgeCrudo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeCrudo/status/1973531769535340950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Nintendo's properties aren't the only ones that appear to have been fed into Sora 2.

            <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-starts-2nd-october">the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta began in earnest</a>, welcoming in untold thousands of eager players to try the game out before its proper launch on the 14th November. However, a number of cheaters also seemed to let themselves in and get up to no good.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 beta requires both TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled on your PC to play, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update#TPM">which Treyarch stated</a> was needed to "create a more secure environment that catches more cheating."</p>
<p>Within hours of the beta starting, however, clips started appearing on social media showing off wall hacks and aim bots working in the beta. Take the below video posted to X, which shows the same old cheats in action.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Now, this account was later banned manually <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1973874240253489434">as confirmed by Treyarch on X</a>, but why are old cheats working on a new game so soon after it was in the player's hands? Well, while the Black Ops 7 Beta requires additional kernel-level access to your computer, the updated version of Activision's proprietary Ricochet Anti-Cheat has not yet come to the game. Instead, players will have to wait until the full launch to get additional cheat protection.</p><p>This is but the latest blow in the ongoing fight between FPS game developers and cheat manufacturers. A continuous back-and-forth where cheats run amok until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">an updated anti-cheat solution bans a vast selection of these cheaters</a>. Then, after a little while, the cheaters learn how the anti-cheat works and it circles round and round. This particular cycle has been a fixture of the Call of Duty series for years.</p>
<p>There are other options available to players who want to curb cheating. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">Activision announced earlier this year that it'll allow console players to turn off crossplay to avoid cheating</a>, admitting the majority of cheaters are playing on PC.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this year's current Call of Duty competitor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has also suffered at the hands of cheaters during its open beta, with<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls"> EA's anti-cheat shutting down over 300,000 cheaters during its run</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s first round of vault hunter balancing tweaks has arrived, with Gearbox having waited until they'd had a chance to try getting some of the looter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4s-latest-update-aims-to-deliver-more-performance-fixes-ends-up-causing-more-stuttering-for-some">technical gremlins under control</a> and observed the state of play balance-wise before whipping out the ol' nerf/buff cannon.
</p>
<p>That approach has meant some arguably overpowered early builds haven't been coded out of existence as quickly as players might have imagined, with the developers seeming keen to avoid knee-jerk reactions when it comes to vault hunter changes in particular. I assume the fact they've had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-has-found-his-soulmate-an-edgy-cowboy-robot-named-after-money-thats-in-borderlands-4s-first-dlc">a DLC robo-cowboy</a> to help keep post-happy exec Randy Pitchford occupied has probably helped maintain that lack of sudden and potentially ill-fated moves.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"For today's update, we wanted to focus on creating greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills," the studio wrote in <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">the notes for this first significant balance patch</a>. "Amon in particular gets a host of adjustments to bring him closer in line with the general power level of the other Vault Hunters. Vex's summons and Rafa's melee power see adjustment to make those builds more viable in the late endgame. Finally, Harlowe has a couple tweaks to make sure Stasis is getting value for players."</p>
<p>As you might have gleaned from that, a glance through the full notes yields many instances of the word "increased" across all four hunters. Amon's gotten by far the most changes, with more than 60 bullet points by my count having affected everything from his actions skills to augments and passives of various varieties. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-best-vex-build">Vex</a> has seen slightly less tweaks across all three of those spheres, while Rafa's had action skill, capstone and passive changes. Harlowe only sees two tweaks, both to her stasis-related damage.</p><p>"Looking to the future, we're investigating stats and behaviors on Class Mods, Rep Kits, Shields, and Firmware to make sure they are providing avenues to greater build diversity," Gearbox continued. "We are also planning to fix a number of unintended interactions. These exploits prevent us from creating meaningful build diversity as they trivialize content that is otherwise meant to challenge players." Judging by that last bit, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psst-borderlands-4-has-a-pretty-broken-infinite-damage-build-and-it-may-soon-go-the-way-of-the-dodo">this overpowered Vex build</a> may soon be less godly.</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that this update's also seen the devs add in "auto-clearing of Borderlands 4 stale shaders on version update", which they say should help prevent "performance degradation on some PCs".</p>
<p>If you've not already, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">our Borderlands 4 review</a> by Jasmine Mannan for impressions of the game that aren't delivered via an all caps tweet from the Pitchford.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi has stated the multiplatform approach for Part Three won't impact development "whatsoever".</p>
<p>With Remake Intergrade heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and Xbox consoles next year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> confirmed the full trilogy would be multiplatform. That said, we don't yet know the release date for Rebirth on Switch 2 and Xbox, and it's unknown if part three will be a simultaneous multiplatform release or staggered with PlayStation leading.</p>
<p>Still, it seems this multiplatform approach is working out just fine, as Hamaguchi told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB4XGfyLrTo">Easy Allies</a> for Part Three "we do have designated teams working on each platform so that our multiplatform approach won't impact the development whatsoever".</p>

<p>Yet while "development for both Nintendo Switch 2 Rebirth and the third installment are going very smoothly", it seems the Xbox consoles are proving a little more problematic.</p>
<p>"As for the Xbox version, like many other publishers, I think we did see some issues with the lack of memory compared with other platforms," said Hamaguchi. While he doesn't specify, presumably he's referring to the less powerful Series S console, which proved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-screen-is-a-must-for-baldurs-gate-3-on-xbox-series-s-says-larian">tricky for Baldur's Gate 3 studio Larian</a> among others.</p><p>"But as for the Switch 2 releases," Hamaguchi continued, "we actually have the main dev team working really hard on this. As a result I think we're pretty confident with the end product, we did get some great reviews for FF7 Remake Intergrade so I hope the fans look forward to it."</p>
<p>Indeed, in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-says-the-key-to-a-good-looking-switch-2-port-is-not-compromising-on-lighting/">Automaton</a> earlier this week, Hamaguchi praised the Switch 2's "great hardware specs".</p>
<p>"However," he added, "due to power consumption constraints, it's designed to dial back performance a bit in handheld mode. So, since a straightforward port wouldn't be enough to make the game run stably in handheld mode, we had our talented rendering programmers put in extra work on optimisation."</p>
<p>The key to ensuring the game still looks great, though, is a focus on lighting.</p>
<p>"I believe lighting is the crucial factor in terms of graphics quality and expression in this day and age," said Hamaguchi. Approximating the lighting would have made the game feel "cheap", he explained, and so the development team has reduced the processing load in other areas - such as post-effects and fog - to retain high quality lighting.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has been doing the rounds for interviews as part of last week's Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>In another interview he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-part-three-will-have-some-sort-of-fresh-gameplay-experience-but-its-a-big-secret-for-now">discussed the gameplay of Part Three further</a>, stating he didn't want to "deliver just exactly the same style of gameplay experience as we had with Rebirth again". Instead it will be evolved to offer a "fresh take on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> gameplay".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> will be released on Switch 2 and Xbox consoles on 22nd January next year. It adds boost options to help players progress quicker, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-helping-boosts-arent-exclusive-to-switch-2-and-xbox-will-also-arrive-via-patch-for-ps5-and-pc">retroactively be added to the PS5 and PC versions too</a>.</p>

			<p>The LEGO franchise has tried its tiny-clawed plastic hand at nearly every video game genre going. We’ve had platformers, shoot ‘em ups, racers, co-op adventures, puzzlers, even a Super Smash Bros. clone. But, rather oddly, never a party game. That’s where LEGO Party comes in, offering fun, frolics and laughter for all the family across its impressive range of silly yet satisfying mini games.</p>

<p>First off, Lego Party looks great. The mini-figs gleam with personality and exude charm, flinging their way through each challenge with wanton abandon. Even better, your Lego dude can be customised to a ridiculous degree. Once you’ve unlocked a few new body parts by playing the game, you’ll soon be able to build the over-the-top Frankenstein Pirate-Ninjago-Knight character of your dreams.</p>


<p>Once you and your gang have chosen your avatars, you pick a themed board game to travel around and undertake your challenges. With Pirates, Ninjas, Knights, and Space to choose from, each board is stuffed with iconic characters. There really is something for every Lego fan here.</p>
<p>The four-player minigames themselves really are a Lego-cised who’s who of classic co-op and party video games of yesteryear. There’s a Trials-style race that sees you and your rivals attempt to navigate a 2D level perched atop motorbikes that hate gravity. There’s a Flappy Birds-like game, a Micro Machines imitator, one that emulates Katamari Damacy but with Lego-brick collecting, and a rope-swinging challenge that brings to mind Speed Runners. As a gamer of some thirty-five years, these mini-games come across as derivative – though irresistibly fun – but to new or young gamers, the selection of mini-games on offer are a constant source of new ideas, though smartly grounded in proven mechanics.</p>


<p>Where Lego Party truly succeeds is when it leans into mini-games that are discernibly Lego-y. Indeed, they can only exist because the game is built from Lego pieces. Activities in which you must decipher a Lego instruction manual, build your own monsters, or discern which selection of bricks built which model are a highlight and offer something entirely original, even to players who have been brought up on Mario Party over numerous iterations.</p>
<p>The pace of the game is blistering, hurtling you from challenge to challenge with a pace akin to WarioWare Inc. more than his party-flinging nemesis. As such, even for younger players there’s no opportunity to get bored, as you are always whisked onto the next thing. More importantly, there’s a high degree of accessibility, perfect for players of varying abilities. Controls are simple, responsive, and well implemented, plus, there’s a nice balance of luck-based and skill-based challenges, ensuring that everyone has a chance of winning and – hopefully – avoiding any potential tantrums from child – and adult, sorry everyone – alike. Basically, anyone, even those who’ve never played a video game before, can have a blast with Lego Party.</p>
<p>Where the game truly delivers though, is in its slick game show presentation. Normally, in-game commentators commenting on the action are acutely annoying, here, they are frankly hilarious. Thanks to reams and reams of available dialogue, Paige and Ted rarely repeat themselves whilst delivering gag after gag. Sure, not all of them land, but when you are regularly setting the whole family off in fits of hysterics, you know you are doing something right. The entire game is imbued with this comic energy, reminiscent of the style so iconically established with The Lego Movie. The slapstick visuals delight throughout, feeling like you are playing Lego with a particularly energetic and imaginative child, as Lego figures are hurtled across the screen, builds are constructed and then pulled apart, and everyone seems to be dressed as a banana or pizza slice.</p>

<p>The game is oddly slight in places. Sixty minigames might sound a lot, but once you’ve seen them all – which won’t take long – it’s remarkable how quickly a sense of repetition sets in. Sometimes the game is too chaotic, leading to players losing track of what’s going on, either in the minigames themselves or as they clamber across the board game section. But frankly, isn’t that all part of the party game experience?</p>
<p>Playing online or in single player this constant bonkers over-the-top energy can feel oddly flat, but in local play with friends or family this is an utterly magical experience. Sure, it would have been nice to have the inclusion of Harry Potter, Marvel, DC, or Star Wars to pad out the game, but with licencing that complex, perhaps we’ll have to wait for the sequel. But with a party game this good on its first outing, I’ve no doubt we’ll get one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We liked Dying Light: The Beast. We liked it very much indeed, and it’s fair to say that many of us at TSA Towers have been leaping and climbing and running about its apocalyptic world while smashing up every zombie in sight. We’ve clearly not been the only ones though, with Techland dropping some serious stats for the games first 12 days out in the world. Most impressive? We’ve contributed to over 2 billion zombie kills in that space of time. See, who’s out there saving the world? We are!</p>



<p>Perhaps if we view Dying Light: The Beast as a zombie apocalypse training ground, these numbers gain some serious context.  While taking out that many zombies, players have only died 169,000 times, so we’re very much on the winning side of things, with a K:D ratio that any Call of Duty player would be proud of. That’s been racked up in an astounding 25.6 million hours of playtime. In less than two weeks. Absolutely mental.</p>
<p>On review duties for TSA, Gamoc awarding Dying Light: The Beast a massive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/dying-light-the-beast-review/">9/10</a> while saying,”The Beast is the Dying Light sequel I always wanted. It’s dark, literally and tonally, focuses on zombies instead of warring human factions, and expands on some of the more outlandish and interesting ideas hinted at in the original. If this is indicative of what to expect in the franchise going forward, and it certainly looks that way, then I am excited.”</p>
<p>The team at Techland haven’t just sent out their zombie-infested hit to rot either, as we’re already onto patch 1.2, with significant fixes and improvements already in place, bringing more stability, squashing bugs, improving the graphics, balancing some of the weaponry and enemies, and even altering some of the AI behaviour to be more realistic.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a blast, and based on these numbers it’s one that plenty are already on board with. If you’re not there yet, what are you waiting for?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox Software has <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1973781293344403545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a new Borderlands 4 patch</a> that introduces auto-clearing of 'stale shaders' upon a version update for the game. According to the developers, this should fix the performance degradation issue some PC players have been experiencing over time. Beyond that, this is largely a balance-focused update that buffs several Vault Hunters, chiefly Amon:</p>



<p><em>For today's update, we wanted to focus on creating greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills. Amon in particular gets a host of adjustments to bring him closer in line with the general power level of the other Vault Hunters. Vex's summons and Rafa's melee power see adjustment to make those builds more viable in the late endgame. Finally, Harlowe has a couple tweaks to make sure Stasis is getting value for players.</em></p>



<p><em>Looking to the future, we're investigating stats and behaviors on Class Mods, Rep Kits, Shields, and Firmware to make sure they are providing avenues to greater build diversity. We are also planning to fix a number of unintended interactions. These exploits prevent us from creating meaningful build diversity as they trivialize content that is otherwise meant to challenge players.</em></p>



<p>The patch also makes a few changes to the Weekly Activities in Borderlands 4. The Big Encore Boss is now a tougher variant of a different existing boss, and it'll come with an even better loot pool. This week, the boss you want to tackle for this activity is Driller Hole.</p>



<p>The Weekly Wildcard Missions have also been buffed, providing a guaranteed Legendary drop that can be repeatedly earned to obtain the 'ideal roll'. This week, the Wildcard Mission is Means of Ascent (Deflector, Tricky, Cold Hearted), and its reward is the Star Helix - Legendary Daedalus Assault Rifle. Finally, the studio shared a picture hint to the whereabouts of Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Borderlands 4 was supposed to launch today on Nintendo Switch 2, but Gearbox suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed this version indefinitely (canceling existing pre-orders, too) on September 23</a>. Earlier this week, the studio also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-debuts-first-new-vault-hunter-borderlands-4-paid-story-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a glimpse at the first post-launch Vault Hunter, C4SH</a>, a former casino bot whose abilities will all revolve around the element of luck.</p>

<p>It would have delayed the launch</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> is en route to the Switch 2 later this month, and for anyone wondering about the chances of this remake getting a release on the original Switch, it's probably not going to happen.</p>
<p>If this wasn't already clear after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/persona-3-reload-is-making-the-jump-to-switch-2-this-october">Switch 2 announcement in July</a>, the Persona team has now confirmed this in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/933/G093322/20250926041/">Japanese outlet 4Gamer</a>, while also providing some reasoning behind the decision.</p>
<p>Although P3R was planned for Nintendo's original hybrid device, "performance" issues got in the way. To get the best out of the visuals and performance on this system, it would have supposedly required a longer development cycle and a potential year-long delay.</p>
<p>As general producer Kazuhisa Wada further explains, the team wanted to release each version as close to other versions as possible, and getting the title up and running on Switch 2 devs kit helped with this. Director Yoshihiro Komori also notes how a Switch port would have required redesigning the UI and art.</p>
<p>This would have apparently put the game's release back by a year, but it's now out this month because of the decision to cut the Switch version. So, if you want something to play on the Switch, it seems you'll just have to settle with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_3_portable">P3P</a> or another entry in the Persona series.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/persona-3-reload-is-making-the-jump-to-switch-2-this-october">previously confirmed</a>, the Switch 2 version of Persona 3 Reload will only be available in physical form as a 'Game-Key Card' release.</p>

<p>We've already been overloaded with a bunch of new games for Switch and Switch 2 in recent weeks, and soon Pokémon will be joining in with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>So far, there's been some promotion for this upcoming release with regular Mega Evolution reveals and distribution announcements, and now, The Pokémon Company has revealed it's doing a crossover event with its mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>.</p>
<p>This event starts on 16th October (lining up with the launch date of Legends: Z-A) and runs until 20th October. Here's the official rundown, along with a look at the new themed avatar items "inspired" by trainers from Lumiose City:</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2wkmlzj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
