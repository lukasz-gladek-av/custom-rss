<p>It's a mouthful</p>

<p>Kirby's big 3D adventure is getting the ol' Nintendo Switch 2 Edition treatment tomorrow as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</a> arrives on the newer console.</p>
<p>Our verdict is already in — and we think this is now, definitively, Kirby's very best outing — but besides the expanded content and new levels, this upgrade also delivers a 60fps performance boost to the base game.</p>
<p>So, how does it compare to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">the Switch 1 release</a>? The indomitable Felix Sanchez has done the maths and put the Switch 1 version up against the Switch 2. From just watching, things should become crystal clear.</p>
<p>Load times, performances, and draw distance are all greatly improved here, with better grass and water textures throughout. We've got a variety of footage for you, from cutscenes to gliding levels, so why not check out the video up-top.</p>
<p>Don't forget, if you want to get the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you'll either need to buy the upgrade pack for $20 or, if you don't own the game at all on Switch 1, you can buy the full version physically when it launches tomorrow, 28th August 2025.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you'll be getting Kirby and the Forgotten Land on Switch 2, and what you're most excited about, in the comments below.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2-preview-an-explosive-start.1282074/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the original&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>&nbsp;being one of my best friend's favorite games and as&nbsp;an RPG lover myself, I jumped at the chance to get my hands on the sequel through the preview. It was exactly what I thought I would experience, with whacky dialogue options, time-distorting technology, and brain damage. Here's what we learned in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f7b9881c-df25-4849-881d-eafe092b40f7" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The</em><em>&nbsp;Outer Worlds 2</em></a>&nbsp;preview.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Taste of the World |&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;Preview</h2>

<p>The preview lasted about an hour and covered character creation and the first mission line. Overall, the story takes you to a colony not patrolled by the Earth&nbsp;Directorate, but under authoritarian control. There's still the silly humor present in the title, but taking out dictatorships remains the goal. You're able to play your way, NPCs recall previous dialogue choices, and actions you take directly impact how the mission plays out. I find this type of gameplay absolutely exhilarating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-dialogue-remembered.jpg?itok=gWh32ZcX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-dialogue-remembered.jpg?itok=1uEw-qip 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Character creation is simple and straightforward. It also has a few inclusivity areas, mainly the ability to create characters with prosthetic limbs. This was great, the limbs are gorgeous, and I loved seeing disabled bodies represented in a popular title. Character Creation is the first important decision-making area of the game.</p>

<p>The focus here is on your skills and traits, which dictate how you interact with your crew and the colony of Arcadia. I played through the preview twice, picking different traits, choosing to get a negative trait, and selecting different skills to see how this impacts the game. My second time around was much smoother than the first with the inclusion of Lockpicking, a skill I find necessary to fully explore Arcadia.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-character-creation-prosthetic-limbs.jpg?itok=Acfhog3C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-character-creation-prosthetic-limbs.jpg?itok=dNbDpD_k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The mission available was what seems to be the first in the game, complete with tutorials and beginner combat tips. There are multiple choices you can make that determine whether you duke it out with enemies or go a stealthier route. The first time, I went with the combat-heavy choice, which resulted in me dying multiple times as I forgot to heal myself repeatedly. The second I became one with the shadows, a far better fit for my playstyle in this instance. Stealth kills are extremely satisfying, especially in a room full of enemies that previously gave me a hard time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, combat is straightforward, you have your main weapon, either ranged or melee, and support items like distraction devices or grenades. You can heal during combat, but it takes a moment and you can die while trying to get your health up. When it comes to stealth, there are multiple bars showing how exposed to enemies you are, really allowing you to take risks while avoiding detection. If you're creative enough, you can turn Arcadia's own defense turrets on the guards or have the mechs turn on their owners.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-sneak-attack-combat.jpg?itok=7aLcGXyX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-sneak-attack-combat.jpg?itok=53YfQAc6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Arcadia itself is full of nooks and crannies that hide collectibles, like Pitchball Cards. Secret item stashes are littered throughout, making the Observant option highly prized if you want to find everything. Otherwise, exploring the colony comes with the regular items for healing, ammo, additional weapons, and support items. Since the preview is centered around a single well-designed location in Arcadia, it's hard to say when the different areas of the colony will feel like and how well their theme is executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without spoiling the ending of the first mission, it's safe to say it's a cliffhanger that exits with a bang, literally. There are multiple explosions during the brief time I experienced Arcadia, but they really left an impression. I absolutely need to know what happens after the preview content ended.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-rift-anomoly-explosion.jpg?itok=yxJlCcAF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-rift-anomoly-explosion.jpg?itok=iFJDcDJ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The overall experience was smooth, with no bugs encountered and no odd glitches, enemies in the sky, or clipping through walls. The story is well thought out with background information feeding into the main quests seamlessly. Depending on your choices, dialogue with the NPCs changes, giving you a unique experience based on your actions, skills, and traits.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>preview really lived up to my expectations in all ways except the length of the available content.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Left Us Wanting More</h2>

<p>While I was able to play through character creation and the first mission line multiple times, I was left wanting more content. The preview was relatively short. Some gameplay items were left out, like having a Pet or working with a Companion. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I will 100% be playing when The Outer Worlds 2 releases at the end of October. I need to know what happens in Arcadia, why a massive explosion was required, and how I can save the world.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bossa Studios and publisher Humble Games have announced when you can expect the 1.0 release of skybound survival game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be arriving on September 17th, having launched in Early Access earlier this year. That feels to me like a surprisingly short amount of time for a game to stay in Early Access these days.</p>

<p>Bossa says that&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is essentially an attempt to create a spiritual successor to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creators-of-surgeon-simulator-release-new-mmo-worlds-adrift-may-17" rel="nofollow">2017's&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>, which, as the studio notes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer" rel="nofollow">"ultimately did not reach a 1.0 release"</a>. Still, Bossa says&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>"rebuild[s] upon the strong groundwork" left behind in the former's wake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=NI6XSdAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=LpssuubO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access in September.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio goes on to say that it's looking to "elevate the elements players loved from&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em>" in&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and there doesn't appear to be any kind of intentional pun in there, which feels like a missed opportunity to me.</p>

<p>In any case, if you played&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift&nbsp;</em>and want to know what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, Bossa says that elements like "exploring hundreds of floating islands" and building unique skyships from rare materials and parts are very much part of the experience.</p>

<p>You can also expect to confront "some huge sky filling bosses", according to Bossa's Luke Williams. He says the studio has spent the last three years of development working closely alongside the community to ensure&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is everything it could be.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is like, then you can check out the official 1.0 release date trailer, courtesy of Humble Games, right here.</p>




<p><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches on September 17th, but if you want to play it before then, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

<p>The PlayStation Plus free games for September 2025 have been announced, with the list including Stardew Valley and Psychonauts 2.</p>



<p>A trio of titles are included in the September offerings, all of which are playable from September 2, which also means there’s limited time remaining to add August’s titles to your library.</p>

<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, three titles are available to download for free throughout September, which we’ve detailed here.</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<p>The beloved indie title lands on PlayStation Plus for September, with an adventure full of farming, mining, fishing, and even romance in the offing.</p>



<p>Still one of the most popular games on platforms like Steam, Stardew Valley continues to go from strength to strength, while developers are working hard on the next title, The Haunted Chocolatier. </p>



<p>Plucked straight into work after inheriting your grandfather’s farm, you start with basic tools and a few coins. From there, the world is truly your oyster.</p>



<h3 id="h-psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</h3>



<p>For those looking for a new platform-adventure game to keep you occupied in the wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong, look no further than Psychonauts 2.</p>



<p>With a variety of missions, a cinematic style, and customizable psychic powers, Psychonauts 2 puts players in control of Raz “on a journey through the minds of friends and foes on a quest to defeat a murderous psychic villain.”</p>



<h3 id="h-viewfinder">Viewfinder</h3>



<p>Any player wanting to test themselves with challenging puzzles can do exactly that with Viewfinder, where you use an instant camera’s viewfinder to bring photos, paintings, and sketches to life.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available from September 2, meaning there’s just a few days left to download August’s titles; Lies of P, Day Z, and My Hero One’s Justice 2.</p>



<p>Which of these titles are you planning to pick up and play next month? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It's a pretty strong line up. Pixelated farming sim Stardew Valley first debuted almost a decade ago, and has since gone from strength to strength. In January of this year, the game's creator Eric Barone revealed that, as of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a>, meanwhile, comes from the always creative minds at Double Fine, and was met with overwhelming praise on its release. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psychonauts-2-review">witty, eccentric and imaginative</a>" in Eurogamer's own review, noting it had a "more developed understanding of mental health" than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have Viewfinder, which is a puzzle game that asks players to "challenge perception, redefine reality, and reshape the world" all with an instant camera. Chris Donlan called it all "magical" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/viewfinders-built-around-a-single-moment-and-its-great">Eurogamer's Viewfinder feature</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxf3j7pyoc26">reported</a> the July 2025 sales numbers for the United States based on dollar sales from physical and digital game and hardware sales, revealing that the Nintendo Switch 2 has hit a new sales milestone in the US, while EA Sports College Football 26, somewhat unsurprisingly, absolutely dominates the sales charts for premium game sales.</p>



<p>After Nintendo's last quarterly report showed the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling through 6 million units globally</a>, Piscatella reveals the console's latest regional milestone, that it has now gone beyond 2 million units sold in the US alone. It was also the best-selling piece of video game hardware for July 2025, both in dollar sales and units sold, and just as impressively, the Switch 2 is outpacing the Nintendo Switch by 75% in the US during the same window when the Nintendo Switch launched in 2017.</p>







<p>Moving onto software, EA Sports College Football 26 won in July, taking the top spot for premium game sales across all platforms in the US for the month. Though it was also a win for Madden NFL 26, even though that game only released earlier this month on August 14. EA offered players an MVP bundle which gets you both College Football 26 and Madden NFL 26, and the MVP bundle was the second-best-selling premium title, behind players just getting College Football 26.</p>







<p>In fact, the bundle sold so strongly, as did College Football 26, that both have joined the list of top-20 best-selling games in the US for 2025, with College Football 26 shooting all the way up to third place behind Oblivion Remastered and Monster Hunter Wilds. The MVP bundle made the list in the number 12 spot.</p>







<p>Other notable entries on the software charts include <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which was able to grab third place for game sales in the US in July 2025, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, which came in at fourth place.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/">Grounded 2</a> was also able to make the charts, but in eighth place when you're looking at premium sales on all platforms. It had a much more impressive top spot when you silo everything down to just PC game sales in the US for July, where it overtook Elden Ring Nightreign, though Nightreign remained at number two.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 still has a ways to go if it is going to hit the <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">15 million units sold number that analysts predict it'll reach before 2025 is over</a>, but having already surpassed 6 million globally, 2 million of that being in the US alone, and it's not even holiday season, all point to it at least getting close. We'll see how the rest of the year unfolds. </p>

            <p>We're back again, gang. Bang bang. The Doom modder behind Fallout: Bakersfield, which recreates the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> from the original Fallout as the backdrop to irradiated boomer shooting, has followed up their first trailer in ages with some more footage of the mod in action.</p>
<p>Alexander 'Red888guns' Berezin, the modder in question, caught most of us off guard last month, when he whipped out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-surprise-update-for-fallout-bakersfield-the-doom-mod-that-rebuilds-the-rpgs-necropolis-as-a-shooter-level">that trailer</a> for a GZDoom WAD plenty had assumed wouldn't ever see the light of day. After all, Berezin had <a href="https://x.com/NewBlood/status/1537228975906627585">plenty of other stuff</a> on his plate. He's definitely working hard to show it off now, though.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Two new videos have hit the modder's YouTube channel in the past day. One's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzZdCmv8AsY">4K version of the previous trailer</a>, because clearly experiencing Doomy visuals in crisp 144p isn't the more authentic way to go, and the other's an extended gameplay montage of Fallout: Bakersfield.</p>
<p>While a good potion of this montage is made up of longer sections you've seen clipped up as part of the trailer, there are some bits that didn't feature there. There's an extended sequence with the Vault Doomweller approaching the entrance to Vault 12, giving us a glimpse through the gear-shaped doorless void at what exploring the massive underground shelter that Necropolis' ghoulish residents emerged from will be like. Plenty of dim, grey chambers to paint with blood, I'd imagine.</p>

<p>Other bits I liked include the moment a bunch of ghouls are set on fire by a trusty flamer and do a bit of a monster mash with their smouldering arms aloft, before being shotgunned. And also, the moment when one just throws up. I take that back, he doesn't just throw up, he actually pukes, then immediately goes to puke again, at which point Berezin pulls up the mod's main menu as if he's decided that's enough ghoul vom for one day.</p><p>By far the best thing about this raw footage, however, is that without the music and quick cuts of the trailer, you really get a chance to take in the mod's eerie and sinister ambience. Thunder crackles regularly, drowning out footsteps that're often the only thing cutting through the tense silence. Weapons prime for firing with satisfying metallic clunks, ghouls moan and murmur, mysterious figures ominously hum as you approach. So gritty a symphony you'd never find if you had a grunge band with sand instruments play on a freshly-salted winter road.</p>
<p>Fallout: Bakersfield's sadly still release dateless as of now, but it's cool to be getting regular reminders that it exists, now Berezin's busy blasting through the bits of it that need work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s hype and status are bringing the game perilously close to that limbo state of an indie game and a AAA title. However, I think it’s still in the indie bracket, but Silksong’s price could reflect its years of development and content. Here’s the latest on its potential cost.</p>



<p>2025 has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a> go from the game on everyone’s wishlist for Nintendo Direct and State of Play showcases to being a literal wishlist item in preparation for its release. Team Cherry has worked diligently on one of the most anticipated indie sequels in history. It’s remained Steam’s most-wishlisted game for an eternity after all!</p>



<p>A bigger game and more content mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> probably won’t cost the same as its predecessor, though, so let’s see how much difference there might be.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hollow-knight-silksong-s-price">Do we Know Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Price?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’ll be worth it, whatever it costs. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of August 27, Hollow Knight: Silksong does not have an official price tag on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, or PC storefronts.</strong></p>



<p>We’re so close to launch, but Silksong’s price tag is mysteriously absent. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10005908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a>, for example, simply says “Announced” and “Add to Wishlist.” Unless something changes, there’s every chance we won’t find out the full price until the game’s long-awaited September 4 release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-hollow-knight-silksong-going-to-cost">How Much is Hollow Knight: Silksong Going to Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Based on estimates, predictions, and the size of the game and overall project compared to the original Hollow Knight, we think Silksong is going to cost in the region of $24.99 to $29.99.</strong></p>



<p>Let me be clear, there is nothing definitive to suggest this. But 2017’s Hollow Knight was $14.99 at launch. Silksong is expected to be much bigger than the original—hence <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why it took so long to release</a>. </p>



<p>More bosses, more enemies, and more content usually mean more money to pay. If Silksong is anywhere near the level of Hollow Knight, it’s going to be worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-price-tracker">Hollow Knight: Silksong Price Tracker</h2>



<p>We are monitoring Silksong’s socials, Discord, and other sources to try and find out Hollow Knight: Silksong’s final price tag. We encourage you to keep checking back with this article as we will eventually have the answer you (and us!) are seeking.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Square Enix is bringing the first part of the epic Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy to the Nintendo Switch 2. FF7 Intergrade arrives in 2025, and this is likely the first of two ports that make their way on Chocobo back to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the news, this announcement might not be that shocking. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-coming-to-switch-2-square-enix-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi said the Nintendo Switch 2</a> “would have enough power to run the FINAL FANTASY VII remake series” back in May 2025. </p>



<p>It seems the Switch 2 can handle the JRPG after all.</p>

<p>The official Final Fantasy 7 <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account proudly announced Intergrade’s Switch 2 debut to the world on August 27.</p>



<p>“Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second, offering smooth performance and crisp visuals,” a message said.</p>



<p>It didn’t specify <em>when </em>in Winter 2025 we could expect it. But it should mean many Christmas trees have a nice Final Fantasy 7 aura flowing off of them, like the Lifestream.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second offering smooth performance and crisp visuals.</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s unlikely the Switch 2 receives Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade and that’s it. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was a big hit, so I’d expect to see a port in the future. The third and final part should inevitably make its way over, too. </p>



<p>Will you be buying Intergrade on the Switch 2 for some Midgar mishaps? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Roxie Richter and Lucas Lee, two of the series' iconic Evil Exes, join Scott and Ramona Flowers in their fight against the vegans, robots, and demons that have taken over the city. You can see them in action in the gameplay trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMZ2JNJq5s4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMZ2JNJq5s4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you'd expect, both playable exes use abilities seen in their past appearances. Lucas Lee uses a skateboard as a weapon and summons his crew of stunt doubles, while Roxie Richter wields a katana with ninja-like agility. Their announcement brings Scott Pilgrim EX's playable roster up to four, but developer Tribute Games has previously announced the game would have seven total playable options, so there are still three fighters we don't know about yet.</p><p>Scott Pilgrim EX <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/scott-pilgrim-ex-is-a-new-throwback-beat-em-up">was announced at Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. While it's not a direct sequel, it continues the legacy of 2010's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was infamously de-listed from digital marketplaces in 2014, but <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-complete-edition" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3c11da4e-b823-40d4-9b2c-5edca714292e" data-entity-substitution="canonical">was re-released in 2021</a>. Scott Pilgrim EX features a soundtrack by Anamanaguchi (who composed for this game's predecessor) and an original story written by Bryan Lee O'Malley, the series' original creator.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For over fifty years, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kamen-rider-is-officially-coming-stateside-thanks-a-ne-1842357919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kamen Rider</a> has been that dude—no matter the mask, no matter the era. As an “anime guy,” I knew he had hands through cultural osmosis. But I hadn’t actually stepped into any of its series trenches until I came across <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6bmD4PL/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a TikTok clip of him</a> dismantling a villain from ass to appetite with such violent poetry, I binged the whole show just to understand the lore behind the mauling.&nbsp;</p><p>While sentai teams (like <em>Power Rangers</em>) fight in coordinated color-coded squads, Kamen Rider has been charging in solo (or sometimes with a partner), defending humanity one high-impact transformation at a time. His design usually draws on grasshopper or beetle motifs, and his powers vary greatly. But his essentials are a sleek motorcycle, a righteous leaping kick, choreographed poses, and enough campy flair to rouse kids from their slumber and watch on a Saturday morning. In short, <em>Kamen Rider</em> is the tokusatsu equivalent of <em>Doctor Who,</em> with generations of different Riders, crossover events, and legacy returns spanning its <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Series#Main_Series[1]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40+ mainline series</a>.</p><p>Figuring out “where to start” with a series like <em>Kamen Rider</em> is a frequently asked question for a series with a history spanning decades. For me, seeing the TikTok clip felt like the digital clouds parting and a message from internet heaven declaring that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kamen-rider-kuuga-manga-translation-preview-vol-1-2-1849406396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2001’s <em>Kamen Rider Kuuga was</em></a> my first entry into the series.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u14f1YlAcC0&amp;list=PLnY1FL_e1HO7buZoL9YINwUzSbIFmH-zc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kamen Rider Kuuga</em></a> is notable for being the series’ first widescreen broadcast version (despite being cropped during its original airing). It’s also the only one I’ve encountered over years of lurking that has a tone similar to Hideaki Anno’s darker, bloodier <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hideaki-anno-godzilla-ultraman-kamen-rider-evangelion-c-1848533602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 <em>Shin Kamen Rider</em> film</a> (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/hideaki-anno-godzilla-ultraman-kamen-rider-evangelion-c-1848533602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best in his trilogy</a>).</p><figure><figcaption>The goodest boy of all time. <span></span><span>Toei/TV Asahi</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Kuuga</em> follows hero Yusuke Godai. Yusuke is brave, great with kids, and has an infectious can-do attitude. No matter how bad things get, Yusuke radiates optimism and throws a thumbs-up to reassure friends and strangers that everything will be okay. After stumbling into an ancient curse, Yusuke becomes humanity’s last line of defense against the Gurongi—a tribe of ritualistic killers whose murders baffle the grim-faced cops trailing in their wake. His sunny disposition clashes with the show’s blood-soaked tone, making every act of heroism feel like a defiant act against despair.</p><figure><figcaption>My hero. <span></span><span>Toei/TV Asahi</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each episode kicks off with a charming PSA reminding viewers to sit back and watch safely. Then it dives into the grim stuff: Yusuke Godai and Kaoru Ichijo, a no-nonsense cop, team up to thwart the Gurongi. Some Gurongi kill at random. Others treat murder like a twisted art project. Deadass, one villain was targeting people at swimming pool centers whose names matched notes from Chopin’s “Revolutionary Étude.” I couldn’t crack the case like Ichijo and Yusuke, but I respected the show for preluding its horror show at the pool by having its Sadako-coded Gurongi grimace at dancers vibing to <a href="https://youtu.be/8jba9xhFxXM?list=PLnY1FL_e1HO7buZoL9YINwUzSbIFmH-zc&amp;t=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LL Cool J’s “Around the Way Girl.”</a> Every so often, Yusuke’s Kuuga powers evolve, unlocking new color-coded forms tailored to match the escalating threat level. Meanwhile, the Gurongi treat murder like a sport, tracking their kills on cursed jewelry or a demonic Etch-A-Sketch.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I wasn't kidding. <span></span><span>Toei/TV Asahi</span></figcaption></figure><p>Kuuga usually appears as a last-minute savior. But don’t let the campy, bug-eyed look of his get-up deceive you. This show is filled with scenes so gruesome that, at times, they could easily belong in a Takashi Miike film, with their cruel and genuinely unsettling nature. So when Kuuga finally arrives, performing impromptu motocross stunts off Gurongi skulls or rider-kicking them into oblivion, it always feels well-earned.&nbsp;</p><p>While watching the show’s villain-of-the-week format evolve into something darker and more layered, I kept trying to guess which Gurongi would be the one to get World Starred into oblivion. I figured it had to be personal—maybe they hurt Oyassan, Yusuke’s warm, goofy café boss. Or perhaps they crossed the line with Ichijo, his emotionally repressed maybe-lover. But I was wrong. The villain fucked up by going after innocent children. It was at that moment Kuuga stopped being a hero and became a reckoning.</p><figure><figcaption>We'll be right back.<span></span><span>Toei/TV Asahi</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Spoilers for that</strong></p><p>In the 34th episode, Kuuga contends with Jalaji—a real piece of shit’s piece of shit. Among the Gurongi, Jalaji is an outcast. His sick puppy modus operandi is targeting young high school boys for his serial killings. His method is cruelly precise: he fires a jagged metal shard into a child’s skull, then calmly informs them they have four days before it triggers a fatal stroke. As if that weren’t horrific enough, he stalks his next victim at the funerals of his last—creating a vicious cycle of grief and dread that feeds on itself like an ouroboros of terror.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;“The more they suffer, the more fun it is.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>By the time Yusuke is alerted to Jalaji, he has already killed 85 teenagers, with his last victim committing suicide out of terror. After thwarting him once, Jalaji infiltrates the police-surveilled hospital of his latest victim, jauntily snapping his fingers down the hallway all the while. Yusuke, not having any of it, forgoes the pomp of his Kamen Rider transformation—something the show has called attention to with villains wising up to his wind-up time—and waves his hand mid-run and tackles him out of the three-story window. Now, finally, the generational ass whooping is upon us.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kamen Rider Kuuga | Ep 35 | Emotion | Full Episode" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZmGElsltuM?list=PLnY1FL_e1HO7buZoL9YINwUzSbIFmH-zc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After tossing Jalaji out the window, Kuuga proceeds to beat Jalaji’s face into a bloody pulp without his usual electric guitar hero music underscoring the moment. When Jalaji tries to run away, Kuuga pulls him back for more. Hilariously, the fight is contrasted with Yusuke advising kindergarteners to use their words to resolve conflicts in the very episode. Meanwhile, Kuuga is giving a master class on how to handle Jalaji.</p><p>After a gnarly uppercut, Kuuga punches some numbers into his new motorcycle's keypad, revs it up, and runs over Jalaji, driving him to the countryside. Jalaji, thinking he’s slick, tries to stab Kuuga. But Kuuga, cold as hell, transforms into his powerful purple form without any fanfare, swats his knife away, and brakes hard, sending Jalaji into the shore. Without wasting a second, Kuuga transforms the handlebars of his cycle into a sword and approaches Gurongi like the goddamn Terminator, shrugging off more needles, and proceeds to posterize Jalaji with slashes before plunging his sword into his chest until he’s engulfed in flames.</p><p>The following episode doesn’t even bother to consider how vicious and villainous Kuuga’s beating of Jalaji was, with some “don’t stoop to their level” cliché virtue signaling nonsense. Kuuga was justified, and the show moved on, as it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Message. <span></span><span>Toei/TV Asahi</span></figcaption></figure><p>Out of context, this one-sided fight easily ranks among the most legendary beatdowns in sentai and tokusatsu history. However, within the show’s framework, it hits harder—revealing a deeper, surprisingly anti-shonen thread that is woven through <em>Kamen Rider Kuuga</em>. As Yusuke levels up, his powers grow more volatile, his body barely keeping pace with his transformations. The police grow uneasy, sensing that their hero might be burning out under the pressure to save the day from Gurongi and their own ineptitude, dispatch with them. Yusuke keeps smiling, keeps saying “everything will be fine,” but in rare quiet moments, soft-spoken doubts hang over him where he voices his own hope that the fighting will end soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Beneath the rubber suits and bold kicks, <em>Kamen Rider Kuuga</em> battles real-world anxieties: the fear of raising children in a violent world and the toll of burdening stalwart heroes. Still, every time Kuuga appears to knock out a villain into explosion.mp4, it feels like a massive, cathartic victory. Not as gratifying as Jalaji’s defeat, but it’s a reminder that even amid chaos, someone is still fighting to make things right—even if it means ulting on a villain who was a thousand years too early to catch the smoke.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt"><h3>AI Can’t Suffer, But It Should Suffer For This</h3></a><p>It's the sentience of AI's creators that really matters</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-interview-pvp"><h3>Overwatch 2 Developers Say They’re Leaning Into What Works</h3></a><p>'We are trying to take bigger swings, bigger risks, and bring more change to the game faster than we did in the past.'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi"><h3>What’s Going To Be The Next Silksong?</h3></a><p>"Given that Silksong is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left?"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/kamen-rider-kuuga-tokusatsu]]></content:encoded>

<hr>
<p>I’ve spent 20 years “awww-ing” over the delightful character of Chibi-Robo despite having never played any of his games. This cute little robot is just joy incarnate – tiny and helpful with gormless black eyes. Whether it be his trophy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_smash_bros_brawl">Smash Bros. Brawl</a> or magazine ads for the DS or 3DS games, I always fawned over gaming’s littlest guy.</p>
<p>But now, I’ve <em>finally</em> played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, and it seems like this little metal dude was all a ruse. Well, kind of: the character is cute, but the game? No one warned me I’d need a therapy session afterwards.</p><div><figure data-videoid="dvEWyBr3KsU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvEWyBr3KsU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dvEWyBr3KsU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvEWyBr3KsU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5fd5a0zmoxgv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvEWyBr3KsU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Chibi-Robo is an odd duck; quirky in the way you’d expect for a mid-2000s GameCube game starring a tiny robot who cleans up after a dysfunctional family. It oozes charm from every pore, from the garbled character voices to the garishly decorated, 1970s-style house. It’s laugh-out-loud funny, too, and the gameplay loop, while a little repetitive and sometimes vague, has a nice rhythm to it. It’s <em>nice</em> just to clean up, collect trash, and make people happy, right?</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/da9af04194620/chibi-robo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I want to make the Sandersons happy. They’re the dysfunctional family at the centre of the story, but calling them so feels like I’m doing them a disservice. They’re a family in crisis, torn apart by spiralling debt and family feuds, with a young daughter crying for attention in the middle of it all. And the little robot is part of the catalyst that kicks things off.</p>
<p>Chibi-Robo is a gift for Jenny, the Sanderson’s daughter, on her eighth birthday. The problem is, Chibi-Robo isn’t cheap, and the father, George, seems to have a knack for spending money on expensive toys and robotics. It’s what got the Sandersons into debt, which you gradually pick up by interacting with both the father and mother, Helen, as well as examining bills and books with red pen scribbled all over them.</p>
<p>Yet here I am, as Chibi-Robo, scrubbing muddy pawprints off the floor with a toothbrush, scooping up sweet wrappers and storing them in my head, and consuming electricity by recharging my batteries. Oh, what’s that? The Sandersons are behind on their electricity bills, too? I should probably slow down a little.</p>

<p>Making friends with the many sentient toys scattered around the house <em>does</em> provide some light relief – they’re all utterly bizarre with fun personalities and voices to match – but they too are products of a struggling family. Giga-Robo, Chibi-Robo’s predecessor, was abandoned because he cost too much. The Free Rangers are mourning the loss of a comrade, who was “captured” by the family dog. Then there’s Captain Plankbeard who couldn’t bring himself to steal a “dubloon” because he was worried about the Sanderson’s finances.</p>
<p>What makes it hit harder is that most of the toys are ones George bought, and even though they have their own issues and concerns for the family, the fact that they cost money fuels Helen’s frustrations. So much so, when I brought Helen a receipt for <em>another</em> toy, she locked herself in the bedroom and threatened divorce.</p>
<p>I may be getting Happy Points for doing these chores, but in reality, am I <em>really</em> making the Sandersons happy? I’m going between the husband and wife, swapping notes or pleading forgiveness, proving points and point scoring, all while Jenny, the daughter, is left sobbing at night or glued to the TV screen in her room.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5471c38f77624/chibi-robo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>How do you process divorce, or the potential of divorce, at eight years old? I was ten when my parents split up and I don’t think I really understood the full scope, including the emotional toll, until a decade later. Thankfully, it never comes to that in Chibi-Robo, but during my entire playthrough, all I could think about was how to make Jenny happy.</p>
<p>Every morning I’d seek her out and give her any Frog Rings I’d found around the house – she loves frogs, and wears a frog hat, speaking mostly in “ribbits” because she’s been cursed by the Frog Wizard, so she tells me. In reality, she’s wearing the hood for attention. Her parents are too busy fighting, so the only time they ever really speak to her is to tell her to take the hood off or complain.</p>
<p>Jenny was the first person to clue me into what was actually going on, not the parents; George would talk about his love of toys, while Helen would just complain about George. Jenny was the first to tell me why George was sleeping on the couch. My heart broke when I found her crying on the staircase one night, all because her parents fought. And the only way to fully understand her is by wearing a Frog Suit.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/89e0d7d217af8/chibi-robo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s easy to blame the parents, but that wasn’t my reaction, particularly as the toys seem endeared to the Sandersons and spoke fondly of the past. Helen and George both appreciated everything I did for them, praising me for cleaning, turning the TV on, or gifting flowers. No gesture was too big or small for thanks.</p>
<p>And you can see the two struggling; Helen still clearly loves her husband, but she’s at the end of her tether, while George knows he’s done wrong and attempts to win Helen back. Chibi-Robo steadily becomes a cycle of people-pleasing, an attempt to fix a rift in a fractured family while helping piece the lives of the toys together.</p>
<p>The real kicker comes from realising that it’s no one person’s fault – everyone is at fault in the Sanderson household in some way or another. Helen was too harsh on George, expecting him to grow up and live up to her ideal image of a husband and father. George was too proud, too fearful of revealing why he no longer had a job. And Jenny maybe could scribble on the floor a bit less (small potatoes, of course, I’ll always clean up after Jenny).</p>
<p>What this all culminates in is Chibo-Robo travelling back in time inside an alien spaceship and discovering the secret password to George’s suitcase. Turns out, those spydorz that have been chasing you? George made them, but they were corrupted by the corporation he worked for, causing him to leave the company and seal the most dangerous of these away.</p>
<p>What this means is all those fears, all that anxiety from debt and despair, leads to a giant spydor entangling the house and the Sandersons in thick cobwebs. It’s a completely unpredictable moment, and honestly? A magnetic, metallic spider the size of a small human is pretty terrifying.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/09e5e25e4e71d/chibi-robo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even after defeating the mechanical spider, however, things aren’t done. News reports that the Chibi-Robo craze is putting a strain on the electricity grid start airing; the Sandersons watch, but they don’t have a solution. The very thing that helped bring them together might save their happiness, and may cost them more money, but it might be a greater threat.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing miracles exist in the form of alien wishes, then, as Giga-Robo – which I’ve spent the whole game trying to fix – is brought back to life, and granted infinite power by the aliens. No more will Giga or Chibi consume energy from the grid, and no more will the Sandersons have to pay.</p>
<p>The “accomplishment” gains media attention and, presumably, resolves the Sandersons’ debt and money issues. Jenny seems happy once again, and the family goes back to a relative normalcy. Everything resolves itself by the luck of magic, like a childhood dream that you pray hard and hard for every night.</p>

<p>By the end of my playthrough, I felt reflective. Having watched my family tear itself apart as a kid, and having seen and lived through the consequences of not paying off bills or struggling for money, I wish I could’ve had a miracle like Chibi-Robo, like Jenny. Something to help ease the burden, something to talk to, and something very cute to sit and watch.</p>
<p>But then it hit me. Yes, there’s no easy “miracle” to pay off debts, and money – particularly in the current climate – is tight. But the best thing you can do for someone who’s struggling? Be there for them. Every little thing you can do is enough, just like Chibi-Robo. There’s nothing miraculous about helping out, after all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have revealed&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62, and in the racing sim's latest update, you can drive a brand new Corvette, plus three more exciting new vehicles.</p>

<p>August's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">follows on from July's</a>, in which a very rare car was added to the roster to give you a once-in-a-lifetime driving experience (virtually, of course). This update doesn't have anything quite so rare, but it does have a brand new hypercar that "offers a glimpse into the future of the Corvette".</p>

<p>The '25 Chevrolet Corvette CX Concept is an all-electric vehicle with a very sleek design and over 2,000hp, and it's available for you to check out in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.62-chevrolet-corvette.jpg?itok=2vgdi28K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.62-chevrolet-corvette.jpg?itok=ryMHjPFS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A brand new Chevrolet Corvette is waiting for you in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62.</figcaption></figure><p>If this car isn't your bag, then there are three others included as part of this update. The first, the '26 Afeela 1, is described by Sony and Polyphony Digital as a car that will "challenge the concept of transportation", and it's the first production model following the introduction of the prototype at CES 2024.</p>

<p>Another new Chevrolet Corvette concept car, the CX.R Vision Gran Turismo, is available in Update 1.62 as well, but if your tastes skew a little more street-level, you can drive the '02 Renault Avantime 3.0 V6 24V, a more modest (but no less fascinating) car.</p>

<p>All of this, of course, comes alongside new Extra Menus, new World Circuit events, and a new featured Curation in Scapes in the form of Tokyo Bay. You can check out a trailer showing it all off right here.</p>




<p>This update arrives just after Sony introduced a brand new official&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/official-gran-turismo-7-car-database" rel="nofollow">car database</a>, which collects the hundreds of vehicles currently available in the game in one handy place for your perusal.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is out now, and while it's a lot prettier or at least, more Unreal than the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3, it's got its fair share of technical problems. Curiously, two of the major crashing issues involve crocodiles. If you want a smooth opening bout of Snake Eater, I would avoid either pretending to be a crocodile or having lunch in the presence of a hungry one. Did a crocodile work on this game? There seems to be some underlying reptilian resentment at work, which I guess is to be expected from a game called Snake Eater.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Konami, of course, are well aware of these issues, and are working on a patch. They'll roll the fixes out in stages, with exact release timing to follow. Here's their shortlist of the known issues, plucked from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">the Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>
<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Who amongst us has not rolled into a crawl and ended up drifting across the scenery? I think it's got something to do with eating parsnips after their sell-by-date. Konami are mum as to what might happen if you roll into a crawl while wearing a crocodile hat. Presumably, your keyboard will grow teeth and clamp shut around your hands.</p>
<p>Sulky swamp lizards aside, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is notable for having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-platinum-game-hidden-in-the-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-thats-actually-a-remake-of-a-rework-of-a-zone-of-the-enders-3-prototype">a whole Platinum game inside it that is secretly a cancelled Zone Of The Enders 3 prototype</a>. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hitman-world-of-assassination-out-now-on-iphone-for-70-or-3-a-level.1281939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The (nearly) complete <a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-stealth-metal-gear-splinter-cell-freelancer-1851786255"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em></a> experience, including all 25 levels and bald assassin Agent 47 himself, is making the leap from consoles and PC to iPhone and iPad. But folks might be shocked by the high sticker price of this new, portable version of the stealth action game.</p> <p>On August 27, as previously teased, IO Interactive released <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hitman-world-of-assassination/id6742786366?platform=ipad"><em>Hitman: WOA</em> on the Apple App Store</a>. It supports newer iPhones and iPads and includes almost the full experience, though it isn’t shipping with the wonderful roguelike mode, Freelancer. Instead, that will be added in a later, free update. Still, having all of <em>Hitman, Hitman 2, </em>and <em>Hitman 3 </em>in your pocket is wild. It also isn’t cheap. This version of the game can be downloaded freely, and you can play the first level at no cost, but to play the rest of the game, you’ll need to fork over $70. Or you can spend $3 per level, which equals around $72 before tax. Yikes.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="HITMAN World of Assassination - iOS Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYJwROKrP6I?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to a press release for the new port, IOI has “designed an entirely touch control scheme built specifically for iPhone and iPad.” Which is neat, but don’t worry, the game supports controllers, too. Still, I can’t help but look at that $70 price tag for a mobile game, one which is a many-years-old console/PC port, and make a weird noise. This same package, with Freelancer, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOopEwi6qPusLtSLqi-aw1HtKt3Iqx9rbzeD9cicht8xalRqrsLvV#dlc">is available on Switch 2 for just $60.</a> It seems odd to charge such a premium for a mobile port, especially when there’s plenty of data to show that these fancy iPhone AAA ports <a href="https://kotaku.com/re7-aaa-ios-iphone-village-remake-flop-low-sales-why-1851595596">don’t sell well at all on the platform.</a></p> <p>But I need to be careful and stop being too critical of this pricey new <em>Hitman</em> phone port because I just noticed my neighbor trimming the bushes outside looks a lot more bald and brooding than usual, and is that a rubber duck in his hand…oh no.</p>

                <p> Sales of the Switch 2 are significantly outpacing sales of the original Switch in the US over similar periods of time. That's according to new data from research firm Circana, which <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxf3j7pyoc26" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published its latest monthly sales report</a> today, August 27. </p><p>The data shows that the Switch 2 has now exceeded 2 million units sold in the US since launch in early June. That's 75% ahead of the pace of sales for the original Switch back in 2017. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, I traveled to Cologne, Germany, to attend Gamescom and play more than two dozen games. One of those games was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the ninth mainline installment in Capcom's long-running survival horror series. Although <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/11/back-to-raccoon-city">it was the same demo from June's Summer Games Fest event</a> in Los Angeles, featuring Grace Ashcroft in a decrepit care center attempting to escape from a monstrous creature stalking the halls, it was still <em>my </em>first time playing it.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read my hands-on preview thoughts on that demo in my <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/25/the-most-dope-games-weve-played-during-gamescom-2025">Gamescom preview round-up here</a>, but it was only half of my Requiem experience last week. I also sat down to interview Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa.

<p><em><strong>Game Informer </strong></em><strong>editor Wesley LeBlanc: Every Resident Evil has a theme. Biohazard was about a southern backwoods family, and Village was Resident Evil's take on classic Universal monsters. How would you describe the horror theme of Requiem?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Director Koshi Nakanishi</strong>: We've been emphasizing in marketing materials, "Return to Raccoon City," and that we're returning to the main storyline of the series and looking to push it forward with horror. And you'll see, if you've played the demo, using characters like Grace and the creature you saw, we introduce this storyline and theme, and they're quite unique as an approach for Resident Evil.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Producer Masato Kumazawa</strong>: One of the elements that you can expect to return is zombies; they are back. We are focusing more on the monsters, a variety of different enemies from the creature you saw in the demo to the next level, the next version of our zombies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You trip as Grace in third-person but not in first-person. Why is that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: We originally planned to just switch the camera hud, but we realized that if you take the camera out from first to third, because of the way Grace is animated – as a first-person model – it looks like she's just walking around straight, with no reaction. It was unnatural. First-person is already more immersive, but that immersion has to be represented in other ways in third-person, which is why we have extra reactions like tripping. If we added tripping to first-person, moving the camera like that would make you motion sick. In third-person, it's about seeing her fear and reaction to the scenario, and going through the rest of the game, we start building in more reactions. There's no point in adding these in first-person because you wouldn't see them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kumazawa</strong>: There are surprise reactions she does in the demo. In third-person, something might happen, and you see her jump, whereas in first-person, there's a bit of a camera move instead. When she takes damage or gets hit, there's no need to do much in first-person, but there are specific animations in third-person to let you feel and show how much she got hurt.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><strong>With tripping and other animations that theoretically slow down gameplay, is it fair to say third-person is harder?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: We don't want to be unfair, so we'll give you a little peek behind the curtain: when you trip, you can't see it, but the creature doesn't move. Third-person never feels like an unfair advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why return to the Ashcroft family now, and why pick a family from the Outbreak series?</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: Alyssa Ashcroft was actually the perfect character for our needs in this game; there really was no other character in mind. Returning to Raccoon City after all this time meant looking back on the incident itself and Umbrella and the themes we haven't visited in a while. Alyssa is a survivor of the incident, and she goes on to journalistically investigate and find the truth and expose the cover-up. But she pays the price for curiosity, presumably gets too close to the truth, and someone or some entity has her killed to silence her. Grace, being the character to take up the torch from her mother after all these years, wants to find the truth after the incident and the murder of her mother. Two generations of Ashcrofts are the perfect choice for our storytelling and moving the main series forward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can you talk to me a bit about the hulking creature design in the demo? What are some of the inspirations behind it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: We had a lot of different concepts through the design phase. So, to be honest, there's not any one particular inspiration from other works. The main objective has been, with quite a few games with stalker enemies and different variations, for her to stand out from the pack. The main single-sentence summary of her: As soon as you lay your eyes on her, you know this isn't right; you need to get away from this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Requiem has a few definitions. What does it mean in the context of this game?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: It's along the lines of remembrance for the dead. As we discussed earlier, Alyssa and Grace are a key family relationship that kicks everything off: Alyssa's murder, Grace's grief, her desire to avenge, her desire to solve her mother's murder, and the aftermath of the Raccoon City incident.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can you expand on the line: "This is merely the overture to our darkest symphony yet?"</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: The musical allusions are a call back to the title. Using a musical metaphor to say this is a requiem for the mass of the dead; even when you watch the SGF presentation or if you've played the same section yourself, and think this is dark and scary – this is just the beginning. It's our way of tying together the title and the metaphor and saying, "If you think this is scary, you haven't seen anything yet."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Does that mean Requiem is the scariest Resident Evil yet?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: That's a bit of a tricky question. I directed [Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]. I know for a lot of players, it was too scary, so scary they couldn't finish it. I'm not aiming to make this the scariest Resident Evil ever. It will be very scary, but I want you to get through the whole thing and enjoy it. It's about a release of tension and catharsis and actually surviving it, but it's certainly up there in terms of how scary Requiem is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kumazawa</strong>: The camera perspective changes are part of this. If you feel it's too scary in first-person, jump out to third-person. But overall, we're aiming to have a rollercoaster ride of a thrilling, well-paced storyline. If we're at max horror the whole time, people can't take it and put the controller down. We want, "Wow, that was scary," and then some exploration and puzzle-solving, then some action combat, and then we bring you back into the fear.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><strong>Can you talk about the persistent theme of family across this trilogy?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: We don't really think of [Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Resident Evil Village, and Resident Evil Requiem] as a trilogy. 7 and 8 are a duology. Ethan's story concludes at the end of Village. Requiem is the ninth mainline title, but it's moving back to the series' mainstream, as it were, [...] to push the storyline forward. In that sense, I don't think family is a main theme of Requiem. It's part of it, but not as emphasized as the past two mainline titles. Part of Grace's motivation is things like finding out what happened to her mother, but that isn't the complete theme of the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What's it like within the team, finally returning to Raccoon City in a new way after all these years?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: There are a lot of Resident Evil fans on the team, so naturally, we find it very exciting, and it's fun to finally tackle the idea of what's happening inside the city. The fans, though, they go to the next level, with even more speculation and questions. We do have a lot of expectations to live up to, but we're confident you will love it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Resident Evil Requiem hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 27, 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/alyssa-ashcroft-returns-in-new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer">the latest Resident Evil Requiem trailer</a>, and then read about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/leon-s-kennedy-was-considered-a-bad-match-for-resident-evil-requiem">why Leon S.
