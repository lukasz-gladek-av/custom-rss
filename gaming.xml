Folks craft celebrity lookalikes, themselves, and their ideal vision of the perfect hero. Personally, I’m in and out in five minutes, ready to play. But what happens if you speed through that process with your character and then find it’s subpar in gameplay? Fortunately, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> won’t shoulder you with buyer’s remorse given its various settings for tweaking your character’s style.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1145556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new claim states that a Star Wars collaboration is planned for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 2 ends on May 2, 2025, and post that date, according to a post by <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1904930387219874285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FNBRintel</a> on X (via <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1904931354669691269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hypex</a>), Season 3 will kick off with a Star Wars collaboration. The Star Wars collaboration will arrive as a mini-season that lasts approximately 30-35 days. The update will include a new POI based on the series, new mythics, skins, and other content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904931282011758877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_Wrld</a>, who recently leaked a Fortnite x <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-collaborating-with-dragon-ball-daima-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daima collaboration</a>, also corroborated the Star Wars Season 3 rumour while adding more details. Players should expect new Star Wars Bosses, NPCs, POIs, and items in Fortnite accounting to their posts. Moreover, the battle pass will seemingly feature 4-5 themed skins as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite and Star Wars have been collaborating since 2019, with new content arriving each year. Fortnite is known to have a new Star Wars collaboration or content ready for players each year on May 4, also known as Star Wars Day. Some of the most popular characters from the franchise, like the Mandalorian, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and a bunch more, have already been introduced to the game. </p>



<p>Last year, we saw the likes of Chewbacca, Dagobah Luke, Lando Calrissian, and AWR Trooper join the game. The collaboration was across several of Fortnite’s game modes, including Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, and Rocket Racing. It will be interesting to see what property Fortnite brings over this year, whether a new game, TV show, or movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Fortnite leaker has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaker-confirms-mortal-kombat-content-is-finally-koming-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat content</a> is finally coming to Fortnite. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sabrina-carpenter-might-be-the-next-playable-fortnite-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> could also be the next Fortnite Festival Icon.

            <title><![CDATA[New Lies of P: Overture Details Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed.1145553/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Lies of P: Overture is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to release</a> sometime later this summer, and new details on what players can expect have come out.</p>



<p>Thanks to a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Lies of P: Overture director Choi Ji-won gave insight into where the upcoming prequel stands in terms of experience and in relation to the original Lies of P.</p>



<p>According to Choi, the story of Lies of P: Overture will be “accessible seamlessly from around chapter nine of the base game.” That means the new story is integrated into the original as opposed to being a completely standalone tale.</p>



<p>“We never really saw the development of Overture as a separate entity,” said Choi to Eurogamer. “With the base game and the expansion together, we believe that the whole entire thing delivers the game of Lies of P as how it was supposed to be experienced. We just couldn’t do that earlier on.”</p>



<p>As far as length is concerned, Lies of P: Overture will take “experience players” roughly 15-20 hours to complete. It features new locations, enemies, bosses, weapons, and characters. Two of those new weapons are a bow and claws, though not much else was given away by Choi.</p>



<p>Lastly, when it comes to what the DLC will actually be, Choi told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-director-says-overture-dlc-isnt-connected-to-base-games-massive-final-cutscene-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> in a separate interview that players should replay the base game. He says that there are various clues throughout that give hints as to what you’ll get with Overture. He also made it clear that the final cutscene of the game is unrelated to what will be in Overture. That scene—don’t worry, no spoilers here—is a tease for future adventures from the developer.</p>



<p>What do you think of the new Lies of P: Overture details? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

So far, the studio has released ports, remasters, and remakes, including The Last of Us Part II, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered. At the very least, it could likely end up a cross-gen game.</p><p>"Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria - a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," the official synopsis reads. "Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit."</p><p>Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards in 2024. It features a fully loaded cast with Tati Gabrielle (Uncharted) as Jordan, Kumail Nanjiani (Eternals) as a man called Colin Graves, and Tony Dalton (Hawkeye), with The Last of Us alumni Ashley Scott and Troy Baker in unrevealed roles.</p>

		<p>While the F1 season is just getting started – or perhaps finishing if you’re Liam Lawson – Codemasters have timed things perfectly with the announcement of F1 25, the next instalment in the long-running series, coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles on the 30th of May, 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5rWBgBjDsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>2025 is set to be one of the biggest years for F1. Alongside the on-track action that of course lies at the heart of it, we’ve also just had the latest season of Netflix’s smash hit Drive to Survive, and later this year we’re getting the F1 movie, starring Brad Pitt as a washed up racer given one more shot at F1 glory.</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton, in his first season with Ferrari, will be the cover star for the game’s special Iconic edition, which makes sense as to why he’s the star of this reveal trailer, with it showing him getting his elbows out and winning a hard fought race in the game.</p>
<p>The fan-favourite story mode, Braking Point, will return in F1 2025, with Konnersport now battling for championships, as a dramatic event throws the team into chaos. Braking Point now comes with multiple difficulty settings which will cater to both returning players and rookies alike, ensuring that everyone can get in on the story-based action.</p>

<p>My Team will be getting a major overhaul, with players calling the shots as the owner of their F1 team, taking on ‘new responsibilities’ before getting behind the wheel as either of the team’s drivers. The EGO engine has also been tuned even further, with increased circuit authenticity made possible through LIDAR technology, and several tracks and their surroundings have been transformed with a more realistic look and feel, building on last year’s already-impressive visuals. More details on the gameplay features and innovations will be revealed shortly through a new entry in the F1 25 Deep Dive series.</p>
<p>“F1 25 delivers more ways for players to experience Formula 1 and race their way, from the drama of Braking Point to making headlines in the pursuit of World Championship glory,” said Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters. “This year, there are new opportunities for players to connect, collaborate, and compete than ever before. We look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">greatly enjoyed F1 24</a>, saying “EA F1 24 is the best rendition of the sport yet, and a fantastic simulation of the iconic motorsport. If you want to forge your own Drive To Survive-style superstardom, this is the perfect place to start. If it’s good enough for Max Verstappen and Lando Norris, then it’s good enough for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>EA Sports F1 25 will release on the 30th of May for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Who knows, maybe there’ll be a speedy Switch 2 launch as well!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/triple-i-initiative-indie-showcase-2025-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Empire has announced the date and time for this year's Triple-i Initiative presentation, which will showcase around 45 minutes of information about new and yet-to-be-revealed indie games.</p>

<p>The first Triple-i Initiative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indie-creators-come-together-for-triple-i-initiative-showcase-this-april" rel="nofollow">took place last year</a>, and it's during that show that we got the first reveals for games like&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, as well as updates on games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow">Vampire Survivors</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/v-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>V Rising</em></a>.</p>

<p>Stunlock's vampire survival game makes a return this year to show off its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million" rel="nofollow">upcoming 1.1 update</a>, and it'll be joined by fellow indie stalwarts like open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow">Enshrouded</a>&nbsp;</em>and dwarven shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/deep-rock-galactic" rel="nofollow"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-triple-i-initiative-2025.jpg?itok=ZjOdf86- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-triple-i-initiative-2025.jpg?itok=O9QmJoox 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>joins the list of indie games being showcased at this year's Triple-i Initiative.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Evil Empire, this year's Triple-i Initiative will feature over 30 announcements, and as well as the aforementioned games, you can also look forward to new info about the likes of&nbsp;<em>X4: Foundations</em>, plus new info from publishers like&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s Playstack and&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>' Hooded Horse.</p>

<p>The full list of studios also includes&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit,&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>studio Sloclap, and&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>outfit Digital Sun, who may well be showcasing more of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>sequel</a>.</p>

<p>As well as new game reveals, Evil Empire also says that this year's Triple-i Initiative will mark the beginning of a week-long sale across Steam and other platforms, with various games from both this year's show and last year's getting discounts.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that this is an indie show, I wouldn't get your hopes up for news on, well,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>that&nbsp;</em>hotly-anticipated indie game</a>. Team Cherry's name isn't on the list of studios to be featured during the show, so adjust your expectations accordingly. Nobody likes&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>spam in the chat, after all.</p>




<p>You can check out this year's Triple-i Initiative on April 10th at 9am Pacific (that's around 12pm Eastern and about 5pm GMT). Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s been like this for a few years, longer if you ask some people, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better anytime soon. Thankfully, <em>Spilled </em>is here. It’s a new game about a tiny boat cleaning up a big mess that at least lets us fix a digital world. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Spilled</em>, out today on PC</a></span>, is the first indie game from developer Lente. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LenteGameDev/status/1897575001106022591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LenteGameDev/status/1897575001106022591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">She lives on a boat, and this is her first release on Steam</a></span>. And in Lente’s <em>Spilled</em>, you are given the role of a sleepy little boat, tasked with cleaning up a gorgeous pixel art world using an upgradeable vacuum, water cannon, and crane. Some nasty, evil boats have been putting around and leaving black goo everywhere across various biomes and its up to you to save the day by collecting all the goo and recycling it into coins—coins that can then be used to upgrade your boat. </p><p>It’s a fairly simple concept, perfectly nailed in <em>Spilled</em>. Controlling the boat feels good and upgrading its engine to make it faster feels even better. Early on, the goo you encounter is in small patches and easy to suck up. But later on, the spills of goo you find are massive and you’ll need to go back and forth through the messes to effectively clean them. And doing this is immensely satisfying, like perfectly removing the sudsy water from a car windshield using a squeegee. Clean up an area enough  and sea critters, like whales and dolphins, will return and the water will turn blue again. </p><p><em>Spilled </em>will take most players about an hour or so to finish. Though if you want to clean every inch of its cozy world and collect all the hidden animals, you’ll likely need to spend about two hours total. It’s short, but its also packed with a lot of ideas. Every 10 minutes or so, <em>Spilled </em>was either teaching me a new way to clean stuff up—like using a water canon to remove hard-to-reach gunk on rocks—or letting me upgrade my boat again.</p><p> I’d love to see a sequel to <em>Spilled </em>that adds more levels, more ways to clean stuff up, and maybe even co-op. But for now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535"><em>Spilled</em> is a solid and gentle indie game</a></span> that lets me clean up the world for an hour, and that’s nice. I really like that. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports and Codemasters have officially revealed F1 25, the latest installment in the long-running Formula 1 racing franchise. The game will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC starting May 27 for those who buy the Iconic Edition of the game.</p>



<p>Those who <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-25-official-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">buy the base game</a> get it starting May 30.</p>



<p>As with any new release of an annual franchise, the biggest questions surround the improvements and new features coming to the game. With F1 25, Codemasters is bringing back a new installment of the Braking Point story mode with Braking Point 3.</p>



<p>“Hot off the heels of the 2023 season and under new ownership, the familiar faces of Callie Mayer, Aiden Jackson, and of course, Devon Butler, make their return,” the mode’s description reads. “However, with a dramatic event threatening to derail their title aspirations, will you have what it takes to steer the team to championship glory?”</p>



<p>In addition to the story mode, F1 2025 features a crossover with the upcoming F1 The Movie, bringing in the APXGP race team for use in both My Team and Driver Career as well as various post-launch chapters “inspired by the film”.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, My Team is getting its “biggest overhaul since it was introduced”. The mode will see you have new challenges and responsibilities as the owner of an F1 team. More specific details on what that entails will be revealed closer to the game’s launch.</p>



<p>Lastly, the game’s EGO engine has been updated along with improved “circuit authenticity made possible through LIDAR technology”.</p>

Taking the number one spot in the Chinese MOBA charts, the TiMi Group is taking its free-to-play characters – and world – in a new direction with Honor of Kings: World. While its scale and monetization screech in dissonance, its flashy combat, diverse roster of playable classes, and multiplayer-flexible modes do carry some promise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During my half-hour-long hands-on with Honor of Kings: World at Tencent’s GDC booth, I took some time to toy around with a couple of World’s different classes, take on a boss inspired by Chinese folklore, and see a brief glimpse of the story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Honor of Kings: World - First Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it boasts many of the same characters as its mobile MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well as mobile, by the way – with the kind of over-the-shoulder, action-driven combat you might expect from something like Genshin Impact. But rather than locking mechanics or gameplay behind randomized drops like in MiHoYo’s game, Honor of Kings offers players different classes to choose from. And while the same overall control scheme unifies each class – a dodge, three standard abilities, and an ultimate of sorts – the roster of different classes struck me as fairly diverse, each with its own abilities and special perks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well, by the way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually, you’ll be able to play with two separate classes, though sometimes you might need to stick with just one for story purposes. It seems like TiMi’s put a lot of effort into the dual-class system, allowing you to switch between the two during combat. The most interesting example they showed during my demo was starting a long, multiple-attack combo and switching characters once the target was launched into the air to extend a combo. It kind of reminded me of a tag system in a fighting game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 11 different classes in the demo I played, I’m certain there are tons of different combinations and ways to style on your opponent. But since this was my first time playing, I looked for balance above all else: I stuck with an even-keeled loadout, using a sword-wielding class for my primary role and a ranged gunner for the second. The two nicely filled in gaps left by the other during my attempt at a boss fight: I’d lay down fire using the gunner’s active reload mechanic to improve my damage and rate of fire when the boss was spitting out attacks in a frenzy, making sure to dodge the occasional flaming projectile and then rush him down with my sword, laying on the damage with a vengeance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This swapping was easily my favorite part of the demo. I enjoyed hammering away at the boss’s stance meter, breaking his stance, and shooting the gunner’s R ability as I closed the distance, swapping to my sword class, and unleashing a devastating ultimate attack of sorts to juice every second from the boss’ temporarily weakened state.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the boss down to a certain point also revealed an interesting story beat that eventually led to me playing as a completely separate character from the pre-built avatar provided for the demo. TiMi didn’t offer much information on how frequently to expect this kind of change, only that it would happen from time to time. The demo took place somewhere closer to halfway through Honor of Kings: World’s runtime, opening up my two classes’ skill trees just enough for me to have some fun with them without overcomplicating its combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss itself was a giant monkey character with various different masks, with a personality and attacking style for each. According to the developer leading my demo, this mechanic has its roots in a traditional style of Chinese theater called <em>Bian lian</em>. One mask might see him spitting fire in a massive area of effect on the map, while another might see him throw around a few melee attacks. I loved this melding of culture, history, and story with a gameplay mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from briefly seeing another journalist in my demo in a hub area before the tutorial, I didn’t have a chance to check out any of World’s multiplayer offerings. TiMi showed a few clips of four-person squads crawling dungeons and taking on bosses before our demo, but teased something that sounded more like an MMO. That part is still a work in progress, so they didn’t share much beyond acknowledging that there would be a bigger scale multiplayer mode in the full game, so I’m curious to see what that looks like given my demo’s single-player scope.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I left the demo concerned about monetization.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the demo, one of TiMi’s developers walked me through some of World’s premise and setup, saying that Honor of Kings: World was a gift of sorts to the MOBA’s loyal fanbase that’s propelled it to massive success in the ten years since its launch. True as that may be, I left the demo concerned about monetization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When another journalist asked about how TiMi plans to make money with Honor of Kings: World, the developer leading our session gave a concerning answer. “The game’s gonna be based around social, so outfits and stuff,” they said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On its own, funding a free-to-play game with cosmetics isn’t necessarily a problem – especially since the developers made it clear that there wouldn’t be any pay-to-win – but given Honor of Kings: World’s scale, with flashy cutscenes, tons of playable characters, and epic boss fights, I can’t help but feel concerned about whether or not World’s model is financially sustainable, regardless of whether or not it’s based on one of the most successful games of the century.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honor of Kings: World undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of it, provided TiMi can stick to its promise of giving fans of its MOBA hit a celebration worthy of its success. Even though I’m still a little worried about the amount of microtransactions that Honor of Kings: World could potentially need to fund its high production value, I still had a ton of fun dodging the big primate’s swings.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s out now across PC, console, and VR for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When new bones are discovered, players can piece them together to their own design, Hello Games explained. They can even create their own museums, or share their collections with other players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect,” Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the launch of Relics is a community expedition focusing on palaeontology, which challenges players to compete for the rarest finds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players should be wary where they choose to excavate though,” Hello Games warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some things have been buried for a reason. Dangerous creatures guard the greatest treasure and may be awoken from their slumber, including Stone Ghosts, and the colossal Stone Golem. New creatures have been introduced too, along with their skeletons. Including the awesome skeletal Titan Worm!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky continues to receive free updates even now, years after launch. And it’s clearly keeping players interested. Hello Games said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-skys-massive-worlds-part-2-update-adds-billions-of-new-solar-systems-and-trillions-of-new-planets">the recently released Worlds Part II update</a> fueled some of No Man’s Sky’s highest player numbers early in the year.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">No Man's Sky Relics Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-dev-hello-games-hails-very-positive-steam-rating-8-years-after-overwhelmingly-negative-launch"><u>Hello Games hailed No Man’s Sky hitting a ‘very positive’ Steam user review user rating</u></a> for the first time, eight years after the game’s controversial launch was slammed by players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based developer Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years"><u>explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>.

                <p><em>Call of Duty: Warzone is celebrating its 5-year anniversary this month. Below, we examine how it has developed over that time, and look to its plans for the future with insights from key developers.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> launched on March 10, 2020, delivering a streamlined, fast-paced, and arcade-style battle-royale experience. Warzone's arrival felt perfectly timed, as it was released during the start of the pandemic with a free-to-play model that allowed everyone to squad up and socially distance. Warzone has continued to evolve (and sometimes devolve) over the years, so with the celebration of the game's recent fifth anniversary, this feels like a great time to trot down memory lane, discuss Warzone's current slump, and look toward the future of Call of Duty's battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to my own reminiscing, I was also able to speak with Warzone developers across Call of Duty's various studios, including Pete Actipis--the game director for Raven Software--and Etienne Pouliot, who is the creative director for Beenox. The developers provided insight on some of Warzone's biggest events and discussed the future of the battle royale. Mark Grigsby, the co-studio head of Infinity Ward, also shared some thoughts on the evolution of Warzone.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1403774528" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

I've been dropping into Warzone since day one, and it's one of the only memories I can look back on fondly when thinking of the COVID-19 pandemic. Warzone's initial launch was smooth, and it was a fresh new way to play in a time when <em>everyone</em> was online. All of my old squadmates from past Call of Duty games were logged on and eager to try battle royale--not to mention the popular athletes, celebrities, and streamers who were also fighting for victory royales on Verdansk. Warzone was an instant hit that millions of people were playing.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, to the developer's credit, Warzone's success wasn't just about the timing. The battle royale felt fluid and well thought out. As someone who also played a bit of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (now PUBG: Battlegrounds) and H1Z1, Warzone's initial gameplay felt so smooth and easy to jump into that it made its non-Fortnite competitors feel janky and no longer enticing to play.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time, Warzone's launch was ambitious with 150-player matches on Verdansk. It also launched without complicated backpacks or inventory systems, and the unique 1v1 Gulag feature offered an interesting way to give you a second chance in the match. Everything about Warzone's initial design felt like an intentional push to get you into the fight as quickly as possible, so matches were often filled with high engagements and plenty of action to keep you hooked on playing.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the battle royale mode started out simplistic and and fast, but over the years has slowly built up some cruft as it's had to add more features in an attempt to stay fresh.</p><p dir="ltr">Verdansk stuck around from Modern Warfare 2019 to Black Ops Cold War, and both games added post-launch updates to the map that continued to push Warzone towards further success. Verdansk wasn't a perfect map design, but it remains Warzone's most beloved map. The nostalgia runs deep, and it's not simply because Verdansk was the first, but there were also a lot of first experiences that made playing the map so special, including the major design changes and special events that took place over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465891-bocw-s4-announcement-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465891" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465891-bocw-s4-announcement-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465891"></a><figcaption>Verdansk update with Nakatomi Plaza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465891-bocw-s4-announcement-027.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The map's evolution included an exciting event to blow the rooftop off the stadium, which was a welcome change that made the location accessible and less frustrating to encounter. An '80s-action-hero-themed event added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/die-hards-nakatomi-plaza-is-coming-to-cod-warzones-map/1100-6491634/">Die Hard's Nakatomi Plaza to Downtown Verdansk</a>, and operator bundles for Rambo and John McClane let you live out all your action-hero fantasies. Verdansk was the birthplace of the Warzone's bunker Easter eggs, which brought the game's community together to solve and inspired similar bunker mysteries for all the big maps that followed. The map even introduced the first Haunting event for Halloween, which is now an annual occurrence that continues to be one of Warzone's most exciting events.</p><p dir="ltr">Mark Grigsby, one of the pioneers of the battle royale, shared how he felt about the evolution of Warzone overall and the impact it’s made on the Call of Duty brand, saying, "It’s wild to see on the development side how Call of Duty: Warzone has evolved since Spring 2020 and what a massive impact it’s had on the franchise."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone Pacific</h2><p dir="ltr">Each yearly Call of Duty premium title that followed Black Ops Cold War added a brand-new era of Warzone, with each one bringing various highs and lows for the battle royale. For example, the transition to 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard and the WWII era rebranded the battle royale as "Warzone Pacific" with the introduction of Caldera, a Pacific island map in a matching WWII setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of Caldera's post-launch updates aren't as memorable as Verdansk's, but the map did offer up one of Warzone's most colossal moments--quite literally, with Godzilla and King Kong spawning onto the island for the Operation Monarch limited-time event. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-gets-mixed-reviews-for-godzilla-and-kong-event-as-some-are-left-disappointed/1100-6503415/">Some players were disappointed and torn on Call of Duty's use of these two Hollywood titans</a>, but I have to admit, I still had a blast fighting them on Caldera.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465885-cod-wz-vgd-operation-monarch-tout-hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465885-cod-wz-vgd-operation-monarch-tout-hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465885"></a><figcaption>Warzone's Operation Monarch on Caldera</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465885-cod-wz-vgd-operation-monarch-tout-hero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When speaking with the developers about the limited-time mode, Pete Actipis discussed how Operation Monarch was one of the most difficult to bring to life in Warzone, saying, "That one was hard for several reasons. Definitely the scale: how to make these two titans play well on a map like that and still have it based around being the last to survive."</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, though, this Warzone Pacific era was a mixed bag. There were major graphical bugs at launch, and the WWII setting and era-appropriate weapons weren't popular. On the other hand, Caldera added new features that reshaped how the battle royale was played during Warzone Pacific. The map introduced WWII planes and dogfighting, which offered up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-player-hits-impressive-fighter-plane-seat-swap-snipe/1100-6500918/">impressive new ways to get kills</a> if you or a squadmate wanted to take to the skies. One of the most notable additions to the map was Caldera's redeploy balloons, which were a huge hit for providing a faster way to traverse the island, and these balloons inspired the redeploy drones used on the modern maps currently found in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">For me, I enjoyed the refreshing change in scenery with Caldera. I found flying to be disorienting and could make me motion-sick, so I preferred to stay boots-on-the-ground in the lush jungles and enjoyed the tropical water around me. At the time, one of my biggest complaints was that I wanted to swim, but that mechanic wouldn't arrive until the next era of Warzone.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone's 2.0 setbacks</h2><p dir="ltr">Warzone left Caldera and WWII behind with a return to modern times in 2022's Modern Warfare 2. The battle royale has been a collaboration of various Call of Duty studios over the years, but MW2 put Warzone back in the hands of the original studio, Infinity Ward.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer dubbed this era as Warzone 2.0, which overhauled the gameplay features, introduced AI soldiers, added swimming mechanics, and launched Al Mazrah as the new big map for battle royale. This midpoint could've been a more refreshing take on Warzone, but it was instead one of the battle royale's biggest stumbles, with a lot of the best design choices from Infinity Ward's original game getting lost in the sauce.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465886-wz2-al-mazrah-overview-011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465886" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465886-wz2-al-mazrah-overview-011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465886"></a><figcaption>Al Mazrah</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465886-wz2-al-mazrah-overview-011.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In terms of map design and visual appeal, I actually think <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-warzone-2-review-al-mazrah-shines/1900-6418003/">Al Mazrah is one of Warzone's strongest maps</a> for standard battle royale. Al Mazrah featured one of the most vibrant designs, and there was a nice map flow with plenty of diverse locations. Unfortunately, Al Mazrah struggled with popularity since it was tied to the controversial design changes.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone 2.0 introduced a complex backpack system and slower looting mechanics, all of which tanked the pace of the game, and it felt like a huge regression from what made Warzone's gameplay feel so satisfying in the beginning. You could no longer get propelled into the action, instead needing to slow down, sort through a backpack of items, and take more precaution to make sure you had the right gear equipped. Even the gulag became an overcomplicated and less satisfying experience, with the addition of a miniboss and a 2v2 teamwork approach.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite Warzone 2.0's backpedaling, I feel confident that if Al Mazrah returned in the present time with Black Ops 6's omnimovement and classic gameplay mechanics, the map would be much more popular today.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone 2.0 also wasn't all doom and gloom. There was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzones-new-the-boys-superpowers-are-great-but-they-dont-belong-everywhere/1100-6515928/">huge crossover with The Boys that gave everyone superpowers</a> on Al Mazrah, and it was a blast to teleport around the map or use Homelander's laser-eye attack. The Haunting event for that year was also really well designed, which included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-dmz-how-to-beat-all-operation-nightmare-bosses/1100-6518466/">crossover with Diablo IV and a variety of minibosses to fight</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Resurgence</h2><p dir="ltr">Much of this trip down memory lane focuses on big maps and standard battle royale, but Call of Duty has experimented with various game modes and maps since Warzone's inception. One of the biggest additions was the highly popular Resurgence respawn modes on a variety of small maps over the years, including Rebirth Island, Fortune's Keep, Ashika Island, Vondel, and most recently, the Black Ops-themed Area 99 map. Warzone didn't even have a Resurgence mode until Black Ops Cold War's integration, but now, a lot of the content seems to shift in the direction of these smaller map experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the most interesting game modes for Modern Warfare 3's era of Warzone took place on Rebirth Island instead of the big map. 2024's The Haunting event added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzones-new-purgatory-ltm-cant-be-won-and-thats-why-its-great/1100-6526671/">unique sandbox-style mode called Purgatory</a>, which didn't provide players with any clear way of winning the match and instead seemed to be more focused on letting players choose how they wanted to play. There were spooky and whimsical elements for the Halloween festivities, but mostly, Purgatory was a chill and welcome way to level up weapons, unlock camos, and complete challenges with your friends.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465887-purgatory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465887" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465887-purgatory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465887"></a><figcaption>Rebirth Island's Purgatory mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465887-purgatory.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When asked what led to the creation of this mode, and if the reception was positive enough to warrant another sandbox-style mode in the future, Pete Actipis revealed that Purgatory had great reception and anything is possible for the future. "We love exploring," Actipis said. "And that's the whole point of these limited-time modes. We want to introduce new and interesting ways of playing. We want to introduce new types of mechanics and reach new audiences. So, doing a mode like Purgatory makes sense."</p><h2 dir="ltr">The present state of Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Present-day Warzone's big-map battle royale is played on Urzikstan, which was introduced with Modern Warfare 3. Urzikstan is solid in terms of the overall design, but this map has received very few changes since its arrival in December of 2023. The setting has grown drab, and all the buildings just start to look the same. Until the more recent addition of Ranked Play on Urzikstan, the map has felt largely abandoned, as most of Warzone's updates and interesting events take place on the smaller Resurgence maps.</p><p dir="ltr">When I asked about these lack of map updates, Actipis told me the developers try to be smart about how they use the resources within Warzone. "It's a big project, and we try to provide the best value we can to the players." Additionally, Actipis revealed that players can expect more balance for content in the future, saying, "We have lots of great plans moving forward of how we're going to equitably distribute content to make sure all player types in all modes are getting fed [in] a little bit more balanced [way]."</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 did bring improvements to Warzone by removing the backpacks and simplifying the looting of the past two years, and the game's omnimovement spices up the gunfights, but it just doesn't feel like enough to make Urizkstan feel satisfying to play.</p><p dir="ltr">As a longtime fan of Warzone, I'm sad to admit that Call of Duty's current "big map" experience for battle royale has grown so stale that I mostly find myself dropping into the smaller and more chaotic Resurgence matches.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465888-warzone1b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465888" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465888-warzone1b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465888"></a><figcaption>Urzikstan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465888-warzone1b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Urzikstan's lack of content also puts Warzone in an awkward slump in a time when it's getting even harder to keep a battle royale fresh and hold players' interest, especially when none of them come close to the production level and style of Fortnite's in-game events. Call of Duty has been nailing the major IP-crossovers like this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-might-include-a-paid-event-pass-for-squid-game-collab/1100-6528608/">Squid Game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-reloaded-adds-tmnt-event-plus-splinter-included-in-paid-pass/2900-6270/">TMNT events</a>, but they don't always translate well into Warzone modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there is a growing worry that Warzone being tied to each yearly Call of Duty title is holding the battle royale back from continued success. With each year's integration, Warzone seems to be disrupted with broken perks, frustrating bugs, and constant overhauls to the game's mechanics. The battle royale never truly gets to have its own unique identity, and by the time enough seasonal improvements are made to Warzone, a new year begins with a host of new problems to solve.</p><p dir="ltr">All other issues aside, it must be mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-rampant-cheating-activision-finally-responds/1100-6528903/">Call of Duty continues to struggle against cheaters</a>, so much so that Activision has finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-finally-let-players-disable-cross-play-for-ranked-play/1100-6528900/">allowed players to turn off cross-play for Ranked Play modes</a>. Warzone has had hacking issues from the start with Verdansk, but the game didn't launch with an anti-cheat system in place. Warzone Pacific introduced Call of Duty's Ricochet anti-cheat, but despite its efforts, each era of Warzone still suffered from lengthy cycles of hacking.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Future of Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">As for the future of Warzone, it's unclear how much success nostalgia can bring for Season 3 and beyond. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-devs-shows-off-faithful-recreation-of-verdansk/1100-6530323/">Verdansk is returning as a remake of the original design</a>, with new technology allowing for improved graphics and lighting. Etienne Pouliot provided further insight into Verdansk's new look, revealing that the visuals include enhanced textures, improved player perspectives, and better visibility.</p><p dir="ltr">The developers expressed that the map remake is for the fans and meant to be faithful to the original design. "We're making sure we don't forget any small details from back then. So, it's not something different. It's really the best version of Verdansk," Pouliot said. "It's just a big commitment to all the players who loved that map and experience."</p><p dir="ltr">"Verdansk holds a special place in my heart," Grigsby said, reminiscing about the map. "Not only does it reign supreme as the iconic map that started it all, but I’m hyped to relive the vibe we all felt back then. The memories of looting in Farmland, then trekking through Downtown with all that verticality, wondering where the circle was going to push us next."</p><p dir="ltr">Pouliot also confirmed the map would allow for swimming. There's only a small area of water featured on the southern portion of Verdansk, and the developer said, "It's not a big game-changer, but it is a nice addition that's no longer a dead zone."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465889-verdanskdeepdivevideo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465889" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465889-verdanskdeepdivevideo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465889"></a><figcaption>Warzone's Verdansk remake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4465889-verdanskdeepdivevideo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We don't perceive that as being a major component to how the game flows," Actipis added. "That is the only place on the map where there is any sort of swimmable water, but the whole idea is that we don't want to take control away or make it feel lousy in any part of the map."</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also be saying goodbye to Urzikstan. The developers confirmed that Verdansk will be the only playable big map for Season 3 of Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past, we've only had map rotation for the small Resurgence maps. When I asked if Warzone could eventually add in big-map rotation, it didn't sound hopeful for fans of the standard battle royale. "It's a complicated problem," Actipis explained. "Development is difficult on maintaining multiple big maps and keeping those up and running with all of the latest changes that are happening. Memory is a component of it. Disk space. There are a lot of different things."</p><p dir="ltr">"For the moment, we're focused on creating the best experience on Verdansk possible and not distributing our resources and losing the focus of the moment of coming back with the classic Verdansk experience," Actipis continued.</p><p dir="ltr">While I am very excited to drop back into my favorite places like Boneyard and Prison, I'm also reminding myself that Verdansk likely won't feel the same. The fights will surely be different, as Call of Duty's movement has evolved into more complex omnimovement, and most Warzone engagements play more aggressively and less campy than they did five years ago. Verdansk will also carry a different vibe in 2025 with squads composed of Ninja Turtles, stoner iguanas, and Cheech and Chong.</p><p dir="ltr">And personally, I don't think there's anything Call of Duty can do to truly recreate the magic of Warzone's first year. The friendships and memories formed during lockdown are hard to duplicate, and I don't want to suffer through another pandemic to try. However, the return of Verdansk has the potential to still be successful, and I truly want to drop into a match and fall in love with big map Warzone again. It will likely require thoughtful updates, fresh events, and harder-working anti-cheat, but I still believe this battle royale has life left to breathe.</p>

<p>We awarded RoboCop: Rogue City three stars on its release. "While Rogue City might not do much that's new, it is for the most part a convincing facsimile of the old," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robocop-rogue-city-review">Eurogamer's RoboCop: Rogue City review</a>.</p>
<p>"Alongside being Teyon's best game, Rogue City is a welcome example of a style of game that doesn't get made much anymore. At some point during the 2010s, the upstart AA contender was brutally shot to death by a cackling gang of megabudget prestige titles and worthy indie games. In Rogue City, Teyon has brought it back to life, armed, armoured, and ready for duty."</p>
<p>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre also got three Eurogamer stars on release. "A delightfully macabre homage, this asymmetrical horror could finally threaten <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>'s crown, if you didn't spend more time fighting the servers than Leatherface himself," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review">Eurogamer's Texas Chain Saw Massacre review</a>.</p>
<p>RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker's Memory will be available for those on PS Plus to claim until 5th May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-relics-update-lets-players-become-palaeontologists/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hello Games is back today with a new No Man's Sky update called RELICS. As you might assume from its title, this patch introduces a way for players to become palaeontologists. They'll be able to excavate the skeletal remains of alien creatures that once inhabited the various worlds. As they discover new bones, players can then assemble them according to their own designs. They can even create their own museums or share their collections with other players.</p>
<p>There is a huge variety of procedurally generated prehistoric bones of all shapes and sizes to excavate and collect. It's up to the No Man's Sky community to assemble them, and the studio reckons fans will have a lot of fun creating increasingly outrageous skeletons to display in their bases-turned-museums or share with other players.</p>
<p>The relics out there to be discovered vary in rarity, so you never know what you're going to unearth. There's a real thrill when you find something really rare. The most unusual finds are worth a lot, too, and for those looking to complete the collection, Hello Games introduced a specialist to barter with at the Space Station.</p>
<p>A new RELICS themed community expedition will be launched soon, focusing on palaeontology and challenging players to compete for the rarest finds. This expedition also unlocks an exclusive living fossil companion, which was described as a loyal, fleshless creature of animated bone.</p>
<p>That said, it won't be just a simple matter of collecting old bones. Sometimes, there might even be dangerous creatures guarding some of these treasures, such as Stone Spirits, the Stone Golem, and the skeletal Titan Worm.</p>

<p>Hello Games then said the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/massive-update-releases-for-no-mans-sky-adding-new-storyline-deep-sea-diving-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Part II</a> update saw No Man's Sky spike to some of its highest player figures at this time of the year. Overall, the game continues to improve and expand at a steady rate. Meanwhile, the community's sentiment grows ever stronger, as evidenced by the fact that its user reviews <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are finally 'Very Positive'</a> on average after years in the Mostly Negative and Mixed ranges.</p>

According to a report in <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/not-so-permadeath-blizzard-revives-hardcore-wow-characters-killed-by-ddos-attacks/">Ars Technica</a></em>, Blizzard made the pronouncement in response to a string of DDoS attacks that seemed specifically targeted to cause the in-game deaths of members of a high-profile raiding guild.</p><p>Hardcode mode was introduced with <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>. It’s a super intense, extremely difficult style of play where a character’s death is permanent no matter how it comes — whether it be falling in a mythic difficulty dungeon, getting ganked in PvP, or simply getting overrun by level 1 boars — is permanent. In regular <em>WoW</em>, characters can come back from or cheat death with a variety of mechanics which are disabled in Hardcore. The game mode has other adjustments, like requiring players to manually set their PvP flag, that Blizzard made to make the mode slightly less punishing.</p><p>Until now, there were no exceptions to the policy even in situations outside of a player’s control such as a death suffered during disconnection from the game server. And it seems like malicious actors were exploiting that strict policy to cause the deaths of members of a popular streaming guild OnlyFangs. According to <em>Ars Technica</em>, DDoS attacks seemed to coincide with the guild’s raiding attempts causing the permadeath of several members. The attacks were so frequent that soadapoppin, a popular Twitch streamer and OnlyFangs’ member, suggested that the guild might need to shutter operations indefinitely unless some kind of protections were put in place.</p><p>Blizzard addressed the issue on the <em>World of Warcraft</em> forums saying that it is aware of the targeted nature of the DDoS attacks and are taking steps to rollback some player deaths</p><p>“We’re taking steps to resurrect player-characters that were lost as a result of these attacks,” wrote <em>WoW Classic</em> associate production director Clay Stone. “In the future, Blizzard may elect — at our sole discretion — to revive Hardcore characters that perish in a mass event which we deem inconsistent with the integrity of the game, such as a DDoS attack.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2026 film is the next big crossover in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and will also bring Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689">back into the fold as Doctor Doom</a></span>. But now we’re getting a long, drawn-out cast announcement confirming which MCU heroes will be facing off against Doctor Doom next year.</p><p>The stream is lingering on shots of director’s chairs featuring different actors’ names on them. The first one was Thor actor <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong>, who was last seen in <em>Thor: Love and Thunder </em>in 2022. After several minutes of hanging out on his chair, the camera panned right to reveal a chair with <strong>Vanessa Kirby’s</strong> name printed on it. Kirby is playing Sue “Invisible Woman” Storm in <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps, </em>which will premiere on July 25. However, she was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already confirmed for the film last year</a></span>, so that’s not new. Third up is <strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>, the new Captain America, who just starred in <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> in February. Fourth revealed is <strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>, who plays the Winter Soldier, and will star in <em>Thunderbolts* </em>on May 2.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Next is <strong>Letitia Wright</strong>, who plays Shuri, the new Black Panther who took on the title in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>. <strong>Paul Rudd </strong>got a tiny chair because he’s Ant-Man who can become a little guy. The camera panned back up to normal human-sized chairs, revealing <strong>Wyatt Russell </strong>will return as U.S. Agent after reprising the role in <em>Thunderbolts*</em>. <strong>Tenoch Huerta Mejía </strong>will return as Namor after playing the sea-faring villain in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>. <strong>Ebon Moss-Bachrach </strong>is the second of the Fantastic Four to join the cast after portraying the Thing in <em>First Steps</em>. <strong>Simu Liu </strong>will reprise his role as Shangi-Chi, which I’m sure he’s happy about considering the martial arts movie’s sequel has been pushed down the assembly line after director Destin Daniel Cretton was moved onto the next <em>Spider-Man </em>movie.</p><p>That’s all we’ve seen thus far. I mean, I guess if you want to keep something in the conversation all day, one way to do that is to drag an announcement out for hours. It seems like they’re revealing a new cast member roughly every 10 minutes. Right now, there haven’t been any surprises, so hopefully, there will be someone unexpected at some point to make these theatrics worthwhile.
