                <p>A new competitive mode called Seek and Deploy Extraction is coming to Halo Infinite this year, and to celebrate, Halo Studios has partnered with ForgeHub for a contest to build a multiplayer map for it. The event runs now through May 13 and features a $20,000 prize pool.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios recently released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sCBLERWYs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sneak-peek video on YouTube</a>--seen below--for S&amp;D Extraction that included info on the Halo Infinite map contest. The first-place winner will take home $5,000, with the runner-up receiving $4,000, per <a href="https://www.forgehub.com/events/contests/12631" rel="nofollow ">ForgeHub's website</a>. Additionally, only one 4-vs-4 arena can be created per person for this event, though people can collaborate in teams.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3sCBLERWYs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E3sCBLERWYs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Halo Infinite's take on the tactical competitive mode--think Counter-Strike--will see squads of four rotating between offense (planting the bomb) and defense (stopping the bomb) each round. Winning six rounds first in S&amp;D Extraction will see your team come away victorious. The video notes that players won't have to "worry about carrying a bomb," as a designated area will prompt you to plant it. The starting weapon for Spartans is the Bandit Evo, though you can buy different weapons and equipment between rounds.</p><p dir="ltr">One mode that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-battle-royale-mode-could-have-been-a-game-changer-dev-says/1100-6527192/">seemingly not coming to Halo Infinite is a battle-royale experience</a>. A developer who reportedly worked on the game's multiplayer mode claimed it had the chance to be "a game-changer for the franchise." Last month, however, did see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-doesnt-have-a-fuel-rod-cannon-but-will-have-a-rocket-that-fires-fuel-rods/1100-6529207/">the addition of a new power weapon that fired fuel rods</a> for the FPS.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">there are multiple Halo games in the works utilizing Unreal Engine 5</a>.

		<p>Double Cross Studio and publisher 2P Games have confirmed that the twisted card game Sultan’s Game will be released on March 31st for PC via Steam. Sultan’s Game has the label of being a twisted narrative card game because you, as his advisor, have to complete different acts within a week or suffer the consquences of failure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sultan's Game | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8KOjHJ-_As?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Sultan’s Game&nbsp;is finally launching soon and we appreciate the overwhelming support from the community along the way,”</em> said Yin Li, Producer and Developer, Double Cross Studio. <em>“Both long-time supporters and newcomers will be able to immerse themselves in the Sultan’s turbulent world soon; stay tuned for the upcoming new information!”</em></p>
<p>Every seven days in Sultan’s Game players draw one of four card types; Carnality, Extravagance, Conquer, and Bloodshed. Carnality cards instruct players to seek pleasures of the body like sex, Extravagance instructs players to spend obscene amounts without a care, Conquer sends players on adventures to complete, and Bloodshed demands a blood sacrifice to please the Sultan. To complete these demands, players will be navigating court politics, the back alleys of the city, and wandering into brothels. Every decision made will have an impact on relationships with other people in your life from political rivals, allies, and family members. The various paths will lead to a variety of different endings, with decisions allowing you to try and control the Sultan, to outright killing him.</p>

<p>There is a demo available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game/">Sultan’s Game on Steam</a> right now.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Take this Down: Being an Accurate Accounting of Doty and Taryon Darrington in the Basilisk’s Den</em>&nbsp;Barber manages to embody the voice and observations of an Automaton that has a vocabulary smaller than can be counted on two hands. Picking up in the Mincing Mongoose Tavern the quick talking Taryon is matched in pace by the intuitive and calculated observations of Doty, and TechRaptor has been provided with an exclusive excerpt.</p>

<p>Tary and Doty are about to be greeted by a group of adventurers looking to hire some assistance to take on a Basilisk that has been terrorizing the town of Lichenvel. This new party is comprised of a half-orc and two Eisfuura, a race of birdfolk on Exandria.</p>

<h2>Excerpt from&nbsp;<em>Take this Down: Being an Accurate Accounting of Doty and Taryon Darrington in the Basilisk’s Den</em>, by Jess Barber</h2>

<hr><p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{96}" paraid="1618617820">Current location: The Mincing Mongoose Tavern, Beaded Alley, Port Damali, Menagerie Coast, Wildemount, Exandria, Mortal Plane. Recommended maximum occupancy: seventy-five medium-sized creatures. Current occupancy: six.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{110}" paraid="1225477402"><em>The tavern where I established myself to commence the search for questing partners was a squalid little affair in the most dangerous part of town, absolutely teeming with cutthroats and villains. Risky, yes, but a necessary evil if I wanted to find like-minded compatriots willing to brave the trials and hardships of adventuring life. As I swilled rotgut whiskey, the only thing the tavern had on offer, I returned the steely-eyed glares of the other patrons, and wondered whether I would manage to escape with my life.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{116}" paraid="1369027242">"Are you still working on your wine there, m'dear?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{126}" paraid="275252197"><em>Name: Hilda Thurgood. Occupation: Tavern Proprietress. Ancestry: Gnomish. Apron: Blue Gingham. Cheeks: Rosy.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{132}" paraid="23731557">"Oh dear, is it not to your liking?" Hilda's brow furrowed in concern as she noted Tary's mostly-full glass. "It's one of my favorite vintages, but I suppose it is a little on the sweet side. Shall I bring you something else to try?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{142}" paraid="1593204177">"Oh! No, no, it's quite delightful, actually." Tary turned on his most sparkling smile. "The perfect terroir for my palate. In fact, I was just about to ask if you had any additional recommendations. It's so difficult to find a good sommelier these days, one must cherish the opportunity when one can."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{150}" paraid="746195104">Hilda's cheeks grew even rosier. "Well, that's awfully kind of you to say. I was actually just sampling from a new vineyard in Kamordah—" She was cut off by the bell on the tavern door jingling cheerfully.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{164}" paraid="1621728785"><em>New occupant analysis: Ancestry: Human. Age: Early thirties. Hair: Close-cropped black curls. Eyes: Dark, with a roguish sparkle. Lips: Full, with the slightest smiling tilt, hinting at shared secrets. Shoulders: Broad. Jawline: Chiseled.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{170}" paraid="1713494016">Tary was no longer looking at Hilda, his attention having shifted fully to the new patron. His heart rate had increased approximately ten percent. Doty recalled the protagonists from Tary's favorite romance novels, and Lawrence, and in general the sort of faces that tended to lead to Tary making bad decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{176}" paraid="996700783">This was concerning.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{182}" paraid="821747334">The human lifted a hand in Tary and Doty's general direction, smiling. He had a tiny, fetching gap between his front teeth. "Afternoon!" he said. "You wouldn't happen to be Sir Darrington, would you? The one looking for a new adventuring party?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{188}" paraid="590837791">"Wh—" said Tary. "I'm—was I—oh! Sir Darrington. Yes. Yes! Indeed, that's me. Please, do sit. All of you."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{198}" paraid="570955009"><em>Analyzing additional party members. One: larger-than-average half-orc. Long tusks, roughspun clothing, significant tattoo coverage. Analysis: Intimidating. Two: smaller-than-average eisfuura. Fluffy feathers, jaunty cap, leather vest with elaborate stitching. Analysis: Adorable.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{214}" paraid="723162557">It took a little doing to replace two of the chairs with a bench capable of supporting the half-orc's weight, but eventually the newcomers got settled in around the table, with the concerningly handsome human sitting catty-corner to Tary—a little closer to Tary, in fact, than Doty would like. "I'm Clarke," he said, extending a hand, which Tary shook warmly.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{220}" paraid="904875354">"Charmed, I'm sure," said Tary. "And your friends?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{226}" paraid="947337582">&nbsp;"This is Dayner—" The small eisfuura. "And Bex." The half-orc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{240}" paraid="1357058711">"Pleasure," chirped Dayner, extending a wing to Tary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{f11b0dcd-820f-446b-8980-86b8d9141e13}{250}" paraid="843914930">Tary took careful hold of the longest primary feathers. "The pleasure is all mine."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{1}" paraid="1402955125">Bex lifted one large hand in a wave. "Hope you don't mind if I don't shake your hand," she said. Her voice was much quieter than Doty expected, and a little shy. Up close, he could see she had an assortment of twigs and dried leaves carefully woven into the unkempt reddish-brown curls of her hair. "Sometimes I accidentally, uh." She made a crushing gesture with both hands that very effectively conveyed broken bones, snapped ligaments, and general agony.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{7}" paraid="621031090">"When you put it like that, I certainly don't mind at all," said Tary. "And while we're at it, let me introduce my traveling companion, Doty. Say hello, Doty."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{13}" paraid="746592624"><em>Creak</em>, said Doty.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{23}" paraid="1230810895">"<em>Fascinating</em>," said Clarke. "Your flyer mentioned an automaton, but I'll admit this isn't what I was expecting. Where did you get it?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{33}" paraid="62174805">"Well," said Tary, "I built him."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{39}" paraid="1187222330">"Built! Well, damn." Clarke sat back, looking impressed. "You really are an inventor and an adventurer, huh. I figured that was an exaggeration, but I see now it wasn't one bit."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{49}" paraid="1475600979">"Oh, well." Tary's cheeks pinked. "I like to stay busy, I suppose. You mentioned you saw my flyer…?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{59}" paraid="1111385143">"Right, your flyer. We saw it down by the waterway this morning, and as soon as I read it I thought, maybe we could help you. Or, more accurately, we thought maybe <em>you </em>could help <em>us</em>."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{77}" paraid="1855420558">"Please," said Tary, leaning forward and balancing his chin on his hand. "Say more."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{83}" paraid="1140380410"><em>Body angle: Fifteen degree incline toward conversational partner. Blink ratio: One-point-seven times standard. Currently remaining below threshold for 'fluttering eyelashes'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{103}" paraid="1002606636">Clarke smiled, leaning forward, too, until the angle of his body matched Tary's. When he braced his elbows on the table, the swell of his biceps strained the fabric of his shirt.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{109}" paraid="841066796">This was very concerning.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{115}" paraid="1348720607">"Let me start at the beginning," said Clarke. "There's a small fishing village about a day's ride from here, name of Lichenvel. They've been having trouble lately with a basilisk. It's just been a general nuisance so far: getting into the storehouses, interfering with the catch, that sort of business. So far, nobody's been hurt, but, well." His expression grew somber. "I'm sure a seasoned adventurer such as yourself is familiar with basilisks. You know as well as I do that it's only a matter of time."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{139}" paraid="404277764">If Clarke noticed the delay, he didn't show it. He continued, "They put out a call for help, and we answered. The three of us have traveled together a long time, doing this sort of work. For coin, of course,&nbsp; but we also try to do some good in the world, and we're no strangers to monster-hunting.

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{159}" paraid="1441881376">Clarke winced, and Bex stopped, frowning. "Sorry," said Clarke. "There's been some—inter-team conflict—"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{165}" paraid="663646985">"We got ditched," interrupted Dayner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{175}" paraid="517993732">Clarke sighed, rubbing his forehead. "One of our members abandoned us. It's not that the three of us aren't capable—we've taken on plenty of challenges on our own. But Swink was a skilled warrior, and to defeat a basilisk, you need someone who knows how to handle a sword. And that's not any of us."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{185}" paraid="281501348">"It's not?" asked Tary. Doty calculated that the natural variation in Tary's line of sight had decreased significantly, in a way that indicated Tary was trying very hard to keep his focus on Clarke's face and nowhere else. "I'm just—surprised," Tary said, when Clarke looked puzzled. "You look like you might have trained a bit, is all."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{195}" paraid="1267103819">Dayner covered her beak with a wing, muffling a cough. The blood flow to Tary's cheeks doubled.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{203}" paraid="12693597">"That's kind of you to say," said Clarke. "I mean, I do carry this." He gestured to a dagger slung at his waist; fairly standard-issue adventuring gear. "But honestly that's mostly for show. Really, I'm more of an academic. Here, look—may I?"&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{213}" paraid="563580536">There was a bit of spare thread clinging to the collar of Tary's cloak. Clarke reached long, elegant fingers towards it, then looked up at Tary, waiting for permission.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{219}" paraid="1312901962">Tary, holding his breath, nodded.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{225}" paraid="972174843">Clarke plucked the thread away from the fabric of Tary's cloak, and made a flourishing little gesture. There was a spark, and then, instead of the thread, he was holding a sleek, green feather.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{235}" paraid="470655775">"Of course," said Clarke. "I have plenty of spells in my repertoire that can hit harder in a fight; it's not all parlor tricks. But I'd barely know the pointy end of the sword from… the other one."&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{0d1f3758-db00-4dc8-81d4-056c902fc693}{241}" paraid="1517605121">"The hilt," said Tary. <em>Expression: Helplessly Charmed.</em>&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naoki-yoshida-square-enix-directors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida has seemingly been removed from Square Enix's list of its board of directors, suggesting that he's either been removed from the post or that he's voluntarily stepped down.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enixs-naoki-yoshida-no-longer-on-companys-board-of-directors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, a recent Square Enix <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/en/news/files/9ac53f2f381de8e15cecedaae031d93e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> regarding a change in executive structure names Yoshida as an executive officer rather than a director, although he's still listed as a director on the company's official <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/officer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">executive list</a>.</p>

<p>While it's possible Yoshida has been demoted to executive officer rather than executive director, it's also possible he's finally been allowed to step down; he said <a href="https://dotesports.com/ff/news/square-enix-wont-let-naoki-yoshida-leave-its-board-of-directors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in 2023</a> that he "[doesn't] want to be on the board" and that "it's much more fun just to make games".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-producer-naoki-yoshida-square-enix-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=mbsA4oCk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-producer-naoki-yoshida-square-enix-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=fTHbn7zq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida may have been demoted from his position as executive director, but he may also simply have stepped down.</figcaption></figure><p>If Yoshida has indeed been demoted against his will, it may well have something to do with the fact that one of the games in which he was heavily involved, 2023's&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>

<p>However, it's also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s most recent expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" rel="nofollow">along with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remaster</em></a>,&nbsp;contributed to a softening of what might otherwise have been a rough quarter for Square Enix.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely possible that the situation is a mixture of both; Yoshida wanted to step down, and thanks to the lackluster performance of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, he was allowed to do so.</p>

<p>Since there hasn't been any kind of official announcement from either Yoshida or Square Enix specifically regarding his change in role, it's hard to say, but I'm sure Yoshida is much happier away from the board.</p>

<p>Samsung has taken to the stage at MWC 2025 to unveil a stunning lineup of technology ranging from new OLED television sets to immense gaming monitors – and everything in between. The set included an incredible <strong>500 Hz OLED monitor </strong>and a gorgeous 240 Hz OLED laptop – and a conceptual handheld gaming device <strong>that folds in the middle</strong>.</p>



<p>This is following on from Samsung’s success with foldable mobile phones and tablets, and it’s a natural enough progression point, but is anyone asking for it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-foldable-gaming-experiences">Foldable Gaming Experiences</h2>



<p>At MWC 2025, <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Samsung revealed</a> Flex Gaming, a conceptual device with a 7.2-inch screen that folds down the middle for ease of storage. It was revealed at the showcase, and a demo was held, but it wasn’t confirmed if the device was usable.</p>



<p>It looks as though it boasts a relatively traditional layout featuring a pair of joysticks and a d-pad, but there’s a recess on either side of the device. This is to allow the joysticks to ‘enter’ the device when it’s collapsed, which means it takes up even less space. </p>



<p>It was sat alongside a Steam Deck and Razer Blade 16, and all these devices were being used to run KRAFTON’s ‘popular games’, which included InZOI, a realistic competitor to The Sims.</p>



<p>Tech aficionados flocked to the event to check out Samsung’s new 77-inch QD-OLED televisions, as well as a 31.5-inch QD-OLED monitor, both of which boast utterly remarkably visuals and colour expression.</p>



<p>One of the more bizarre elements of the Samsung lineup was the Flexible Cabinbag, a bag-like device that unfolds into an 18.1-inch display. It can be compacted to fit inside a briefcase, and it comes equipped with – you guessed it – an OLED screen. That’s the order of the day where Samsung is concerned.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d invest in a folding handheld gaming device? Let us know in the comments.</p>

All game data has been completed, and we are currently making the final balance adjustments. Compared to the version shown at Tokyo Game Show 2024, it has become even more fun. After release, I’d love to jump into online play and enjoy it together with everyone!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>I believe that once you try the full version, you’ll find yourself thinking like: “Oh? This is even more fun than I expected!” → “Wait, this is seriously amazing!” → “Wow?! So many things to explore!”</p><p>In terms of content volume, this is the largest <em>FANTASY LIFE</em> game yet in every aspect. I apologize for the delay in the release, but this extra time has allowed us to bring full multi-platform support, cross-save (so you can carry your save data across different consoles), and cross-play (letting players on different platforms enjoy online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [454 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> together). We’ve also made major user interface improvements, ensuring a more polished and seamless experience. Now, we’re finally bringing this game to completion in the best possible form. Please look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Behind this Project…</strong></p><p>In mid-2024, <em>FANTASY LIFE</em> faced an unexpected challenge. At that time, producer Keiji Inafune left the company, and we had to reassess and restructure the project.</p><p>Meanwhile, internal test players had given the game harsh evaluations, making it clear that major revisions were necessary. In response, I decided to take on the role of producer, shifting the core development team from Osaka to our headquarters.</p><p>While the Osaka team had been dedicated from the start, the project evolved into a collective effort across our whole company—with developers from Fukuoka, Tokyo and beyond, we were able to significantly strengthen our development capabilities.</p><p>This restructuring allowed us to expand the team and create an environment where we could focus on fine-tuning the game’s quality right up until the very end.</p><p>From that point onward, we undertook a complete overhaul of the game: adding <a title="Genres > Open-World [574 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> exploration and parkour-style <a title="Genres > Action [2,530 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, restructuring the system’s progression flow, improving the core mechanics, and refining the scenario to be even more emotionally impactful.</p><p>Thanks to the solid foundation of the game’s core mechanics, these additions didn’t just fit in—they enhanced what was already great about the game, making the experience significantly more enjoyable. The improvements received high praise from our internal testers too, marking a major milestone: <em>FANTASY LIFE i</em> was finally nearing completion after its long development journey.</p><p>For us, watching Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka (and Hokkaido, too!) come together as one to push the game’s quality to a higher level was a powerful reminder of the true joy in creating a large-scale game.</p><p>The day that we can deliver the ultimate Fantasy Life experience to all of you is almost here! Get ready for it!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Joe and Anthony Russo's new Netflix movie, The Electric State, is getting a tie-in game. The game is called The Electric State: Kid Cosmo, and it's a prequel to the movie.</p><p>Described as a "bite-sized adventure puzzle game," Kid Cosmo focuses on the movie's characters Michelle and Chris. The game is described as being a "narrative-driven game" and taking place over the course of five years. You can <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see footage of the game at Variety</a>.</p><p>Kid Cosmo launches on March 18 for iOS and Android--only Netflix subscribers can get it. As for the movie, the film debuts on Netflix on March 14.</p><p>The game hails from the Russo brothers' production company, AGBO, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-hemsworths-netflix-movie-extraction-might-become-a-game-under-agbos-new-deal-with-nexon/1100-6499357/" data-ref-id="1100-6499357">received $400 million in funding from gaming giant Nexon in 2022 to produce video games.</a> Anthony Russo told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game, which focuses on the characters Michelle and Chris, will provide more depth than what's possible in the movie alone.</p><p>"There's just a limit in a two-hour medium to how much ground you can cover, in terms of story. So the game does hold something very special in terms of like, who these people are, what their relationship is to one another, and how it evolves and grows over time," he said.

		<p>Rockstar Games has announced it is acquiring the Australian based game developer Video Games Deluxe, though it has not disclosed the fee. Video Games Deluxe has been a long time partner studio of Rockstar Games, having worked on the re-release of LA Noire and LA Noire: The VR Files, along with updating Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. Going forward, the name Video Games Deluxe will be dropped and the studio renamed to Rockstar Australia.</p>

<p><em>“After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia,</em>” said Rockstar Games Head of Publishing, Jennifer Kolbe in a statement.</p>
<p><em>“It’s been an honor to work closely with&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;this past decade,”</em> said Video Games Deluxe founder&nbsp;Brendan McNamara. <em>“We are thrilled to be a part of&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.”</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe was born out of the ashes of Team Bondi, developer of LA Noire, and was founded by Brendan McNamara. We do not know what this means going forward. It could be that Rockstar Australia will support with content and updates for Grand Theft Auto VI, or it could be a signal of intent by Rockstar to have another studio out there that can create more games.</p>

After playing a few hours of Sandfall Interactive’s dark fantasy RPG, I can say that <em>Expedition 33 </em>grasps the melodrama of modern <em>Final Fantasy</em> and marries it with the tactical turn-based combat fans of that series have been craving a return to for decades. On top of this, the game also has a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like timing mechanic to make that combat about more than just picking which attacks and items you use during a turn. Sandfall Interactive is cooking with some excellent ingredients, and the small taste I’ve gotten has me eager to try the full meal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195840" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Take A Tour Through Halo Infinite's Newest Arena Maps" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="284" data-playlist="195840,196789,195624" data-current="195840"><div><p>Take A Tour Through Halo Infinite's Newest Arena Maps</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21353.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If I wasn’t already on board for the incredible voice cast led by standouts like <em>Daredevil</em> actor Charlie Cox, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s Jennifer English, and Clive Rosfield himself, Ben Starr, I would have been pulled in by <em>Expedition 33</em>’s tragic premise. In this world, a malevolent sorceress paints a number each year, and everyone in the world who is of that age is Thanos-snapped away. The titular expedition is made up of people who go on a journey to try and stop her, but even in thee early hours I played, there’s little hope that they’ll actually succeed. The expedition seems more concerned with carving a path for those who eventually can. No one hopes for much in a world where everything you know and love can be gone in the stroke of a paintbrush. Growing old is so improbable that meeting a senior citizen is like finding a member of an endangered species. The world of <em>Expedition 33</em> feels so far gone to the cast trying to save it that the act of trying feels like a futile suicide mission. It is deliciously dreary, like listening to the most heartbreaking emo song I’d ever heard on a loop, reveling in the melancholy just to feel something.</p><p>In the short time I got to play <em>Expedition 33</em>, it introduced plenty of lore and jargon that I hope will make more sense when seen in the context of the full game, but even if I don’t know what all its proper nouns mean yet, I’m already intrigued by how the game commits to a broken world that feels beyond saving. And yet, the party moves forward anyway. It’s tantalizing, and luckily the turn-based combat is just as compelling.</p><figure id="" data-id="e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-recommend-id="image://e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-recommend-id="image://e18f6a0cb0166d95480e9d340e0c092c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A turn-based battle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Expedition 33 </em>has most of the standard pillars of a turn-based battle system such as elemental weaknesses and party members who specialize in different roles. But there’s a refreshing blend of active combat systems to make fights feel more involved and less repetitive. Each character has original mechanics; as he uses standard attacks, for instance, the swordsman Gustave builds up a reserve of stored power which you can unleash after you’ve charged up enough for your liking, while the mage Lune makes use of “stains” that can be inflicted upon foes and used to increase the power of certain spell combinations. But in between those strategic decisions, you also have quick time events to juice up attacks, ranged attacks that you aim by hand to target weak points, and a dodge and parry mechanic to waste your opponents’ turns. I enjoy these defensive options in premise, but I’m not sold on the execution of them just yet. Some attacks that enemies dish out have a rhythmic quality that makes them easy to read and execute dodges or parries. Others feel more clunky, arbitrary, and difficult to react to. Some of that game sense will likely come with more time, but it was still a frustrating obstacle in some of the more difficult boss fights.</p><p>That small wrinkle aside, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> oozes drama, tactical depth, and style. I can’t wait to dive into it when the game launches on April 25. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-champions-release%E2%80%94platforms-everything-we-know.1123728/</guid>

<p>Whisper it, but the release of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions instantly gives a Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling. The Pokémon&nbsp;Company surprised everyone with its announcement, but now it’s out in the wild, it’s time to prepare yourself for battle.</p>



<p>Older Pokémon&nbsp;fans will remember the glory of Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium 1 and 2. The larger-than-life titles focused on the series’ core combat and head-to-head encounters. Exhilarating battles brought to life in huge arenas with flashy visuals and sizzling sound effects. The last 25 years have seen a slew of Pokémon&nbsp;titles, but none similar to Stadium. </p>



<p>Say hello to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Champions</a>—a seemingly spiritual successor to the Stadium years. It’s an entirely new AAA release, and its launch might surprise you for a couple of reasons.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-pokemon-champions-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stadium vibes. Credit to The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions doesn’t have a release date or an estimated window. All we know for sure is it’s “Now in Development,” and updates on its progress will arrive as and when they are ready.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokémon&nbsp;Presents</a> showcase is where we first learned of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions. A new Pokémon&nbsp;title was rumored to be shown off during the presentation. But it was expected to be another remake or perhaps a remaster. </p>



<p>Instead, a full trailer for Pokémon&nbsp;Champions was revealed—showing off its glitz, glamor, and gameplay. You can check out the debut announcement trailer right here.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-champions-platforms">All Pokémon&nbsp;Champions Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is a multi-platform release for Nintendo Switch and mobile.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not just an exclusive Nintendo release and that’s it. Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is also coming to mobile platforms too. The official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik6IGiCzFzQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube trailer</a> announcement’s description confirms as much.</p>



<p>“Look forward to cross-platform battles alongside your favorite Pokémon on Nintendo Switch and mobile, with a variety of different modes available for your desired experience,” it says.</p>



<p>For now, we presume it’s the Nintendo Switch, but a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release is likely on the cards as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-pokemon-champions">What is Pokémon&nbsp;Champions?</h2>



<p>Even though a lot of the content is quite cryptic, there’s a definite Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling with big-time battles in large arenas again. It also looks like Pokémon&nbsp;can turn into Tera Types too. </p>



<p>It’s also confirmed Champions “Will feature familiar mechanics such as Pokémon types, Abilities, and moves, creating an environment conducive to rich and varied strategies for new and experienced Trainers alike.”</p>



<p>We’re sure we’ll learn much more about Pokémon Champions as time passes.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games made a big announcement today--but it seemingly has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. The company announced that it has acquired the Sydney, Australia-based game developer Video Games Deluxe, a studio with ties to LA Noire. Going forward, the studio will be re-named Rockstar Australia.</p><p>Video Games Deluxe had a long history of working with Rockstar prior to this acquisition, as the studio teamed up to help co-develop LA Noire and GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara previously established the Australian studio Team Bondi, which created LA Noire for Rockstar Games.</p><p>McNarmara said in a statement, "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."</p><p>Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p><p>As for Team Bondi, the Sydney-based studio named after the iconic beach, released LA Noire in 2011 with Rockstar Games as the publisher, and it was the company's one and only release. The game was a success by some measurements, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-at-odds-with-team-bondi-report/1100-6322180/" data-ref-id="1100-6322180">Rockstar and Team Bondi reportedly butted heads</a>. Team Bondi also faced allegations of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/igda-investigating-team-bondi-workers-rights-complaints/1100-6321475/" data-ref-id="1100-6321475">"absolutely unacceptable"</a> working conditions.</p><p>Happy Feet and Mad Max director George Mitchell's company, Kennedy Miller Mitchell, bought the rights to Team Bondi's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/whore-of-the-orient/">Whore of the Orient</a>. Warner Bros. was signed on as the publisher of the project, before backing out, leading to the game's cancellation.</p><p>Rockstar's global network of development studios are understood to collaborate on big games, so it's possible Rockstar Australia is also working on GTA 6. Nothing is confirmed, however, and Rockstar is known to be one of the more secretive gaming companies. Officially speaking, there is no word on what Rockstar Australia is working on.</p><p>Rockstar's new development studio in Australia joins the company's <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big network of international studios</a>. These include:</p><ul><li>Rockstar Dundee</li><li>Rockstar India</li><li>Rockstar International</li><li>Rockstar LA</li><li>Rockstar Leeds</li><li>Rockstar Lincoln</li><li>Rockstar London</li><li>Rockstar New England</li><li>Rockstar New York</li><li>Rockstar North</li><li>Rockstar San Diego</li><li>Rockstar Toronto</li></ul><p>GTA 6 is set for release this year on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. It's projected to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and bring in more than $3 billion in revenue during its first year.</a> The game's first trailer was released in December 2023, and since then, Rockstar Games has not uttered a word about the game.</p>

            <p>
LA Noire boss Brendan McNamara is back within GTA developer Rockstar, as the head of the newly-acquired and retitled studio Rockstar Australia. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar announced today it had bought McNamara's Sydney-based developer Video Games Deluxe, following a decade of close collaboration on various Rockstar re-releases. 
</p>
<p>
It was Video Games Deluxe - now re-named Rockstar Australia - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/boss-of-developer-behind-gta-trilogys-original-poorly-received-launch-laments-being-removed-from-games-credits-even-though-he-wasnt">swooped in to update the recent GTA Trilogy port</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">earlier work by another studio that was widely-criticised for its poor performance</a>.
</p>
<p>
Video Games Deluxe also worked with Rockstar on the 2017 re-release of LA Noire, as well as the game's VR Case Files version.
</p>
<p>
Of course, McNamara was responsible for the original version of LA Noire - he was its director, and the founder of its developer Team Bondi. 
</p>
<p>
LA Noire was a commercial success and its technical ambition was praised, but Team Bondi closed less than a year after the game shipped following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/la-noire-developer-investigated-by-igda">allegations of a toxic workplace and crunch culture during its seven-year development</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-staff-cut-from-la-noire-credits">furore over more than 100 people who worked on the project deliberately being left out of its credits</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The expectation is slightly weird here, that you can do this stuff without killing yourself," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/la-noire-dev-responds-to-controversy">McNamara told IGN back in 2011, addressing the accusations of exploitative working practices</a>. "Well, you can't, whether it's in London or New York or wherever; you're competing against the best people in the world at what they do, and you just have to be prepared to do what you have to do to compete against those people."
</p>
<p>
McNamara next tried to get a new game off the ground, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sounds-like-team-bondis-whore-of-the-orient-is-long-dead">named Whore of the Orient</a>, though a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-bondi-staff-sacked-whore-of-the-orient-development-on-hold-report">publishing deal with Warner Bros. Interactive collapsed and the project was canned</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It affects the company, yeah, definitely," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brendan-mcnamara-id-rather-people-just-ring-me-up-and-tell-me-to-f-off-interview">McNamara told Eurogamer in 2011, discussing the impact of the accusations</a> surrounding LA Noire's development on Team Bondi's ability to get another project off the ground. "It affects my reputation. But it also affects people's opportunities in Australia.
</p>
<p>
"People are entitled to their opinion. I'm perfectly happy for people to say they don't like working with me or I'm a bully or I'm this or whatever," he continued. "The part that annoys me is people do it anonymously. I'd rather they just ring me up and tell me to fuck off, right? Or people want to print your company emails on the internet. I'm like, what is that about? That could happen to any company in the business."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what Rockstar Australia will be working on specifically now - though with the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> on the horizon, it's unlikely to be much else.
</p>
<p>
"It's been an honour to work closely with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> this past decade," McNamara said in a statement today. "We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible."
</p>
<p>
Rockstar parent company <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">narrowed down GTA 6's release date to an autumn 2025 window</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-acquires-australian-studio-video-games-deluxe/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Rockstar Games announced the acquisition of Sydney-based developer Video Games Deluxe. The studio was founded in 2013 by former Team Bondi founder Brendan McNamara. Since its inception, Video Games Deluxe has collaborated with Rockstar on the re-release of L.A. Noire and the 2017 VR-only game L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files. More recently, the developer has worked on improving Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games Head of Publishing Jennifer Kolbe said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia.</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara added:</p>
<p><em>It’s been an honor to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade. We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.</em></p>
<p>The acquisition price remains undisclosed. In July 2020, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/l-a-noire-creators-working-on-aaa-open-world-vr-game-for-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for an open world VR game to be made for Rockstar. However, given the complete lack of growth for virtual reality gaming, it is highly unlikely that the project is still being worked on. It is far more conceivable that the former Video Games Deluxe will bolster Rockstar's output with the upcoming massively anticipated launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, planned for this Fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-awaited free Grand Theft Auto V update</a> that's set to introduce technical improvements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>AMD FSR1 and FSR 3</li>
<li>Ray traced shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, and global illumination</li>
<li>Faster loading times using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices and configurations</li>
<li>Enhanced support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher frame rates</li>
<li>DualSense controller support, with adaptive triggers</li>
<li>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch will drop tomorrow and can already be preloaded on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-video-games-deluxe-la-noire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>studio Rockstar has announced that it will acquire Video Games Deluxe, the studio founded by former Team Bondi head and&nbsp;<em>LA Noire&nbsp;</em>director Brendan McNamara.</p>

<p>In a press release, Rockstar confirms the acquisition and also announces that Video Games Deluxe will be renamed to Rockstar Australia. The two studios don't reveal what they'll be working on together.</p>

<p>For his part, McNamara says his studio is "thrilled" to be a part of Rockstar and that the newly-minted Australian wing will "continue [its] efforts to make the best games possible". Rockstar publishing head Jennifer Kolbe, meanwhile, says it's "exciting" to add Rockstar Australia to the studio's lineup.</p>

<p>The studio is also responsible for creating that same year's&nbsp;<em>LA Noire: The VR Case Files</em>, which serves as a sort of remake-slash-reimagining of the original&nbsp;<em>LA Noire</em>. It follows the same story, but its cases are unique and built from the ground up for VR.</p>

<p>Along with its work on&nbsp;<em>LA Noire</em>, Video Games Deluxe also worked on the mobile versions of the ill-received&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition-announced-by-rockstar-games" rel="nofollow"><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</em></a>, although it's not the developer originally responsible for creating those remasters.</p>

<p>Last we heard, Video Games Deluxe was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/la-noire-devs-working-with-rockstar-on-aaa-open-world-vr-game" rel="nofollow">working on an open-world game</a> for Rockstar, although we haven't heard much about that project since it was first unveiled back in 2020. It isn't mentioned in the press release, either, so presumably the two studios aren't ready to reveal it yet.</p>




<p>As for Rockstar, the studio is currently gearing up for the release of tentpole sandbox game&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">currently expected to land in fall</a> (although no official release date has been given for the game yet).</p>

<p>The <em>GTA&nbsp;</em>publisher&nbsp;also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-5-pc-update-ps5-xbox-series-xs" rel="nofollow">released a long-awaited update</a> for the PC version of&nbsp;<em>GTA 5</em>, adding previously console-exclusive features and technical improvements to the game.</p>

The studio began with literary adaptations and family-friendly films like <em>Old Yeller</em> and <em>The Parent Trap</em> before moving on to more experimental fantasy with <em>Tron</em> and <em>Escape to Witch Mountain</em>. After the quirky comedies of the late 1980s and 1990s, such as <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em> and <em>The Santa Clause</em>, Disney began recreating its iconic animated masterpieces from the Golden Era to the Renaissance Era to capitalize on millennial nostalgia.</p><p>This new phase of Disney filmmaking shows no signs of stopping, with live-action versions of <em>Moana</em> and <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> set for release in 2025 and 2026. Maybe we’ll reach the point where every Disney animated film has a counterpart! But for now, let’s rank these Disney live-action remakes that add a human touch to our cherished animated favorites—excluding any sequels, prequels, or spin-offs.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="4266" data-height="2306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-recommend-id="image://c855251eeab7135b3336f54559f3c30a" data-format="jpg" data-width="4266" data-height="2306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tom Hanks talking to Pinocchio " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tom Hanks knows how to tug at our heartstrings as the lonely toymaker Geppetto, who yearns for a boy of his own. While he tries his hardest to forge a bond with the titular puppet, the CGI animation makes Pinocchio, along with other famous characters like his trusty sidekick, Jiminy Cricket, and the manipulative Honest John, seem lifeless. They look jarringly out of place against the equally artificial settings; what is meant to be an idyllic European town is obviously a fake movie set. The disability representation with the new addition of Fabiana and her ballerina marionette, Sabina, is a nice touch—certainly better than the cringeworthy, Scuttle-like Sofia the seagull. The original <em>Pinocchio</em> is a mesmerizing work of art, so any remake had big shoes to fill. Using actual puppetry could have made this version feel more authentic and visually pleasing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-recommend-id="image://7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-recommend-id="image://7f108e612b13b9d16fa2a975005d4550" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nala and Simba embracing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Lion King</em> is an odd part of this live-action trend because there are zero human characters, and it’s still animated—just with computers, nearly shot-for-shot in many instances. The special effects are incredibly detailed and true to life, but in a story where a little lion cub has to react to his father’s death in a stampede, it feels soulless. That’s why the anthropomorphic versions of the characters, with their bigger eyes and larger expressions, worked so well for this profound tale of life and death. Here, the characters are barely able to react, their expressions flat and lifeless because the design focuses so much on capturing real life. Timon and Pumbaa especially look frightening. This new version of <em>The Lion King</em> feels pointless and gives little reason for existing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-recommend-id="image://6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-recommend-id="image://6f16bf4afa73a74ffe26f479ec647003" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two dogs on the porch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Released straight to Disney+, this update of the 1955 original is a fine, if unnecessary, remake. There’s a more developed romance between Jim Dear and Darling (Thomas Mann and Kiersey Clemons) that leads to the birth of their baby, which the regal cocker spaniel, Lady, believes is her impending doom. The clear draw here is, of course, the adorable dogs in the titular roles and their sidekicks. The new <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> blends CGI with real-life rescue dogs, avoiding the uncanny valley. It’s hard not to love these furry, four-legged stars as they trot through their quaint town, even if it looks like a studio set and lacks the beauty of the original’s hand-painted backgrounds of Victorian homes and gaslit streets.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-recommend-id="image://1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-recommend-id="image://1ffacbbe81c3752aed83d72921b26b70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aladdin getting the lamp" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ottoman-style designs in Guy Ritchie’s version of <em>Aladdin</em>—golden domes of an ornate palace, intricate patterns, and flowing, rainbow-colored silks—set against the vast, sandy landscapes create an absolutely gorgeous live-action version of Agrabah. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott share an earnest connection as Aladdin and Jasmine, supported by their soaring singing voices. Will Smith could never match Robin Williams’ brilliantly chaotic, motor-mouthed portrayal of Genie, but he deserves credit for making it work with his own swagger. Still, this <em>Aladdin</em> adaptation is more of a feast for the eyes than for the heart.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a945c9c65d4dc681cb33b7258dec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mulan ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Mulan</em> doesn’t have the same spark without Donny Osmond singing about getting down to business and defeating the Huns. Without the music, the focus shifts more to the action sequences, which are grand in scale and set against sweeping mountain backdrops. Disney often finds itself in a bind with these live-action remakes—damned if they stick too closely to the animated original with shot-for-shot recreations, and damned if they stray too far with unnecessary originality. The remake of <em>Mulan</em> removes Mushu and Cricket for being too fantastical, yet the changes they make still take away any authenticity. There’s the addition of Xianniang (Gong Li), a witch who can shapeshift into a falcon—far less scary than the actual soldiers in the original—and Mulan’s (Liu Yifei) ability to use qigong to explain her martial arts talent, rather than letting her transformation come from strength and perseverance. This version of <em>Mulan</em> tries to add magic in all the wrong places.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-recommend-id="image://7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-format="png" data-width="1523" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-recommend-id="image://7ec1ced01b9cb2377f7a5263d49364a3" data-format="png" data-width="1523" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Weird characters in Alice in Wonderland" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tim Burton’s vision of a topsy-turvy world filled with whimsical creatures and curiosities is far spookier than the 1951 original. Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter resembles a deranged circus clown with his pale face and wild hair; Helena Bonham Carter’s Red Queen has a giant, computerized bobblehead. Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas) have sunken eyes with vacant stares. Alice takes on a feminist twist as a soldier in the fierce final battle, wielding a sword and wearing silver-plated armor, but the dull, gray cinematography makes the scene feel bland. The bizarre aesthetic and darkness take away from the, well, wonder of it all.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-recommend-id="image://e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-format="jpg" data-width="620" data-height="300" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-recommend-id="image://e10124948552f6160f7cda2065c1fe05" data-format="jpg" data-width="620" data-height="300" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dumbo laying down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tim Burton’s carnivalesque visuals and fascination with oddities who don’t fit in—like an elephant with giant ears—seem perfect for remaking <em>Dumbo</em>. Unfortunately, the film takes a one-hour children’s romp and stretches it out by nearly another hour with boring material. We’re meant to care about the handsome Colin Farrell as a one-armed veteran and his children (Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins), who are charged with taking care of Dumbo, but we just want to get back to the main attraction. The live-action version also critiques the capitalistic exploitation that lurks beneath a mammoth theme park, Dreamland (a not-so-subtle nod to Disneyland), but it’s overly grim and never lands. The only real positive is Dumbo’s design, with adorable big eyes that strike the right chord between realistic and cartoony.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-recommend-id="image://ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-recommend-id="image://ac91fa9230315d4d2ed93771415e95bb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peter Pan and friends looking over a cliff" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There have been tons of live-action adaptations or retellings of <em>Peter Pan</em>, from the filmed stage production starring Mary Martin to the star-studded Steven Spielberg epic and the ethereal 2003 version. David Lowery’s <em>Peter Pan &amp; Wendy</em> doesn’t have enough pixie dust, especially since Peter Pan (Alexander Molony) is no longer an impish scoundrel with a zest for life but a mopey little boy, while Tinkerbell (Yara Shahidi) has lost all of her sassiness. One of the most positive changes is making Tiger Lily (Alyssa Wapanatâhk) a strong warrior who helps Peter and the Lost Boys fight Hook and the pirates while removing any racist mocking of her Indigenous background. For all the beauty and mystery of Neverland’s misty rolling hills and towering waterfalls, the film lacks the sense of awe that should define <em>Peter Pan</em>’s world.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-recommend-id="image://47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-recommend-id="image://47a2cab5de2af54f63ca4c67609041f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beauty and the Beast dancing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original animated <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> from 1991 is gorgeous and one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. Unfortunately, this live-action version does not live up to it, mainly because of its design choices. Lumière, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts look scary with their teeny-tiny eyes and mouths, making it difficult to read their expressions. While Dan Stevens’ rich, booming voice and stately presence suit his role as the Beast—especially in his rousing ballad <em>“Evermore”</em>—the CGI looks too artificial. The Beast should have been created with practical effects and makeup so that audiences could literally see the humanity underneath that Belle connects to. The biggest disappointment is Belle’s golden dress; in the original film, it had rows of curtain-like fabric on her hoop skirt, but the new <em>Wish</em>-like version is flat and a cheesy bright yellow. Emma Watson’s wafer-thin voice doesn’t help her portrayal of the beloved bookworm either.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-recommend-id="image://a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-recommend-id="image://a530ca33f8d415a6e0428120b891c8b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man and woman kissing among wolves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s an earlier remake of <em>The Jungle Book</em> that draws from Rudyard Kipling’s novel as much as the Disney animated film. Unlike the current wave of Disney remakes, director and co-writer Stephen Sommers does not have to follow the same story beats, choosing to explore an adult Mowgli, played by the expressive Jason Scott Lee. This version of <em>The Jungle Book</em> is more of an <em>Indiana Jones</em>-style adventure, where Mowgli helps a British captain search for treasure while falling for the spirited Kitty, who knew him as a child. Unlike Jon Favreau’s film, there are real animals rather than photorealistic ones, and they do not talk or sing. This version of <em>The Jungle Book</em> is certainly not the closest to the Disney original, but it has an old-fashioned, B-movie charm.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-recommend-id="image://10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-format="webp" data-width="750" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-recommend-id="image://10a235831d266a8451d43ff9096568a2" data-format="webp" data-width="750" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cruella De Vil smiling deviously " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is one of the few Disney live-action remakes from the 1990s. Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil is deliciously diabolical in her over-the-top performance, clashing with Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson as the sweet couple who (very quickly!) fall in love. While we can admire the wrangling of so many Dalmatian puppies—who are known for being a stubborn breed—the story feels as scattered as the dogs’ spots. Written by John Hughes of <em>Home Alone</em> and <em>National Lampoon’s Vacation</em> fame, <em>101 Dalmatians</em> jumps around from lighthearted romantic comedy to slapstick mishaps with Cruella’s henchmen.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-recommend-id="image://a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-recommend-id="image://a77b7369f549b04dd12b540c718d48a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maleficent ready for war" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Maleficent</em> might be the Disney live-action film that departs the most from its original source material, retelling the story of <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> (1959) through the villain’s eyes. Angelina Jolie is pitch-perfect as the regal fairy, draped in black, with green eyes that pierce into your soul. The film reveals a rich, dark history behind the kingdom and Aurora’s father, Stefan (Sharlto Copley). There’s plenty of revision, especially in the reimagining of true love’s kiss as a deeper bond that goes beyond mere romance. This unique angle adds dimension to a fairy tale that originally followed a simple good vs. evil structure. Visually, it’s hard to match the vibrant beauty of the original, but this film’s blue and yellow tones, the neon glows of the fairies, and its ornate medieval-style set design are captivating in their own way.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-recommend-id="image://9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-recommend-id="image://9b8806649e19597ef3e7d891fc047d45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ariel singing " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Halle Bailey delivers a show-stopping performance as Ariel. Her voice is the kind a sea witch would want to steal—soulful and melodic, with powerful belts that send full-body chills. The sea creatures she calls friends are not as expressive as in the animated film, but their personalities still shine through in little details, like Sebastian’s perpetually shocked eyes or Flounder’s tininess. <em>The Little Mermaid</em> stands out as one of the few Disney live-action films that thoughtfully expand on the original story and characters. Despite their language barrier, Ariel and Eric bond over their shared love of stargazing, cartography, and dreams of adventure, making their connection feel deeper than just surface attraction. Eric now lives on a Caribbean-inspired island with a culture that holds both respect and fear for the ocean and its mysteries. This dynamic makes the harmony between the humans and mermaids at the end of the movie feel more earned.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-recommend-id="image://3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-recommend-id="image://3a6f23ee18144c7039eb8a0f9477276a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cinderella posing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kenneth Branagh helms this enchanting remake of the 1950 classic. Cinderella was always a bit of a dull princess, her personality mostly defined by her compassion for animals and patience for chores. But Lily James adds depth to the role, bringing a quiet inner strength that motivates her unrelenting kindness and positivity despite terrible circumstances. Her mantra, “Have courage and be kind. For where there is kindness, there is goodness, and where there is goodness, there is magic,” feels even more resonant today. Cate Blanchett also brings emotional intensity to the wicked stepmother, portraying a more genuine and lacerating cruelty. This <em>Cinderella</em> outdoes the original’s famous dress, with layers upon layers of gossamer fabric creating a dazzling, billowy masterpiece that quickly becomes every little kid’s dream to wear.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-recommend-id="image://508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-recommend-id="image://508f04ebbd72b84b117603240ba76142" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy embracing bear" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jon Favreau directs an adaptation of the 1967 classic about a little boy, Mowgli, raised by wolves, who makes his way through the labyrinthine jungle. Along the way, he crosses paths with the laid-back bear Baloo, who loves snoozing as much as he loves honey, and the pragmatic panther Bagheera. They serve as his friends and guides as he faces the menacing tiger Shere Khan. The photorealistic, computer-generated animation of the animals and surrounding environments—the lush greenery and bubbling waterfalls—is breathtaking. <em>The Jungle Book</em> was filmed entirely on a green screen, meaning the actors never actually stepped outside, and often, the young actor Neel Sethi was interacting with puppet heads of animals or nothing at all! Yet nothing feels artificial. <em>The Jungle Book</em> is stunning, and even with its digital updates, it never loses the endearing personalities of its animal characters.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-recommend-id="image://95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-recommend-id="image://95555448c5852a0fa507708b688c85ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creature staring at young boy" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The 1977 live-action/animated film is one of Disney’s goofiest yet most tedious outputs, hardly seeming like a frontrunner for a live-action adaptation. However, David Lowery’s version transforms the boy-meets-dragon tale into a gentle coming-of-age story with emotional heights that evoke Steven Spielberg’s <em>E.T.</em> Pete (Oakes Fegley), raised in the woods by his trusty, furry green dragon, Elliot, must save him from hunters from the outside world. <em>Pete’s Dragon</em> boasts a strong ensemble cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford, Wes Bentley, and Karl Urban, who portray humble, everyday characters just seeking connection. The animation is incredible, with Elliot depicted as a puppy-like creature with expressive eyes and playful gestures. The dragon becomes a representation of the universal need for companionship and understanding, and his adventure is guaranteed to make you cry.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-40m-concurrent-users</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-passes-40m-concurrent-users-for-the-first-time.1123644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-40m-concurrent-users<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC gaming platform Steam has broken another major concurrent player milestone, and this one's a big one, likely driven by the success of games like the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>As spotted by the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1896195019419111562" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, Steam passed 40 million concurrent players over the weekend, with 40,017,061 players being logged into the platform at one point yesterday. That, naturally, is an all-time record.</p>

<p>Back in August, the release of Soulslike action game&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>helped Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong" rel="nofollow">break the 37 million concurrent user barrier</a>, so it's impressive that this weekend's total represents a three million increase on that, especially given&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">popularity</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-40m-players-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=KWdMFCbL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-40m-players-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=Zqr7iyME 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has proven a big success story on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>As SteamDB points out, 12.6 million of those players were currently playing games at the time the site logged the new concurrent player record, which means around 27.4 million were either enjoying other features or idling.</p>

<p>Still, 12.6 million people playing games on Steam at the same time is pretty impressive, and I'm sure Valve will be happy that its digital distribution platform still doesn't really seem threatened by its increasing number of rivals.</p>

<p>So, what games helped Steam reach the 40 million count? Perhaps one of the biggest contributors is Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">attracted over a million players</a> at its peak, going on to become the game with the fifth-highest player peak in Steam's history.</p>

<p>Others include many of the usual suspects;&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>has enjoyed 1.75 million players over the last 24 hours, and other big hitters like&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>all hit peak player counts in the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-steam-40m-players.jpg?itok=F7GXgCeB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-steam-40m-players.jpg?itok=4ziorc4F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has a pretty respectable 24-hour player peak on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>In other recent Steam news, Valve has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-early-access-update-warning-feature" rel="nofollow">implemented a new feature</a> that informs you if it's been a while since an Early Access game received an update, although the feature seems a little temperamental at the moment.</p>

<p>The latest Steam Next Fest is also underway, and our own Don has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-best-demos-february-2025" rel="nofollow">compiled a list of some of the best demos</a> the event has to offer.</p>
