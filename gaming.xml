He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Friday, retro and arcade game publisher ININ Games surprisingly announced it’s been able to “recalculate production” on offering a physical version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>for the Switch 2 because “Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2.” Physical games on the Switch 2 have been something of a contentious topic; full physical games are reportedly expensive for developers, while game-key cards don’t actually have the game on the cart.</p><p>But later in the day, ININ removed that line from its post and published <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002062795857174721">a significant correction</a>: “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.” However, it will still be able to offer the physical Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>, though by tacking on €10 to the retail price.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Solid information about why more developers don’t offer games fully on-cartridge is hard to find, though it may come down to cost. In May, a Brazilian Nintendo journalist <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?s=19">reported that</a>, based on leaks from Arc System Works, Nintendo only offered two types of physical games for developers: a 64GB cartridge and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">game-key card</a>. The YouTube channel Physical Paradise has <a href="https://youtu.be/x1wCUjEwklg?si=PhTU7qqhdB_t7nFT&amp;t=274">also reported that</a> the cost of a physical cartridge is “about” $16, “which is quite expensive.”</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, replying to ININ Games’ initial announcement about the new cartridge sizes, <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2002066817704194487">said on X that</a> “cost was always the primary factor between key cards vs full cart releases.”</p><div><div><p id="do-you-know-the-actual-cost-of-switch-2-cartridges"><h2>Do you know the actual cost of Switch 2 cartridges?</h2></p></div><p>If you do, please email me at jay.peters@theverge.com or message me on Signal @jaypeters.11.</p></div><p>It’s unclear exactly how much more affordable additional cartridge capacity sizes could be or why the company might offer them to developers now. New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells me it could be because of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">rising cost of memory</a>; his two cents is that this “is in anticipation of memory going up in cost soon, allowing Nintendo to charge a more reasonable price especially for third-party games.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/848462/nintendo-switch-2-smaller-cartridges-inin-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A change-up has happened at Archetype Entertainment. The lead of the studio, James Ohlen, will be stepping down from the company, shifting his role within the parent company, Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/james-ohlen-shifts-from-archetype-entertainment-head-to-creative-consultant-for-tabletop-rpgs-at-wizards.716766/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, James Ohlen has chosen to leave his position as the lead of Archetype Entertainment. This is a new internal games studio established by tabletop giant Wizards of the Coast to develop AAA videogames based on original IPs.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exodus-archetype-entertainment-planet-view.jpg?itok=9ygK8tGQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">

  </picture><p>This is important since the studio's first project, <em>Exodus</em>, has been long in development. After its 2023 announcement, a lot of pre-rendered trailers, a dedicated episode in the anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, and an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coasts-exodus-ttrpg-is-out-putting-sci-fi-twist-on-dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">TTRPG tie-in</a>, the sci-fi title had a gameplay trailer at this year's The Game Awards. The game appears to be a narrative-focused third-person action title. It also dropped a release date of early 2027.</p><p>Ohlen's official reasons for his departure from Archetype Entertainment were that he felt that his work on <em>Exodus</em> was complete and that the final bits of development were in good hands. Given the nature of videogame development cycles, this tracks. It means the game is essentially content complete; all that is left is QA, playtesting, and improving technical performance.</p><p>But Ohlen is not completely departing from Wizards of the Coast as a company. Ohlen will remain as a creative consultant for the tabletop publisher, shifting his focus to TTRPGs. This is a familiar field for Ohlen since he launched Arcanum Worlds, a TTRPG studio dedicated to publishing third-party material for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p><p>Better still, Arcanum Worlds' output has a consistent record of quality. Their world includes DMs Guild supplements like <em>Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy</em> and <em>Heroes of Baldur's Gate,</em> as well as the comprehensive book on the Nine Hells, <em>Chains of Asmodeus</em>. The studio has also created original fantasy settings built on D&amp;D's system, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dragon-age-writer-reveals-raiders-of-serpent-sea" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Raiders of the Serpent Sea</em></a> and <em>Odyssey of the Dragonlords</em>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-new-york-times-crosswords-josh-wardle-app-ios-an-1848455748"><i><span>Wordle</span></i></a><span>, the word-guessing game that has been a daily fixture in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-pope-american-leo-wordle-words-with-friends-gamer-1851779977"><span>many people’s lives</span></a><span> since 2021, had a more difficult word than usual today, December 19. I don’t play </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, so I didn’t think much of it when my coworkers were chatting about how tough today’s word was. That is, until I looked outside of the </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>Slack and to the rest of the internet, where I saw that </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> players were absolutely crashing out about today’s word.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The word for today is “myrrh,” which, for those who don’t know about the cool shit Jesus was given when he died, is a “fragrant gum resin obtained from various Arabian and African trees and used in perfumery, medicines, and incense.” For a lot of players, the go-to </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> strategy is to start by guessing vowels as a basis and then filling in consonants based on where the vowels fall. As you can see, myrrh has no vowels, so players were already at a disadvantage. Many tried and failed to figure out the word, and it just about ruined their day.</span></p>

What I wasn’t expecting was some of the other responses I came across that we elected not to share here. I know edgy humor and wild comparisons are common in most gaming spheres, but I did not expect some of the vile shit I saw </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>players calling the game’s developers. So if you’re down to see some truly off-the-wall, excessive reactions to a simple word game, you can search for that yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>At any rate, maybe they’ll bring “myrrh” back to </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><span>Jimmy Fallon’s game show</span></a><span> version comes along, and we’ll see someone crash out on live television.</span></p>

          <p>The Switch 2’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">data-free, download-enabling Game Key Cards</a> have proved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendo%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cgame-key-cards%E2%80%9D-for-the-switch-2.1506662/#post-43644552">controversial with players</a> who worry about long-term ownership and access issues to their purchases. But they’ve remained <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">popular with publishers</a> that want to save production costs on a boxed Switch 2 game release, since Game Key Cards don’t include any of the expensive flash memory found on a standard Switch 2 cartridge.</p>
<p>Now, though, at least one publisher has publicly suggested that Nintendo is offering cheaper Switch 2 cartridge options with smaller storage capacities, lowering production costs in a way that could make full cartridge releases more viable for many games on the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/regarding-the-physical-format-on-nintendo-switch-2-please-read-carefully">Earlier this week</a>, <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>publisher Inin Games explained to customers that it couldn’t switch from Game Key Cards to a “full physical cartridge” for the retail version of the Switch 2 game without “significantly rais[ing] manufacturing costs.” Those additional costs would “force us to increase the retail price by at least €15 [about $20],” Inin Games wrote at the time.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doesitplay.org/post/3mae3kmiy5y2b">an update posted to social media earlier today</a>, though, the publisher said that “there is no better timing: two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge [storage capacity] sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that wasn’t possible before.”</p>
<p>As such, Inin said it has decided to replace the Game Key Cards that were going to be in the game’s retail box with full physical cartridges. That change will result in the game’s asking price going up by €10 (about $13) “due to still higher production costs,” Inin explained. Still, that’s still less than the “at least €15” Inin was speculatively quoting for the same change just days ago. And Inin said early pre-order customers for <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> won’t have to pay the increased price, essentially getting the full cartridge at no additional cost.</p>

You can unlock Pauline's Diva Dress a lot earlier in your adventure with the Amiibo. The Diva Dress doubles the likelihood of enemies dropping music discs. To unlock the Diva Dress, you need to talk to the NPC shaped like the Amiibo in the Resort Layer. The NPC will ask you to show them the Amiibo to claim your reward. Without the Amiibo, this particular outfit is locked behind post-game challenges.</p><p>Scanning the Bananza Amiibo also spawns gold KONG letters that can be smashed to refill Bananergy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Never before have we seen so much goodwill so quickly squandered: This week, Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://aftermath.site/larian-ceo-ai-art-baldurs-gate-3-divinity/"><u>repeatedly dug his heels in on the issue of AI</u></a> following a poorly received interview during which he talked about how his studio – fresh off the success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, a meticulously crafted feat of human ingenuity – employs it. He went so far as to suggest that “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” which is almost certainly untrue. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss the myriad reasons someone working in games might not want to object to their boss’ ill-advised edict these days.</p><p>This time around, we convene for our final show of 2025, a notably horrible year for the world but <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"><u>a pretty solid one for Aftermath</u></a>. We begin by talking about a controversy that was unexpected, to say the least: Larian openly embracing AI. Vincke has spent the past several days both digging his heels in and doing damage control, but the furor continues. Will the studio change its ways? Or will those of us opposed to AI have a difficult decision to make when Larian’s next and apparently biggest game, <em>Divinity</em>, comes out in… probably still a lot of years?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we hand out our first ever Stuff Of The Year awards to the games, trends, events, people, cats, nontroversies, and everything else that defined our 2025. Finally, we come up with a rock-solid concept for Aftermath Muppets.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can force a still-human Luke to exasperatedly put up with our Muppet antics all day.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> This is part of the larger story of video game industry precarity. If you are not OK with how your studio is implementing AI, you’re probably not gonna make a fuss about it, because you could lose your job. Right now, everyone in the games industry is jobless, so that’s your one lifeline, and if you lose it, you might be cooked. Especially Larian being a studio where a lot of people had to move for those jobs, you are just not going to risk it.&nbsp;</p><p>So [Vincke] is like “Yeah, everyone’s fine with it,” I don’t think they actually are. You’re a boss speaking for everyone at your company, and your company employs hundreds of people. Like, come on.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> And a lot of people had to go through, like, 20 job interviews. Don’t forget. A lot of people had to go through a really bad hiring process.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, writers especially. For people who watch or listen to the show but aren’t on Bluesky, a lot of writers this week talked about how it’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brunodias.bsky.social/post/3ma4qheh7gk22?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an open secret in the games industry</u></a> that the job application process for Larian in particular is just a fucking nightmare. You’ve gotta do tons and tons of interviews. It takes months. You’ve gotta do a writing test that includes playable elements.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It’s uncompensated.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yep, it’s uncompensated. And then they might not get back to you for a really long time, only to let you know that they’re going with somebody else. It’s this thing that every writer in the industry will tell you about. It seems entirely miserable.&nbsp;</p><p>But yeah, so you have all of this precarity and a boss speaking for the company, as well as all these employees who I’m sure would want to say something if they felt safe doing so. [It’s notable, also, that former employees have come forward on social media to say they did, in fact, have a problem with AI.] And then all of that ties back into the AI conversation: People are worried about losing their already less-than-secure jobs to AI, specifically. You have this example of how precarious things are and how that’s already muzzling them, and it’s just a fucked-up stew with every conceivable ingredient of the ills of the games industry right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> At what is ostensibly the good company. That’s what makes it hurt most: They’re the good guys, technically.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Or they were.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Where have all the cowboys gone, man?</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/larian-ceo-ai-art-baldurs-gate-3-divinity/"><div><p>I Don’t Think Larian’s CEO Understands How Art Is Made</p><p>‘I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it’ [Citation needed]</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/take-time-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>1388722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a conundrum: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">Cooperative board games</a> have wide appeal, but they tend to have a singular problem. Because everyone around the table wants to win, rather than genuine cooperation, there’s a tendency for groups to accept plans suggested by the most experienced or able player. Of the various ways to prevent this, the most successful has been to give players hidden information they’re not allowed to communicate.</p><div catalogid="ca7f5cd0-93c8-4c39-8f04-3dc1337b1477" id="233757"><div id="233757" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Take Time Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most extreme example is 2018 game <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Me7G?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Mind</a> where players aren’t allowed to talk at all, and simply have to rely on their innate sense of timing to lay cards in the correct numeric order. Take Time belongs in this group, but it’s trying to use a set of novel, simple mechanics to chart a worthwhile course between no communication at all, and heavyweight cooperative planning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Time’s tiny box belies a wealth of goodness within, which you can sense by its weight. First up there’s a player deck of numeric cards, 24 in all, embossed in gold and set against fetching, complimentary shades of white and dark blue. Beneath there are a set of 12 envelopes, also embossed in gold and set with luminous art pieces depicting colorful, stylized scenes from nature. It’s a salutary lesson in how simple yet highly effective graphic design and artwork can elevate everyday game components into something glorious and eye-catching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the envelopes contain four clock discs, each with six points. While these are thinner cardboard and lack the gold that elevates the cards and envelopes, they’re still delightful things, carrying more of that rich, stylish nature art in slightly more muted colors. You’ll be playing cards at each of the points, and as soon as they’re on the table, the whole thing springs to life visually. The final component is a set of punch tokens which contain a clock hand and several cogs. They’re chunky and a little drab compared to everything else in the box, but that’s fine: they take a back seat during most of the play time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The core game rules are very simple. Each player gets a hand of number cards which come in two colors that run from 1 to 12. In the center of the table is a clock face with six segments. One of these will be the starting segment and your goal, as a group, is to play cards so that the total in each segment runs from lowest in the starting segment and ascends to the highest in the final segment. The catch? Most of your cards must be played face down, and you’re not allowed to talk about your plays while making them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, you start to make logical deductions about what people are likely to have played. It’s up to the players – without discussion – to decide who’s going first so, intuitively, someone with a low card will likely play into the starting space and the group will understand that is probably a one, or a two. If the next player plays into the next space, it’s a good bet they’ve played a two (ties count as being part of the ascending order) or a three. Cards played straight into the final space are probably high, and so on. On this basis you can begin to figure your way around the puzzle, although deciding where to play your limited number of face-up cards is still an interesting choice. If no one reaches to open the play, for example, then it’s likely nobody has a low card so starting with a face-up mid-range option might be wise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each pack contains four clock faces and, from the very first challenge, there are additional requirements to frustrate you. That first face, for instance, requires the first segment to have a single white-color card in it, and the last segment can contain no more than three cards. So you can’t just dump high-values into that final space mindlessly and call it a day, as once you hit the three-card limit there’s a good chance the penultimate space might end up containing a higher total.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Take Time’s tiny box belies a wealth of goodness within.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the difficulty begins to scale, you’ll start making use of the game’s most ingenious aspect. Although you can’t communicate while you’re playing cards, you’re allowed to plan and strategize before anyone has looked at the cards they’ve been dealt. Initially this looks of limited value: how can you plan when you don’t know what values anyone has at their disposal? But there are still things you can do. The card colors are public knowledge, for example, as it’s reflected on the card backs, so in that first clock you can quickly see how many white cards have been dealt and whether you’re likely to have a low-value card to play into its first segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. The rules are purposefully vague about what you can discuss in this phase, only explicitly disallowing “codes or signals” during card play. This leaves cunning players with a wealth of ways to approach the game and increase the group’s chances. No spoilers, but once you understand the game flow you can be surprisingly creative in terms of forming a plan, and when imaginative proposals pay off on a difficult clock it is incredibly satisfying. But remember that you have to adhere to the dictum that you must not communicate in any way, even with devised codes, during the card-play phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played a limited-communication cooperative game before, such as <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwNpg?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hanabi</a>, or Take Time’s spiritual predecessor The Mind, you’ll know this rule is hard to enforce. Sometimes a player forgets, and blurts something out by accident, or the preceding player will instinctively react to a play with a wince or a knowing smile, all of which gives out useful information. Some players find this vagueness troublesome: if that’s you, be aware that Take Time has nothing to ameliorate this issue. If not, it can actually be quite fun to watch how different groups interpret and enforce “no communication.” It’s a cooperative game, so it doesn’t really matter so long as you’re on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the game has no final fail state. If you mess up on a clock face, you get to have an additional face-up play for each failure to a maximum of three, and then you keep going until you either succeed or give up. In the latter case, you place the clock into the delightfully named Sleeve of Regrets and move on. To win overall you must go back and ensure you pass all 40 tests although once you’ve at least attempted them, you can open a final sleeve for additional replayability. But how you actually approach this is up to you: Take Time is more interested in being surprising and fun than it is in whether a group wins or loses. It’s clearly supposed to be a cozy, cooperative time to be enjoyed together.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Although you can’t communicate while you’re playing cards, you’re allowed to strategize before anyone has looked at their cards.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From the initial clock face, you may be wondering how any of the subsequent puzzles get hard enough to make you want to skip them. Each new face introduces new rules and wrinkles, but these never become overwhelming. After the first three faces, for instance, you’re not allowed to have any segment total higher than 24. Later, some segments disallow certain cards, while others force you to draw new cards, and an increasing proportion will have one or more placement rules. The design has a fantastic knack of pulling the rug out from strategies you’ve become used to. If your new clock disallows laying your lowest cards on the first segment, and your highest on the last, working out how to get them in ascending order suddenly becomes a whole lot more challenging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazingly, the lack of an absolute loss condition does little to undermine the excitement and thrill of play. Even with good communication and a full three bonus cards, there’s easily enough uncertainty about what’s around the clock to require thoughtful consideration before late cards, and ramp up the tension ahead of the final reveal. A group win is always gratifying, and it doesn’t take many losses before any given face begins to assume a daunting prospect, propelling you toward discussing new approaches, and offering ever-sweeter satisfaction when you finally take the win.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7O0p?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEn83?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Asmodee</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 19, 2025 7:24 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Some gamers view games almost entirely through the lenses of strategy or narrative, and Take Time offers neither of these pleasures. It is, however, brilliantly successful at suckering in pretty much everyone else, including reluctant players and family groups. Its simple rules and non-threatening structure appeal to all ages, and the way it remains packed with excitement and creative potential without complexity or even the threat of losing is almost magical. Don’t expect this to burn your brain, or even create particularly memorable play moments, but being able to spend such pleasant time with friends, family, or relative strangers is a memorable reward all in itself.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/take-time-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>But Riot says it’s considering rolling the BIOS requirement out to all players in <em>Valorant</em>‘s highest competitive ranking tiers (Ascendant, Immortal, and Radiant), where there’s more to be gained from working around the anti-cheat software. And Riot anti-cheat analyst Mohamed Al-Sharifi says the same restrictions <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/2001831378401530297">could be turned on</a> for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>, though they aren’t currently. If users are blocked from playing by Vanguard, they’ll need to download and install the latest BIOS update for their motherboard before they’ll be allowed to launch the game.</p>

<h2>Newer PCs are getting patched; older PCs might not be</h2>

<p>The vulnerability is known to affect four of the largest PC motherboard makers: ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI. All four have released updates for at least some of their newer motherboards, while other boards have updates coming later. According to <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/382314">the vulnerability note</a>, it’s unclear whether systems from OEMs like Dell, Lenovo, Acer, or HP are affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asrock.com/support/Security.asp?iD=1">ASRock’s security bulletin</a> about the issue says it affects Intel boards based on the 500-, 600-, 700-, and 800-series chipsets; <a href="https://csr.msi.com/global/product-security-advisories">MSI</a> only lists the 600- and 700-series chipsets. <a href="https://www.asus.com/security-advisory/">Asus</a> is also missing the 800-series, but says the vulnerability affects boards based on even older 400-series Intel chipsets; <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Support/Security/2338">Gigabyte</a>, meanwhile, covers 600-through-800-series Intel chipsets, but is also the only vendor to mention patches for AMD’s 600- and 800-series chipsets (any motherboard with an AM5 socket, in short).</p>
<p>Collectively, all of these chipsets cover Intel’s 10th-generation Core processors and newer, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series and newer.</p>
<p>What’s unclear is whether the boards and chipsets that go unmentioned by each vendor aren’t getting a patch because they don’t <em>need</em> a patch, if they will be patched but they just aren’t being mentioned, or if they aren’t getting a patch at all. The bulletins at least suggest that 400- and 500-series Intel chipsets and 600- and 800-series AMD chipsets <em>could</em> be affected, but not all vendors have promised patches for them.</p>

                <p>A sizeable portion of Nintendo Switch 2 players have been very vocal about their opposition to Game-Key Cards that allow players to digitally download a game rather than including it on a cartridge. But there's at least one publisher that's taken this criticism to heart by switching gears from This may be a welcome development for Nintendo Switch 2 players who hate Game-Key Cards back to cartridges, thanks to the new size options offered by Nintendo.</p><p>Inin Games shared the news that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-ditches-game-key-cards-for-a-physical-release-but-itll-cost-more/1100-6537110/" data-ref-id="1100-6537110">upcoming US and European run</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/r-type-dimensions-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-706122">R-Type Dimensions III</a> is going to be released on a physical cartridge instead of a Game-Key Cards. The company also cited a recalculation of the <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">production prices</a> as a reason for the change. Apparently it's cheaper to release a game on Game-Key Cards, but the rumored measures taken by Nintendo apparently lowered the price for cartridges as well.</p><p>Game-Key Cards have been in physical Nintendo Switch 2 game boxes, but those cards don't actually include any game data. Instead, the Game-Key Cards allow the console to download the game from the internet. </p><p>Nintendo hasn't issued any statement about this yet, <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/2001264866632372548" rel="nofollow ">but the rumors suggest that smaller cartridges</a> are being offered in 16GB and 32GB sizes, both of which are cheaper than the standard 64GB cartridge. Publishers who wanted to sell Switch 2 games on physical cartridges were previously stuck paying for and using Nintendo's 64GB cartridge. The publishers who released larger games were also forced to use Game-Key Cards because their titles couldn't fit on a single cartridge. There's currently no indication that Nintendo is planning any cartridges bigger than 64GB to accommodate those larger games. If those were available, they might mitigate the need for Game-Key Cards.</p><p>The one bit of bad news from R-Type Dimensions III is that the game will be a little more expensive now that Inin Games is going for the physical cartridge. Regardless, Inin pledged to honor the original price for anyone who preordered the game before the change was made.</p><p>"We'd like to sincerely thank the community for the passionate discussion, the feedback, and the patience over the past days," reads <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a statement by Inin Games</a>. "Your enthusiasm for physical games and for R-Type in particular made this solution possible, and we're very happy to be able to deliver a true cartridge release."</p><p>Last month, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a> will be the first game published by Nintendo itself that will only be given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-first-nintendo-published-title-to-get-game-key-card/1100-6536144/" data-ref-id="1100-6536144">a physical release as a Key Card</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dev-explains-why-its-ditching-game-key-cards-thanks-to-nintendo-2000654878</link>
            <guid>1388674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a promising reversal for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940">game key card haters</a> everywhere,<em> R-Type Dimensions 3</em> publisher Inin Games has announced it will be able to support a physical release on Switch 2 that contains the entire game on the cartridge. How was it able to manage this feat? It said this was all thanks to Nintendo introducing additional SD card sizes for Switch 2, before later revoking all such claims.</p> <p>“We’re happy to share a positive update regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions 3</em>,” the company <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii">announced on Friday</a>. “There is no better timing: Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that in a way that wasn’t possible before.”</p>

 <p>As a result, it said it would move forward with offering a physical version of the game on Switch 2 that wasn’t a game key card. The only difference is that the physical version will cost $10 more than the digital version to account for the production costs. This is good news, and essentially what every diehard fan and enthusiast collector has been begging Nintendo and its Switch 2 development partners to do from the start.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ININ Games retracts their statement about the new smaller Switch 2 carts. </p> <p>"There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information… <a href="https://t.co/V9yeCHynVR">pic.twitter.com/V9yeCHynVR</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2002067728631533570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But apparently Inin Games wasn’t supposed to reveal that this was all due to new cartridge sizes from Nintendo. The company deleted its original statement and followed up with a bizarre new one. “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities,” the company corrected itself.</p>

 <p>It continued, “Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo. At this time, we can only confirm that our upcoming release <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> will be on a physical cartridge. No further technical details regarding cartridge specifications have been officially confirmed.” Mmhmm. Sure.</p>

 <p>The good news is that it sounds like other publishers may be able to take advantage of this new development moving forward, though some may still opt to do game key cards for performance reasons (running a game off an installation vs. a cartridge can improve loading times) or because of the cost savings. Up until now, the only Switch 2 cartridges available to developers were 64GB ones.</p>

 <p>Games that were too big, like<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, had to go the game key card route as a result. But it also meant that most small games found paying for the unneeded extra space prohibitively expensive. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> and a ton of other games were only released on Switch 2 as game key cards as a result. Hopefully, Square Enix and others follow the example now set by <em> R-Type Dimensions 3</em><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on Thursday, December 18, and saw 21 awards handed out to deserving games, developers, and people. </p>



<p>This year, I was lucky enough to be selected <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as one of the judges</a> and had the opportunity to vote on 12 awards. Those included the likes of Music, Gameplay, Narrative, Game of the Year, and more. </p>







<p>While the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awards were given out</a> already, I thought it would be good to show the Insider Gaming audience how I voted this year. To be completely honest, it was a lot tougher than I expected.</p>



<p>Doing a ranked choice vote led to plenty of second guessing and dozens of pages of notes in my black and white marble notebook. There was even a time where I had my votes all ready to submit, only to start over by reviewing my notes again. Eventually, decisions were made and the ballots were sent in. </p>



<p>Not all of my selections won, but I was happy with how I voted and congratulate all of the winners. There really were so many incredible games this year that you could make a strong case for every game that was nominated, and even others that weren’t. But, without any more delay, here’s how I voted for The Indie Game Awards 2025.</p>

                <p>The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red is the latest company to sound off on the use of AI in gaming. During CD Projekt Red's latest earnings briefing, Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski said<span> there are "meaningful" and "real" benefits to using the technology.</span></p><p>The company is already implementing such technologies "mainly in the productivity areas" and so far that's where the "largest benefits" have stemmed from, he <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/result-center/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-witcher-4-and-cyberpunk-2-boss-is-skeptical-ai-can-replace-industry-talent-and-cant-imagine-reducing-headcount-thanks-to-the-tech-its-not-gonna-be-making-the-witcher-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar.</a> A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said.</p>

<p>"The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take. It doesn't mean it's not gonna be useful, but it's not gonna be making The Witcher 5, or 6, or anything like that," Nowakowski explained.</p><p>Nowakowski also pushed back against the idea that the mass layoffs happening in the video game industry today are due to AI's acceleration. Instead, he said the cuts are largely the result of games being canceled.</p><p>"Some studios have been going through turmoil; there were some project closures and so on, which led to many redundancies in the gaming industry; we've all seen that--it's been very dramatic in many cases. But, literally kill me here, but I don't recall a single time when it would be attributable directly to AI. At least I don't know about that."</p><p>And looking to the future, if AI is adopted more broadly, Nowakowski does not believe it will lead to net job losses overall. "I don't imagine that," he said.</p><p>This echoes what others have said, pointing to previous labor revolutions that impacted some jobs in the short term but boosted total employment overall on a longer timeline. Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0yT4ec9M6GobLC5ByN8pX3?si=0Vg8nv83RsyqI0LqfYTv-Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">workers whose job is "the task" may be at the greatest risk</a>.</p><p>The AI issue continues to be controversial, in part because of how the term is defined. Developers have been using versions of AI to make games for decades, after all. One of the newest forms of AI is generative AI, and it is baked into products that many game developers use, including Unreal Engine and Photoshop, among others. Recently, Larian's CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">drew backlash for his comments</a> on how the developer might use AI, and he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">plans to answer more questions about this in January. </a></p>

<p>"They've done an amazing job"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Square Enix had a holiday treat in store for us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrades-free-switch-2-demo-is-now-live">earlier this week,</a> when it dropped the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo on the Switch 2 eShop. Before the full game launches next year, you can now get an idea of what to expect by playing through the iconic opening sequence <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>But how does it hold up from a technical standpoint? Here to answer that very question are the experts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQoWX_Q94vs">Digital Foundry</a>, who have been diving into the demo to see what it can muster.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, DF notes that the Switch 2 <em>is</em> running the 'Intergrade' version of the game (as its name suggests), with all the improved bells and whistles that we previously saw on the PS5 re-release. The frame rate is still at 30fps, mind you, but we knew that already.</p>
<p>On a similarly optimistic note, Digital Foundry describes the HDR implementation as "excellent", with popping highlights and dark zones which don't appear washed out.</p>
<p>In terms of image quality, the game isn't fully comparable to any other console version. The image is a little soft, but "still clear enough", with some dithering weirdness when objects are in motion and across select surfaces. DF puts the Switch 2's approximate internal resolution count at 1080p, stating that it's "really, really beautiful in portable mode".</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like it's holding up really rather well. The DF analysis concludes that the demo is currently "one of the best looking games on Switch 2", though whether that all holds up for the final, much larger version remains to be seen.</p>
<p>That full version will arrive on Switch 2 on 22nd January, and any demo data that you get under your belt until then will carry over to the full release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As to be expected with seasonal content, new maps and weapons are planned for Battlefield 6. The studio says this content is being developed to "introduce fresh tactical opportunities and keep the experience evolving in meaningful ways."</p><p dir="ltr">This only gives players a vague sense of what to expect, but for Season 1, Battlefield 6 gained three <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-all-new-maps-and-vehicles/1100-6535770/">multiplayer maps</a>, more vehicles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-battlefield-6-weapons-in-season-1-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6535768/">several new weapons</a>, and some additional attachments. The content was rolled out in three separate phases, and it's likely future seasons could follow the same approach.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also touched on the game's free-to-play Redsec battle royale mode. The game currently doesn't feature a solo playlist, which has been highly-requested from the community, and the studio is aware of the interest and working to deliver an option for solo players.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are working through the technical details to deliver it at a quality level that feels right for Battlefield," the developer said. "Once we are confident in the plan and timing, we will share more."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer's post also included several statistics for Battlefield 6 in 2025. Players across multiplayer and Redsec played over 1.7 billion matches and logged 383.5 million gameplay hours. This overall gametime resulted in 12.4 billion kills and 871 million revives. Engineer was the most used class at 28%, but it was a close race with support players making up 27%, assault players at 26%, and the recon class was the least used at 19%.</p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, Battlefield 6 released Winter Offensive as the last update for Season 1. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-buggy-update-is-being-fixed-as-new-patches-scheduled-and-tournament-delayed/1100-6536891/">Winter Offensive had a rough launch</a>, which led to Battlefield Studios releasing a series of hotfixes and updates across all platforms.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">Battlefield 6 is 2025's No. 1 best-selling game</a> in the US so far, toppling Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which currently sits at No. 7 on the list.</p>

                <p>Christmas is around the corner and one of Universal Studios' biggest attractions is the meet-and-greet with The Grinch. Meeting Whoville's Christmas curmudgeon can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSVKYYOiRVD/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">take up to over five hours</a> with the lines, but with social interactions going viral, it's hard not to resist a photo and a few minutes with the beloved monster.</p><p>The interactions are fairly quick; you can maybe get a quick question in, and then the photo, and be on your way. Fortnite creative developer <a href="https://x.com/ImmatureGamer/status/2001727399910867200" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Immature asked Mr. Grinch if he played Fortnite</a>. Innocent enough, but in the typical Grinch way, he turned sour on the game, saying it got boring and needed him to be in it.</p><p>"I used to, but then it got boring. Very boring. But I know they're always releasing new skins and characters. I heard that [Marty] McFly guy is in there now. I heard Eminem was in there--there's a bunch of new things. When are they going to put me in there? If I was in the game, it would be fantastic, but since I'm not..."</p><p>Considering the hundreds of character skins over the years, it feels surprising that the Grinch isn't in the game. Fortnite was quick to respond saying "No promises. But you're at least gonna have to get into the Christmas spirit first, Mr. Grinch."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2001730375001788601" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No promises.

Three brand-new collabs have already been revealed: Harry Potter, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Bleach. Harry Potter will feature Fortnite characters in Hogwarts uniforms, while Bleach is expected to bring four character-based skins. The SpongeBob collaboration includes the Patty Wagon as a car cosmetic, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spongebob-might-not-be-the-only-paramount-cartoon-coming-to-fortnite-reports-suggest/1100-6536487/" data-ref-id="1100-6536487">reports also pointing to SpongeBob and Patrick appearing as sidekicks</a>.</p><p>The Back to the Future collaboration from the current battle pass is expanding on December 23, adding a Doc Brown skin and a DeLorean time machine car skin, which will be free in Fortnite for players who already own it in Rocket League. Winterfest will also expand existing music collaborations, with Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter each receiving holiday-themed skins and new jam tracks. Additionally, rumored but unconfirmed collabs like Home Alone and Batman Beyond could still appear, as there's some space left in the Winterfest schedule.</p>
