            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it intends to undergo a major internal restructuring into new units called "Creative Houses", following disappointing first-quarter financial results for the company.</p>

<p>As part of its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a>, Ubisoft says these "Creative Houses" will help to "enhance quality, focus, autonomy, and accountability" across the company. The new entity Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">created earlier this year</a> to shepherd its core IP will serve as the first Creative House, but we don't know what the others will be yet.</p>

<p>In terms of financials, Ubisoft reported a 3.9% drop in sales when compared to the previous year, as well as a 2.9% drop in net bookings. The studio blames "a lower-than-expected performance for&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>", as well as "a partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-financials-reorganization.jpg?itok=Ac_wXmMA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-financials-reorganization.jpg?itok=lAS_EreS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft blames&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>for its poor first-quarter results.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these underwhelming figures, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reveals that recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales" rel="nofollow">tentpole release</a>&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>now has "more than 5 million unique players". Presumably, that translates to sales as well, given that the game isn't available on subscription services.</p>

<p>This performance, Ubisoft says, is "in line with expectations", so while the game hasn't been disappointing, it also hasn't exceeded Ubisoft's predictions. The studio also looks forward to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2</a>, which it expects will help the game "reach a broader audience".</p>

<p>It hasn't been the best couple of years for Ubisoft. In May, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">released its summary</a> for the preceding fiscal year, which showed that both sales and profits were down compared to the previous year despite the release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>

<p>Prior to that, in December last year, Ubisoft announced it would&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shut down the live-service shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and close two of its studios, with the French gaming outfit going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">close another location in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-reorganization.jpg?itok=m-k6Xl8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-reorganization.jpg?itok=QY_pKjgK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft shut down its live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the aforementioned Switch 2 release of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it must be said that Ubisoft's release slate is looking a little barren for the next few months, so I wouldn't be surprised if the studio registers another drop in the second quarter. We'll have to wait and see what happens.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-to-go-back-to-beta-as-layoffs-loom.1250925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that the portal-based first-person shooter will be going back into beta, and that several staff members will be losing their jobs as a result.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, 1047 acknowledges that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">"launched too early"</a>, and that in releasing the game, the studio "bit off more than [it] could chew", making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"boneheaded mistakes"</a> along the way.</p>

<p>As a result,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be "going back to beta", 1047 says, which means that "major parts" of the shooter will be rebuilt "to capture the spirit of what made&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>special".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs-rework.jpg?itok=rQ5j7Fn6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs-rework.jpg?itok=TnZ4toCq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is going back to the beta drawing board, so to speak.</figcaption></figure><p>While in its new beta period,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s progression will be reworked, more portals will be added to its maps, and monetization will be simplified, according to 1047 Games. Not only that, but the studio will be "refocusing on classic game modes" the community has "been asking for".</p>

<p>As part of "rebuilding the core experience" of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, which 1047 Games says is not a "quick fix", the studio says it'll be laying off employees to "shift [its] resources to focus" on the rework. 1047 Games doesn't state how many employees will be losing their jobs.</p>

<p>The studio does, however, say that it intends to "retain as many team members as possible", and that as a result of doing so, the servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be shut down next month. As a reminder, updates for that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-updates-ending-as-1047-focuses-on-new-project" rel="nofollow">ended back in September 2022</a>.</p>

<p>If you're an avid&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>player, however, you'll be pleased to know 1047 says it's "exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches", so while nothing has been decided yet, it's not necessarily over for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>.</p>




<p>Despite dropping back into beta,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going away; it'll still be available to play, and Chapter 3 will be released as planned. However, it sounds like more big updates won't be released until&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is ready for release (again).</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <p>Riot's spin-off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> with the terrible name, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-l">2XKO</a>, is getting a closed beta in a few months and, to entice fans to sign up, the developers have released a new video showing off pink-haired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a> bruiser Vi doing some biffing. I know you like biffing, so I'm telling you about this despite being unable to reliably write the title of this free-to-play wrecker without carefully typing it out like my mum composing an email with a single forefinger. </p>

<p>"2XKO’s Closed Beta starts September 9, available globally on PC," said Riot in <a href="https://x.com/Play2XKO/status/1947686336020025842">a press release on social media</a>. "After Closed Beta begins, our goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance. This is a huge step for us. We’ll be deploying our backend systems at a larger scale for the first time, so things might be bumpy at first, but we’ll improve as we go."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/">sign up here</a> if you are eager to batter Vi for all her baffling choices in Arcane's disappointingly disjointed second season. The beta will only happen on PC, so feel free to be a smug wretch to your long-suffering Xbox friends, although Riot do say that any progression made on PC will cross over to console if you decide to play on multiple platforms.</p>

<p>2KXO was-- excuse me, I mean 2OXK was - sorry, 2XOK was... FUCK. The fighting game formerly known as Project L was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-confirm-fighting-game-in-development">revealed during the EVO fighting game championship in 2019</a>, even though rumours and leaks outed the game not too long after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rising-thunder-cancelled">Riot bought Rising Thunder developer Radiant Entertainment</a> way back in 2016. The game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riots-fighting-game-project-l-finally-gets-a-name-but-not-a-good-one">given its untypeable moniker</a> last year, on the logic that it is a tag-team fighter in which you field 2x brawlers, and that those 2x brawlers will presumably KO somebody. 2... X... K... O, see? </p>
<p>I know. I hate it too. But if you're legitimately interested in the game's ins and outs, Riot have <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/whats-new-in-alpha-lab-2/">an admittedly thorough breakdown of a previous alpha</a> which shows various features, including how the tag team assists will work, as well as clues to how battle-passy things will get when it comes to unlocking cosmetics. This is something that will be interesting to witness, because cosmetics in a fighting game need to be interesting without obscuring or distracting from the clarity of the action. Will I be able to dress up as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dressing-up-as-santa-in-tekken-7-and-visiting-players">a cleanly defined Santa</a>, for example? Only time will tell.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-2xko-dangles-vi-in-front-of-fans-alongside-a-closed-beta]]></content:encoded>

                <p>According to one gaming analyst, the best-selling new PlayStation 5 game based on copies sold is Microsoft's Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft launched the game on PS5 at the end of March this year, and it recently eclipsed 3 million copies sold on PS5 to become the console's best-selling game of 2025, according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea</a>. </p><p>The research company said the recent sale on Forza Horizon 5 on PS5, which brought the price down to $45, helped the game surpass 3 million sales on Sony's platform.</p><p>Alinea added that Forza Horizon 5 is a juggernaut on Xbox, reaching more than 45 million players on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S through sales and Game Pass downloads. The game is reportedly performing well on Steam, too, reaching 6.5 million copies sold, Alinea said.</p><p>The company further predicted that the inevitable Forza Horizon 6 will launch on PS5 on day one. Microsoft has not announced any new Forza Horizon games, however.</p><p>Alinea's report went on to claim that the PS5 and Steam versions of Forza Horizon 5 have generated nearly $400 million in revenue. The research firm said Microsoft's ongoing strategy to release its games on other platforms is part of the company's transition "from a console platform holder to a third-party publisher." Microsoft is not getting out of the hardware business, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">having already confirmed it's making a new hardware platform with AMD</a>. However, Alinea said the company's next system "won't <em>really </em>be a console," but instead could be a "console-like gaming hardware project."</p><p>"Microsoft probably won't <em>market</em> the next Xbox as a PC, but in functionality, it will likely get closer than ever--a console that runs like a PC, integrates deeply with Windows, and supports cloud/hybrid gaming," Alinea said.</p><p>Microsoft has partnered with Asus for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Xbox Rog Ally line of portable systems launching this year.</a> Microsoft was at one point reportedly considering launching its own Xbox device, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-essentially-canceled-report/1100-6532402/" data-ref-id="1100-6532402">that's no longer the plan, it seems.</a></p>

            <p>Obsidian surprised us by announcing a sequel to shrunken-player backyard survival game Grounded earlier this summer. We assumed that Grounded, released in 2022 after two years in early access, had more years of live development ahead of it, which is often the case for multiplayer survival games like it. But that was never apparently the intention for Grounded.</p>
<p>Executive producer Marcus Morgan told me in an interview that Obsidian always intended Grounded to have a beginning, a middle and an end. "When we began Grounded 1, there was always this idea that there would be a close to Grounded 1," he said. "Obviously there's survival games like Ark, which are kind of ever expanding, or Minecraft, which are big platforms that are expanding. But a lot of our touch-points for Grounded 1 came from The Forest or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>. So when we were making Grounded 1, we knew there would be a beginning and a middle and an end to the game, in terms of the story we wanted to tell."</p>
<p>The unexpected success of Grounded shook these plans a little - "it took off way more than we could have ever imagined," he said - but an end to the story did eventually come, at which point the studio knew it wanted to do more but also knew it couldn't realise the ideas within the game's existing framework.</p>

<p>Mainly, Obsidian wanted to implement mounts, or "buggies" as Obsidian is now calling them - insects like ants that you can ride around on. "The reason we didn't actually have [mounts] in Grounded 1 was because the world and the space wasn't designed to actually have mounts," Morgan explained to me. To enable them, then, Obsidian moved the playing space from a confined backyard to a much larger park, while also taking the new-game opportunity to move to Unreal Engine 5 and implement other feature ideas as well.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing Grounded 2 ahead of its 29th July early access release so I'll tell you more about those new ideas and how successful, or not, they are when the embargo lifts on the same day. But to return to my point: that beginning, middle and end structure has remained - it has carried over to Grounded 2. In fact, Obsidian not only knows where it could end but where, excitingly, a third game could follow on from it.</p>
<p>While talking about the original plan for Grounded, Morgan said this: "At first it was like, 'We'll just make Grounded.' There's not the, 'Well maybe we'll have a trilogy.' Like, we hope, but that's not where we started." I pressed him on this mention of a trilogy and he said, "That was just me speaking aspirationally."</p>

<p>Then he added: "I don't know whether or not it's Grounded 2 or a Grounded trilogy, but I will say we absolutely have ideas and stories and expansions and features that we would want to go for. Whether that continues to expand Grounded 2 or whether that is going to Grounded 3... I want to start with Grounded 2 because that's not even launched yet and I've got to get my mind around that. But we do have more, there's more in our hearts and souls, even beyond where we see Grounded 2 going throughout early access. We do have more that we hope people want to see and play. It's in our hearts."</p>
<p>Another surprising thing about Grounded 2's development is that it's been shared. Grounded 1 was made entirely at Obsidian, but Grounded 2 has been co-developed with Embracer-owned studio Eidos Montreal. Morgan told me Obsidian sought the partnership, being, as it was, rather busy making both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2, which are both 2025 games.</p>
<p>"We knew we wanted to make Grounded 2 and we knew we were going to need help expanding and building on that," he said, "so we actually went out, like, 'Okay, where can we go find co-development help that shares similar sensibilities and has a passion and a love for the game?' There wasn't a lot of pressure or rush for it, we just wanted to find the right partner." And Eidos was apparently it.</p>
<p>There are actually more people working on Grounded 2 at Eidos than at Obsidian, he said, but assured me that "a significant number of people" are working on the game at Obsidian, including the original Grounded team, and that the project was being led from there.</p>

<p>"I know this is gonna sound corny but sincerely it is a cooperative way of developing things," he said. We, as Obsidian, as the creators of the IP, obviously have a very strong point of view about 'what is Grounded' and what fits, what doesn't. There's some weighting on our side in the same way that when we used to make games for other folks, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> or [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2], there were the IP holders there.</p>
<p>"But Eidos has been empowered a lot and also just brings a lot to the table with regards to their ownership and filling the game, so I would say it's shared. I don't know if we really think about it as who's officially in charge? Like, if you wanted to put a stamp on it, it's Obsidian, because it's our game. But Eidos is just as much of an owner and just as much of a contributor to it. We are just one team. We might be in two different studios but we're the Grounded team. That's how we do it."</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will launch in early access on 29th July, at which point, I'll be able to share fuller thoughts on the game. Note that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-going-anywhere-if-people-still-want-to-play-it-as-grounded-2-gets-ready-to-launch-obsidian-promises-its-not-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-original-game">Grounded 1 will continue to exist even when this game comes out</a>, by the way - Obsidian is a big believer in game preservation and has no plans to sunset that older game. Content updates will stop, but maintenance will continue.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-could-grow-into-a-trilogy-and-there-are-already-ideas-that-could-fill-a-potential-grounded-3]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The return of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to iOS in the UK is "uncertain", Epic has claimed, as it's unable to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS this year, "if ever".</p>
<p>That's because the CMA, the UK's competition regulator, has "deprioritised store competition entirely", following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">lengthy legal battle between Epic and Apple</a>.</p>
<p>The CMA has today released two roadmaps for possible measures to improve competition in mobile ecosystems for both Apple and Google. However, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-cma-s-roadmap-doesn-t-open-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-to-competition-in-the-uk">Epic has claimed in a statement</a> the regulator is "choosing not to prioritise opening the mobile ecosystem to alternative app stores this year".</p>

<p>It continued: "This is a missed opportunity to introduce competition into a currently-monopolised market and unlock economic growth and consumer choice. Four years after concluding that the App Store and Google Play Store are parallel monopolies the CMA has done nothing to allow competing stores.</p>
<p>"A free market requires multiple stores competing to offer consumers the best prices and services. If you don't have competing stores, the one store that is a state-sanctioned monopoly will use its control to extract all the value from the market at the expense of all creators who cannot compete, and consumers who can't choose the best deal among competing stores."</p>
<p>In May this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite finally returned to Apple devices in the US and Europe</a> after a five-year legal battle over store competition.</p>
<p>However, following Brexit, the UK has not been included, so the return of Fortnite won't be until at least next year.</p>

<p>"The CMA also made a vague announcement about allowing developers to steer customers to payment service outside of apps, without referencing the kinds of restrictions, obstructions and junk fees that Apple introduced in Europe to make a mockery of the Digital Markets Act," Epic added.</p>
<p>"Unless Apple and Google are completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment, we can expect years of malicious compliance ahead, and no genuine restoration of market competition."</p>
<p>Epic compared this "bleak news from the United Kingdom" to the stronger pro-competition actions of other regions.</p>
<p>"We hope the CMA will use its consultation process to re-examine these weak roadmap decisions and bring the benefits of genuine app store and payments competition to British consumers," it said.</p>
<p>Later this year, the Epic Games Store and Fortnite will arrive in Brazil and Japan.</p>

Not by a long shot, truth be told. And returning to the game for this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> edition (that's the last time I'm typing that out), I was a little worried that perhaps I'd gotten a bit excited. A 9?! Surely no.</p>
<p>Anyway. Long story short, and after several raucous hours spent refamiliarising myself with the core board-gaming aspects involved here...well, 2024 me was 100% right. Jamboree is absolutely excellent stuff, provided what you're looking for is fun, frantic, family-friendly entertainment that's full of surprises and activities to get everyone involved. Honestly, these Nintendo board game nights do be getting competitive lately.</p>

<p>For those who haven't yet played the game, there's a ton of content to dig into here, which helps justify the beefy Switch 2 price tag, whilst for those who're upgrading from the OG game, I reckon you're easily getting your money's worth for what is a highly entertaining addition to the core package.</p>
<p>So, let's start off with a brief recap of Super Mario Party Jamboree for those who've yet to play it. With a core party experience that's the best it's ever been in the series, this is a delightful thing to stick on of an evening with a bunch of pals or family members. The rules to the core board game are simple dice-based fare that anyone can follow, and the new Jamboree Buddy characters who pop out to aid you from time to time are a fun addition that kids love.</p>

<p>Rounds can be a little long, running up to around 90 minutes, but I stand by my opinion that they actually feel super quick when you're playing, as Nintendo has done a good job of keeping the momentum going with clever boards, minigames, and random aspects that keep everyone in with a fighting chance to the end. The final rounds of a match up the ante just enough to ensure you end on a high for the most part as well.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/super-mario-party-jamboree-all-boards-list-and-how-to-unlock">seven boards to play on</a>, most of which have moving parts such as trains and race cars to take into account, and extras such as Bowser's Kaboom squad (excellent), Kooplathon (messy, but still excellent) and a few other throwaway modes, you've got yourself a proper party to be getting on with.</p>

<p>There are plenty of options for younger players to get involved, too, and you can even set handicaps to give kids - or anyone else who wants it - a boosted start in terms of points. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/super-mario-party-jamboree-all-minigames-list">minigames</a> in the base game are uniformly excellent, with a really nice mix of activities and game types that can be filtered, so you get to drop any you're not keen on. With local and online co-op and multiplayer, and a bunch of other modes thrown in for good measure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-party-jamboree">my review verdict of "best Mario Party yet"</a> holds true.</p>
<p>With this Jamboree TV addition for Switch 2, the changes to the vanilla game start as soon as you boot up, with a choice of the original or Jamboree TV to be made first of all. Jumping into the base game, nothing has changed, right down to — it seems — the crispness of the textures and resolution, as this older mode is slightly blurrier and not as slick as the newer addition. Which is a bit surprising, but does hammer home that this new content is a properly separate thing.</p>
<p>Digging into Jamboree TV itself, then, essentially it utilises the new features of the Switch 2 console (the camera, mic, and mouse, to be specific) to deliver a bunch of new game types housed in a flashy TV show format, which allows for new forms of silly fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157446/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, some of the biggest laughs I've had so far have come from just pulling faces and watching my kid's expressions as they appear out of green pipes in a studio full of Mushroom Kingdom folk. It's highly amusing, even before the actual minigames get started, and it's a superior way to present the party overall, to the extent I hope Nintendo stick with it going forward.</p>
<p>Of course, playing a minigame, especially if it's decent, is enjoyable enough as it is, but seeing your face above your chosen Nintendo avatar, seeing the reactions of your fellow players as they win, lose, or come a cropper really does add to the fun. It's not gonna be the same with randoms online, to be fair, but it's an exquisite thing when playing with your nearest and dearest, and that's what the Big N is really aiming at.</p>
<p>In terms of presentation, Jamboree TV gives a nice uplift to the resolution, clarity, and sharpness of image. The whole thing feels super-smooth and responsive in both docked and handheld modes, and I'm sure there are new volumetric lighting and reflection elements added across the boards here as it all looks much fancier than I remember, with reflective floors and all sorts of futuristic things like that.</p>

<p>Getting started with your Switch 2 camera (which I wasn't looking forward to because I'm lazy that way) is actually a breeze. Simply have it plugged in whilst the game is running and it'll whizz you and any other players through a quick setup which shows off how clever the new tech is - well, at least to me. Sit all your players within the frame of your single console camera and each detected face gets a little coloured circle which can be used to zoom and set everyone's face position individually. You don't even have to be sitting close to one another, particularly.</p>
<p>It's very quick and easy to get sorted, and the game then separates you out so that your faces can be used in interesting ways, such as recording and holding highlights and other things of this nature, all to give it a TV-show feel. I can imagine for people with long distances between family members, this could be a really great way to make things feel more involved when playing online. Which is nice!</p>
<p>Onto the new minigames, then, and there are a whole bunch of Mouse Mode and microphone-based activities to dig into. The mic stuff, which is made up of things like a rhythm game where you clap to the icons instead of the usual pushing of buttons, alongside some 'shouting games' (a new genre I just invented) — where you make loud noises to raise and lower a balloon, charge a car's turn boost, and so on — are fun, and even more fun when you realise you can say anything and don't have to stick to the words they use in-game.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157447/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, and I'm truly shocked to be saying this, it's actually the Mouse Mode stuff that's the real draw.</p>
<p>I totally didn't expect to enjoy using the mouse for minigames. It seemed like something that was going to really bother me, but as it turns out the likes of air hockey, bomb throwing, a mail sorting game, dominos, one of those electric-current type maze deals...they are, by and large, really good - and exactly the sort of thing that gets you laughing, especially when all your silly big faces are on the screen at the same time.</p>
<p>Is it going to revolutionise gaming? No, it is not, but I am having a great time anyway. These new ways of playing are fun, and they give you around 20 new games to add to an already huge collection from the OG release.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157448/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>More interestingly in the long run, perhaps, are the new ways to play that are also included for Mario Party in Jamboree TV mode. Here you can choose from new Tag Team and Frenzy rulesets. Frenzy makes for shorter matches that get to the face-off and final run excitement quicker, whilst also adding lots more duels and ways to lose and gain coins quickly. Tag Team adds 'Together Dice' and 'Rally Spaces' alongside a few other wrinkles that see pairs collect and share coins, stars and items as they attempt to best another duo. It's all good stuff that serves to add plenty more life to an already jam-packed experience.</p>
<p>Apart from this (yes there's more!) you also get a Carnival Coaster mode which serves as a light-gun style shooter that's decent, and even better with a pal so that you can shoot out either side of your coaster cabin. You also have Bowser Live, which gives you a balancing game, coin collecting, and some very silly bits where you have to shout compliments at Bowser since it's his own evil version of the main Jamboree TV event. Again, it's all very throwaway, but also very fun, thanks to that camera and Joy-Con tech that nails both sound and motion inputs really well.</p>

<p>So, Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV (I copy and pasted), overall, is a fantastic addition to an already cracking party game. The price may be a little steep for new players, but this really is a huge package of family good times with all of this new stuff added. Still not quite the measure of a perfect 10/10 (although it's very, very close), this bumper package is easily the best Mario Party game Nintendo has given us thus far, and one of the most effortless ways to have a great time with family and friends on Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV gives an already fantastic party game a huge shot in the arm, with a bunch of brilliant Mouse Mode and mic-based games that also allow you to see your big silly face as you play. It's all very knockabout, very easy to use, and very easy to enjoy.</p>
<p>With a huge base game packing seven boards and a whole bunch of modes, and the Switch 2's new tech adding to the fun in meaningful ways, this is a thoroughly delightful and totally family-friendly way to party Mushroom Kingdom-style.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-software-beta-makes-multi-device-dualsense-switching-easier.1250865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a new PS5 system software update beta, and if you like to use your DualSense controller across other devices besides your console, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the beta will start rolling out tomorrow. The main feature being introduced in this update is the ability to pair your DualSense with multiple devices, making it easier to switch between them whenever you like.</p>

<p>At the moment, if you want to switch from using your DualSense on your PS5 to using it on a PC, for instance, you need to pair the controller with the new machine every time you want to swap, but when the new update lands, that won't be the case anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-software-update-beta-dualsense-close-up.jpg?itok=rrVWxFet 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-software-update-beta-dualsense-close-up.jpg?itok=rXL7004g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like to use your DualSense on other devices, the new PS5 system software beta is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>The new update will allow you to register your DualSense with up to four compatible devices at once, and all you need to do in order to switch from one device to another is press the PlayStation button and one of the face buttons.</p>

<p>Once you've assigned a device to one of the face buttons, switching to that device will show a different number of player indicator lights on your controller, corresponding to the device you have connected. It's that simple!</p>

<p>Of course, you can also continue to use your DualSense via wired USB connection if your device supports it as well, but it's nice to know that switching between wireless connections will get easier.</p>

<p>As well as the new DualSense switching feature, Sony has also revealed a new Power Saver feature as part of its Road to Zero <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmental plan</a>. It won't be live in this update, but when it does arrive, you'll be able to cut performance in certain PS5 games in order to reduce power consumption.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-beta-console.jpg?itok=PFnruA7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-beta-console.jpg?itok=Kf1MJb58 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 is getting a new Power Saver feature in future.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know which games will support this feature, nor do we know when it'll land, but with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">many</a>&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;demanding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-ps5-version-late-2025" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">horizon</a> in terms of performance, it's probably better for Power Saver to land sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In any case, the new PS5 system software beta begins rolling out in certain territories tomorrow. We don't know when the full release is coming yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil is lurching back into theaters next year in a new film by Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger. In an interview, Cregger spoke about how he grew up playing the Resident Evil games, and how that love for the Capcom franchise has guided his vision for this new film adaptation of it.</p><p>"I played all of the games. I played Resident Evil 4 a hundred times through. I'm obsessed with it. And so, I just want to tell a story that feels like it's honoring the experience you get when you play the games," Cregger said to <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/resident-evil-reboot-movie-zach-cregger-tease-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>. "I haven't seen the movies; that's just not my thing. But the games are my thing. That's just a playground I just love--I think the movie is going to rip."</p><p>All but one of the previous live-action Resident Evil films were directed by Paul WS Anderson. They were very loose adaptations of the games, remixing ideas from them with original storylines centered around Milla Jovovich's character of Alice. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-movie-director-says-hes-expecting-online-hate-and-heres-why/1100-6533133/" data-ref-id="1100-6533133">Cregger doesn't want to be slavishly obedient</a> to the lore of the games, but as he explained in a separate interview earlier this month, he isn't planning to break "any major rules" of the franchise with his spin on it. Overall, the director says that he just wants to "tell a story that just feels authentic to the experience you get when you play the games."</p><p>In the video game department, the next Resident Evil game is scheduled to be released in February 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> will see players travel back to the ruins of Raccoon City for a new survival-horror experience, and it'll be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. A mobile spin-off game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-newly-revealed-resident-evil-game-is-not-what-youd-expect/1100-6532940/" data-ref-id="1100-6532940">Resident Evil: Survival Unit</a> is also in development, and Cregger's Resident Evil film is targeting a September 18 release date next year.</p>

			<p>Nintendo knows that gaming is a social activity, but as gaming has moved increasingly online, they haven’t consistently kept pace with changing habits. The Switch 2, though, is the most social Nintendo platform we’ve ever had. GameChat and GameShare are two new features built into the console’s very fabric, bringing family and friends together to play through innovative multiplayer, multi-console streaming and, well, the slightly less timely ability to chat with each other.</p>
<p>Mario Party, then, is the perfect game to showcase the Switch 2’s new features. Alongside the Switch 2 camera peripheral, the now excessively titled Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV DLC is here to make group gaming more social, vibrant, and silly, while emphasising the human connection. As you crush your family in a minigame melee, of course.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Mario Party Jamboree was a great return to form</a> for Nintendo’s long-running digital boardgame, and it did so by focusing on the basics. The central mode once again sees you travel around the various boards, attempting to earn more Stars than your opponents through canny use of special items, thoughtful route planning around the sometimes-convoluted multiple pathways and battering everyone in the different minigames that punctuate each round.</p>
<p>For the Switch 2 Edition, the main game has been given a scrub-up, but it’s the added social systems of the game and the Switch in general that bring the biggest changes. Similar to Mario Kart World, you can see your friends while playing if you have cameras attached and enabled. Sure, the Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat makes talking to your friends easier makes this easier than ever, but there’s something just that bit more personal and immediate by being able to see them as well.</p>


<p>The camera is capable of zooming in on up to four people playing in the same space, and you can gurn, smile, cry or, well, make rude gestures when things don’t go your way. My 9-year-old son believes that this is the best new feature, purely because it allows you to have your head next to your avatar and you can make silly faces in it. It adds a level of life and humour into the game that actually overrides some of Mario Party’s slower moments, helping you breeze through the 90+ minutes of a full game session.</p>
<p>Through the main Mario Party game it is, fundamentally, just a camera, but the Jamboree TV DLC makes it an integral gameplay tool. There are 20 new minigames here that utilise the Switch 2’s impressive new features, with a variety of Eye-Toy-like CameraPlay minigames, microphone-driven tasks, and a batch that utilise the Joy Con 2’s mouse controls. They show some of the system’s huge potential, while highlighting some of its weaker elements as well.</p>

<p>There’s three core modes to Jamboree TV, with the first being Bowser Live, which sees you participating in a live show hosted by Mario’s nemesis, where the losers will be burned to a crisp by his fiery breath. You choose to focus on either camera or microphone games – though oddly, not both at the same time – and fight it out through three rounds. Camera-led games might see you trying to stack Goombas on your head, or repeatedly hammering a ? block for coins by punching the air, while microphone ones have you shouting at your console to move objects around. You can definitely ruin these for your opponents by shouting at the wrong time, and I can see multiple households descending into chaos because of it.</p>
<p>Bowser Live is a much shorter experience than many of the other Mario Party modes, only taking place across three stages. The third and final game is also something of a disappointment as it’s the same thing every time. At the close, you and your teammate have to shout, holler and hoot to win over Bowser and the crowd, but as a co-op pair, no matter how loud we shouted, we never won, with the AI team soundly beating us. Playing against each other, or as a four, will do away with that, but it’s not a minigame in the true sense, and its repeated use as the closing point of the mode sees it wear thin extremely quickly.</p>

<p>The mouse-led minigames are the clear winners in Jamboree TV, though you’ll obviously need an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 if you want to play with more than two players. Carnival Coaster is the overarching mode for these, putting you on a rollercoaster that’s also an on-rails shooter. You blast Koopas and Para-Biddybuds, as you race down the rails, putting your arms up for a speed boost, before hitting the next minigame.</p>
<p>This batch of mousey minigames have proven to be the Jamboree TV’s highlight, from sorting through emails – any from Bowser go in the trash – to co-op climbing with each player taking control of one springy arm. They showcase just how good the mouse controls are, and they feel fresh, fun and compellingly different to the wider Mario Party canon. Just as with the main game, you can forgo the wider framing of Bowser Live and Carnival Coaster to hop in and out of your favourite minigames, and this is probably the best way to experience the newest additions, with a solid stream of competitive diversions.</p>

<p>GameShare takes Nintendo’s focus on social play to the next level, and here it lets you share the game across multiple players and multiple platforms so that you can all play together from one copy of the game. That includes the original Switch, Switch OLED and Switch Lite, though you’ll only be able to play the main game’s modes, and none of the newer Jamboree TV content when connected to the older generation. It’s the ideal endpoint for the game though, and I can see it helping to drive Mario Party’s popularity to new heights, albeit while potentially selling fewer copies of the game.</p>

			<p>Unreal Engine was considered for Halo Infinite, but developer 343 Industries eventually went with its Slipspace Engine again due to a few issues, including how the engine would have impacted the vision for the game.</p>



<p>As reported in a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming">Rebs Gaming</a> recently discovered an official Halo Infinite documentary created in 2017 to reframe 343 Industries' vision for the game and pitch to Xbox leadership for funding on the Vimeo profile page of a former 343I developer. The documentary, which has been made private following its discovery, features a presentation given by studio head Chris Lee revealing that, as it has been rumored a while back, 343 Industries indeed considered using Unreal Engine for the latest entry in the iconic series. In May 2017, the developer visited The Coalition, spending two days presenting their findings on the Unreal Engine before deciding on which engine to use the following month. This was a tumultuous time at the studio, as a former developer revealed that the game's art team threatened to quit if leadership didn't investigate a possible switch to Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the findings were more favorable for the Slipspace Engine, as the Unreal Engine proved to be better in some areas, but the studio's proprietary engine was considered more powerful in others. In addition, rebuilding the foundation would have taken two years, and an engine switch would have impacted the vision. A vote with leadership was also held, and 85% chose Slipspace over the Unreal Engine, which is the engine 343 Industries ultimately used for Halo Infinite.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although 343 Industries, now <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-has-multiple-projects-on-the-way-made-with-unreal-engine-5/">Halo Studios</a>, ended up going with Unreal Engine 5 for the development of the next entry in the series, up until late 2022, the Slipspace Engine still seemed to have some life left in it, as it is rumored it would have powered a direct sequel to Halo Infinite. With the change of leadership on September 22 also came a change of plans, and thus, the Slipspace Engine was replaced by Unreal Engine 5 as the engine that will power future entries in the series, which may include a remake of the first entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/">Combat Evolved.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> came and went without all that much noise, delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/">solid, if not exactly (mini)game-changing entry</a> in the long-running series. So, the announcement that Jamboree would be one of the first Nintendo Switch titles to receive a major paid <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> upgrade came as a bit of a surprise to some. But perhaps the laboriously-titled Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV shouldn’t have been <em>that</em> unexpected, as Nintendo is basically using the upgraded game as a showcase for the Switch 2’s new features and peripherals, such as Joy-Con 2 mouse controls and the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera.</p>



<p>Does the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Party Jamboree take the festivities to the next level? Or is it okay to leave this party in the past? Boogie on down for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the title screen, you'll find most of Super Mario Party Jamboree's new Switch 2 content by selecting Jamboree TV, which includes a couple of new game modes that provide quick access to the game's roughly 20 new minigames.</p>



<p>The “Bowser Live” mode serves up minigames that require the use of the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera and the console’s new built-in microphone. Basically, two teams compete in a trio of camera or microphone-focused minigames, and whoever does best over the course of all three, wins. The loser gets roasted alive by Bowser. Pretty simple.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Switch 2 camera is basically functional, I suppose. Simple minigames that involve doing things like punching upwards to bash a coin block or pulling various basic poses Simon-Says-style <em>do</em> work, but the experience isn’t overly thrilling. I’m not providing my own screenshots for privacy purposes, but Nintendo’s screenshots showing what people look like when captured in game are very much a best-case scenario. I don’t know if conditions in the room I was playing in weren’t right, but the images of myself and my fellow players captured by the game were very low quality. The camera/game is also bad at finding the edges of a person – often large chunks of background would be included or, alternatively, arms and legs would be cut off. The game is also not particularly good with players of various sizes, as my family members, who range from around 4 feet to 6 feet tall, all had to stand at odd varying distances from the camera.</p>



<p>Minigames based around the mic are similarly functional, but also not that exciting, and background talk and other extraneous noise easily confuses the game. Ultimately, Bowser Live was good for a few chuckles, particularly when my seven-year-old discovered he could stick his butt into other players’ sections of the screen, but nobody who experienced the heady 2010s era of Kinect and the PlayStation Eye are going to find anything here terribly impressive or innovative.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Significantly more successful is the new “Carnival Coaster” mode, which revolves around the new Joy-Con 2’s mouse functionality. Carnival Coaster asks players to team up to get to the end of one of five different on-rail rides. You have a limited amount of time to reach the end, but successfully shooting down groups of enemies will net you bonus time. You'll also periodically play a mouse-controlled minigame, with further time being added to the clock if you do well.</p>



<p>While the shooting aspect of Carnival Coaster mode is quite simple, it works well enough, and the minigames you play are almost all winners -- some of the best in all of Jamboree. While some of these minigames are quite simple, asking you to pluck and sort mail into folders or scoop ice cream cones, others throw in a literal twist as you use mouse and motion controls simultaneously to, say, stack and manipulate blocks and other items to build the highest tower.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, the Switch 2’s built-in features bring some added functionality to the standard Mario Party experience as well. Players can capture a live image of their face to give the party a personal touch and GameChat has the potential to make online games a little more rowdy. GameShare support also means both Switch 2 and OG Switch owners can test Jamboree out with you, even if they don't own the game. Meanwhile, Jamboree’s resolution has also been bumped up (it already ran at 60fps on the OG Switch), which is nice, although I don’t know if many people play Mario Party for its graphical fidelity.</p>



<p>With all these additions, the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Party Jamboree is probably the most feature- and content-rich entry in the series to date, which is good, because it’s also the most expensive game in the series at a full $80 (those who own the Switch version can upgrade for $20). Whether you’re willing to pony up that much to party hardy is up to you.</p>

<p><strong>A Sometimes-Stimulating Switch 2 Showcase</strong></p>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is an interesting showcase of Nintendo’s latest hardware features, for better or worse. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera feels like a late-to-the-party retread of a style of gameplay that went out of fashion a decade ago, but pretty much any mode and minigame that relies on Joy-Con 2 mouse controls works out quite well. Nintendo’s asking price may be hard to justify for some, but if you’re looking for a single product that shows off all of the Switch 2’s unique abilities, this multi-talented upgrade may be worth an invite.</p>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV launches on July 24. As mentioned, those who already own the Switch version of Jamboree can upgrade for $20 or you can buy the original game and upgrade together for $80.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a twist that no one could have predicted a few years ago, the best-selling game released on PlayStation 5 in 2025 so far is Forza Horizon 5, a game published by Microsoft.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true">Alinea Analytics</a>, the fifth entry in the series by Playground Games, which was released on PlayStation 5 this March, has surpassed 3 million copies on Sony's system, overtaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which sits at 2.9 million copies, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which sold 2 million, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which sold 1.4 million copies, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which sold 1.3 million units.</p>



<p>While selling 3 million copies in just a few months, by itself, is a very good indication of how well Forza Horizon 5 is doing on PlayStation 5, the Microsoft game seems to be doing even better on the system, looking at other data, as it is also outselling other first-party exclusives. According to the data provided by Alinea, Forza Horizon 5 sold 2 million copies on PlayStation 5 in 25 days, while other first-party exclusives like Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Astro Bot failed to achieve similar results. The second entry in the Kojima Production series only sold 1 million copies in 25 days, while last year's GOTY only passed two million copies sold in three months. As such, it's becoming clearer how Microsoft's decision to go multiplatform has been the right one to offset low sales on Xbox systems and stagnating Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about this excellent racing game by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/">review.</a></p>

<p>The staff <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">Game Developer</a> spoke to for the report paint a horrifying picture of the day that saw Microsoft jettison all of those people and projects. They claim staff were removed from company communications such as Slack and email before human resources had even made contact to inform them whether they'd been let go. "It was so sad seeing people so distraught and confused and not knowing if they would have a job by the end of the day - or even if the layoffs were done by the end of the day," said current ZeniMax worker and ZeniMax Workers United - CWA union member Page Branson.</p>
<p>"It's not okay. It wasn't normal," added ZeniMax senior QA tester and fellow ZeniMax Workers United member Autumn Mitchell. "I don't care how many times they do it to try and make it seem normal — it's not. The way they do it is inhumane. I don't care how much they say that it's dignified or they want to do it in a respectful way - it's not."</p>
<p>"Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting," the QA tester continued.</p>
<p>Both Branson and Mitchell believe the cuts at ZeniMax, which Game Developer report have affected "hundreds" of workers, would have been worse if a significant number of the studio's staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-have-reached-a-tentative-contract-agreement-with-microsoft-paving-the-way-for-better-wages-and-more">hadn't unionised</a>. As is, they say the layoffs have seen key developers be let go, leaving those who remain facing a bleak future.</p>
<p>"A lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight," Branson said. "Everyone left now has to pick up the pieces as best they can. The [dwindling] morale and general confusion of it all has extended into our general workflow. We used to have very, very reliable people working on things and they're no longer there. They were integral. I feel like they were numbers on a sheet that got cut, but the real application of what they were doing was integral to making everything run correctly."</p>
<p>"This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games," Mitchell added, later likening the situation to having to keep on working while "looking at a graveyard".</p>

            <p>It seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> could be getting a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> port.</p>
<p>During Ubisoft's latest quarterly earnings call, which was listened to by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-might-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">IGN</a>, the company's CEO Yves Guillemot commented that Assassin's Creed Shadows has "some new versions" coming, which will be available "on other machines". Given that Shadows is already available on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, that only really leaves Nintendo's hardware under that 'other machines' banner, unless the studio exec was referring to previous generation consoles or mobile.</p>

<p>However, during the same call Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet seemed to further cement this idea that Assassin's Creed Shadows may make its Nintendo debut. Responding to one investor, Duguet said: "And we also have a game that will be launched on the Switch 2."</p>
<p>Before you say, 'but Victoria, this is clearly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">which we know is headed to Switch 2 already</a> - Duguet was talking about games "beyond the announced releases". So, evidently there's at least one other Ubisoft title bound for Nintendo's latest console.</p>
<p>Couple these comments from Ubisoft's leadership with that <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-assassins-creed-shadows-has-appeared-on-the-pegi-website.1168491/">Nintendo Switch 2 PEGI rating for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> that started making the rounds in April, and it seems an announcement of some sort is ultimately on the horizon.</p>

<p>In addition to these little Shadow nuggets, Ubisoft also recently celebrated welcoming five million players to its latest Assassin's Creed game. "Assassin's Creed Shadows delivered on its expectations, with now more than five million unique players since its launch," Guillemot wrote in Ubisoft's FY26 Q1 sales report.</p>
<p>The team elaborated further on social media, revealing that along with those five million assassins, there have been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March.</p>
<p>"And still, you paused to take in the view," <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1947688095123460139">Ubisoft wrote</a>. "Thank you for forging legends with us."</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blades-of-fire">Blades of Fire</a>, the dark fantasy action-adventure from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a> studio MercurySteam, has "underperformed" following its console and Epic Games Store-exclusive PC release in May, contributing to a €10m loss for publishing group Digital Bros. The company has blamed the game's failure on "an oversupply of new releases and increasingly selective consumers".
</p>
<p>
Blades of Fire marked MercurySteam's first new title since it collaborated with Nintendo on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-dread-review-a-sublime-return-for-a-nintendo-icon">2021's widely acclaimed Metroid Dread</a>, and it launched to generally positive reviews. Eurogamer, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blades-of-fire-review">called it</a> "original, lovable, and born of genuine passion, despite the near overwhelming number of problems that could have extinguished it." Other upbeat reviews followed, but that clearly hasn't been enough to tempt a sufficient number of players into Blades of Fire's world.
</p>
<p>
Digital Bros (which owns Blades of Fire publisher 505 Games) has <a href="https://digitalbros-com.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025.07.22-FY2024-2025-Trade-update_cript.pdf">announced</a> it now expects revenue for its fiscal year ending 30th June 2025 - already projected to decline year-on-year - will "contract even further". The company says it currently anticipates a loss of "at least" €10m (approximately £8.7m), which it blames directly on the "underperformance" of Blades of Fire and higher-than-expected write-offs due to "persistent market uncertainty".

<p>
"The video game market remains affected by challenging competitive dynamics, driven by an oversupply of new releases and increasingly selective consumers," Digital Bros wrote. "These conditions make it particularly difficult to successfully launch new titles and to develop reliable forecasting models capable of accurately projecting sales and volumes at launch."
</p>
<p>
This, it added, "confirms the challenges faced by most industry peers and competitors in attracting consumers to new titles, particularly when these are not backed by an established brand driving a loyal player community."
</p>
<p>
Digital Bros' announcement mirrors similar struggles from other publishers in recent years. Last September, for instance, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage studio Don't Nod blamed an "extremely competitive and selective market" for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">commercial underperformance</a> of its critically acclaimed Jusant and Banishers, while Ubisoft highlighted an industry shift toward "mega-brands and long-lasting titles" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">considerably lower-than-expected earnings</a> in 2023.
</p>
<p>
But it's also clear 'established brands' are no guarantee of success either. Despite its strategic shift, Ubisoft was forced to admit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws had seen a "softer than expected launch" last year</a>, and the might of Batman couldn't save Warner Bros' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">performed so badly it lead to a $200m loss</a> for the company.

<p>We wouldn't HATE it if he was correct</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Yes, we already reported a little while back that well-known YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate">NateTheHate</a>, has suggested that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-set-to-take-place-later-this-month-its-claimed">Nintendo Direct is incoming</a> sometime in and around July. That's this month!</p>
<p>Speaking on his YouTube show, Mr TheHate (hope we got that right) had said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I have been told... There is a Direct this month, so the month of July. But, that Direct will not take place until after Donkey Kong Bananza releases. Beyond that, I have no additional information, I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st, right, which is Nintendo's earning report day. So I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investor's report."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it seems he has now doubled down on this belief, with precious little time left for it to transpire. As seen over <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">on on his social media</a> (cheers <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/natethehate-states-again-that-he-believes-nintendo-direct-happening-this-month/">MyNintendoNews</a>), in answering another poster, Nate reveals that "to my knowledge"the Direct is still on the cards.</p>
<figure><a title="DIRECT IN JULY?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7f16c52ccdeb/direct-in-july.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: x/@natethehate2</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nate has been reliable in the past, getting the Switch 2 announcement date correct, as an example, but we will all just have to wait and see with this one. At least there's not too long to go either way. One thing that may add a little credence, though, and it's something we've also reported on already, is that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-major-third-party-devs-reportedly-sitting-on-multiple-switch-2-announcements">a whole bunch of major devs are sitting on "multiple Switch 2 announcements".</a></p>
<p>Let's keep our fingers crossed that he's right, and a big juicy content drop is just around yonder corner.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Reckon there'll be a Direct in the window Nate points out? Looking forward to anything being announced in particular? make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Square Enix and Tactic Studios have announced that the multiplayer murder mystery game KILLER INN will host a Closed Beta Test this weekend on Steam. The CBT is set to begin on Friday, July 25, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time and will be live until Monday, July 28, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time. Access can be requested <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the store page</a>.</p>



<p>The developers warned that this is first and foremost a test meant to verify how the servers hold up when a large number of players join the game at the same time. This version also lacks the tutorials that will be available when the game actually launches in the near future.</p>



<p>KILLER INN is an asymmetrical competitive game where players are divided into two teams. The larger group (16) of players is called Lambs and faces off against a smaller group (8) of Wolves. Each team must reduce the other team's ranks through combat—the first team to eliminate all of the other team's members wins. The difference is that the Wolves know who their teammates are from the start, but the Lambs don't know which of their teammates may actually be a Wolf.</p>



<p>Whenever a Wolf kills a Lamb, at least one clue is left behind. Lambs must gather these clues to figure out the Wolves' identities. When coming across a corpse, players must ensure to pick up any clues on it, as this is an essential aspect of the game. To survive, players will need weapons and armor. They can get them either by opening chests with tokens earned after completing quests for the castle's staff members in the castle, or saving up gold to buy items from the in-game shop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles' Classic mode, which will allow players to experience the original game released back in 1997 on the first PlayStation, has been built from scratch, as the original source code has been lost, but this allowed the development team to add content that was cut from the original release.</p>



<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/21/the-secrets-behind-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-makeover/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the game's director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed once again that the Classic mode, which attempts to recreate the original as faithfully as possible, has been created from scratch, as the original master data and source code have been lost. As Maehiro-san highlighted, back in the day, developers didn't have effective resource management tools as they do today, and games were essentially developed by overwriting the previous code every time a bug was fixed or a language option was added.</p>



<p>As the Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Classic mode is meant to provide an experience faithful to the original, the development team also had the option of emulating the original, but doing so would have prevented them from making granular improvements. Eventually, it was decided that the best option would be to rebuild the original game from scratch. This choice paid off in a big way, as recreating the original experience gave the team a solid foundation upon which to create the Enhanced version, and add features that were cut from the original, such as character dialogues playing during battles under certain conditions that will help flesh out story character after they have joined Ramza's party. This is, in my opinion, a great addition, as it was sad to see this characters slide in the background and essentially become like generic units.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles will include some new features not seen in the original, it may not be the definitive edition some were waiting for, as tt won't feature the additional content seen in the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile release is based. <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">The decision</a> to not include this extra content was made because the remaster's main goal was to be as faithful to the original as possible.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on September 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
