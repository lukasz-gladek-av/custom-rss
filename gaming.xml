			<p>As <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1986748540744519784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by LinkedIn researcher extraordinaire Timur222, an Executive Producer who worked at Free Range Games until last week (she was unfortunately just laid off, as so many game developers nowadays) has practically confirmed that The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria will be getting a sequel. On her LinkedIn profile, she wrote: </p>



<p><em>As Executive Producer and Studio Executive at Free Range Games, I lead large-scale creative and technical initiatives that drive the development of AAA titles across global teams. My work includes overseeing the post-production lifecycle of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria franchise (and sequel) and a new unannounced IP with a $100 million budget and a 130-person distributed team. I partner closely with executive leadership to define production strategy, strengthen operational efficiency, and align project milestones with studio growth objectives. Beyond production oversight. I play a key role in building a culture of trust and accountability, mentoring producers, and advancing sustainable remote collaboration models that enhance delivery consistency and team cohesion.</em></p>



<p>It seems like the independent developer based in Sausalito, California, has two big projects on the works: a sequel to 2023's survival crafting game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, which has clearly done well enough to warrant another entry, and an even bigger unannounced project with a nine-digit budget.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as covered a couple of weeks ago, Free Range Games is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/durins-folk-dlc-adds-20-hours-new-content-the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durin's Folk DLC</a>, which will introduce around twenty hours of new content to The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, not to mention new features such as recruitable NPCs with specific skills.</p>



<p>The DLC will add an area known as Durin's Tower, trading camps near Moria’s gates, and the recruiting camp at Dimmer Dale. New gameplay elements include recruiting dwarves with specific skills. In Durin's Folk, players will also manage delvings (mining bases) with buildings. The DLC will go live on November 18 on all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p>It's certainly good news for Tolkien fans who love videogames, especially following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second cancellation of Amazon's MMO</a>. According to a recent rumor, there may be yet another project based on The Lord of the Rings: an action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-in-development-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly created as a rival to Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The full list of nominees for the 2026 Grammys was announced on Friday, and that includes the category dedicated to video games and interactive media. This will be the fourth year that the award for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media will be given after it was introduced for the 2023 awards.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2026-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">year’s nominees include</a> games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Star Wars Outlaws, and even Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>You may be asking, “How is Helldivers 2 nominated?” Well, that’s because of the timing of nominations and when soundtracks were actually released. The soundtrack for Helldivers 2 <a href="https://milanrecords.com/out-now-helldivers-2-original-game-soundtrack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was officially released</a> on September 20, 2024. To be eligible for the 2026 Grammys, the soundtrack had to be released between August 31, 2024, and August 30, 2025. </p>



<p>The 68th annual Grammy Awards takes place on February 1, 2026. You can check out the five games up for the award below.</p>







<p>Of this year’s nominees, only two were from games that originally released during the nomination window. Helldivers 2’s eligibility was already covered above, but what about Avatar and Star Wars Outlaws? That’s pretty simple, as well, because they were for story expansions that released within the required timeframe.</p>



<p>The full nomination list is:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – Secrets of the Spire</strong>: Pinar Toprak, composer</li>



<li><strong>Helldivers 2</strong>: Wilbert Roget, II, composer</li>



<li><strong>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</strong>: Gordy Haab, composer</li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card &amp; A Pirate’s Fortune</strong>: Cody Matthew Johnson &amp; Wilbert Roget, II, composers</li>



<li><strong>Sword of the Sea</strong>: Austin Wintory, composer</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-past-soundtrack-winners">Past Soundtrack Winners</h2>



<p>As mentioned, this will be the fourth year in a row for the Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media. In 2023, <strong>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok by Stephanie Economou</strong> took home the first award after beating out Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Call of Duty Vanguard, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and Old World.</p>



<p>In 2024, it was <strong>Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab winning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong>. Other nominees that year included Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, and Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical. </p>



<p>Last year, <strong>Winifred Phillips won for Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</strong>. Wizardry beat out Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars Outlaws.</p>

That one simply has a Bowser figure who tries to stop racers from making the loop. But Bowser's Castle Raceway has a proper castle in the center of the track.</p><p>Kamek or other Mario Kart racers you already own zip across the treacherous track via a slam launcher. Bowser's minions will try to stop you in a variety of ways, which is awkward since Kamek is Bowser's right-hand Koopa, but perhaps Bullet Bill, Dry Bones, Lakitu, and the castle itself are jealous of that. The track has one tall loop that sends your racer through the castle door.</p><p>This 34-inch track is one of the larger Mario Kart Hot Wheel sets actively being produced today. As mentioned, Bowser's Castle Raceway implements the new Speed Snap connection system, which makes track pieces easier for kids to assemble. And as the name suggests, the system makes the assembly and teardown processes quicker in general.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Mario-Kart-Circuit-Track/dp/B08VZR6XZX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wheels-Mario-Kart-Circuit-Track\/dp\/B08VZR6XZX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Mario-Kart-Circuit-Track/dp/B08VZR6XZX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Hot Wheels: Mario Kart Circuit Track Set</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Mario-Kart-Circuit-Track/dp/B08VZR6XZX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wheels-Mario-Kart-Circuit-Track\/dp\/B08VZR6XZX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Mario-Kart-Circuit-Track/dp/B08VZR6XZX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$68 (was $98) | Amazon Exclusive</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Amazon-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Mario-Kart-Circuit-Track/dp/B08VZR6XZX?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Kart Circuit Track Set</a> comes with two diecast racers with their standard karts: Mario and Yoshi.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The proof is in the pudding, and the food is good."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games have been busy. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">GTA 6 was delayed yesterday</a>, news that broke alongside Take-Two's quarterly earnings call. And just last week, Rockstar fired between 30 and 40 employees, claiming later that they were "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum">distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</a>" against company policy. The fired employees, however, say they were participating in a union-related Discord chat, and that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-dev-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-in-sudden-firing-of-dozens-of-staff">their firing was "blatant" and "ruthless" union busting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is defending the company's culture and labor record, saying Take-Two is "incredibly proud" of its labor relations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN yesterday ahead of the earnings announcement, Zelnick pointed me to Take-Two and Rockstar's existing public statements when I asked if he had any response to the allegations of union busting, and reiterating that "we fully support Rockstar."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So then I asked Zelnick, what is Take-Two's stance on unions, generally? Zelnick did not reply to that specific question. But here's what he did say:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here’s what we have a stance on. We value every one of our colleagues greatly. We have 13,500 colleagues worldwide. We’re so proud of our culture. In the last few years we’ve been recognized over 15 times as an employer of choice... we’ve been certified this year as a great place to work in the U.S. and UK, Forbes recently called us one of the world’s best employers, and further... our attrition rate is half or less of the industry average. To be specific, our global attrition rate is just over 6%, in the UK it's less than 4%. The industry average is over 12%, and Rockstar is even lower than our average."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, you know, the proof is in the pudding, and the food is good, and I think our culture is extraordinary. And we strive to be the most creative, most innovative, and most efficient company in the business. So that’s how we look at it. We’re incredibly proud of our labor relations."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/gettyimages-1440125158-1762538511589.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Strauss Zelnick has defended Rockstar's company culture. Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[A Take-Two spokesperson later clarified Rockstar's global attrition rate is 4%, and in the UK it is "half that number." IGN followed up to ask for the source of the over 12% industry average attrition. The spokesperson clarified it was for "entertainment and tech" and that the source was Take-Two's own internal research: "we use a variety of related data platforms/sources to compile."]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick's response comes amid ongoing uproar over the firings, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-employment-protests-outside-take-two-and-rockstar-north-offices-as-fired-staff-deny-leaking-company-secrets">affected employees and supporters picketing outside Rockstar and Take-Two's UK offices yesterday</a>. According to the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), the only non-Rockstar people inside the private union Discord were union organizers. IWGB boss Alex Marshall issued IGN the following statement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rockstar continue to deflect from the real reason for these dismissals: they are afraid of hard working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice.

<figure data-uuid="fce842f35f96c"><a title="Mega Man 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fce842f35f96c/mega-man-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mega Man</strong> artist and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mighty_no_9">Mighty No. 9</a> creator Keiji Inafune has been a huge name in the industry for nearly four decades, so you could say he's got a fair bit of experience. Recently, the producer gave a talk at South Korea’s Console Game Developer Conference 2025, and has a few strong words for developers and publishers relying on big IPs and genre trends.</p>
<p>Reported on by <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/406514">ThisIsGame</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mega-man-creator-keiji-inafune-criticizes-game-industrys-growing-reliance-on-ip-fame-and-trendy-genres-we-need-developers-with-a-clear-message/">Automaton</a>), Inafune was critical of studios that rely on those established brands and IPs or just shoot for "genre trends" because they're supposedly guaranteed to make money.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying it’s bad to continue existing franchises or make games that riff on popular genres," Inafune states (translated via machine by Automaton), "What I mean is that these shouldn’t be the only games being made."</p>
<p>It's hard to argue with that, though obviously every studio is going to vary. Nintendo has a huge range of IPs to dip into, for example, and while we see regulars such as <strong>Mario</strong>, <strong>Pokémon</strong>, and <strong>Zelda</strong> pop up every other year (or sometimes every year), the Big N occasionally dips into its deeper past (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven</a> in 2026, anyone?).</p>
<p>In terms of "popular genres", looter shooters, Battle Royales, and extraction shooters are all carrots the industry has been trying to chase for years with varying results.</p>

<p>In his speech, Inafune mentioned "<strong>Monster Hunter</strong>-style" and "<strong>Final Fantasy</strong>-style" games and that, back in his day, new concepts were "simply the norm" and put down his own success to jumping between different projects, even though he spent the most time working on the Mega Man series.</p>
<p>He told the audience that his success "was possible because I didn’t dwell on my past hits”, and that the industry has taken a much more "defensive" stance as the industry has matured.</p>
<p>While he understands that business may need to fall back on the more-popular things, "when considering the essence of game development and the passion for creation, it should not become the entirety of the gaming scene."</p>
<p>Inafune has indeed had an extremely varied career, worked as a graphic designer on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a>, various Disney Capcom games, producer on the DualShock release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil_directors_cut">Resident Evil</a>, the <strong>Onimusha</strong> series, executive producer on <strong>Lost Planet</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/apollo_justice_ace_attorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/ghost_trick_phantom_detective">Ghost Trick</a>... we could list <em>hundreds.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="351278c84ddf8"><a title="Mighty No. 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/351278c84ddf8/mighty-no-9.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Deep Silver</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Post-Capcom, Inafune has worked with Inti Creates on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/azure_striker_gunvolt">Azure Striker Gunvolt</a> series and launched the hugely successful Kickstarter for Mighty No. 9, a game which was heavily inspired by Mega Man and, unfortunately, turned out to be a critical flop. In 2022, he announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/nft-project-with-artwork-from-mega-man-artist-and-mighty-no-9-creator-keiji-inafune-confirmed">an NFT project called Beastroids</a>, once again inspired by Mega Man.</p>
<p>Inafune also joined Level-5 after the purchase of Comcept in 2017, eventually working as producer on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>. He <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/fantasy-life-i-development-was-restructured-in-2024-as-keiji-inafune-left-company">left the company in 2024</a>, with Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino saying that following his departure, "we had to reassess and restructure the project". He has since joined Rocket Studio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The original Soldier of Fortune was a Raven Software title that was released on PC in the year 2000, and if you look at gameplay from the original title, it's a clear showcase of just how far we've come since those days. However, thanks to modder 'Pathtraced Paradise,' a new RTX Remix mod currently in development breathes new path-traced life into the classic first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/videotrailer-news/take-a-look-at-this-soldier-of-fortune-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">DSOGaming</a>, the modder currently has YouTube videos uploaded of the first two levels, though<a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/solider-of-fortune-rtx-remix-mod-wip-demo"> files for the tutorial and first three levels have been compiled so far</a>. It is still a work-in-progress, though, so you'll have to wait for Pathtraced Paradise to finish developing the mod to play the whole game in this new light. There's currently no download link available for the mod.</p>



<p>That said, what they've shared of the first two levels already looks like strong work, as you can see from the videos below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Soldier of Fortune (2000) - RTX Remix Mod - Level 1 Playthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-wBXc-_Tdw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's always fun to see old games like Soldier of Fortune get another chance at life with mods like this, which easily make going back to classic titles a much more enjoyable experience than they otherwise would be if you had to deal with the original graphical settings.</p>



<p>Other recent RTX remix mods that added path-tracing to older games include <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-soon/">a recent Max Payne 2 mod that looks incredible</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/">Grand Theft Auto IV RTX remix mod</a>, and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-path-tracing-rtx-remix/">Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind path-tracing mod</a>.</p>



<p>There's also path-tracing mods worth checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-rtx-mod-path-tracing/">for Fallout: New Vegas</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">the Half-Life remake, Black Mesa</a>. Also, it should be noted that the same creator behind the aforementioned GTA IV path-tracing mod has made successful path-tracing mods for <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-4-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">Portal 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">Left 4 Dead 2</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's unfortunately no word on when Pathtraced Paradise will be done modding the rest of the game, but at least for now, these videos provide a sneak peek at what we can look forward to, especially considering the fact that these aren't even representative of what the mod will look like when it's finished.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developer-behind-hit-2025-game-thinks-the-response-has-been-%E2%80%98too-positive%E2%80%99.1347313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I am convinced that I can get better at <a href="https://kotaku.com/ballxpit-devolver-kenny-sun-brickbreaker-indie-2000635720">playing <em>Ball X Pit</em></a>, but whether I win or lose often seems to have little connection to my actual moment-to-moment skill. Sure, I can be smarter about my upgrade picks. I can aim and maneuver to maximize my DPS and avoid some attacks. But in the aggregate, my success feels more or less predetermined by an invisible curve that’s slowly progressing me through the metagame.</p> <p>“I think there is a bit of a skill curve, but I do think it plateaus pretty quickly,” lead developer Kenny Sun <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ball-x-pit-x-interview">told<em> Game File</em></a> this week. “Once you get it, there’s not much you can do to improve your play. So, it is very much a game about pretending that you’re getting better by getting better stats, actually.”</p>

 <p>Rarely has a developer so perfectly articulated my ambiguous and conflicted feelings about their game!</p> <p>Look, <em>Ball X Pit</em> is great. The smart mashup of <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-balatro-kill-the-brickman-poncle-roguelike-2000619132"><em>Breakout</em> and <em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> is way more than just a cash-in on one of Steam’s hottest genres. It’s part shoot ’em up, part buildcrafting roguelike, and part management sim. And it’s not just nice to look at and listen to while you’re watching the numbers go up. There are new levels to reach with unique hazards and tons of characters to unlock that subvert the core ball-throwing mechanic in interesting ways.</p>

 <p>But still, I have a hard time not feeling slightly tricked and manipulated as I play, even if after each break I eventually come back for more. It’s the same way I felt about <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and later <em>Balatro</em>, and most recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-silent-hill-jurassic-world-dispatch-2000638933"><em>Slots &amp; Daggers</em></a>. Sun said this is partly by design.</p>

 <p>“I kind of like the idea of having it start off as one thing and then slowly evolve into an idle game,” he told<em> Game File</em>. “Like, the more you play, the less you play.” He continued, “That’s something that one of my artists was talking about: He had this idea about how games were kind of turning into a thing where players just want to play less of the game. Like, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is all about not playing the game.”</p>

 <p>In other words, the more I play, the more I’m actually not playing, which makes me want to play even more. This is nothing completely new. You can sense the <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-video-game-loot-is-so-addictive-according-to-the-c-1846695147">dark DNA of <em>Diablo</em></a> in each of these recent RNG-driven skinner boxes. But they are getting so much more streamlined and optimized.</p>

 <p>Maybe that’s some small part of why Sun seems somewhat reluctant about <em>Ball X Pit</em>‘s wild success.</p> <p>It sold 400,000 copies in its first week. That number has almost doubled in the weeks since. “It just feels weird for so many people to like this game,” he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-07/how-ball-x-pit-became-a-hit-video-game?srnd=undefined">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a separate interview. “I think the response has been a bit too positive. I think, like, there are plenty of flaws…I think the good things are good enough that it makes people ignore the flaws.”</p> <p>Whatever those flaws are, they haven’t dented the roguelike’s 96-percent positive user rating on Steam. No wonder my inbox is flooded with new indie games pitching themselves as “<em>Vampire Survivors</em> meets X” or <em>“Balatro</em> crossed with Y.” Unfortunately, I don’t think most of them will be cleverly designed as <em>Ball X Pit</em>, let alone as successful.</p>

You can't make a Western game and try to compete with Red Dead."</p><p>Stockman went on to describe GTA Online's continued success as a "lifestyle" that has "propelled it to be beyond just a game." Instead of trying to take GTA's crown, Stockman suggested that there's room for someone to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-gta/2900-5629/" data-ref-id="2900-5629">the No. 2 game like GTA</a>.</p><p>"The industry is bigger than its ever been in the sense that people hunger for games," said Stockman. "People hunger for new experiences. I think it's entirely possible to be a number two, there's nothing wrong with trying to be a number two if you play your cards right. You don't go crazy, you be very focused, you don't look at GTA as a North Star and say, 'I wanna be that.' You have a clear identity and this is what you're trying to do. And you don't have to be a 100 hour masterpiece, and you just gotta be smart about it."</p><p>Stockman recently disclosed that he has been asked to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-creative-director-wants-to-bring-the-franchise-back-from-the-dead/1100-6535875/" data-ref-id="1100-6535875">pitch a Saints Row sequel</a>, but that project hasn't fully come together yet. The most recent game in the series was the 2022 Saints Row reboot.</p><p>For the time being, there are no new Saints Row games officially in the works, and the wait for GTA 6 is now much longer, a fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-delays-gta-6-and-the-internet-responds-exactly-as-youd-expect/1100-6536039/" data-ref-id="1100-6536039">fans online haven't been happy about</a>. Barring another release date change, Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 19, 2026.</p>

It's a "more straightforward racing" kind of mode. Meanwhile, City Trial is a "free-for-all battle for 16 players online." You collect power-ups, survive Field Events like falling meteors and "powerful boss battles," and compete against rival Riders in Stadium contests.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-getting-a-kirby-air-ride-sequel/1100-6530561/" data-ref-id="1100-6530561">A sequel</a> to a series that's been dormant for over 20 years, director Masahiro Sakurai said Kirby Air Riders is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-sakurai-says/1100-6534066/" data-ref-id="1100-6534066">basically Mario Kart</a>" in August 2025, so if you like that racing game, you may like this racing game.

                <p>An early quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> tasks you with finding Antiseptics, Syringes, Durable Cloths, and Great Mullein for Lance. While this may sound overwhelming at first, it's actually a pretty easy quest to complete once you realize all of the items are likely to be found in the same handful of areas. Below, we'll fill you in on where to find all of the items for the first quest from Lance, as well as how you can simply craft a few of them if necessary.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Where_to_get_Antiseptics__Syringes__and_Durable_Cloths">Where to get Antiseptics, Syringes, and Durable Cloths</a><ul><li><a href="#How_to_craft_Antiseptic">How to craft Antiseptic</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_craft_Durable_Cloth">How to craft Durable Cloth</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Where_to_get_Great_Mullein">Where to get Great Mullein</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Where_to_get_Antiseptics__Syringes__and_Durable_Cloths">Where to get Antiseptics, Syringes, and Durable Cloths</h2><p>Antiseptics, syringes, and durable cloths can all be found in medical POIs, with the latter occasionally showing up in Commercial buildings as well. Some excellent early spots to seek out these items include the Testing Annex on the southeastern side of the Dam Battlegrounds, or the Hospital or Piazza Arbusto pharmacy on Buried City. All of these locations have a high probability of serving up at least one or two of these items while thoroughly exploring their interiors.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598672-share_20251107_0504583.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598673-share_20251107_0506480.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598674-share_20251107_0506491.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598672,1300-4598673,1300-4598674" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598672-share_20251107_0504583.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598673-share_20251107_0506480.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598674-share_20251107_0506491.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598672-share_20251107_0504583.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598673-share_20251107_0506480.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598674-share_20251107_0506491.jpeg"></figure><p>Alternatively, Antiseptics and Durable Cloths can also be crafted if you have the Refiner workshop bench built in Speranza.</p><h3 id="How_to_craft_Antiseptic">How to craft Antiseptic</h3><ul><li>Chemicals x10</li><li>Great Mullein x2</li></ul><h3 id="How_to_craft_Durable_Cloth">How to craft Durable Cloth</h3><ul><li>Fabric x14</li></ul><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598670-share_20251107_0504572.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598671-share_20251107_0504561.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598670,1300-4598671" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598670-share_20251107_0504572.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598671-share_20251107_0504561.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598670-share_20251107_0504572.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598671-share_20251107_0504561.jpeg"></figure><p>Sadly, Syringes can't be crafted, so you'll need to do some looting one way or another if you want to get your hands on those. Luckily, as you'll see below, the spot you find Great Mullein easiest is also a great choice for finding these medical supplies, so it shouldn't pose too much of a hassle.</p><h2 id="Where_to_get_Great_Mullein">Where to get Great Mullein</h2><p>Great Mullein can be found across multiple maps, typically in areas with a lot of water. The easiest place to find some near-guaranteed drops is the Testing Annex on the Dam Battlegrounds map. On the bottom floor of this facility is a pool of water that almost always has multiple spawns of this plant available for you to pluck up--assuming no one else has passed through and taken them before you. As referenced above, it's also a fantastic location for finding the other items you need as well, so make sure you loot upstairs, too, if you haven't finished the other quest requirements.</p><p>Refer to the image below for what Great Mullein looks like.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598675-share_20251107_0504550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598675" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598675-share_20251107_0504550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598675"></a><figcaption>Great Mullein in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598675-share_20251107_0504550.jpeg"></figure><p>When you've found all of the items needed for Lance, return to him at Speranza and turn in the quest. Next up, he'll send you off to loot a bunch of containers across multiple maps for the Medical Merchandise quest, so make sure you're ready for plenty of exploring when you head topside next.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

This quest is straightforward at a glance, but you'll want to know where to go to find this item, as getting back out alive is all part of the task.</p><p>You heard right--you'll need to take the ESR Analyzer back to Speranza, so you'll want to bring an augment with a safe pocket to ensure that you don't lose the item if you happen to die. Once you've equipped an appropriate augment--and hopefully a good gun and a few heals--it'll be time to set off.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle A Reveal in Ruins, follow the steps below to find the ESR Analyzer.</p><h3>Where to find the ESR Analyzer for A Reveal in Ruins</h3><p>The first quest objective for A Reveal in Ruins states you can find an ESR Analyzer in any pharmacy in the Buried City, but the safest and most easily-accessible option is located in the Piazza Arbusto POI on the southeast part of the map. This location is generally quiet with slightly fewer ARC and raiders wandering around than in higher-traffic areas around the Buried City.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598595-share_20251107_0409440.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598595-share_20251107_0409440.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598595"></a><figcaption>Pizza Arbusto pharmacy location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598595-share_20251107_0409440.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the pharmacy in Piazza Arbusto, you'll discover the front door is barred. You'll need to breach it by interacting with the barricade, which will take a few moments to complete and make a lot of noise. You'll probably be fine--but if it <em>does</em> alert any nearby ARC, you can either fight them or quickly close the door behind you when you enter the pharmacy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598597-share_20251107_0409473.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598597" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598597-share_20251107_0409473.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598597"></a><figcaption>Breach the door to enter the pharmacy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598597-share_20251107_0409473.jpeg"></figure><p>Inside the pharmacy, you'll be able to find a variety of useful healing items and resources, so feel free to check all the shelves in this room. When you're ready to pick up the ESR Analyzer, you'll find it in plain sight on the counter here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598598-share_20251107_0409451.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598598" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598598-share_20251107_0409451.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598598"></a><figcaption>Take the ESR Analyzer from the counter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598598-share_20251107_0409451.jpeg"></figure><p>With the ESR Analyzer found, you'll want to toss it in a safe pocket (if you have one), as you need to extract with the item and take it back to Lance to complete the quest. The Eastern Station extraction point is just southwest of your location, so that's likely to be your safest bet for getting out alive. Head there and carefully make your way downstairs, as there are sometimes explosive ARC Pods wandering the steps. Call the train, head back to Speranza, and give Lance the ESR Analyzer to complete A Reveal in Ruins.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>You're probably accustomed to using the normal method of extraction in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, such as elevators, trains, or air shafts (depending on the map). However, Raider Hatches provide an easier and faster method of getting back to Speranza if you have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-arc-raiders-hatch-keys-and-what-they-do/1100-6535839/" data-ref-id="1100-6535839">Raider Hatch Key</a>. You'll learn about these unique escape hatches during the Hatch Repair quest--but you'll also need to repair a hatch to complete the quest.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete Hatch Repairs, but as you'll find further below, the quest makes it quite easy for you to do so if you wish. Either way, it's never a bad idea to load in with a free loadout to ensure you don't lose any hard-earned items or guns if you die during the quest.</p><p>Once you're ready to take on Hatch Repairs, follow the steps below to find a Raider Hatch and repair it.</p><h2>Where to find a Raider Hatch</h2><p>The first step to repairing a Raider Hatch is to, well, find one. Luckily, there are multiple Raider Hatches on the Dam Battlegrounds map, so the one that will be best suited for you to visit will depend on where you spawn. Below are the four spots you can go to find a Raider Hatch, so pick the one closest to your spawn--or wherever you are during your exploration--and head that way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598589-share_20251107_0339422.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598589" data-ratio="0.58888126286891" data-width="2914" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598589-share_20251107_0339422.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598589"></a><figcaption>Raider Hatch locations on Dam Battlegrounds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598589-share_20251107_0339422.jpeg"></figure><p>As a side note, you can complete this quest on other maps, as well, as Raider Hatches are available on every map. However, since this quest is given to you early in the game, we've opted to keep this guide simple with the Dam Battlegrounds locations, as this map is available to all players immediately. In contrast, other maps won't unlock until you've played a specific number of matches.</p><h2>How to repair a Raider Hatch</h2><p>When you arrive at a Raider Hatch, you'll need to repair it. This part is very easy, as you'll simply need to <strong>click on the pipe coming out of the hatch</strong>, which should glow yellow in your game to indicate that you can interact with it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598590-share_20251107_0339411.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598590" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598590-share_20251107_0339411.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598590"></a><figcaption>Repair the Raider Hatch by interacting with this pipe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598590-share_20251107_0339411.jpeg"></figure><p>With this done, you'll have completed the Hatch Repairs quest. Before you leave, note that finishing the above task will cause a small box to spawn near the hatch, which will contain a Raider Hatch Key. These can be used to escape through any Raider Hatch. Your quest is done, so you don't have to use this key right now if you'd like to continue exploring--but if you're ready to bail out, this makes for a quick and easy return to Speranza.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick seems pretty happy with this year’s <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</em> In a new interview, he said the relatively short and linear semi-open-world action game proves that a lot of players will buy games that are focused, not super bloated, and offer a good story. And boy howdy, as someone who loves a nice weekend single-player game, I’m very happy to hear that.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true#:~:text=The%20other%20big,the%20perfect%20result.%E2%80%9D">In a recent interview with T<em>he Game Business</em> newsletter</a>, Zelnick talked about some of the successes Take-Two has had over the past few months. It turns out <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em> isn’t selling as well as expected, which the CEO blames on PC issues and says he expects it to do well in the long term. On the flipside, <em>Mafia: The Old Country,</em> a different game published earlier this year by 2K (a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two), actually <em>beat</em> internal sales expectations. According to Zelnick, it proves that people want well-made, narrative-driven single-player games.</p>

 <p>“What we suspected was confirmed,” Zelnick told the outlet. “Which is just…if you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.”</p>  <h2>Remember when everything wasn’t a live-service thing?</h2> <p>Released in August and developed by Hangar 13,<em> The Old Country</em> is smaller than past <em>Mafia</em> titles, only takes about 11 hours to complete, has no online components, and launched at a reduced price of $50. It’s also the kind of game we don’t really get anymore from AAA publishers like 2K: <a href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions">a big-budget, solo-only, linear action game</a> that lacks a lot of replay value or in-game purchases. Back in the PS2 and even Xbox 360 eras of gaming, this was pretty standard stuff. Not so much anymore.</p>

 <p>However, as Zelnick points out, there is definitely a demand for these types of games. I think a lot of people don’t have the time to dedicate to the latest big online hit, nor can they invest 200 hours into some giant open-world RPG. But a 10- to 12-hour action-adventure game with some great cutscenes, good writing, and no bullshit? Yeah, that’s appealing to a lot of people, myself included.</p> <p>Hopefully<em>, Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s success can be used as a blueprint for Take-Two, and the publisher can greenlight similarly sized projects at its various studios. And we can play those games while we wait for Take-Two’s juggernaut, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6,</em> to finally release one day. Eventually</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption developer Rockstar fired 30-40 employees, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was accused of union busting by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain</a>. Rockstar denied the accusations through a spokesperson and maintained that these employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had leaked information on a public forum</a>.</p>



<p>The latest chapter of the story saw an anonymous employee of the award-winning game development studio <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/?do=findComment&amp;comment=1072605777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write a lengthy post on GTAForums</a>, the biggest public forum dedicated to the series of best-selling open world videogames. This poster's identity was allegedly verified by a moderator at GTAForums.</p>



<p>In the post, this employee claims that the fired workers were practically ambushed by the HR department, which called them over 'for a quick chat' and then handed a termination letter accusing them of misconduct related to Discord discussions, but provided no evidence or further details about the supposed offense. Those physically present were reportedly forced out within minutes. Others who were not at the office received a brisk phone call of less than two minutes and were notified that they would receive the aforementioned letter. Some of them were sick, even recovering from surgery, or on family leave, and this sudden termination leaves them financially vulnerable.</p>



<p>The anonymous employee adds that Rockstar fired critical staff, such as leads, artists, designers, programmers, and producers, many of whom had long tenures and clean records at the studio. Moreover, he counters the official statement, clarifying that the Discord channel in question was strictly for employee and union discussions about working conditions, not for game leaks; all those who got terminated were union members. The timing, the employee says, was clearly aimed at sabotaging union recognition, just as the union group had reached the size needed to initiate formal negotiations for better pay and working conditions.</p>



<p>The post concludes with a warning that if Rockstar gets away with this, it may do it again without facing repercussions. The employee also urges fans to support the fired workers by making a donation <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the Action Network</a>.</p>



<p>The controversy arises in the same week that brought us to yesterday, when Rockstar announced the second delay of Grand Theft Auto VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now slated for release on November 19, 2026</a>.</p>

According to the suit, Roblox’s parental controls push only began after a number of lawsuits, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">a report released last fall by the short seller Hindenburg</a> that said its “in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.”</p><p>In August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">Louisiana filed a similar lawsuit</a>, alleging that Roblox “permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive.” A couple of months later, the state of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/793711/another-state-is-suing-roblox">Kentucky also sued Roblox</a>, calling it “a hunting ground for child predators.” Last month, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/florida-attorney-general-issues-subpoenas-roblox-child-safety-rcna238711">subpoenaed Roblox</a> over similar allegations. It’s not just states suing Roblox, either. Numerous <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/texas-lawsuit-roblox-discord/285-ea17aa89-62bb-4bb5-8877-266b82f7efb7">families and Roblox players</a> have also sued the platform for alleged abuse, such as the cases detailed in Texas’s lawsuit.</p><p>Eric Porterfield, Senior Director of Policy Communications at Roblox, responded to the lawsuit in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, saying, “We are disappointed that, rather than working collaboratively with Roblox on this industry-wide challenge and seeking real solutions, the AG has chosen to file a lawsuit based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims.” He added, “We have introduced over 145 safety measures on the platform this year alone.”</p><p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-rdc-2025">reported in September</a> that it has over 111 million daily active users, many of whom are children. Earlier this year, Roblox announced plans to roll out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/708670/roblox-trusted-connections-age-estimation-privacy">age verification</a> using IDs and facial scans, along with <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/open-sourcing-roblox-sentinel-preemptive-risk-detection">an AI system</a> intended to “detect early signals of potential child endangerment.”</p><p>It echoes similar changes on social media platforms like Discord, which also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/650493/discord-age-verification-face-id-scan-experiment">began rolling out age verification</a> this year and has even been cited in some of the same lawsuits filed against Roblox, including <a href="https://abc7.com/post/online-gaming-parental-controls-lawsuit-claims-roblox-discord-failed-protect-galveston-texas-girl-alleged-predator/16294376/">one case</a> involving a 13-year-old from Texas.

            <p>Even as the consortium led by Donald Trump's haunted finger puppet Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund proceed with their wildly leveraged $50 billion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">acquisition of Electronic Arts</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> executive producer Mike Gamble would like everybody to know that we're just fine, you guys. 
</p>
<p>Everything is hunkey-dorey over here at BioWare, a studio whose last few, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-dragon-age-the-veilguard-report-reveals-more-about-turbulent-development-including-forspoken-prompted-shift-from-snark-to-seriousness">famously</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-producer-posts-tell-all-video-about-the-messy-birth-of-ea-and-biowares-anthem">difficult</a> original videogame projects both severely undershot commercial expectations, as we gaze down the barrel of a buyout that will leave our parent organisation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">$20 billion in debt </a>and beholden to new owners who may disagree with everything we stand for, and who allegedly want to juice the screws with generative AI. Happy N7 Day, you bastards. Here's a cute coded message for you about the future of Mass Effect, 13 years since the last indisputably good one (sorry Nic). Please ignore the tears streaming down my face.
</p>
<p>OK, so this characterisation is both mean-spirited and quite silly, but I cannot read Gamble's <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">smiling words</a> without hearing somebody cocking a Kessler out of shot. "Like you, we've heard the rumors lately," he acknowledges, after some seasonal preamble. "You've made it clear you care deeply about what's next. So let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe."
</p>
<p>For context, the next Mass Effect game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-making-a-new-mass-effect">sort-of-announced in 2020</a>. Since then, there has been the occasional snippet of info about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-tease-the-return-of-the-geth-in-the-next-mass-effect-game">the possible return of the Geth</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-5s-top-development-brass-includes-a-few-original-mass-effect-trilogy-veterans">the definite return of senior developers from the original trilogy</a>, but nothing of real substance, for BioWare's attention has been firmly fixed on the completion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. The latter missed EA's opening quarterly targets, prompting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">mass layoffs</a> in a year when EA staff earned less on average while CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-got-a-nice-pay-bump-last-year-while-the-companys-workers-earned-less-on-average">got himself a pay rise</a>. All this was before the proposed $50 billion dollar acquisition, which has led one former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive to speculate that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-exec-thinks-eas-new-owners-might-sell-bioware-and-use-other-studios-for-saudi-arabian-pr">EA might sell BioWare or close them down</a>.
</p><p>"The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble went on. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."
</p>
<p>He also gave an update on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-amazon-make-a-mass-effect-tv-show-liara-should-be-the-main-character">the forthcoming Mass Effect TV show</a>, on which BioWare are collaborating with Amazon. Amazon, the revolting business empire that turned Sauron into an office creep, though I will concede they did an OK job with Fallout.
</p>
<p>"The writers room is going strong, and we've got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game," Gamble added. "The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story - because after all ... that's YOUR story, isn't it?" It is, Mike, and I'll thank Jeff Bezos to keep his stinking space colonisation fantasies away from my precious Normandy.
</p>
<p>If you're wondering why the blog post text looks weird, that's because as with N7 Day bulletins of yore, it contains a hidden message. Tot up all the italicised words, including game names, and you get "u r l Mass Effect k r g a n", unless I've missed a few. Which I guess points towards a website of some kind, while teasing that the Krogan are in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>. I've jumbled the letters up several times and I can't find a way to make it read "please Sony buy us".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mass-effect-tv-series-not-adapting-original-trilogy.1347229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Amazon’s Mass Effect series won’t be an adaptation of the original Commander Shepherd trilogy, confirms BioWare and EA. Even more so, it’ll be an original story set after Mass Effect 3.</p>



<p>The Mass Effect series has rightly become the premier narrative-driven game and a must-play for any gamer. Despite an okay third entry, the first two games are some of the best RPGs on the market, even after almost two decades. The last entry in the series, Mass Effect Andromeda, didn’t meet fan expectations, so any new project is welcome. Last year, Amazon announced that it would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-officially-in-development-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be making a Mass Effect TV series</a> for Prime Video. Now, we know a bit more about the direction they are going, and it’s an interesting one.</p>



<h2 id="h-mass-effect-tv-show-set-after-the-original-trilogy">Mass Effect TV Show Set After The Original Trilogy</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As part of N7 Day, celebrating the USS Normandy in the game, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog was posted</a> on the official Mass Effect site. Series executive producer Mike Gamble spoke at length about the future of the series. While no updates on the new Mass Effect were shared outside of that it’s in production, the Amazon show was talked about. In the piece, he states,</p>



<p>“<strong>The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game</strong>,” Gamble says in the blog. “<strong>The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?</strong>”</p>



<p>As Gamble said, the show is <strong>now in the writing stage</strong> and will, surprisingly, <strong>not adapt the original trilogy</strong>. This means that, more than likely, Commander Shepard and the Normandy crew will not be in attendance. However, despite being an original story, it will take place <strong>after the events of Mass Effect 3</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to what ending may be canon is unknown, but it’ll be interesting to see how it goes. Mass Effect is a space opera, so it does translate well into a show akin to Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek. As a fan, I’m excited to see what’s in store, especially since it’ll be a brand new adventure.</p>



<p>What do you think about Amazon’s Mass Effect not adapting the original trilogy? Would you’ve liked to see Commander Shepard and crew in live-action? Do you think the show will work with an original story? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

Reznov’s father was killed by the Nazis, creating in him a thirst for payback so deep that not even death will quench it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1945</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Petrenko and Reznov blast into Berlin and plant the hammer and sickle atop the Reichstag in 1945. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Black Ops 1</a> reveals their post-war fates. Treacherous officer Nikita Dragovich and his pet sadist Lev Kravchenko drag our heroes into a task force hunting German scientist Friedrich Steiner– the evil genius behind a doomsday nerve gas called Nova 6. They corner the unrepentant jerk in the Arctic Circle where Steiner defects, to Reznov’s disgust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragovich betrays Reznov and gasses his men with the Nova 6, killing several including our POV character from World at War. Reznov is rescued by the British but sinks the Nova stockpile beneath the ice.Dragovich, Kravchenko, and Steiner escape with the formula. Reznov is recaptured and sent to the Vorkuta prison camp where he waits 16 years for a new protagonist to bro out with.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-bay-of-pigs-1762273011596.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1961</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Bay of Pigs invasion, the United States supports a coup that fails to overthrow Fidel Castro’s government. In real life, the U.S. provided funding, training, and air support for the revolution. In Black Ops 1, the CIA sends some special ops assassins to eliminate Castro: Alaskan Marine Alex Mason, Navy Seal Joseph Bowman, and chain-smoking, nigh unkillable veteran Frank Woods. Mason and Woods become the bedrock characters of BLOPS. Bowman, not so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch’s trio take down El Commandante’s body double. Mason is captured and taunted by an alive and well Fidel. Castro hands his prisoner over to returning Soviet heavies Kravchenko and Dragovich, who throw him in the gulag at Vorkuta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bad guys rewire Mason’s brain to become a sleeper agent controlled by a cryptic numbers station. Mason resists with the help of Reznov, his lone ally in the bowels of the Russian prison– Shawshank Redemption in a Soviet labor camp. As the men bond, Reznov programs a backdoor into Mason’s brain, compelling him to annihilate Steiner, Kravchenko, and Dragovich by any means necessary.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-escape-1762273161292.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1963</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Reznov engineers an uprising with a catchy 8-step plan that doubles as a conditioning tool. Big Vik sacrifices his own freedom so Mason can catch the last train out of Vorkuta, ending his two year imprisonment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The extremely traumatized Mason is assigned to handler Jason Hudson and summoned to the Pentagon. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara briefs them on Dragovich’s plans while Mason, who probably should have taken some self care PTO, starts to unravel. Mason’s mental breakdown crescendos when he meets John F. Kennedy as Dragovich’s programming surfaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the fact that he just crashed out in front of the President, Mason’s bosses send him to sabotage the Soyuz space program and torch the team of Nazi scientists working on Nova 6. The team rescues double-agent Grigori Weaver, who loses an eye in the process. He doesn’t have a massive role beyond BLOPS 1, but he plays a pivotal part in the Zombies’ Dark Aether Saga– one of many characters who found new life within the mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most operators would call it a day there, but because of Reznov’s programming, Mason literally cannot stop until he finds and ends Dragovich. The gang blows up his limo but they bail before the kill is confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Five days later, President Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Mason is present at the scene, but the CIA is quite unbothered by the brainwashed killing machine’s proximity to the crime of the century and keeps him on the payroll.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-russian-roulette-1762273354243.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1968</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Vietnam, Mason joins up with old buddies Woods and Bowman in search of Soviet intel on Nova 6. Mason meets with a defector that he believes is Viktor Reznov and they survive a lot of action setpieces together. The crew eventually arrives in Laos to secure a crashed plane carrying a cargo of Nova 6, but the gas is gone when they arrive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">VC and Spetsnaz troops ambush team BLOPS and force them to play Russian Roulette in a gruesome homage to The Deer Hunter. After Bowman is brutally murdered, Mason and Woods fight their way free, hijack a Hind, and bust up Kravchenko's headquarters, saving “Reznov” once again. Woods sacrifices himself to save Mason from the cornered Kravchenko, and both men are presumed dead. In true Call of Duty fashion, neither are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Weaver and Hudson make contact with Dr. Steiner, who is now terrified of Dragovich and desperate to flip on him. He reveals that Dragovich is hours away from ordering sleeper agents to unleash Nova 6 across the U.S., provoking nuclear war. Hudson and Weaver rush to Steiner’s lab on Rebirth Island, but Mason and his guardian angel beat them to it. They infiltrate the facility on their own and find Steiner. Reznov executes the Nazi scientist, but that’s not what Hudson and Weaver see. Mason is alone, and they watch him pull the trigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hudson and Weaver take Mason in and race to unravel his severely compromised brain to stop World War 3. Their desperate interrogation makes up the iconic frame narrative of Black Ops 1. “The numbers, Mason!” ranks among Call of Duty’s most immortal lines– right up there with “50,000 people used to live here” and “f***ing campers.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We learn the truth: Reznov died in Vorkuta and the disgruntled old soldier who's been following Mason around is a Fight Club-style figment of his imagination.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mason decodes the sequence and leads a strike on Dragovich’s undersea numbers station. In the final showdown, Mason strangles Dragovich and puts an end to his decades-spanning plot. This will not be the last of Mason’s problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Black Ops in the bag, we leap forward four games in the release order to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops: Cold War</a>, set in the brief window of the 1980s before the flashback sequences of Black Ops 2. Dragovich is dead, Mason is half out of his mind, and a new figure named Persus has emerged from the ashes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-cold-war-1762273438153.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1981</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Soviet spymaster “Perseus” amasses power and creates his own rogue intelligence network to sow discord across the world. By 1981, they’ve stolen an American-made nuclear bomb courtesy of Operation Greenlight, an extremely dubious top-secret program that hid scorched-earth nukes all across Europe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woods is back in action after blowing up and escaping from a POW camp. Hudson asks him to join Mason and new super spy guy Russell Adler to hunt down Perseus for the CIA. They capture an injured Perseus lieutenant and bring them in for some light MKULTRA. M16 agent Helen Park helps implant the Perseus agent with false memories of serving with Adler in Vietnam in order to exploit them for intel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reborn as “Bell,” the new player character joins Adler’s team, where they are kept in check with a “would you kindly” style control phrase: “We’ve got a job to do.” They gather a CIA Scooby gang and uncover a Spetsnaz training ground dressed up like an idyllic American suburb, complete with an arcade and period-appropriate Doritos. They confirm the stolen nuke was of U.S. origin, and learn the truth about Operation Greenlight– and their boss’s role in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hudson was not only aware of the plan, he was in charge of it. The squad shelves their beef and plots to steal a list of sleeper agents from KGB headquarters in Moscow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the help of a mole named Belikov, Adler and Bell infiltrate the Lubyanka and cross paths with Mikhail Gorbachev and a bunch of Soviet spooks, including young Imran Zakhaev, the future final boss of Modern Warfare. The two series don’t cross over very often, but there are sporadic hints that the worlds of Treyarch and Infinity Ward aren’t as separate as they seem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The agents go loud and escape with the sleeper list, which points them to a Greenlight scientist named Hastings. By the time they find him it’s too late– Perseus has the activation codes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adler abandons his totally subtle mind-meld scheme and force-feeds drugs directly into Bell’s brain instead. Their past as a Perseus agent resurfaces along with the location of the secret base.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story can go a few different ways from here, but as far as canon is concerned, Bell lets Adler’s intrusion slide and gives up the real location. The team destroys Perseus’ monastery stronghold and secures the nukes, but the man himself escapes. Hudson, wanting to clear up any loose ends, orders Adler to execute Bell as the story concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cold War sits awkwardly in the Black Ops timeline– you’d think someone would mention the whole “seeding a continent with nukes” thing over the next few decades of the story. Still, the retcon works, and characters like Park will pop up in future games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real main event of Black Ops in the 1980s isn’t Perseus, however– it’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii">Black Ops 2</a>'s Raul Menendez, a ruthless arms dealer turned charismatic cult leader locked in a 40-year blood feud with Mason and Woods.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-2-interrogation-1762273600314.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1986</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex Mason has retired to Alaska’s frozen tundra, raising his son David and being generally irritable. He should try mushing wolf-dogs. Ex-handler Hudson and Oliver North come a-knocking with one last job: “Uncle” Woods has gotten himself captured again while messing around in the Angolan civil war.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mason and Hudson rescue Woods and in the process Mason crosses paths with an ice-cold young arms dealer named Raul Menendez. The men scuffle, Mason shoots his eye out and leaves him for dead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point in his career, Mason has slaughtered entire legions of hostile NPCS. What difference does one more gun-runner make? But Menendez survives with a gnarly scar and swears vengeance on the spook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raul was raised during Nicaragua’s dirty wars, watching U.S. backed Contras tear his homeland to shreds. His animosity towards America became personal when his beloved sister Josefina was nearly burned alive by a greedy American businessman. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raul and his father built a massive drug cartel that attracted the ire of the CIA. The agency merced Papa Menendez in front of his son, which further soured Raul’s feelings towards the United States.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By 1986, he’s running arms with the Soviets in Afghanistan. Mason and company are sent to intervene, linking up with local freedom fighters and  a Chinese contact named Tian Zhao. They survive a Soviet attack led by Lev Kravchenko, last of the Dragovich loyalists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sight of Kravchenko does a number on Mason’s, let’s face it, completely cooked brain, but it’s Woods who canonically delivers the killshot after they learn about a mole in the CIA. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mujahideen leader turns on the Americans under orders from Menendez, leaving the squad to die in the desert. A delirious Mason sees “Tricky Vik” Reznov ride in on horseback to save the day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The CIA finds the Menendez family compound in Nicaragua and cuts a check to Manuel Noriega, the real-life Panamanian dictator on the U.S. payroll. Noriega’s goons storm the compound and brutalize Josefina. Raul goes berzerk. Noriega shoots his own men and lets Menendez go as a favor, which Raul returns by nearly beating the general to death.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When they finally meet, Woods hurls a grenade meant for Raul, but a bad bounce means it kills Josefina instead. Raul survives, and vows that Woods, and the entire world, will one day feel his absolute loss. Three years later, Menendez puts his plan into motion.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-2-mason-1762273856264.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1989</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The U.S. invades Panama with the aim of overthrowing Noriega. In real life, Noriega was smoked out of the Vatican embassy by Van Halen music on loop. In BLOPSworld he’s captured by (who else?) Mason and Woods. Hudson informs his men that Noriega is a “high-value individual” to be exchanged for an anonymous prisoner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hudson tells Woods that the hooded captive is Raul Menendez, and orders him to shoot the restrained prisoner during the swap. To Woods’s horror, the man is really Alex Mason, and while the canon isn’t absolutely clear about this, it’s widely believed that Mason is no more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Afterwards, the real Menendez appears, blows away Woods’s kneecaps, and reveals that he’s kidnapped Mason’s son David. Menendez used the boy as leverage to force Hudson to do his bidding. He slits Hudson’s throat with Josefina’s locket, leaves David traumatized, and spares Woods to suffer with the guilt of killing his closest friend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one fell swoop, two lead characters from the previous Black Ops game were wiped off the board and another horribly mutilated, leaving young David to pick up the pieces– a story to which we’ll return after a detour through the early ‘90s for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woods spends the intervening years riding a desk and raising David as best he can without revealing the truth behind his father’s death. The CIA believes that Russell Adler is the mole, paid off by Menendez to teamkill his CoD clan. Woods doesn’t buy it, and suspects a shadow faction inside the agency itself: Pantheon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pantheon began as a CIA subdivision in the ‘70s, experimenting with a psychotropic super-soldier serum called Project: Cradle. After a disastrous outbreak of the Cradle virus turned survivors into hallucinating rage monsters, Deputy Director Daniel Livingstone officially disavowed it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The group reformed as an independent rogue cabal, reviving Cradle in secret while fanning the flames of America’s forever wars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, grab your best bootleg Bart Simpson shirt and get ready to rip some packs of Gulf War generals, because it’s 1991 and we’re invading Iraq… the first time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-6-1762274241865.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1991</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Wheelchair-bound Woods is fielding a new team: his protege Troy Marshall, ops specialist Jane Harrow, and the enigmatic William “Case” Calderon. The squad is tasked to extract Saddam Hussein’s defecting defense minister Saeed Alawai, but their target is executed on the spot by fugitive Russell Adler.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adler insists that the CIA is compromised, and says he couldn’t allow the man to fall into Pantheon’s clutches. He surrenders himself with a simple riddle for Woods: “Bishop takes Rook.” Livingstone dismisses his warning and suspends the squad, who decide to follow Adler’s trail anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rook” refers to an old KGB safehouse in Bulgaria that Adler and Woods discovered during their adventures in the ‘70s. The disgraced team shacks up there and recruits some new allies: German tech guy Felix Neumann and Sev Dumas, an assassin from the fictional city-state of Avalon. She was trained and betrayed by the Guild, an underground criminal network that will become way more important in the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the gang assembled, they break out Adler from a CIA black site deep beneath the U.S. Capitol building while Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton works the room at a glitzy gala upstairs..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back at the Rook, Adler explains that Pantheon was in bed with Hussein, trading experimental weapons for access to his definitely-real WMD facilities. He tells them about Cradle and where they might find it. Next stop: Saddam’s palace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With help from Cold War’s Helen Park, the rogue BLOPers infiltrate Hussein’s gilded bunker. Among his hoard of treasures, the squad finds a sample of Cradle. They also discover that Jane Harrow is Pantheon’s mole within the CIA and trace the virus’s origin to a research facility on American soil. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When they arrive in Kentucky, Case falls down an elevator shaft and is exposed to the Cradle, experiencing a Zombie nightmare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Case overcomes his BLOPs protagonist amnesia and unlocks his past– he was the failed original test “case” for a Cradle-powered super-soldier. The project was scrapped, his memories were erased, and he was welcomed back into the loving arms of the CIA, which remains oddly unconcerned with the scrambling of its employees’ minds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A casino heist points the squad towards Gusev, Harrow’s Cradle scientist. He’s hiding out in Kuwait, so Case, Adler, and Lawrence Sims, another Cold War veteran, ground his flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gusev tells the gang that Pantheon’s headquarters is located in an old Soviet prison camp– Victor Reznov’s old haunt Vorkuta, ground zero for the entire Black Ops saga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the most shameless nostalgia fest since Snake returned to Shadow Moses, team Rogue BLOPs revisits the gulag and apprehends the traitorous Harrow. They dose her with truth serum and drag the whole story out of her: She blames Adler for the home-invasion deaths of her parents and joined Pantheon for revenge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their master plan is to use the Cradle for a false-flag terror attack on Washington, D.C. The Iraqis would take the fall, Livingstone would be KIA, and Harrow/Pantheon would be in charge of the CIA.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pantheon invades the Rook, setting off a climactic safehouse standoff. Harrow attempts to escape on a helicopter, but Case boards her vessel mid-flight. Completely geeked on Cradle, Case strangles Harrow in a blind rage and sends the chopper crashing into a river, where both are presumed dead. Sure they are!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Livingstone makes peace with Woods, Adler, and Marshall and encourages them to hang out their shingle as an off-the-books Black Ops cell. In a final stinger, we see that Pantheon is down but not out as another mole, Jackson Caine, slips into Livingstone’s office and hacks into his computer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story continues 44 years later in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, but first there’s the matter of Menendez to attend to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2014, a social movement named Cordis Die emerges from the internet. Its charismatic leader Odysseus gains followers with his impassioned rants against the corrupt 1%. He engineers riots in Iran and North Korea and develops an unstoppable computer worm out of the rare earth metal Celerium with the help of hacker Chloe Lynch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He uses it to hack the Chinese stock exchange in 2018, pinning the blame on the U.S. and triggering a second cold war between NATO and China amid an escalated drone arms race. Mason’s former ally Tian Zhao is in charge of China’s SDC and working with Menendez, combining their vast resources to heat up the conflict and usher in a new world order.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-2-2025-1762274452500.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">By the far off distant future of 2025, Cordis Die has amassed two billion followers, none of whom realise their cult leader is the Nicaraguan narco-terrorist, and that the entire “Occupy BLOPS” movement was just a cover for one man’s mad-on against Woods and Mason. Young David Mason is now a Navy Seal operator named “Section” who still checks in on his dear old Uncle Frank.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Menendez makes the first move by visiting a still-living, still-smoking Woods in the Vault, a retirement home for Mimis and Pop Pops with red in their ledger. He leaves behind the pendant used to murder Hudson. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Section and his JSOC boys Mike Harper and Javier Salazar visit Woods for some action-packed ‘60s flashbacks. The old man gives them the dirt on his tragic history with Menendez and clues them in about Celerium. The young bucks embark on a series of missions investigating Menendez, and his massive mercenary army.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gang eavesdrops for intel about a cyber weapon called “Karma.” Section, Harper, and Salazar search for it on the decadent floating city of Colossus, where they discover that “Karma” is actually Chloe Lynch, and that Menendez is trying to kill her to keep her quiet about the Celerium computer worm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Her fate has yet to be confirmed by canon, but if they do save Karma from top henchman DeFalco, she uncovers Menendez's ultimate plan: on June 19th, Freedom Day, he’s going to hijack the U.S. military’s drone system and unleash an electronic rumbling on every major city within both global superpowers. That’s tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over Section’s objections, his commander Admiral Briggs decides it’s high time to grab Menendez. They contact Farid, a deep cover operative observing Menendez ignite a revolution in Yemen. Farid sacrifices himself to save Harper and Melendez is easily captured and taken onboard the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Barack Obama.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! We were playing right into Menendez’s brilliant ruse the entire time. It’s the “getting caught was part of my plan” gambit that was all the rage in the late aughts, though to be fair, Black Ops 2 scribe David S. Goyer also wrote the screenplay for the trope-defining Dark Knight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cordis Die goons storm the Obama and Menendez seizes control of the ship with the help of his double agent, your now ex-BFF Salazar. He uploads the virus and takes over the U.S. military drone network before escaping. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since canon presumes you completed the bonus Strike Missions and took down Tian Zhao, Chinese planes will save the ship and ally with JSOC against the drones, ending the cold war for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As thousands of metal death machines swarm upon populated cities, Section, Harper, David Petraeus, and the President of the United States are shot down in a war-torn Los Angeles. Under siege by an army of killer drones, the men escort POTUS to safety in one the most spectacular setpieces in a series that has a lot of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">JSOC and China trace the drone control signal to a Cordis Die facility in Haiti and stage a full-scale invasion. Menendez goes live when they arrive, but instead of destroying the world’s cities he blows up every single one of the drones instead, crippling American military infrastructure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Section finally captures his father’s murderer and makes a martyr out of Menendez– which is exactly what he wanted. He posts a posthumous YouTube video instructing his billions of followers to take advantage of the drone-free power void and seize control of the United States.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch has been pretty firm that the "Menendez dies” ending of Black Op 2 is canonical, although his promised Cordis Die uprising fizzles out. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/20/blops7-1755708228049.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">2035</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set a decade after the end of BLOPS 2. Frank Woods has finally gone to that old soldiers’ home in the sky and David Mason is still dorkily calling himself Section and leading a new team named “Specter One,” with old faces like Harper and Marshall and new ones like the bionic 50/50.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The world is still shaken from the drone incident. The Guild has shed its shady beginning and is reborn as a powerful tech giant offering protection in uncertain times. In 2035, the dead Menendez shocks the world with a prophecy and a threat: in three days, your streets will run red with your blood. He’s presumably referring to a new fear-based macguffin that pushes minds to the edge of consciousness with typical Black Ops trippiness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a “five minutes into the future” setting, a touch more sci-fi than Modern Warfare but closer to a tomorrow that seems just around the corner. It’s not the first time that Black Ops has moved forward in the timeline, and it’s nowhere close to the giant leap taken by Treyarch for Black Ops 3.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-3-1762274652978.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">2062</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 2062, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-3">Black Ops 3</a> is the odd duck in an already pretty weird franchise. It depicts a surreal, Phillip K. Dickian future that’s been forged in the fallout of Cordis Die’s drone war, where the old geopolitical order has collapsed and optimized into two bloated megafactions locked in endless proxy wars. New technology makes air supremacy obsolete. Mechs roam the battlefield, and wallrunning supersoldiers interface directly with the grid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 3’s campaign is ambitious and strange, but it feels less like the next chapter in the Black Ops saga and more of an optional epilogue, the kind of ending you’d reload a save to avoid. There’s connective tissue to the larger mythos, but none of the classic characters or grudges survive the time skip. Also, BLOPS being BLOPS, most of the action turns out to be the digital experiences of a disembodied dying consciousness inside a simulation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no reason to doubt its canonicity, Black Ops 3 is not the focus of Black Ops 7– The latest title has far too much unfinished business in the past to linger in the far-flung future. Still, the slow drift towards sci-fi is undeniable, and it makes total sense: Black Ops has spent the last 15 years strip-mining the shadow wars of the 20th century, and there’s really only one direction left to go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Black Ops lose its psycho wetworks swagger if it moves beyond the current day? Is there still more juice to squeeze from our clandestine past? Or is it time for Treyarch and Raven Software to invent something entirely new? After all, if we learned anything from Call of Duty: Black Ops, it’s that identities are anything but permanent.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-timeline]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect developer BioWare has reaffirmed its commitment to making the series' next game, just weeks after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo">publisher EA agreed a $55 billion deal to go private</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> posted today to mark the Mass Effect franchise's annual N7 Day celebrations, franchise boss Mike Gamble said he wanted to set "the record straight" after all the "rumors lately."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," Gamble wrote. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had questioned whether EA would remain committed to Mass Effect — and BioWare in general — following the completion of its enormous deal, and after a lackluster response to the studio's previous game, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Today's statement is clearly meant to calm fan concerns — though actual new information on the next Mass Effect game remains scarce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble continued today. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, while it's not a surprise, fans at least now have solid confirmation that you will be able to romance more sci-fi characters, head tendrils and all.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Mass Effect Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show," Gamble concluded. "Until then, thank you for your patience because y'all are thirsty for news and I see you looking for secret meaning in my tweets (okay, sometimes they have secret meaning)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that numerous letters of the above text are italicised in BioWare's original blog post, which when put together spell out the words "<em>url krogan</em>." Is there some fresh new krogan lore sitting hidden somewhere on the BioWare blog for fans to find? We are scouring the site now to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other celebrations today will include new Mass Effect gear to buy, and free crossover items within both Apex Legends and Skate (which should hopefully avoid the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-fans-blast-cardboard-isaac-clarkes-absurd-35-pricetag-in-free-to-play-skate">criticism of Skate's recent and rather pricey Dead Space crossover</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, in other Mass Effect news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-wont-retread-shepards-story-and-will-be-set-after-the-original-trilogy">BioWare today confirmed that Amazon's upcoming TV adaptation would feature a new story set after the events of the series' original trilogy</a> — rather than rehashing Commander Shepard's adventures, as seen in the series' original trilogy. It's a canny move which avoids contradicting players' own stories — and something that could potentially see the TV show tying into the next Mass Effect game, which fans believe will be set hundreds of years after Mass Effect 3's endings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For everyone yelling at me because we didn’t use N7 Day to provide a whole bunch of info... I mean, I get it," Gamble subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1986833146873024598" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on social media. "I’m a fan too. I want you to see stuff. But it’s not the time... yet. Has it been years since announce? Yes. Have we been busy? Yes. Are we NOW 100% on Mass Effect? Also yes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare first confirmed it would develop another Mass Effect game back in 2020, via a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mass-effect-revealed">cinematic trailer that showed a return for fan-favorite character Liara</a>, now sporting an older look. Subsequent years have seen the studio tease out a handful of further Easter eggs pointing to the state of the galaxy, many years on — but clearly the project remains some way off from actually releasing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It follows similar action Paxton has taken against "several Big Tech social media companies" and TikTok.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm suing Roblox for putting pixel pedophiles and profits over the safety of Texas children," Paxton <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1986529630124126245" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> in a social media post. "We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators where the well-being of our kids is sacrificed on the altar of corporate greed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a press statement, Paxton expanded on this, writing he was suing Roblox Corporation, "a multi-billion-dollar company that operates one of the largest online gaming sites for children, for flagrantly ignoring state and federal online safety laws while deceiving parents about the dangers of its platform."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/gettyimages-2238840255-1762531702795.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Texas is suing Roblox.

Paxton claimed that though Roblox markets itself as a safe space, it has become a "breeding ground for predators."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Children in Texas have been repeatedly exposed to sexually explicit content, exploitation, and grooming because Roblox chose to put pixel pedophiles and corporate profit over the safety of Texas children," he added. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Roblox for comment. Roblox told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0kd4kk0kqo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a> it is "disappointed" that it is being sued based on "misrepresentations and sensationalised claims." A spokesperson said it shares Paxton's commitment to keeping children safe online and that it has introduced measures to remove bad actors and protect its users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Roblox's most recent <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/safety-snapshot-november" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Safety Snapshot</u></a>, the company said it "continue[s] to innovate around safety," and revealed it had open-sourced a version of <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/open-sourcing-roblox-pii-classifier-ai-pii-detection-chat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roblox PII Classifier</u></a>, which "has significantly enhanced" its ability to detect and block attempts to violate its policies around sharing personally identifiable information (PII). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since its implementation, PII conversation recall in English has risen to 98%, outperforming other leading open-source models," Roblox said, adding that it was also committed to more transparency for users to report "anything problematic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We know users expect more information about what happens when they report something on Roblox, so we’ve broadened the list of categories that we respond to," it added. "Across all report types, we now let users know when we’ve taken action in response to their report.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU and Intel 13th Gen i5 CPU fall squarely in the entry-level category for graphics and processing power. The Victus will play many games, including newer AAA titles, but graphically intensive titles will often require you to play with a mix of low and medium settings.</p><p>The Victus has 8GB RAM and a 512GB SSD; both figures are often viewed as the minimum for gaming PCs these days. Many AAA games have recommended configurations that include 16GB RAM, but 8GB meets the minimum for visually demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2. Just be aware that with a laptop such as this Victus, you sometimes need to lower the resolution to 720p get better than 30fps.</p><p>Even with its drawbacks, the HP Victus is a bargain for $480, especially for those who want to play indies and older AAA games on PC. For comparison, this laptop is more powerful than the Steam Deck, and millions of gamers are happy with the performance on Valve's handheld. The Victus has sleek form factor and a full keyboard with a numpad. In terms of its appearance and build quality, the Victus is one of the better entry-level options out there.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-collector-edition-4k-blu-ray-star-wars-and-marvel-original-series/1100-6535976/">Star Wars 4K Steelbook Collector's Editions Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>
