            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>After years of waiting, <a href="https://youtu.be/VrTVeYm4iIM?si=iO2aCqBXdOTXoJOB">Wednesday's comprehensive Nintendo Direct</a> finally revealed everything the Nintendo Switch 2 has to offer, including its new features, launch games, and release date. To top it all off, pre-orders were set to open next week on April 9 until Nintendo issued a new statement to news outlets this morning. Pre-orders are being temporarily postponed due to the United States' recently announced tariffs, which will likely impact the console's price.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Nintendo issued the following statement to </span></span><span><span>Game Informer</span></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>On Wednesday evening, the White House announced its upcoming tariff plan, which would impose fees on goods imported from other countries. While the administration has been public about the incoming taxes, the exact rate has turned out to be much higher than anticipated, and in Nintendo's case, it will likely cost them a lot of money. Two common countries where products are manufactured, China and Vietnam, will have tariffs of 54% and 46%, respectively, placed on their exports to the US.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>After the Direct, we learned the base system would cost $449 while the Mario Kart World bundle would be $499, a pair of price tags that staggered many potential buyers. Despite that, Nintendo's delay implies it might raise the price even higher to offset the new tax. Regardless of whether the price will be adjusted, updates on the international trade situation are coming through every day, so Nintendo may also just be waiting for future developments.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Nintendo Switch 2's launch date of June 5 remains unchanged.

You'll also get an excellent 0.03ms response time that's great for gaming.</p><ul><li><strong>UltraGear 45-Inch OLED Curved Monitor (45GX90SA) -- $1,700</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=LG+Launches+Three+New+Premium+Curved+Gaming+Monitors+With+240Hz+Refresh+Rates&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-04+11%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-04+16%3A29%3A39&amp;fnarticle_id=6530638&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-45gx90sa-b-gaming-monitor&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flg-launches-three-new-premium-curved-gaming-monitors-with-240hz-refresh-rates%2F1100-6530638%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See at LG Store</a></li><li><a href="https://howl.link/srs70g9xgwdcg?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17437922004949?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See at Best Buy</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>UltraGear 39-Inch OLED Curved Monitor (39GX90SA) -- 1,600</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=LG+Launches+Three+New+Premium+Curved+Gaming+Monitors+With+240Hz+Refresh+Rates&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-04+11%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-04+16%3A29%3A39&amp;fnarticle_id=6530638&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-39gx90sa-w-gaming-monitor&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flg-launches-three-new-premium-curved-gaming-monitors-with-240hz-refresh-rates%2F1100-6530638%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See at LG Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-39GX90SA-W-Ultragear-Compatible-DisplayHDR/dp/B0F15C7JL2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://howl.link/bkuofwfz9n6sa?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17437924996502?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See at Best Buy</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>UltraGear 34-Inch OLED Curved Monitor (34GX90SA) -- $1,400</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=LG+Launches+Three+New+Premium+Curved+Gaming+Monitors+With+240Hz+Refresh+Rates&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-04+11%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-04+16%3A29%3A39&amp;fnarticle_id=6530638&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-34gx90sa-w-gaming-monitor&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flg-launches-three-new-premium-curved-gaming-monitors-with-240hz-refresh-rates%2F1100-6530638%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See at LG Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-34GX90SA-W-Ultragear-Compatible-DisplayHDR/dp/B0F15CGTGW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">See at Amazon</a></li></ul></li></ul></div>                      </div><p>Other notable features include support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium, and each runs on webOS 24, which lets you access a variety of streaming services, 350 free channels on the LG Channels app, and cloud gaming platforms like GeForce Now and Amazon Luna.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The big news of the week – aside from another ruinous attack from the United States <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/407053/trump-tariff-expensive-democracy-authoritarianism-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on its own economy</a> – was the long-awaited debut of the Nintendo Switch 2. It looks solid, with an intriguing salvo of early games (<em>Mario Kart</em>, <em>Donkey Kong</em>, a new FromSoftware game), but <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price tag</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-preorder-tariff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder</a> shenanigans left fans wondering if they really <em>need </em>to fork over so much money for what is essentially an incremental upgrade to the first Switch. Now a question looms over the console: Will it be the next ubiquitous Nintendo knock-out hit, or the next Wii U?</p><p>On this episode of Aftermath Hours, we’re joined by special guest Mike Drucker, comedian and writer on shows like <em>Adam Ruins Everything</em>, <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em>, and <em>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</em>, to talk about his new book, <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/good-game-no-rematch-mike-drucker?variant=43103018024994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Good Game, No Rematch: A Life Made of Video Games</em></a>. We discuss how games and people’s relationship to them have changed over the years – and also the time Mike got shot in the dick with a paintball gun while working for Nintendo.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of Nintendo, we then move on to the Switch 2, which the company finally revealed in earnest this week with a handful of cool games and a price tag that’s giving would-be buyers serious sticker shock as a result of, well, everything else going on in the world right now. We also put out into the universe the idea of a new DK Rap – but this time they hire a legit rapper and play it totally straight. Please, Nintendo, fulfill our dreams.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make an entire album of DK Raps.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The economy’s a smoking hole in the ground right now. Part of that’s not Nintendo’s fault, but also part of it is Nintendo’s fault because they’re like “Hey, we know you’re gonna do this. You know you’re gonna do this. Let’s just do this.” I don’t know how successful that’s gonna be long-term, particularly when not just Steam but also other console makers want a piece of that really badly. Nintendo will always be the leader, but by how much? And good of a deal is that? If Sony comes out with a handheld tomorrow that’s par-for-par and you can play your PlayStation 5 games on it, that’d be a good deal for a lot of people. That’d be a place where you buy PlayStation games.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, there is the context of, with the Switch and its massive success, Nintendo kind of brought the idea of a handheld back into vogue, and now they’re dealing with the world they created. The Switch 2 is an incremental upgrade that’s not as immediately earthshaking as its predecessor to sort of enter Nintendo back into their own market. And to what extent do they recognize right now that the pitch [in terms of price, at least] isn’t quite as thrilling as it could be? The week before this, they did a big Switch 1 Direct where they were like “Look at all this stuff we still have coming to Switch 1. We have not wound it down quite yet.”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s not even just “Will this succeed?” It will succeed, but in my heart of hearts, I think they’re gonna keep up the alternating-console-being-trash streak that they’ve had since the Gamecube. Like, OK, Gamecube sucked. Wii was a hit. Wii U–</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I liked the Gamecube!</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>But it didn’t do [well saleswise]. If you play <em>Smash</em>, it’s fantastic, but relative to its competitors, it was a dud. They fucked up. The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit, and then they’re like “You guys will buy anything.” And then it’s not always the case.</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Having been inside there [working at Nintendo of America], I kinda feel sympathy. I know that this is Nintendo of Japan’s decision. I wasn’t there when the Wii U came out, but I was there in some of the naming meetings. And I think the thesis of every naming meeting was “Please don’t call it the Wii U.” And the main response from Japan was “We know what we’re doing. We’re gonna do it. We’re gonna name it the Wii U.” And we were like “OK, we tried.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has returned the boobs to far Cry 4 following a mistake which censored the game worldwide.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-4-censorship-patch-removes-nudity-10-years-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our report earlier today</a> which brought further light to the situation that Ubisoft had apparently censored the nudity in Far Cry 4, the official Far Cry account <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/1908168738886787356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied to our post</a> to clarify the situation.</p>



<p>“To clarify, the update was the result of a mistake during deployment. Content intended specifically for the Japanese version of the game was accidentally pushed to the global Steam version,” they said.</p>



<p>They continued, “The team has since corrected the error by reuploading the proper global files to Steam. If players are still seeing anything unusual, restarting Steam and checking for updates should resolve it. Just to reassure everyone: there are no plans to censor Far Cry. This was purely a regional packaging error and has now been fully addressed. Thank you“</p>



<p>So fear not, boobs have once again returned to Far Cry 4.</p>



<p>Ubisoft community developer Patricia Brochu-Gagné also took to Reddit to further clarify the situation saying, “This was simply an error tied to a specific regional build, and it’s now been corrected.”</p>



<p>Far Cry 4 went on to sell over 10 million copies during the PlayStation 4 / Xbox One generation and to some, is considered one of the better Far Cry titles in the series. </p>

The Internet, of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-play-as-the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-in-mario-kart-world-and-the-internet-is-thrilled">is thrilled about this</a>, already coming up with dozens of memes and fanart of the adorable Cow that, until recently, was nothing more prominent than a fun background character in a single Mario Kart track.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as news of Cow spread throughout the land, fans began pointing out a potential, erm, problem, with another element of the Mario Kart World reveal. In the Nintendo Direct 2 trailer from Wednesday, Mario eats a burger. Burgers are (typically) made of beef. Would Cow, whose people are ostensibly a source of beef, consume beef herself? Fans really wanted to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well at the Nintendo preview event, we found out. You see, the food items we saw in the trailer are obtainable in Mario Kart World at Yoshi's diner locations scattered across courses. They function like a drive-thru, allowing racers to drive up and grab a bag of take-out just like they would an item box. There are a lot of different food items that can be inside, including burgers, steak kebabs, pizza, and donuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, Cow can eat them all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, Cow CAN eat steak in Mario Kart World. <a href="https://t.co/qN5PZ9IIM4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qN5PZ9IIM4</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1908259261769003473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">During our session we also saw Cow eat a number of other items, including the burger. We're still a little hazy on what these items are actually doing for Cow — other racers change costumes when consuming them, but Cow doesn't seem to experience any effects. Could she be eating beef just because she enjoys it? Is there a secret power-up she gets from burger consumption that we just don't know about yet because Nintendo hasn't revealed it? Or perhaps are these veggie burgers and Beyond meat kebabs?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Nintendo to try and clear all this up, but we haven't heard back yet. I'm sure it's because they're busy at their New York event, and not because this is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5RRyyHsjoU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhinged question to ask</a> their PR about. Yeah, that's probably it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway go check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">preview of Mario Kart World</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">video version of which</a> features an appearance by our friend Cow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Movie Games has announced that Drug Dealer Simulator will be coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles on April 16, with a PlayStation 5 release to come at a later date.</p>



<p>In the new press release, it was said that Drug Dealer Simulator has already surpassed over “1 million buyers” on PC – a total amounting to some $16 million in revenue.</p>



<p>Originally, the announcement was made a few weeks ago, but the recent PR email seems, at least at face value, that they are also trying to capitalise on the highly-successful Schedule 1. </p>



<p>Schedule 1 released on March 29, and recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak concurrent playercount of 414,000</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 329,000 concurrent players at the time of writing. At the moment, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 is yet to announce a console release</a>, so it makes sense that a rival drug dealer simulator would try and get ahead with an Xbox and PlayStation release… I guess.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The opening minutes of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond were a great showcase of Switch 2's mouse controls.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">For seven years, Metroid Prime 4 was just a logo. Fans obsessively tuned into every Nintendo presentation hoping for an update on the game to no avail until 2024 when a trailer was finally released and footage of the game in motion was actually revealed. This year, not only is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond getting released but it’s also getting some really interesting visual and gameplay upgrades on Nintendo Switch 2. We’ve played Retro Studio’s latest installment in the classic sci-fi action adventure series on Switch 2 and we have lots to tell you about. Read on to find out more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Beyond Beautiful</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing we noticed with Metroid Prime 4 was how gorgeous it was. It’s got an incredibly clean and stylish aesthetic and Nintendo was advertising it as running in 120 frames per second on Switch 2. This won’t be the case on Switch 1 and it’s tough to track how much Nintendo will be able to stick to that number on the full game, but it’s an ambitious goal either way. So far, Prime 4 has a really great sense of scale. We fought a bunch of grunt-like enemies, saw a massive, hulking mech strut into the battle, and then took down a large boss that featured several different attack phases. The area we demoed was just a small glimpse at what the full game might offer so we’re hoping we see some grander setpieces and large, open environments, some of which have been teased already in trailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Metroid games are also about cramped tunnels and dark corridors and we got to see a few of those, too. Like previous Prime games, a quick button press instantly pops Samus from first-person aiming into third-person morph ball mode, allowing her to traverse some areas she can’t reach otherwise. We got to test this out a bit and it works great so we can’t wait to search around every nook and cranny of this game looking for missile upgrades, energy tanks, shortcuts, and more. This is the most detailed Metroid game yet and these sections are no different, giving us a glimpse of battles happening between warring factions happening beneath you as you roll around in tunnels above them. But wait, how does it all play?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Samouse Aran (Or, Of Mice and Metroids)</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most fascinating additions to Metroid Prime 4 on Switch 2 is the optional mouse controls. Looking back, the Prime series has experimented a ton with unique control options across various games. The first two Metroid Prime games were built around the fairly traditional Nintendo GameCube controller (although there was nothing traditional about turning a historically 2D sidescrolling game into a first person action adventure game with third person ball rolling mechanics) but after that, all bets were off. Metroid Prime: Hunters on Nintendo DS had touch screen controls. Metroid Prime 3 on Nintendo Wii had pointer and motion controls. Metroid Prime Pinball on DS shipped with a Game Boy Advance cartridge shaped rumble pack. We don’t talk about Metroid Prime: Blast Ball on Nintendo 3DS. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, Metroid Prime 4 on Switch 2 lets you turn your right Joy-Con 2 sideways, place it on a flat surface, and control Samus’ aiming with a snappy and precise mouse pointer complete with haptic feedback for every shot. Even neater, the game seamlessly allows you to switch from traditional stick controls to mouse controls on a whim, with no need to pause to go into the settings. We could see plenty of people deciding this is their preferred way to play Metroid Prime 4, and the ease of which you can swap back and forth between mouse and pointer controls makes it so you can choose to only plop the Joy-Con 2 on the table when it’s time for a serious combat sequence, and use traditional controls for the more chill exploration segments Prime 4 will surely deliver. Or maybe you’ll want to play the whole game in handheld mode or with a Pro Controller. Either way, you’ve got options.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct April 2025 Games</h3><p>Every game shown in Nintendo's April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 reveal direct event.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" Upgrade Path</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing Nintendo isn’t being totally clear on just yet is where Prime 4 sits in their awkward transitional Switch 1 to Switch 2 titles list. While some original Switch games like Echoes of Wisdom and Link’s Awakening are getting free upgrade patches for Switch 2, others like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are charging $10 for visual upgrades (and a few bells and whistles) while some games like Kirby and the Forgotten Land will receive $20 upgrades that improve visuals and add new content. Which of these categories will Metroid Prime 4’s mouse controls and 120FPS options be in when they come to Switch 2? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, like its release date and base game price, we just don’t know yet. You’ll be able to buy the base game and the “Switch 2 edition upgrade pack” individually or as a bundle in a bright red Switch 2 branded box but as of now, we have no idea how much any of those will cost you. Our best guess is that it will be $10 more for the Switch 2 version given that it’s not coming with an expansion like Mario Party’s “+ Jamboree TV” and Kirby’s “+ Star-Crossed World”, but we’re not 100% sure yet. Samus has unlockable psychic powers in Prime 4 so we might just have to ask her. She’s usually not very talkative, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4 doesn’t have a release date just yet but it’s coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 in 2025 so hey, at least we won’t have to wait seven years again to find out more.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>At GDC 2025, I watched a walkthrough of one of the early levels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/possessors/" data-ref-id="5000-631833">Possessor(s)</a>, the next game from Heart Machine. The studio typically goes for action games but mixes in a little bit of something else--2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-drifter/" data-ref-id="5000-228161">Hyper Light Drifter</a> had RPG elements, 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solar-ash/" data-ref-id="5000-505771">Solar Ash</a> was an adventure-platformer, and 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-breaker/" data-ref-id="5000-561878">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is a cooperative roguelike. Possessor(s) is a metroidvania or, as Heart Machine prefers to call it, a search-action game (which, honestly, is such a better term for the genre).</p><p dir="ltr">A sidescroller, Possessor(s) sees you play as two characters: Luca, a teenage girl, and Rehm, the demon possessing her. I didn't get to see the events that led to their partnership, but the Heart Machine team explained that the start of Possessor(s) sees Luca caught up in an interdimensional catastrophe that rips a hole in the sky and kills everyone she loves--it's only because of the intervention of the strange horned man now within her that she survives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289"></a><figcaption>During Luca and Rehm's journey, they'll encounter objects possessed by feral demons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rehm also gives Luca artificial legs (I don't know what happened to her original legs, but I assume the full game will clue us in), so that she can jump higher and survive falls from any height, and Luca uses these new prosthetics to navigate the now-quarantined city in hopes of escaping it and learning more about how the catastrophe happened. The duo regularly converse about their substantially different views of demons and the corporation responsible for most everything in the city, alleviating much of the sense of loneliness that I've come to expect in other search-action games.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Rehm, Luca is able to hold her own in a world that wants to kill her. Combat is against the possessed objects and people of the city--demons far more feral than Rehm have corrupted all manner of things in the metropolis. I was surprised when a potted plant that had been pretending to be totally inanimate and harmless sprung to life right as Luca walked past it, and the devs said that plenty of demons will adopt that strategy of hiding in plain sight by pretending to be seemingly normal parts of the world. When a fight does break out, mechanically, it looks a whole lot like playing Super Smash Bros., with an emphasis on combos and air juggles. It looks more engaging than Hyper Light Breaker, but I didn't get hands-on time with Possessor(s) so I can't say one way or the other for sure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290"></a><figcaption>As Luca unlocks new traversal abilities, she and Rehm will be able to reach more areas of the map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like its genre contemporaries, Luca unlocks additional abilities over time, which open up new options in combat and open up new areas of the map. I didn't get a chance to see this in action, but it sounds like it works just like how upgrades are handled in the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nine-sols/" data-ref-id="5000-548741">Nine Sols</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/" data-ref-id="5000-17693">Super Metroid</a>, and other similar games, with an open-ended, interconnected world that allows players to explore in whichever direction they have access to.</p><p dir="ltr">Stylistically, Possessor(s) is the biggest departure from Hyper Light Drifter's visuals--not bad by any means, but surprising all the same since every subsequent game from the studio has followed that art direction pretty closely. The colors are certainly similar, but Possessor(s)'s characters look hand-drawn, and bolder lines and flashier colors for the animations make attacks and movements appear like something from a comic book or manga. It's very cool, and at least in terms of art direction, Possessor(s) is my favorite of Heart Machine's games. It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but the game intrigues me all the same, and I can't wait to jump into it myself later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Possessor(s) is set to launch for PS5 and PC sometime in 2025.</p>

          <p>This morning's announcement that Nintendo is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">delaying US preorders for the Switch 2</a> immediately increased the salience of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">President Trump's proposed wide-reaching import tariffs</a> for millions of American Nintendo fans. Additionally, the Entertainment Software Association—a lobbying group that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">represents the game industry's interests</a> in Washington—is warning that the effects of Trump's tariffs on the gaming world won't stop with Nintendo.</p>
<p>"There are so many devices we play video games on," ESA senior vice president Aubrey Quinn <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously">said in an interview with IGN</a> just as Nintendo's preorder delay news broke. "There are other consoles... VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games; if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously.</p>
<p>"This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry," she continued. "There's going to be an impact on the entire industry."</p>
<p>While Trump's tariff proposal includes a 10 percent tax on imports from pretty much every country, it also includes a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam and a 54 percent total tariff on China, the two countries where most console hardware is produced. Quinn told IGN that it's "hard to imagine a world where tariffs like these don’t impact pricing" for those consoles.</p>
<p>More than that, though, Quinn warns that massive tariffs would tamp down overall consumer spending, which would have knock-on effects for game industry revenues, employment, and research and development investment.</p>
<p>"Video game consoles are sold under tight margins in order to reduce the barrier to entry for consumers," the ESA notes in <a href="https://www.theesa.com/issues/tariffs/">its issue page on tariffs</a>. "Tariffs mean that the additional costs would be passed along to consumers, resulting in a ripple effect of harm for the industry and the jobs it generates and supports.</p>
<h2>Not just a foreign problem</h2>
<p>The negative impacts wouldn't be limited to foreign companies like Nintendo, Quinn warned, because "even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company."</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2 is fast approaching and set to introduce two new heroes, a new map, and a slew of changes to both its features list and gameplay. As is the case with any update at the start of a season, the game is getting a balance update to dozens of heroes, applying buffs and nerfs to a majority of the playable characters.</p>

            <p>
It's been one hell of a wait, but Binding of Isaac creator Edmund McMillen's extremely long-awaited cat breeding game Mewgenics is almost upon us. And with a release looming (comparatively speaking, at least), its first proper trailer is here - and, wow, is it something.
</p>
<p>
Mewgenics (or Mew-Genics as it was originally known) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-meat-boy-developer-announces-mutant-cat-game-mew-genics">first surfaced back in 2012</a>. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/edmund-mcmillen-details-his-upcoming-cat-lady-sim-mew-genics">described</a> as a cat-themed "cross between The Sims and Pokémon with a sprinkling of Animal Crossing and a dash of Tamagotchi", and was supposed to be developer Team Meat's long-awaited follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a> - until it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-dev-announces-the-legend-of-bum-bo">quietly shelved just a few years later</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, a lot more has happened. After McMillen and Team Meat development partner Tommy Refenes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-meat-boy-forever-and-the-return-of-team-meat">opted to go their separate ways</a>, McMillen went on to create the hugely successful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> Rebirth, plus other acclaimed oddities like The End is Nigh and Isaac spin-off The Legend of Bum-bo. In 2018, however, McMillen <a href="http://bindingofisaac.com/post/169521328569/a-new-years-qa">revealed he'd decided to resurrect Mewgenics</a>, and development has been ticking along ever since.

<p>
We've had a steady stream of updates since then, including confirmation Mewgenics has changed considerably since its original inception 13 years ago. It's now something like a cat-themed tactical RPG, split between breeding and combat, and is currently scheduled to launch this year. But while McMillen says there won't be any release date news just yet, we do have one hell of a live-action trailer to tide us over. It tells the heartwarming story of a struggling couple and the rutting cat-things that brought them closer together. And there's even some gameplay in there too, but given everything else going on - including the catchy little song it's all set to - you might need to watch a few times to take it all in.
</p>
<p>
Revealing the trailer in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/686060/view/529842974219043475?l=english">post on Steam</a>, McMillen offered a brief development update, explaining Mewgenics is currently undergoing a bit of polishing ahead of a more thorough showing next month. And as for a release date? McMillen said there'll be more news on that next month too. In the meantime, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">available to wishlist on PC</a>.

Why you are first hearing this through the press rather than from Nintendo is a bit beyond me, and further highlights how strange this whole thing has been.</p><p>I first learned this via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameSpot</a>. Subsequent outlets also received a statement, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> attributes to Eddie Garcia for Nintendo, which reads,</p><blockquote><p>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Pre-orders for the Switch 2 were already complicated, explained in an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ</a> that came out after Wednesday’s Direct. Likewise, the Switch's price filtered out after the fact through news writeups and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250402229347/en/Nintendo-Switch-2-Launches-June-5-at-%24449.99-Bringing-New-Forms-of-Game-Communication-to-Life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press releases</a>, and now we have this new information coming out in a roundabout way as well. </p><p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/minnmax.bsky.social/post/3llwgj66kn22s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MinnMax</a> commented, all this practical information “is everywhere, because [Nintendo] didn’t name any of the prices for anything… It felt like [Nintendo] didn’t want to take [its] L.” I’m not going to spin some kind of conspiracy theory about the company making the press do its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dirty work</a>, or at the very least its most boring work, but it definitely feels unusual for a company that has a big week of trying to sell me something to be so unclear about how precisely I can buy what it’s selling.&nbsp;</p><p>Now is, of course, not a great time for companies to have to tell people how to exchange money for goods. But doing so in as clear a way as possible is a company’s responsibility, not journalists’. Today’s small debacle feels like one snapshot of the confusion Trump's tariffs are going to continue to cause, and one example of how companies are likely to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-raising-prices-increases-trump-tariffs-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pass the buck</a> for all this onto everyday people. </p><p>Meanwhile, it feels like Nintendo is doing its level best to be business as usual; it's been running its usual Treehouses since the Direct, with chats full of viewers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3llym2u63522u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complaining</a> about the Switch 2’s price. Nintendo of America’s <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter feed</a> is full of hype clips for games, with similar comments underneath. And the rest of my part of the internet is full of people who are angry and anxious-- over a console they're excited about, sure, but also over <em>everything</em>. As the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESA told IGN</a>, “If we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously… There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.” Replace “the industry” with “everyone who buys things,” and you have a better picture of how the weirdness around the Switch, or video game prices broadly, is just one small, clear example of how much needless suffering Trump’s tariffs are going to cause.</p><p>Delayed hardware pre-orders are, in the grand scheme of things, not the world’s biggest deal. But if Switch pre-orders are the thing that makes “the economy” feel <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com/post/3llytzkatmc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real</a> to more people, that helps more people see how cruel and short-sighted Trump’s latest plans are, perhaps the best use of journalists’ time right now is helping our readers make sense of that and figure out what action to take, rather than having to tell them when they can buy a console and for how much.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders"><h3>Nintendo’s Long Line Of Hits Followed By Misses Might Continue With Switch 2</h3></a><p>"The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstations-horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-adaptation-will-now-be-a-movie-adaptation-instead/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>The previously announced&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-is-in-the-works-by-the-umbrella-academys-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn TV show</a> adaptation that was being led by the same showrunner behind Netflix's Umbrella Academy is no more, and Guerrilla's open-world robot-dinosaur hunting series will be adapted into a movie instead.</span></p>
<p>At the top of the year, during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV95SMpTW-M&amp;t=1914s">CES 2025</a>, Sony announced that it would be making a movie adaptation of Horizon Zero Dawn. An exciting announcement that fans presumed would be something to go along with the TV show we already knew was in development.</p>
<p>That's not the case; however, PlayStation Productions head Asad Qizilbash confirmed this in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/global/last-of-us-fallout-creators-tv-adaptations-bafta-games-awards-1236352651/">Variety</a>. Speaking to Variety ahead of the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-bafta-games-nominations-list-revealed-astro-bot-nominated-in-8-categories/">BAFTA 2025 Game Awards</a> set for April 8, 2025, Qizilbash shared his thoughts on how prestige adaptations of video game series and franchises have gone so far, and how they could grow in the future.</p>
<p>During that discussion, Qizilbash talked about how these adaptations can be very successful, so long as the approach is right.</p>
<p>"<em>I think what people have seen in Hollywood is that video game adaptations, if done right, can actually be very popular, and they scale really well. That's been a big sea change that I've seen in the last five, six years, since we've really started to come and deliver some great content.</em>"</p>
<p>Having that methodology is why Qizilbash admits that they felt a change needed to be made with how the Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation was developing. Qizilbash says that the TV show version that PlayStation Productions was working on with Netflix "<em>just wasn't creatively going how we wanted to,</em>" prompting the switch to make it a movie instead—and likely a very different project altogether, beyond the obvious differences between making a movie and making a TV show.</p>
<p>Out of the adaptations we've seen from PlayStation Productions so far, it's clear that HBO's The Last of Us has been the most successful. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/twisted-metal-tv-series-anthony-mackie/">Twisted Metal</a> show is set to premiere its second season sometime this summer, giving it another chance to make a mark after the first season failed to set the world on fire.</p>
<p>An even bigger challenge this time around, considering it'll be arriving shortly after the second season of HBO's The Last of Us, which is expected to be better than season one. The film adaptations we've gotten so far in Uncharted and Gran Turismo were able to find high to moderate financial success, respectively, but both were largely slammed by critics.</p>
<p>The switch to making the Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation a film instead of a TV show could transform the project from a middling sci-fi show to a stellar sci-fi film that does wonders at the box office. But at this point, Qizilbash and PlayStation Productions' batting average doesn't inspire confidence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em></a> biggest modern influences has announced his retirement. After 28 years of working at Wizards of the Coast on the world's most popular fantasy RPG, Christopher Perkins is stepping away, leaving a rich history behind.</p>



<p>Christopher Perkins announced his retirement from Wizards of the Coast via social media post on X (formerly Twitter). In the post, Perkins states that after 28 years of the company and wrapping up both Dungeons &amp; Dragons' 50th anniversary and new 2024 core rulebooks, that it was the perfect fairytale ending for him. He states that the franchise is in good hands and that he cannot wait to enjoy D&amp;D purely as a fan.</p>

In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dndbeyond.com/post/3llyx7uz36c2x" rel="nofollow">Bluesky social</a>, the company stated that they were grateful for Perkins' decades of work, stating that the game would not be what it is today without his contributions.</p>

<p>Perkins contributions to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> are substantial. He joined Wizards of the Coast in 1997 as an editor for <em>Dungeon</em> magazine. He later became a senior producer for the game while developing the <em>Star Wars Saga Edition</em> TTRPG. He also authored a blog, titled "The Dungeon Master Experience" on Wizards' website, openly dispensing sage advice about the challenges of being a DM.</p>

<p>But Perkins's biggest contributions came with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition. In addition to being the Senior Story Designer for the game, Perkins was also the lead story designer behind two of 5e's most acclaimed modules: <em>Curse of Strahd</em>, the 5e update to the iconic Castle Ravenloft module, and the whimsical Feywild journey of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wild-beyond-witchlight-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Wild Beyond the Witchlight</em></a>.</p>

<p>Perkins was also an active public figure for D&amp;D. He DM'd Penny Arcade's irreverent actual play series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-start-of-acquisitions-incorporated-first-actual-play-with-jerry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Acquisitions Incorporated</em></a>, hosted the Twitch live stream series <em>Dice, Camera, Action</em>, and guest-starred on several episodes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a>.</p>

<p>The last <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> product credited to Christopher Perkins as product lead is the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Dungeon Master's Guide</a>. An admirable update to the game's strong foundation.</p>
