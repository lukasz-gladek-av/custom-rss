            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-apple-in-disagreement-about-cloud-gaming-again/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This argument between Microsoft and Apple is far from new, but it has resurfaced again. Earlier in the year, Apple opened its App Store to game streaming services, such as the commonly used Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now. This allowed a more seamless integration, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-considering-a-browser-based-app-for-xbox-game-pass-to-bypass-apple-app-store-rules/">users didn't have to use a web app</a> on iPhone and iPad. Despite this, NVIDIA and Microsoft have not made native apps for iOS, which Microsoft has now explicitly explained.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer already spoke out about Apple earlier this year, saying that Apple's cloud changes haven't gone "far enough" for Xbox. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In an interview</a> with The Verge, Spencer mentioned "that there's not enough room for us to monetize Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS." Regarding the terms that Apple suggested, he responded with, "You might even say they go the opposite direction in some way, but they definitely don't go far enough to open up competition in the world's largest gaming platform." During that interview, Spencer said he would continue to work with Apple and Google to try and create a solution for this.</p>
<p>In submissions to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Microsoft has raised the point that despite the various changes that Apple made to the App Store guidelines in January, March, and April<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (as seen in sections 4.7 and 4.9)</a>, it still isn't enough for it to operate a native Xbox Cloud Gaming app on iOS.</p>
<p>After reviewing Apple's guidelines, Microsoft has said that they "still represent an obstacle to Cloud Gaming native apps" as it cannot comply with them in a technical and economical sense if it incorporates games into the Xbox Cloud Gaming services on iOS. Specifically, Apple is asking to make multiplatform services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and all content, subscriptions, and features available within the app as an in-app purchase.</p>
<p>By asking that, Microsoft opens a can of worms for the third-party game developers who have their games on the service. Microsoft would then have to ask them to recode their games so that they are compliant with the IAP requirement, which is a significant amount of effort for something that may not even be successful.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple argues</a> that it is supporting cloud gaming via web apps, citing two articles by the Verge that discuss Microsoft's improvements to Xbox Cloud Gaming performance on iPhone and iPad and the fact that more than 20 million people have used Xbox Cloud Gaming on their iOS platforms. Apple has also claimed that Microsoft has not engaged with them despite multiple efforts to work together to make cloud gaming successful on iOS.</p>
<p>When it comes to the issue of third-party developers having to recede their games, Apple has also argued that point, saying that developers "generally are not having difficulty with the IPA requirement," citing Antstream, a small app developer who was responsible for launching the first iPhone game streaming service with over 1,300 retro titles from different companies.</p>
<p>To try to settle this argument, the CMA has set a deadline for all parties involved to respond to the market investigation before a provisional decision report is released in November. A final report is due next year.</p>

When <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span> first released in 2016 it failed to live up to the lofty promises made by developer Hello Games prior to launch. Yet, over many years the studio has slowly updated and changed its underlying systems to not only meet those original expectations from fans and help rebuild trust, but eventually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-unexpected-success-of-no-man-s-sky-1833920840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-unexpected-success-of-no-man-s-sky-1833920840">surpass those expectations</a></span>. In 2024, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is perhaps the most definitive game for those seeking a unique space fantasy that lets you explore, catalog, and conquer the great unknown.</p></div><div><p>I respect, but don’t quite understand, the popularity of realistic driving sims like <em>American Truck Simulator</em>. Growing up in Los Angeles, driving around in my free time just to drive was a favorite pastime. There is something about the monotonous act of just cruising down roads with the radio on that feels meditative, but for me at least, doing that in a game just doesn’t hit the same. If you feel similarly then maybe change the setting to space<em>. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Trucker</em></a></span> is exactly that, a realistic driving simulator with the exception of the extra-planetary routes you’ll be undertaking.</p></div><div><p>If you’d rather spend your time with a strategy game that will let you sink dozens of hours into building up your own space empire as you play cutthroat political games then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stellaris</em></a></span><em> </em>is for you. From the same team behind strategy heavy hitters like the <em>Crusader Kings</em> and <em>Victoria </em>series, <em>Stellaris </em>takes Paradox Interactive’s deftly crafted 4X gameplay and transfers it to a grand galactic theater. If you’ve ever thought that, actually, the political part of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels was fascinating, you can guide your own rise to power amongst the stars.</p></div><div><p>Space isn’t all that friendly, especially in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em></a></span>. In this co-up adventure, you and up to three friends man your spaceship against the seemingly constant threats of deep space. Communication is key in this joint adventure that requires you to run around your ship and man the proper stations to stay alive. Like any good party game, <em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em> is easy to pick up, hard to master, and just hectic enough to cause the right amount of chaos amongst your group.</p></div><div><p>How hard can it really be to build a rocket? Turns out extremely, but thanks to <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> it can also be extremely funny. The space flight simulation title bases its building and launching of rockets and other spacecraft off of completely realistic physics. The humorous twist are the titular Kerbals, silly looking aliens who are your guinea pigs. The meat of<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kerbal Space Program</em></a></span> is its incredibly intricate building systems that challenge you to make effective spaceships, but your many failures are made easier by the presence of the Kerbals at all times. Sometimes you might find yourself making the most failure prone craft you can just to see how it treats your willing victims.</p></div><div><p><em>Fallout </em>in space. That’s the pitch for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/578650/The_Outer_Worlds/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/578650/The_Outer_Worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a></span>—which is not to be confused with <em>Outer Wilds</em>, another great space exploration title currently not on sale. Developed by <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> creator Obsidian Entertainment, <em>The Outer Worlds</em> brings the studio’s signature player-centric open-world RPG design to a space setting rife with sharp satire and western homages. The ability to choose how you approach situations (be it with a gun or with your words) in many major story beats and more minor interactions creates a living breathing world that makes the player feel truly important in more ways than just being the protagonist of a predetermined story. Running around and uncovering every little detail of <em>The Outer Worlds </em>setting is worthwhile, as its frontier western twist on the space adventure is perfectly pulpy.</p></div><div><p>In the twelve years since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>FTL</em></a></span><em> </em>released it feels like the roguelike genre has absolutely ballooned in popularity, yet <em>FTL </em>remains one of the absolute best to ever do it. You take control of a spaceship’s crew and make your way to your destination while being constantly attacked by enemies. While staying alive is paramount, <em>FTL </em>is much more management-based as you need to choose the proper crew and equipment as well as direct said crew to stations across these ships in order to avoid defeat. The fast-paced but highly strategic and customizable nature of each encounter makes returning to <em>FTL </em>over and over again a joy.</p></div><div><p>As far as original sci-fi settings go, <em>The Expanse</em> series (both the books and the TV show) are up there. From the mind of writers Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck—under the pen name James S. A. Corey—<em>The Expanse</em> is a gritty realistic version of space filled with high political tensions and space-based class disparity that leads to some incredible story arcs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1708010/The_Expanse_A_Telltale_Series/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1708010/The_Expanse_A_Telltale_Series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Telltale Series</em></a></span> based on the TV show continues that thrilling world in a slightly more interactive form and centers around one of the show’s best characters, Camina Drummer. You shouldn’t feel intimidated if you’ve never read or watched <em>The Expanse</em>, as the game is a great starting point.</p></div><div><p>Space is an unknowable void. It is uncaring, cold, and will kill you. You cannot defeat a force of nature like it. That is the conceit behind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341070/The_Banished_Vault/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341070/The_Banished_Vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Banished Vault</em></a></span>, a space-faring strategy/management game unlike any other on this list. You control a massive colony ship as it jumps from system to system as it constantly flees for an encroaching plague. Each system has planets and potential resources to find that can prolong your inhabitants’ lives from the inevitability of their deaths. There isn’t a real sense of victory in <em>The Banished Vault</em>, just a sense of ephemeral survival that can quickly be taken from you. This helplessness in the face of space makes for a thrilling gameplay loop that somehow hooks you in, compelling you to try to survive just a bit longer each time. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A certain fashion trend, a popular artist, or a movie that most everyone has seen. They also have their own signature games, and even consoles. For example, my generation had quite a few great systems growing up, but none was ever more popular than the PlayStation 2, and few games were as beloved as its RPGs.

No, you did not hallucinate Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy battling Sephiroth. That is, in fact, very real, and part of the first <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game. You know what else is real? Mickey Mouse being the king of this universe, but also lowkey one of its most prolific warriors. These games are <em>Space Jam </em>for theater kids and Disney adults and they’re on a pretty decent sale right now.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1000794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1000794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>On Steam</strong></a></span><strong>, the entire franchise is on sale as the <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em> for $69, though it usually goes for $100. </strong>This collection features just about every <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>title, since they’re all mostly canonical and tie in to the confusing overarching story in some fashion. Most of the entries are the full, original games, where possible. Some of the other titles, though, couldn’t be ported without meaningful resources put towards altering the gameplay to fit systems other than where the game first launched. For instance, <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</em>, which was released on the DS and made use of the dual screens for gameplay. In the case of games like this, this collection instead has compilations of the cutscenes in high-definition. </p><p>As far as full games, bagging this collection will get you <em>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, Re:Chain of Memories, II Final Mix, Birth By Sleep Final Mix, Dream Drop Distance HD, 0.2 Birth By Sleep - A fragmentary passage, III, and III ReMind</em>. You’ll also get the HD cutscenes of <em>358/2 Days </em>and <em>Re:coded</em>, as well as the movie <em>χ Back Cover</em>. Now, in case that made no sense, and I’m sure it didn’t, I will do my best to explain what I just said.<br></p><p>The three main games are in there, and the first two are specifically the <em>Final Mix </em>versions, which just means they are the re-releases that featured expanded content. Remember, DLC didn’t <em>really </em>exists in the early 2000s. The first game is not really all that fun (it’s too stiff in my opinion), but the second is like a completely different and much better game. Meanwhile, <em>ReMind </em>is just the third game’s lone piece of DLC, so if you’re interested in where the series will go outside of the story arc that concluded with <em>III</em>, it’s probably worth having.<br></p><p><em>Re:Chain of Memories and Re:coded </em>are (as the titles might give away) remakes of existing games which were ported to consoles. The former is a Gameboy Advance title that adopted a card-based battle system, and the latter was a mobile game that was eventually brought to the DS and then everything else. Meanwhile, <em>Birth By Sleep </em>is a PSP prequel that is probably one of the most celebrated titles in the series, and <em>0.2 Birth By Sleep - A fragmentary passage </em>is a playable prologue for <em>III </em>that picks back up with the fan-favorite character Aqua. I’m giving you all the broad strokes because anything else might literally cause an aneurysm.<br></p><p><em>Dream Drop Distance HD </em>is also a port of a 3DS game, but at the time the handheld was being touted as being able to house console-level experiences, hence why this game was able to make the jump to other systems completely intact. And yes, <em>Dream Drop Distance </em>can be shortened to <em>3D</em>, a point that the series’ creator Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix were <em>very </em>proud to tout. Everything is canon, everything is convoluted, and I kind of respect it.<br></p><p>I cannot tell you a damn thing about <em>χ Back Cover</em>, as that simply goes beyond my limited understanding of the series. In my defense, I was very hammered the last time anyone tried to explain the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games to me, and while that was fun, it probably doesn’t help. What I do know though is that <em>χ Back Cover</em> is a film tied to yet another mobile game that presumably does a good job of filling players in on what that side of the story was all about, without forcing anyone to play the game.</p><p>Despite my jests, <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>is a hugely important series to a generation of folks. It’s tremendously obtuse, but it is also <em>so </em>sincere. It taught a generation of kids the power of friendship. It let Woody from <em>Toy Story</em> roast the shit out of its central villain and weaponize the power of love. The main weapon of the game is a literal giant key. And for the price of a single game, you get about two decades worth of the most heartfelt nonsense wrapped in one of the action-RPG genres’ best combat systems. Need I say anything else?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-concord-shutting-down-mean-for-you/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you haven’t heard the absolutely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mind-boggling announcement</a> from Sony, you should know that Concord is shutting down completely. They’re not just ceasing ongoing development or canceling future content, they’re going nuclear with the arena shooter. So, what does that mean for you? What does it mean for those who paid for the game?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-still-play-concord">Can You Still Play Concord?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, in canceling the game, they took down the servers altogether. You can’t join a game if you own a copy and still have it installed, and you currently cannot buy it. Sony took down the store page on Steam, and over on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, it’s listed as “Announced” with a release date of 8/23/2024. </p>



<p>In its announcement, Sony said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Concord fans — we’ve been listening closely to your feedback since the launch of Concord on PlayStation 5 and PC and want to thank everyone who has joined the journey aboard the Northstar. Your support and the passionate community that has grown around the game has meant the world to us.</p>



<p>However, while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended. Therefore, at this time, we have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players.</p>



<p>While we determine the best path ahead, Concord sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC. If you purchased the game for PlayStation 5 from the PlayStation Store or PlayStation Direct, a refund will be issued back to your original payment method.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While it’s fantastic to hear that those who paid for a copy will receive a full refund, it still sucks for those players who were genuinely excited about the game. While it certainly didn’t sell well, Concord was entertaining, though it didn’t break the mold. The studio was chasing a trend from years prior and was too slow to capitalize.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-concord-return">Will Concord Return?</h2>



<p>It’s certainly possible that Sony will decide to bring Concord back online with a total revamp and a better roadmap. If they do, I suspect it’ll launch as a free-to-play game instead of a paid title. Based on the wording in the announcement, Sony wishes to “explore options” to determine how best to move forward with the project. After all, it spent years in development.</p>



<hr>



<p>According to analysts, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord only sold approximately 25,000 copies</a>, which makes it a failure on all accounts. We’re all curious to see how Sony will proceed with this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-shutting-down-sony-offering-full-refunds.970992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that live-service hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down effective Friday, and that all players who have purchased the game will be entitled to refunds.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony says that it's been "listening closely" to&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>feedback. The studio says that while many of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s qualities "resonated" with its player base, "other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended".</p>
<p>For that reason, Sony says it's taking&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline on September 6th, which is this Friday. The company says that it will "explore options, including those that will better reach our players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/concord-shutting-down-combat.jpg?itok=eZnIGRb0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/concord-shutting-down-combat.jpg?itok=3u7WxvAI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Concord&nbsp;</em>will be no more beginning this Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to taking the game's servers offline, Sony says it'll be offering "a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC". That's everyone who bought it, since&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>isn't available on any other platforms.</p>
<p>If you bought it either from the PlayStation Store or from PlayStation Direct, you'll be issued a refund "back to your original payment method".</p>
<p>Things are a little different if you purchased <em>Concord&nbsp;</em>from other platforms. Steam players will be issued a refund "over the coming days", as will the Epic Games Store. Physical retailers, meanwhile, will have their own refund processes to which you should refer if you bought the game from them.</p>
<p>Once you've received your refund, you won't have access to&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>anymore, which suggests that Sony isn't just going to be taking this one offline for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Sony taking&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline is a stunning blow to a game that was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of the studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-comments">live-service approach</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, Sony revealed that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-revised-its-live-service-ganes-plans-with-only-6-games-coming-by-fy-2025">release just six</a> of its previously-planned twelve live-service games before the end of the 2025 fiscal year, and since&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>is presumably one of those six games, its failure should probably cause Sony execs to do some serious soul-searching.</p>
<p>It's remarkable that Sony is choosing to take&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline less than two weeks after its launch, but given that the game attracted <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just shy of 700 concurrent players</a> at its peak (on Steam, that is), it's a decision that makes some sense. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <p>
Floundering 5v5 shooter Concord is set to go offline indefinitely this Friday - just two weeks after its PS5 and PC release - as Sony and Firewalk Studios admit "our initial launch didn't land".
</p>
<p>
Concord - one of several games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">snapped up by Sony</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">live-service push</a> under former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">initially announced last May</a>. Since then, the response has been tepid, culimating in less-than-stellar player numbers at launch, and subsequent estimates it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">only sold around 25,000 copies across PS5 and PC</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, Sony is taking the remarkable step of pulling the game offline this Friday, 6th September. In a post announcing the news <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>, game director Ryan Ellis wrote, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognise that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."

<p>
As such, Concord will be taken offline indefinitely so Firewalk can "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players."
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Concord will be pulled from sale immediately, and everyone who purchased the game on PlayStation 5 and PC will receive a full refund. Those who bought Concord on the PlayStation Store or PlayStation Direct will be refunded via their original payment method, and Sony says these refunds may take between 30 and 60 days to be appear on purchasers' bank statements.
</p>
<p>
Steam and Epic customers will be refunded in the "coming days" and will receive confirmation their refund has been processed. And as for players who bought a physical copy of Concord, they're advised to refer to the refund process of their retailer. All players, notes Sony, will lose access to the game once refunded.
</p>
<p>
"We'll keep you updated," Firewalk's statement concludes, "and thank you again to all the Freegunners who have joined us in the Concord galaxy."
</p>
<p>
Writing about the "kind and earnest" Concord's muted launch last month, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spare-a-thought-for-poor-concord-a-kind-and-earnest-shooter-sent-out-to-die">said</a>, "Out of the trenches of development and into no man's land it goes, clutching its weapon and its special ability, hoping for the best and bracing for what is, probably, the inevitable, while the forever war for our attention rumbles on."

			<p>Denuvo DRM is one of the most well-known and well-hated pieces of software in the gaming industry. It's used to protect games from piracy, which is frequent in a world full of digital content. Denuvo has been on the market for ten years now, and is increasingly more controversial, as it stops people from tampering with the product and making it available for piracy, as well as to stop unlicensed emulation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-qa-with-tim-willits-we-have-a-game-that-will-exceed-expectations/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is one of the most highly anticipated games and has decided not to go ahead with Denuvo DRM or any alternatives to DRM. This information was found in a <a href="https://support.saber.games/hc/en-us/articles/26354574015249-Warhammer-40-000-Space-Marine-2-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A posted</a> on the Saber Games website that discusses some important topics, such as the presence of microtransactions.</p>
<p>The FAQ covers a lot of important details about the upcoming release of Space Marine 2, a game that has already received a lot of attention due to a leak of a developer's build. However, many have moved past that and are now eagerly awaiting the game's release date, due on September 9, 2024.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Aside from the lack of DRM, Space Marine 2 will not feature any microtransactions, except paid cosmetic DLC. However, that is completely optional, and there won't be any pay-to-win features in Space Marine 2. "All gameplay content and features will be free to all players. Any paid DLCs will be cosmetic only," as confirmed in the FAQ on the Saber website. While they aren't using DRM, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, they will rely on EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) for anti-cheat coverage.</p>
<p>For those who are more interested in the graphical side of things, there are no plans for ray-tracing at current, but DLSS2/FSR2 will be available to those able to use it on day one, with DLSS3/FSR3 coming later in the year. Additionally, the developers aim to optimize the game for the Steam Deck later in the year. Unfortunately, the game is set not to support ultrawide and super-ultrawide monitors on launch day. This problem with a previous Warhammer 40,000 game was resolved after some time with a dedicated patch.</p>
<p>While Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will be available on GeForce Now on day one, it won't come to Xbox Game Pass for the foreseeable future. Regarding GeForce Now, the game will have fully-functioning cross-platform saves and offline progression, but those who want to play the Operations Mode will need a stable internet connection to access it.</p>
<p>Friendly fire will not appear in any game mode, but there will be dedicated PvP servers for those who want to partake. The dedicated servers will be for NA, LATAM, and SIE regions. As expected, there is no LAN support for PvE/PvP.</p>
<p>For those curious about Space Marine 2, the game doesn't require you to play the first to enjoy this one, despite some returning characters from the first game.</p>

			<p>After only ten days on the market, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-first-trailer-gameplay-release-date/">Concord</a> sales are ceasing immediately as Sony and Firewalk Studios explore better options to better reach their players.</p>
<p>In a new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, Game Director Ryan Ellis provided an update on the state of the game, revealing that some aspects of the game and the initial launch did not land the way the studio intended. As such, it has been decided to cease sales of the game immediately and take servers down later this week, on September 6th. A full refund is being offered for anyone who purchased the game on any platform. You can find information on how refunds are being offered below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Steam</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Store</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Steam Store will refund players who bought the game over the coming days.&nbsp;Steam will send confirmation of the refund once it has been processed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Epic Games Store</strong>&nbsp;– Epic Games Store will refund players who bought the game over the coming days and will contact each customer directly to confirm that the refund has been processed.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Other retailer refunds</strong>&nbsp;– For customers who have purchased a physical copy at a retailer location outside of PlayStation directly, please refer to the refund process of the retailer you purchased it from to obtain your refund.&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While the decision to halt Concord sales immediately, and take the game offline, may sound a little extreme, with the game having only been out for a few days, it was clear right from release how the game wasn't doing well at all, with extremely low concurrent players numbers on Steam from day one, despite showing some promise. Unfortunately for Sony and Firewalk Studios, gaming has moved past the trends that Concord tried to catch, and it will be very interesting to see how the game will be changed if it ever returns to the market.</p>

Now, after Capcom had what it called “technical discussions” with Microsoft, Xbox will be able to get in on the fun as well, though a bit later than everyone else.</p><div><p>Recently, there’s been a noticeable delay for big third-party releases on Xbox. It took last year’s Game of the Year, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3,</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993155/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-game-of-the-year">several months after its console launch to hit Xbox</a> because of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23844418/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-series-x-s-cross-save-split-screen">technical constraints of developing for the Series S</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224290/black-myth-wukong-passes-counter-strike-all-time-peak-on-steam">launched to big fanfare</a> on PlayStation and PC, and while an Xbox release is planned, there’s been no word of when. </p></div><p>Similarly, the developers of <em>Enotria: The Last Song </em>— an action RPG based on Italian folklore — <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement">announced an “indefinite delay” of the Xbox version of its game</a>. In <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830677183695667270">a statement on social media</a>, the developers at Jyamma Games said that they want to bring the game to Xbox as fast as possible but that “this task is nearly impossible with Microsoft taking months to reply to us when we have the game ready for submission.” The developers then implored fans to reach out to Xbox on their behalf, ostensibly to get the ball moving.</p><p>The two Capcom collections include 15 games, featuring arcade classics like <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>, <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>, <em>Capcom vs. SNK, Power Stone</em>, and more.

The first-person hero shooter&nbsp;launched exclusively on PS5 and PC on August 23rd, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing?utm_source=twitter">estimates have put sales</a> at under 25,000. <em>Concord </em>also only managed to hit an all-time peak of 697 players on Steam, lower than the launch peak of <em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum — </em>widely regarded as the worst game of 2023.</p><p>“We have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players,” says <em>Concord game</em> director Ryan Ellis in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">PlayStation blog post</a>. “While we determine the best path ahead, <em>Concord </em>sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC.”</p><p>If you purchased the game for PS5 from the PlayStation Store, a refund will be issued to your original payment method. If you purchased<em> Concord</em> on Steam, you’ll get a refund in the coming days, and the same will occur on the Epic Games Store. </p><p><em>Concord </em>launched as a $40 game after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-live-service-hero-shooter-concord-has-been-in-development-for-around-8-years">eight years of development</a> and went up against many free-to-play alternatives like <em>Overwatch </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211812/valorant-console-launch-xbox-series-s-x-ps5-download">even <em>Valorant</em></a><em> </em>in the competitive hero shooter genre. It has ultimately failed to compete as a paid game, especially without a unique selling point. </p><p>Firewalk Studios’ mention of options “that will better reach our players” and the refunds make it seem like <em>Concord</em>, if it does return, will move to a free-to-play model. “We’ll keep you updated and thank you again to all the Freegunners who have joined us in the <em>Concord </em>galaxy,” says Ellis.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation is shutting down Concord just two weeks after its launch. </p>



<p>The company announced <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via a blog post</a> on Tuesday afternoon that it will be taking the game offline on September 6. The company says it’s doing so to “explore options, including those that will better reach our players”.</p>



<p>“[W]hile many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended,” game director Ryan Ellis said.</p>



<p>Those who purchased the game will get a full refund while all future sales will be stopped immediately. If you purchased the game physically, Sony says to check the refund policy at the retailer the game was purchased at.</p>



<p>Concord launched on August 23 to little fanfare. It’s launch day saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than 700 concurrent players</a> on Steam, and the number continued to drop daily. Ahead of this announcement, the game was struggling to hit 100 concurrent players on the platform.</p>



<p>There is no information on what the game did player-wise on PlayStation 5. There were reports that the game sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 25,000 copies</a>. The actual number, however, is likely lower after early refunds are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The first major title update for Madden 25 was released on Tuesday, and with it comes a number of changes. From gameplay to Franchise to Superstar mode, every aspect of the game has seen an update or fix in some fashion.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest changes come from the addition of the revamped passing mechanic being added from College Football 25, defensive pursuit logic updates, fixed a glitch that gave receivers speed boost when using custom stems and smart-routing, and fixed an issue with importing draft classes in Franchise mode.</p>

<section><p>GameSpot recently had the opportunity to discuss Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis--and the Persona series as a whole--with general producer Kazuhisa Wada.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The Persona series is currently in an interesting place. Following the release of Persona 5 back in 2016, the series has grown exponentially more popular. Back in December 2023, Atlus confirmed the Persona 5 series--which includes the original game, Royal, Strikers, Tactica, and Dancing in Starlight--has sold more than 10 million copies. When Persona 3 Reload launched earlier this year, it sold over 1 million copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling Persona game to date. Compare that with Persona 4 at 2.5 million copies sold--1 million of those from the last year--and you can see the franchise's incredible momentum.</p><p dir="ltr">Suffice to say, there's never been more eyes on the Persona series, and this makes the studio's current transition and trajectory particularly interesting. For the past eight years, the studio has solely released remakes, ports, and additional content pertaining to the series' existing entries. Even more notable, however, is that the team working on these projects (Atlus' P-Studio) has also seen an exodus of long-time Persona developers, with Katsura Hashino, Shigenori Soejima, Yuichiro Tanaka, Azusa Kido, Yujiro Kosaka, and Yasuhiro Akimoto all leaving the Persona series to start a new team and work on the upcoming fantasy RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio. I can't help but wonder, then, what's next for P-Studio and the Persona series?</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to delve into this with Atlus' Kazuhisa Wada, a long-time producer and director at the studio who now leads P-Studio following Hashino's departure. Though the conversation focused on the studio's next release, Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis, I was also able to gain some insight into the future of the Persona series, if we'll one day get Persona 1 and 2 remakes, and why we the team can't seem to stop releasing deluxe editions of its games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360770-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360770" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360770-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360770"></a><figcaption>Yukari and Mitsuru ready to attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360770-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%287%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Why did the team decide to release Episode Aigis as DLC rather than incorporating it into the base game as Persona 3 FES did?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Wada: </strong>FES was released months after Persona 3, which ended up being the "complete" version of the game. Episode Aigis itself was a standalone piece of content you could select from the main-menu screen, even though it was included in the base game. Some of the reason is that we felt it made sense to release it as a separate DLC rather than as a complete version of Persona 3 Reload. However, a larger reason was that we were simply unable to plan for Episode Aigis ahead of time. Late into the development of P3R, we found ourselves under extremely difficult circumstances--we still wanted to make Episode Aigis a reality, but we didn't have the proper resources to make it happen. Thankfully, last year, we were able to secure the team necessary to do so. But even then, we hadn't decided on the overall team structure for the project. While we were unsure at the time whether we could get it across the finish line, I was determined to make Episode Aigis see the light day. So, I pushed through, and we were able to develop it as DLC.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I've always felt that The Answer was an extended metaphor for grief--that it explores how the world seems to stand still and we find ourselves pushing away emotions rather than processing them. What is it like revisiting these themes all these years later, with more life experience?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Rather [than the team's thoughts], I would be interested to know how you and others who shared those same feelings at the time feel about these themes now, all these years later and with that experience. The essence of Episode Aigis is essential to fully convey the overall significance of P3, so if we can help people understand it better, that may be one answer.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, we have tried to make a few adjustments to the game in order to help players better understand these themes, and to ultimately help them move forward from 3/31. We looked back at the scenario and analyzed the various opinions of fans at the time and picked out the parts of the scenario that were "controversial" outside of the main plot. In the original, we felt that the limited description of each character's actions and decisions made it difficult to convey the necessary emotional premise, so we made some delicate adjustments around that. I'm sure there are many different opinions on how this will affect the game in general, but I would like to ask you to play the game and see for yourself, and then give us your honest feedback.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are the most meaningful changes, both story-wise and in regards to gameplay, in Episode Aigis?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">In terms of story, the dialogue of the main story was adjusted based on the policy described in your second question, while the missing information in terms of emotions and relationships between friends was filled in through linked episodes and dungeon conversations.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of gameplay, new Theurgy, shifts, and special skills were added based on the design specifications of Reload to eliminate the stress of the FES era and to make dungeon attack and battles more enjoyable. In addition, five difficulty levels are available here, allowing for a variety of play styles. The highest difficulty level is also very challenging yet rewarding at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, not only is the Persona Compendium included, but any compendium progress can be carried over from the base version of P3R using existing save data, so we hope fans enjoy all these changes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360771-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360771" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360771-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360771"></a><figcaption>Aigis readies multiple personas to attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360771-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%285%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the most challenging aspect of remaking a game nearly 20 years later?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The most difficult task was to create a production structure and get the project drafted and approved. From there, we had to find the best way to convey the essence of the content, which was divisive at the time, and how to tune it for the better. It was equally challenging, but also just as important and rewarding, to find a way to portray both Metis, a character who had not appeared for almost 20 years, and the game's themes in an appealing way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the inclusion of Episode Aigis, Persona 3 Reload feels like it is the deluxe version of </strong><strong>the game yet it is missing an important feature: the female protagonist. Why was she </strong><strong>excluded? Will we see her again one day?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the female protagonist will not be added to P3R. Back when we were planning Episode Aigis, we had considered adding the female protagonist, but the more we looked at what this would take to make happen, the more unlikely it became. The development time and cost would not have been manageable and due to the nature of the content, it's difficult to entrust this externally. Even if we were able to move forward, the actual release would end up being far into the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, we would be expected to build not just a remake, but a completely new game, so we would need to devote our limited development resources for it. I apologize to the fans who have supported us for so long, but this follows the same reasoning that allowed us to do Episode Aigis: We cannot do any additional content like creating a female protagonist for P3R unless we create and release it at this very moment where interest in P3R is at its highest.</p><p dir="ltr">But since it is not possible for us to release P3R with the female protagonist in this window, we just can't do it. I'm really sorry to all of the fans who were holding out hope, but it is likely never going to happen.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Atlus has a tendency to return to games and release new editions with new features fairly </strong><strong>regularly. Why is that? When do you decide to reach a stopping point?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal added many expanded features that couldn't be contained in a DLC format, so we had to treat them as completely new games. This time, we've kept that in mind for Episode Aigis, so we've made sure that the expanded content only works as DLC. Moving forward, if the content doesn't significantly expand on the base game, then we would like to deliver that content in an appropriate format.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360772-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360772-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%283%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4360772"></a><figcaption>The SEES team discusses its next mission.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4360772-p3rexpansionpassepisodeaigis081524%283%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>As Persona 3 Reload wraps up, are there any plans to remake Persona 1 and Persona 2?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It is not on my schedule right now. I would like to do it someday.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I know some of the team members have moved on to Metaphor: ReFantazio. How does this impact the future of the Persona series?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Many years ago, one of the issues we wanted to resolve as a company was to improve the development capacity of the organization. Fortunately, as of today, very talented young and mid-career people are steadily growing through projects like P3R and P5R, so if we are asked about the impact on the future from here on, the answer can only be "for the better."</p><p dir="ltr">We game developers, myself included, have a number of issues that need to be resolved in response to the lengthy and expanded game development process. I believe that one of the most important things to do is to pass on the spirit of the game to the next generation. One of the most important things is to build an organization that allows that transition to happen naturally.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to develop and maintain a sustainable, high-quality series of titles, I believe that the methodologies of organizational reform and generational change at that time were unavoidable and highly necessary. Even then, I believe the fact we can point to the growth of the Persona series from then to now is the best proof we have that we are on the right track. Therefore, we would be very happy and encouraged if you all have even greater expectations of both us and the games we produce in the future, so please keep up the good work.</p>

                <p>After just a week on the market, Sony has decided to remove Concord from sale and will take the game's servers offline. The move comes after the game failed to find an audience, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/" data-ref-id="1100-6526227">reported 25,000 sales</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-big-new-ps5-and-pc-game-concord-got-off-to-a-slow-start/1100-6526101/" data-ref-id="1100-6526101">very low player numbers</a>.</p><p>Game director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."</p><p>Concord is no longer available to buy and the servers will go offline on September 6. Ellis said the team will "explore options" for how to "better reach our players," which sounds like the game could return in some form down the road.</p><p>Sony is refunding people who bought Concord. Those who bought the game on PS5 will get an automatic refund to their payment method. People who bought Concord on Steam and the Epic Games Store will get refunds, too, and players should look for email messages from those providers.</p><p>Anyone who bought a physical copy of Concord can get a refund from the store they bought it from.</p><p>This is a shocking turn of events, as few could have predicted Sony would end sales and shut the servers down for Concord so quickly, even though the player numbers and sales figures were low.</p><p>As Ellis alluded to in the statement, it sounds like Sony and Firewalk could be revamping Concord with a plan to bring it back in a different way. One possibility is it returns as a free-to-play title, which is what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/" data-ref-id="1100-6526227">many expected it to be at launch to give it the best chance to find an audience. </a></p><p>Prior to this dramatic announcement, Firewalk planned to launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-concord-early-and-what-time-it-unlocks/1100-6525754/" data-ref-id="1100-6525754">Concord Season 1: The Tempest</a> in October, adding a new character, new map, new variants, and additional cosmetics and rewards. Season 2 was scheduled for January, with Season 3 expected in April, though these timelines have surely now changed.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Concord.</p>

                <p>Jyamma Games, the developer behind the Italian-inspired souls-like game Enotria: The Last Song, has indefinitely delayed the Xbox version due to Microsoft being non-responsive.</p><p>According to a Discord post by Jyamma studio CEO Jacky Greco (via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/they-dont-care-about-enotria-and-they-dont-care-about-you-jyamma-games-ceo-blasts-xbox-amidst-indefinite-delay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>), an Xbox version is ready for submission. However, Microsoft has seemingly ignored the studio's submission ahead of the game's September 18 release date.</p><p>"We believe that Xbox is blessed with a huge gaming community and we would love to release Enotria on your platform as fast as possible, as we spent a lot of money and resources to make it happen, but this task is nearly impossible with Microsoft taking months to reply to us when we have the game ready for submission," Jyamma Games <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830677183695667270" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained in a statement</a>. "If you'd like to help please let Xbox know about our situation, if we had a dedicated xbox account manager help us out this issue would not exist, thank you so much!"</p><p>Xbox has seen a number of games skip the platform, at least at launch, due to a variety of factors. Black Myth: Wukong reportedly has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-report/1100-6526196/" data-ref-id="1100-6526196">non-publicized timed exclusivity deal with Sony</a>, although other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YOf7LJRiDww?si=X_XzPR0vaCL8Teie&amp;t=1432" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> dispute that. Capcom's remasters such as Ace Attorney Investigations and Capcom Fighting Game Collection were initially skipped over for Xbox as well. However, Capcom revealed that as a result of technical discussions with Microsoft, the latter and the second compilation <a href="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1830984496260219001" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">are coming to Xbox in 2025</a>.</p><p>Microsoft requires feature parity and simultaneous launches across Series S and Series X, which has also contributed to delays. Most infamously, Baldur's Gate 3 was released late for Xbox last year due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/">technical complications</a> related to the Series S version. However, that's not the case with Enotria, as the developer said on <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830672665482330526" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>, "It's not a performance issue, the game works better as expected on series S, and really good on series X, but we cannot proceed through the submission process and the reply from microsoft can take up to 2 months."</p>
