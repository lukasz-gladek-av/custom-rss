		<p>You just can’t keep a zombie game down, can you? Much like the undead that have invaded the land of the living, it feels almost inevitable that zombie games will spawn sequels, no matter how long and arduous the development becomes, receive lavish remakes and reimaginings, or at the very least end up firmly lodged in the games industry discourse for several years.</p>
<p>Launching on the 18th anniversary of the Willamette Incident, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is the latest in a slew of zombie games that are clawing themselves back into the public eye. We’re absolutely here for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster – Director’s Report" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mP5jIX87-lA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Capcom has shown a mastery of classic game remakes over the past half decade, through the excellent reimagining of earlier parts of the Resident Evil series. Resi 2 and 3 were given a complete makeover with modern third-person gameplay at their core, and while Resi 4 was closer to the original in that it already featured third-person camera, there was still plenty of space for modernising the controls and feel of the game.</p>
<p>You could argue that Dead Rising, by contrast, doesn’t need anywhere near as much work to feel like a contemporary game. Coming out in the first year of the Xbox 360’s life, the sandbox setting and gameplay, the number of zombies being shown on screen, the menagerie of silly and playful ways to kill them, and the generally tongue-in-cheek tone all play well close to two decades later. Perhaps that’s why so much of this has been kept intact for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, though I’d still argue that branding this as a remaster, deluxe or otherwise, is a huge misnomer.</p>

<p>For one thing, this is just as much of a remake as Resi 4 was. The game has been reconstructed within RE Engine, all of the character models have been remade, the shopping mall has been given a major spruce up and large parts of the environment redesigned, and there’s plenty of other tweaks and changes throughout. The core gameplay might be practically the same, but this is a remake through and through.</p>

<p>With this being a remake, Capcom has been able to go through and make several quality-of-life improvements throughout. The 72-hour in-game time limit and constantly ticking clock for missions remain, but if you find yourself stuck for things to do – let’s say you just want to race through the story and ignore rescuing survivors – then you can skip time back at base. Saving is similar, in that manual saves will still need you to nip to the loos dotted around the mall, but an autosave system will trigger as you go between areas and at key story moments, so you don’t have to retrace your steps anywhere near as much if you die. Oh, and radio calls and dialogue won’t be interrupted when being attacked or performing certain actions anymore, and all the dialogue is now voiced, so even Otis has a voice! Then there’s durability indicators in the UI to show the state of your weapons, and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>They’re all honestly great improvements to see, just rounding off the edges of the zombie-bashing original. This was my very first time playing the first Dead Rising – I had a fun time with the PC release of Dead Rising 3 –&nbsp;and the autosave in particular let me just barrel straight into the mess of zombies with barely a care in the world, wholeheartedly embracing the silliness of the zombie-bashing action.</p>

<p>You’re clued in on some of the game’s irreverent tone from the helicopter-based opening, as Frank gets a ride into town and snaps photos of what’s supposedly local rioting from the air. The camera is a constant companion through the game – Frank’s running animations always have him clutching the camera to his chest to keep it safe – and you can always switch to the viewfinder and snap a quick photo, while this remake is bringing new photo filters to add more creativity. Each photo, though, is immediately rated to judge the number of subjects in view, highlight any particular moments of action, like a zombie head exploding, judge the theme, like the comedic value of zombies with bear costume heads slapped on them, and then spit out a score.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I would keep forgetting to try and take photos, instead focussing on the opening day of the game’s 72-hour story, and just messing with the throngs of zombies that shamble around the shopping centre. There’s a simple joy to discovering what’s possible, quickly nipping into a shop to grab things off shelves to use as weapons, some of which are pleasant surprises. It took a moment for me to realise that the golf club isn’t just a melee weapon, but can line up a drive to power a golf ball into a zombie’s noggin, while throwing a pie at a zombie is just wonderfully satisfying for the cream that splatters across their head and blinds them, or you can ride a skateboard through the throngs of enemies. Oh, and I mustn’t forget about the lawnmower, or even just Frank’s eventual ability to decapitate zombies with a backflip kick!</p>

<p>It’s even goofier if you do all this in costume. Naturally, you can still pick up some new kicks and clothes off the racks of clothing stores, but there’s a bunch of new costumes, such as the oversized bee mascot, with antennae that will happily clip through scenery during cutscenes. The Deluxe Remaster’s digital deluxe edition – as if the game name wasn’t deluxe enough – will also bundle in some extras with the obligatory RPD uniform, the bizarre horror of a blood-splattered bunny, the long-tongued licker, and more.</p>
<p>On the surface level, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster just gives the 18-year-old game a fresh lick of paint, but as I’ve said plenty times already, there’s a fair bit more going on here than that. We’re just over a month away from the full release and, since I never played the original, I’m looking forward to diving in for more of the mid-2000s zombie-bashing shenanigans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mother-machine-preview-chaos-gremlins-reign-supreme<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maschien-Mensch has announced their new multiplayer roguelite platformer hybrid, <em><a href="https://maschinen-mensch.com/">Mother Machine</a></em>. This indie developer from Berlin will be most known to fans for their previous titles<em> Curious Expedition</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8eb1ab91-9e37-45c6-9c56-1ac5757fb54e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/curious-expedition-2"><em>Curious Expedition 2</em></a>, <em>Mother Machine</em> takes their development journey in an entirely new direction.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago TechRaptor was invited to join the team for a behind-closed-doors reveal of their game including an extended live gameplay session run by members of the Maschien-Mensch team.</p>
<p><em>Mother Machine</em> takes place in a distant future on an alien planet. Humans abandoned the titular AI supercomputer, Mother Machine, but existence alone is driving her insane. As a solution to this problem, <em>Mother Machine</em> creates life in the form of Chaos Gremlins and sets them to explore the world.</p>

<p><em>Mother Machine</em> is a multiplayer roguelite where players take on the role of a Chaos Gremlin, created by the titular <em>Mother Machine</em>. As a Chaos Gremlin you and up to three of your friends get to explore a procedurally-generated tunnel system.</p>
<p>Each Gremlin has the base ability to run, jump, mine crystals, and climb so that they can make their way through each of the game's levels. Along the way, the aim is to collect the crystals and bring them back to their base or spend them throughout the level for a variety of upgrades.</p>
<p>With these crystals, you can mutate your Chaos Gremlin. In our time watching the game in action, we saw that some Gremlins were able to create projectiles out of burps or secrete a substance to make climbing easier.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mother-machine-climbing.jpg?itok=5ixiMjmb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mother-machine-climbing.jpg?itok=MqXSh2yq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We got to see how each of these mutations would facilitate a different kind of playstyle. If you didn't want enemies to bother you as much then making sure you were an offensive style Gremlin could mean you would need to worry less if enemies appeared, alternatively, if you want to make sure no rock goes unturned making sure you can climb anywhere can mean you might be able to come back to base with even more crystals.</p>
<p>The ability to specialize your Gremlins differently was also a key aspect of why playing this game is meant to be more fun with other players. With two or even three Gremlins suddenly roles begin to form with offensive Gremlins taking the lead while others explore for crystals when the coast is clear.</p>
<p>Watching the devs from Maschinen-Mensch play the game there were requests for assistance from one another for additional support in a variety of different activities. It was fun to see this kind of collaborative discussion, and also just how that collaboration paid off as the pack was able to move together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mother-machine-enemies.jpg?itok=7hs751Gx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mother-machine-enemies.jpg?itok=nawwCyWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The real star of what little we saw of the game was the alien landscape that the game is set in. The Gremlins alone are strange and alien but once you start to look at all of the different flora and fauna that appear during escalation you begin to understand just how weird this world is.</p>
<p>There were some moments where animations performed strangely at angles, and the spread of fluids like those from the projectiles spread onto the environments in a strange way but we were informed that with the release date still in 2025 there was still plenty of time to polish the game further.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mother-machine-world-view.jpg?itok=ZLQsvA0K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mother-machine-world-view.jpg?itok=jG36z7Bs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Mother Machine</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>What the team at Maschinen-Mensch is working on was a lot of fun to see for the short time we were able to see it. While it's definitely a large departure in gameplay from their previous titles it looks like they've been able to take a lot about what they've learned in the realm of roguelite and procedurally generated gameplay and apply the formula here.</p>
<p>From the gameplay, we saw there's definitely some rough around the edges going on, but the core gameplay loop seemed appealing especially as part of a group of friends.</p>
<p>Some elements that we didn't get to learn much about were the underlying story and what Mother Machine's true intentions are, or just how crazy you can get with the mutations on your Chaos Gremlins.</p>
<p>This will be a title to keep an eye on as we head into 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-3-vr-developer-archiact-shuts-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>VR studio Archiact, best known for games like&nbsp;<em>Doom 3: VR Edition&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Journey to Foundation</em>, has officially shut down.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/archiact_archiacts-journey-is-coming-to-a-close-activity-7228922392360722434-ILGR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on its official LinkedIn page</a>, Archiact said that it informed its staff of the studio's closure yesterday. The company will officially close its doors in two weeks, according to the post.</p>
<p>Archiact goes on to trace an outline of its journey from inception to closure. The studio was started in 2013 and was involved with publishing more than 35 games, as well as developing VR and mixed reality titles itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/archiact-shutting-down-journey-to-foundation.jpg?itok=lp7ZDRAV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/archiact-shutting-down-journey-to-foundation.jpg?itok=Hs7fXwJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Archiact worked on games like&nbsp;<em>Journey to Foundation</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Doom 3</em>'s VR port and&nbsp;<em>Journey to Foundation</em>, other VR games Archiact worked on include "augmented reality experience"&nbsp;<em>Marvel Dimension of Heroes</em>, VR diving game&nbsp;<em>Freediver: Triton Down</em>, and "sci-fi bullet-hell shooter"&nbsp;<em>Evasion</em>.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn't the first we've heard of Archiact experiencing some problems. Back in January, Archiact <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs">laid off an undisclosed number of staff</a>, a decision the studio said was not taken lightly.</p>
<p>Archiact's closure is part of a wider trend in the industry right now, one that involves a lot of layoffs and studio closures across both the triple-A and indie spaces. It seems that no studio, however successful, is safe from the swinging scythe of this wave of layoffs.</p>
<p>Other smaller indie studios hit by layoffs or closures include&nbsp;<em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>developer Bossa,&nbsp;<em>Palia&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs">Singularity 6</a>&nbsp;(which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition">recently acquired by MMO giant Daybreak</a>), and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs"><em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM</a>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-layoffs-archiact.jpg?itok=lRdBrdre 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-layoffs-archiact.jpg?itok=9mlw8qb9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Archiact is far from the only studio to have been hit by layoffs or closures recently.</figcaption></figure><p>On the industry's AAA side, studios hit by layoffs and closures recently include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees"><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie</a>, its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">parent company Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-layoffs-share-buyback">EA</a>, again among many others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reasons for these layoffs are far-reaching; some studios can't get funding for in-development projects, while others are being mismanaged or are dealing with overhiring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>One thing's for sure, though; we haven't heard the last of this wave of industry layoffs and studio closures yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>As long-time readers will know, I'm a piteous mark for weird little game guys. I’m currently trying to puzzle out what the titular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mother-machine">Mother Machine</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-curious-expedition">The Curious Expedition</a> studio Maschinen-Mensch’s upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> refers to. But, if it’s a reference to forming a parental bond with what the game has saw-me-comingishly named “chaos gremlins”, I'm way ahead of you.</p>
<p>Ah, the press release speaketh! Probably should have read some more before I began exclaiming “Chaos Gremlins!” over and over. Have an announcement trailer.</p>

<p>And here's the deep gremlin lore: </p>
<blockquote><p>Set thousands of years in the future, Mother Machine takes place on a distant planet once colonised by humans but since abandoned. Left behind by her creators, an Artificial Intelligence faced a problem: without a purpose, she needed to find a way to protect her digital mind from breaking under the burden of being forever alone. Her solution was to create a creature that she could take care of. True rascals, with an affinity for mischief and chaos, these little gremlins were bioengineered by their mother to withstand and survive a harsh alien environment. 3D-printed from organic filament by their godlike Mother Machine, these creatures are tasked to collect and explore a vast cave network of a mysterious alien planet, brimming with biodiversity and peculiar life-forms — but the further the gremlins venture, the more they find out about the dark secrets of the planet’s history, and the true ambitions of their mechanical mother.</p></blockquote>
<p>They are literally, canonically, emotional support Chaos Gremlins. Brilliant. Mother Machine lets you enlist up to three mates in drop-in co-op to aid you. The more gremlins, the higher the levels of “both chaos and competition.” It also sounds like they’ll be a dynamic difficulty system: “balanced co-op mechanics allow expert players to join together with novices.” Platforming looks to be front-and-centre, but Maschinen-Mensch also refer to Mother Machine an an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Sounds like this manifests in mutation skill trees, which let you alter and improve your gremlin’s abilities.</p>
<p>The game also boasts “endlessly replayable generative levels,” although what this means in context, I’m not sure. For all the fun in the trailer, I am left uncertain of how Mother Machine will be structured, or even what goals your troupe of disaster lizards are out to accomplish. The trailer above shows one gremlin farting on another. I’d inquire about the practical applications of such an ability, but I think that might be missing the point. It does look good though. Similar appeal to co-op physics sandboxes, I think, just with a good deal more intention and sinew holding it together - enough so that I'd likely still be interested in playing it solo. It's out sometime in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Developer Maschinen-Mensch has revealed Mother Machine, a co-op action-platformer with RPG elements. Built using Unreal Engine 5, the game allows for up to four players to take control of an adorable chaos gremlin, explore a series of procedurally generated cave networks for resources, and regularly meet a horrible end thanks to a malfunctioning robot mother.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPUI2ihP6pE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gPUI2ihP6pE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Maschinen-Mensch is aiming for an accessible title regardless of skill level, and balanced co-op mechanics will allow expert players to join forces with newcomers to explore intricate and procedurally-designed alien caves. The studio also says it has been influenced by several games while developing Mother Machine, like Spelunky, the Oddworld series, and Helldivers 2.</p><p>While your gremlin's base set of skills will allow them run, climb, and leap through these replayable levels, you can also experiment with a vast range of mutations that are geared toward specific playstyles. Players can use swipe-attacks, healing farts, and weaponized burps to knock out any enemies they come across.</p><p>Together, players will be able to discover more resources and secrets the deeper they venture into the strange planet. And if they meet an untimely end? Mother can always 3D print a fresh batch mischievous science experiments to carry on the mission and achieve its dark ambition.</p><p>Mother Machine is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-joy-of-the-perfect-stealth-game-run-which-i-will-never-know.951882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not generally a video game achievement chaser, with two exceptions: the <em>Half-Life 2</em> “Flushed” achievement for killing someone with a toilet, and any stealth game that has a combined achievement for never killing anyone and never being detected. I’ve been midway through several of these kinds of playthroughs for years. Will I ever finish them? I doubt it, but I’ll never stop trying.</p><p>I love stealth games: their thoughtful pace, their attention to their environment, all those key codes and alternate routes being loudly shouted by NPCs in public places. The holy grail of stealth game runs, to me, is getting in and out as if you were never there. Many modern stealth games push you toward these kinds of runs: For <em>Dishonored </em>and <em>Dishonored 2</em>, there are the “Ghost” and “Clean Hands” achievements for never being detected and never killing anyone. <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em> has “Pacifist” for not killing anyone, and “Foxiest of the Hounds” for never setting off any alarms. And then there’s the gold standard of any <em>Hitman</em> run: the “Suit Only/Silent Assassin,” or SASO, run, for only killing targets, hiding all bodies, and never getting spotted, all without donning a disguise.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m midway through this kind of run in every game I mentioned above. As I type this, my Corvo Attano is perched on a lamppost on his way to kidnap Anton Sokolov, and my Emily Kaldwin is just outside the Clockwork Mansion, gearing up to evade all those automatons. Lord knows where I left Adam Jensen– probably in a vent. I’ve SASOed <em>Hitman</em>’s Paris and Sapienza with ease, but I’ve never done it in other missions. I’ve played all these games for dozens of hours (Steam tells me I have 125 hours in <em>DX:HR</em>, and that’s not including the Director’s Cut that makes the boss fights more possible with a stealth build), and many of those hours have been spent painstakingly save-scumming my way through a level.</p><p>There’s a pleasure in games like <em>Dishonored</em> and <em>Hitman</em> in blowing your cover and just going full chaos (<a href="https://aftermath.site/hitman-freelancer-the-best-kind-of-hitman-is-more-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hitman Freelancer</em></a> lends itself especially well to this, since you only get one shot anyway), but you can’t do that in a perfect stealth run. Instead, you have to move slowly and methodically and stressfully. In <em>Dishonored 2</em>, a game I hadn’t spent much time in before attempting a perfect stealth run, it took me hours to complete the first mission. I’d dart from a corner to behind a box, save, then dart to a light fixture and save again. I remember one hallway in the Addermire Institute where I kept getting spotted by two guards, the familiar zinging strings of the alerted sound playing over and over as I reloaded. I had to eschew many of the fun side objectives and exploration in pursuit of a single-minded goal, one that doesn’t matter at all but that I <em>want</em> so badly.</p><p>Some of these games add the complication that characters you pacify can be discovered or die after you’ve left an area. I’ve thought I’ve aced a level, only for <em>Dishonored</em>’s ending stat screen to make me realize a hastily-hidden body got eaten by rats, or someone woke up a <em>Hitman</em> character I’d left in a hallway I thought no one came down. The stress of the perfect run never ends until you know, 100%, that you’re in the clear. And then you have to do it all over again in <em>another</em> level, and <em>another</em>, until you’ve turned a 10-hour game into a 30-hour one.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, it’s not actually a very <em>fun</em> way to play. But still! It feels so good to work so hard at a level, to learn its layout so intimately, to make little encounters so much more convoluted or complicated when you can’t use many of the tools a game offers you. I get to see a new side of all the craft that goes into every piece of a stealth game’s level design, exploring exactly how NPCs or objects are placed. I remember that cursed hallway in <em>Dishonored 2</em>’s Addermire Institute much better than I remember the level’s actual target, because it was a site of such drama, one that was personal to me and my playthrough. Who can be disappointed in <em>Deus Ex</em>’s boss fights when I have my own boss fight in the form of a guy who won’t walk away from an elevator? <a href="https://kotaku.com/getting-out-alive-is-the-coolest-part-of-hitman-1765069321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leaving a level </a>in my <em>Hitman</em> suit becomes a whole new game when I can’t just beeline for the exit. These full stealth runs might be stealth games at their worst–the save-scumming, the long stretches of sitting still–but they’re also stealth games at their best, full of tension and creativity.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe I’ll get you one day, achievements, but more likely I’ll just keep sighing at your descriptions on my screen, imagining who I could be if I were a little more patient, or had slightly better reflexes, or didn’t entirely forget how to play a video game if I put it down for more than a week. The perfect stealth dream lives, even if I will never live it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new take on Pokemon could be coming soon. According to <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1823123300756914568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>, a Pokemon live action series is in development at Netflix.</p>



<p>Details on the rumored series are scarce, however, there is some information on the main premise. The report claims that the show won’t feature Ash Ketchum or a new character as the game’s main protagonist. Instead, the main character of the show will be firs trainer from the history of the series, “Red”.</p>



<p>Whether it’s based on the original game’s story or a completely fresh take remains to be seen.</p>



<p>This obviously wouldn’t be the first live action Pokemon production after Detective Pikachu released in 2019. This would, though, be the first series in a live action environment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halloween-getting-unreal-engine-5-game-john-carpenter-involved/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Halloween is a beloved horror franchise and one of the classics. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halloween-unreal-engine-5-john-carpenter-boss-team-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN announced</a> that two games are in production for the Halloween franchise. They are being developed by Boss Team Games, which is responsible for creating the Evil Dead and Cobra Kai games.</p>
<p>At the moment, the details of what these Halloween games may entail are incredibly limited. Still, it has been confirmed that both are being made in conjunction with John Carpenter, the original creator of the 1978 classic.</p>
<p>What is known is that at least one of the games being made is being made in Unreal Engine 5, giving the game plenty of potential for realism and horrifying scares.</p>
<p>"As a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horror-legend-john-carpenter-just-wants-to-play-video-games-watch-basketball-and-eat-popsicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge gamer myself</a>, I'm thrilled to help bring Michael Myers to life again in this game, and my hope is to scare you silly," said John Carpenter, who is said to be "intimately involved" in developing this project.</p>
<p>From what we know, players will be able to relive iconic moments from the movies and play some of the classic characters from the franchise. While Boss Team Games is developing the games, they are also being developed in association with Compass International Pictures and Further Front to ensure they are close reminders of the movies.</p>
<p>It's becoming more common to see iconic horror movies become video games, such as Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, Alien, and more. Halloween is over 45 years old, and there have rarely been adaptations of this franchise that aren't movies. The franchise continues to grow, with the latest movie, Halloween Ends, being released in 2022.</p>
<p>The first and only video game released for the Halloween movies was a game released on the Atari 2600 by the development team Wizard Video. Around the same time, they also released a Texas Chainsaw Massacre video game.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean Michael Myers doesn't appear in other media. He is a very popular killer in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-team-reveal-2024-roadmap/">Dead by Daylight</a>, named "The Shape," and is one of the scarier killers that players can choose to play as.</p>
<p>"Everyone at Boss Team Games are huge fans of horror, and Halloween obviously holds a special place in the hearts of all horror fans. Getting to work with iconic characters like Michael Myers and build on John Carpenter's original vision is a dream come true," said Steve Harris, CEO of Boss Team Games.</p>
<p>They are also working alongside Malek Akkad, who was one of the original producers of the franchise and has continued to produce the most recent Halloween movies, too.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF71PqJrO0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released this week, Funko Fusion teased Five Nights at Freddy’s gameplay, featuring iconic characters like Freddy Fazbear and Foxy the Pirate.</p>



<p>The gameplay reveals iconic settings, security cameras, potential objectives, and many familiar faces. It also confirms that Freddy Fazbear and Foxy the Pirate will be playable characters. </p>



<p>The trailer description adds that fans will “play through a level inspired by the first FNAF game.” </p>

</p></figure>







<p>Although fans already knew that Five Nights at Freddy’s was coming to Funko Fusion, there have only been brief glimpses until now.</p>



<p>Developer 10:10 Games first announced its partnership with Funko two years ago, and Funko Fusion got its first teaser trailer in 2023. The game combines a wide variety of popular IP, from Back to the Future to Shaun of the Dead. </p>



<p>The new gameplay trailer marks yet another major collaboration for Five Nights at Freddy’s. Just last week, the Dead by Daylight team confirmed that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-x-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover-coming-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossover with Five Nights at Freddy’s</a> is coming sometime in 2025. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, FNAF fans can also look forward to the live-action movie sequel, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-updates-possibly-tease-october-filming-toy-bonnie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently teased Toy Bonnie</a> and corresponding animatronics should appear in the film.</p>



<p>Funko Fusion will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 13, 2024. It will arrive on PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch later on November 15, 2024.</p>

                <p>Alien: Romulus will contain a nod to the 2014 survival-horror game Alien: Isolation. Director Fede Alvarez said recently that the Creative Assembly game taught him a lot about horror, and he is honoring the game with a little Easter egg in Alien: Romulus.</p><p>"The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see a phone," he said on the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/alien-romulus-alien-isolation-easter-egg-emergency-phone/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inside Total Film podcast</a>.

When you see the phone, it's like: Brace for impact."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0XDEhP4MQs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x0XDEhP4MQs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alvarez went on to say Alien: Isolation was an experience that "made me see that Alien could truly be terrifying and done well [today]."</p><p>"I was like, 'Fuck, if I could do anything, I would love to do Alien and scare the audience again with that creature and those environments.' I was playing, and realizing how terrifying Alien could be if you take it back to that tone," he said.</p><p>Alien: Romulus releases on August 16. It bills itself as a film that takes the series "back to its roots." A team of space colonizers are scavenging from a derelict space station when they encounter the big, bad Xenomorph. The movie stars Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Spike Fearn, and Aileen Wu.</p><p>Ridley Scott, who directed the original Alien, is a producer on Alien: Romulus.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reka-release-date-and-award-winning-lead-writer-announced.951816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reka-release-date-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Emberstorm Entertainment and publisher Fireshine Games have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Reka&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, as well as the name of the project's award-winning lead writer.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Reka&nbsp;</em>on PC via Steam Early Access on September 12th, so it's safe to start thinking about how you want to lead your cozy cottagecore witchcraft life now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Mirror's Edge&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>writer Rhianna Pratchett will serve as the game's lead writer. Pratchett says that she's "never been one to shy away from the weird and wonderful", and that helping to create&nbsp;<em>Reka</em>'s story and world alongside the aforementioned studios has been "an absolute delight".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reka-early-access-release-date-cottage.jpg?itok=VPfVP35i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reka-early-access-release-date-cottage.jpg?itok=KnVDYvX6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We could all use our houses being a little more ambulatory from time to time.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Reka&nbsp;</em>is aiming to give you the experience of being a witch, only without all the pesky stake burnings and lake drownings (well, hopefully, anyway).</p>
<p>You'll play as the titular Reka, an apprentice to legendary witch Baba Jaga (also known as Baba Yaga in some parts of the world). Just like the witch of legend, you'll have access to your very own "chicken-legged cottage", which will provide a haven from an "unpredictable, sometimes dark world".</p>
<p>The game promises a "deep and diverging land" with several different biomes to explore, as well as full character creation that allows you to shape Reka in whatever image you desire.</p>
<p>If you want to see&nbsp;<em>Reka&nbsp;</em>in action and get a sense for what kind of game you're in for, you can check out one of the game's earlier teasers, which shows off the aforementioned "chicken-legged" house, right here.</p>

<p><em>Reka&nbsp;</em>will boast procedurally-generated landscapes, so no two players' games will look the same, and it'll also offer the ability to "discover and tame wildlife", with your animal companions either joining you on your adventures or waiting for you at home.</p>
<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Reka&nbsp;</em>ahead of its September release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1737870/REKA/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">right now on Steam</a>.

As is tradition with Square Enix games, a demo for <em>Visions of Mana </em>was released ahead of the game’s official August 29 release. That said, this <em>Visions of Mana </em>teaser plays by slightly different rules than most Square Enix demos. If you’re wondering if this action-RPG is right for you, then the demo will let you get a taste of the game’s world and combat mechanics.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,196805,196572" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Visions of Mana:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Visions-Mana-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CQ73WDH8/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/visions-of-manner-demo-guide-does-it-carry-over-1851618271&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CQ73WDH8" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/clVDQrSgeMQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/clVDQrSgeMQ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><h2 id="h15360"><a id=""></a><strong>What content is included in the <em>Visions of Mana </em>demo?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="e73c2e10913c301d94a9f9114d0b9e32" data-recommend-id="image://e73c2e10913c301d94a9f9114d0b9e32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The field of quests in the demo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The field of quests in the demo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e73c2e10913c301d94a9f9114d0b9e32" data-recommend-id="image://e73c2e10913c301d94a9f9114d0b9e32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The field of quests in the demo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After a brief cutscene, the <em>Visions of Mana </em>demo will start you and your party in a short, linear path through an icy field. This acts as a tutorial, and you’ll work your way through some basic platforming challenges as you familiarize yourself with the game’s mechanics.<br></p><p>Afterwards, the party will arrive in a wide open field, which introduces the Pikul mount for the party to ride on. This section features collectibles to find, side quests to complete, and even an optional battle arena against some relatively high level enemies. That said, none of these diversions are required to advance the story.</p><p>Finally, the demo includes a town where the party can purchase new equipment, take a few more side quests, and chat with some friendly NPCs. A handful of story events will occur here, which will eventually culminate in the party boarding a boat. After a prompt appears warning you that you’ve reached a point of no return, the party will face off against a Kraken boss battle. Once you defeat the naughty octopus, the demo will end with a few story sequences to conclude this chapter of the adventure.</p><h3 id="h15361"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is the Visions of Mana demo?</strong></h3><p>If you aim to clear absolutely everything the demo offers, it should take <strong>a little over two hours</strong>. If you skip past the open field section, you can probably cut the total runtime in half. It ultimately depends on how much you want to dig into the game’s mechanics, especially if you play with the options to customize your party.</p><h2 id="h15362"><a id=""></a><strong>Does progress from the Visions of Mana demo carry over to the full game?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9de3024379abc5b9938cc221fcd75f4c" data-recommend-id="image://9de3024379abc5b9938cc221fcd75f4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's Pikul, your mighty steed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's Pikul, your mighty steed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9de3024379abc5b9938cc221fcd75f4c" data-recommend-id="image://9de3024379abc5b9938cc221fcd75f4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's Pikul, your mighty steed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>No…for the most part</strong>. The demo begins shortly after the start of the game, so it doesn’t function the way that, say, the <em>Dragon Quest X</em> or <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> demos do. That said, <strong>if save data from the demo is present on your system when playing the full game, you can obtain three bonus weapons for Val (the game’s protagonist) once you reach Chapter 1</strong>. Note that these are common weapons that you can also obtain through standard play.<br></p><h3 id="h15363"><a id=""></a><strong>Do you need to beat the demo to get the bonus weapons in the full game?</strong></h3><p>No. There is no prompt to save the game upon completing the demo, so it doesn’t seem like your actual progress affects whether you qualify for the extra weapons.</p><h2 id="h15364"><a id=""></a><strong>What are some tips for the Visions of Mana demo?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="652a5ba67f6f33f9cab29254033d2dc5" data-recommend-id="image://652a5ba67f6f33f9cab29254033d2dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A strike!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A strike!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="652a5ba67f6f33f9cab29254033d2dc5" data-recommend-id="image://652a5ba67f6f33f9cab29254033d2dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A strike!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the demo for <em>Visions of Mana </em>isn’t hard, necessarily, you may need to take a few minutes to adjust to the game’s combat system. The <em>Mana </em>series typically places as much of an emphasis on its RPG systems as its combat. This means you’re rewarded for learning your active character’s combat mechanics, customizing your party members’ behavior in battle, and stopping the action to cast spells and use items.<br></p><p>Case in point: The protagonist Val starts as the <strong>Rune Knight </strong>class, which is the best damage dealer available in the demo. However, Val won’t really feel powerful until you unlock the <strong>Horizontal Slice </strong>skill, which unlocks a three-hit combo. To maximize your damage, wait for openings to attack, and then hold down the attack button to wallop enemies.</p><p>By upgrading your party’s Elemental Plots, you can also buff Val’s attack and crit stats by using spells and elemental enchantments. You don’t particularly have to worry about MP conservation in the demo, so go all out against tough enemies. Don’t neglect to use your Elemental Vessel by pressing R2 for some extra crowd control, and once your CS gauge in the bottom-left is charged, you can press L2 to unleash a devastating super move.</p><p>Finally, if you’re still having trouble, feel free to rush towards the town once you enter the open field area. You can purchase equipment upgrades that significantly increase your party’s power, and you’ll find side quests that will point you back to the open field. Or, if you’d rather save all this questing for the full game, you can skip ahead and experience the Kraken battle. The choice is yours.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/retrorealms-halloween-and-ash-vs-evil-dead-announced-for-october-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao3sM3nEhcI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Boss Team Games announced RetroRealms: Halloween and Ash vs Evil Dead with a release date set for October 18, 2024.</p>



<p>RetroRealms turns both iconic properties into a 16-bit platformer. Although fans must purchase each game separately, buying both will allow players “to crossover worlds.”</p>



<p>Today’s trailer also reveals the pre-order bonuses. Pre-orders are available now, and fans who invest will receive DLC characters. Those include Laurie Strode for Halloween, as well as Kelly Maxwell for Ash vs Evil Dead.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Today’s announcement closely follows yesterday’s reveal from Boss Team Games. The team confirmed it is working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/boss-team-games-working-on-titles-based-on-halloween-john-carpenter-involved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two titles based on Halloween</a>, and it seems RetroRealms was the undisclosed game from earlier this week.</p>



<p>While RetroRealms already has a trailer, Boss Team Games’ other Halloween game is built in Unreal Engine 5 and still “in early development.” </p>



<p>That second project based on the original Halloween will also “relive moments from the film.” Its development will also involve John Carpenter, Compass International Pictures, and Further Front.</p>



<p>Boss Team Games previously published Evil Dead: The Game, an asymmetrical multiplayer game based on the hit IP that launched in 2022. Evil Dead: The Game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-dead-content-stopped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended its content cycle</a> late last year.</p>



<p>RetroRealms: Halloween and Ash vs Evil Dead will be available on PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, and current or last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>
