I think games are generally quite bad at acknowledging that they are things that are made by people. These people tend to have conversations about ideas, which turn into implementing those ideas, and sometimes these ideas are abandoned. We've all enjoyed a deleted scene in the extras of a DVD, yet the cutting room floor does not seem to be a thing for most games, at least not publicly. Which is why the new B-Sides DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dystopika">Dystopika</a>, a chill cyberpunk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city builder</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/make-the-night-city-of-your-dreams-with-this-cyberpunk-city-sandbox-builder">quite liked</a> by some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-dystopika-you-are-the-chill-landscaper-of-a-vast-cyberpunk-city-and-it-is-exactly-my-cup-of-noodles">former RPSers</a>.
</p>
<p>
Developer Voids Within explain in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2379910/view/538871739033059922?l=english">Steam post</a> that, "like the B-sides of a record, this DLC contains unreleased experiments and concepts that were previously cut at the sketchbook or concept art phase which have now been fully realized as new props and districts." So, less of a deleted scene, and more of an alternate cut, but I'm liking their musical metaphor too.

<p>
In terms of what's included, for starters there's a new district called Rustport. This, you will not be surprised to hear, looks like quite a reddy orange locale, so at least it lives up to its name. There's a new megastructure called Port Terra which looks like two Beyblades stacked on top of each other. You'll also find a new utility district, Scaffolding, again a place that looks like it lives up to its name. Aside from that, there's more than 20 new props, like a couple of monorail styles and airships, a bunch more hologram projections, and 12 new C-ville and Labber's Row signage variations.
</p><p>
This DLC also coincides with a new update, bringing in version 1.7.0 of the game. Included in this are a couple of new tools, the first being a density brush that lets you paint up or paint down smaller procedural buildings. The other tool is literally called the "Nothing" cursor. 
</p>
<p>
"That’s right, a tool that does nothing!" the devs explain. "Admire and navigate your city without those pesky building previews. The cursor tool can be found next to the Destroy tool in the toolbar." And there's also a new prop, a hologram wall emitter, which "allows placement on walls and angled surfaces for more versatile placement of holograms." Not to mention there's a bunch of quality of life improvements and bug fixes - you can take a full gander of the patch notes right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2379910/view/538871739033059914">here</a>.

<p>Ahead of Season 1’s launch for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the complete patch notes have been released. In it, details regarding new maps, weapons, modes, adjustments, and several bug fixes have been addressed.</p>



<p>Released in November, Black Ops 7 is the latest in the iconic FPS series. While it hasn’t reached the heights of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successors or rivals like Battlefield 6</a>, it’s still growing. With Season 1, the shooter is going all out with new additions and fixing several elements after fan feedback. </p>



<p>In Season 1, new maps for Zombies and Multiplayer are available and will be released throughout the season. The biggest fixes come to the Ricochet Anti-Cheat system and bullet penetration, which were heavily mentioned by fans after release. In addition, weapons like the NX Ravager and Ballistic Knife can be secured via new challenges. On top of all that, many bug fixes and adjustments have been made to the UI and gameplay. </p>

    <article>
      <p>Earlier today, Humble followed in the hoofprints of <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>Steam</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>Epic</u></a> by yanking bafflingly controversial art game <em>Horses </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too?ref=aftermath.site"><u>from its digital shelves</u></a> – in this case after the storefront had already made it available for purchase. Now, mere hours later, Humble has relisted <em>Horses</em>.</p><p>IGN’s Rebekah Valentine <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3m74exeicds2c?ref=aftermath.site"><u>broke the news</u></a>, which was immediately met with a collective “Huh.” Aftermath reached out to Humble for more information but did not receive a reply as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to Aftermath, Santa Ragione co-founder and director Pietro Righi Riva said that Humble temporarily pulled <em>Horses </em>to reevaluate it, but found no reason to set that decision in stone.</p><p>"In short, their team saw the press coverage and temporarily delisted <em>Horses </em>to reevaluate it," Riva said. "After a full review they determined that while the content is heavy, nothing in the game warrants removal from their store."</p><p>"We are grateful to Humble for having reconsidered and for taking the time to check out the game, although I wish they had informed us that this process was ongoing!" he added. "We are happy that it has been resolved with the game being back on the store, and we wish Steam and Epic would also reconsider their stance based on the actual game contents."</p><p><em>Horses</em>, which contains censored nudity and adult themes like sexual assault and slavery, remains banned on Steam and Epic. This despite the fact that it is far tamer than many widely distributed films and on level even with some popular games. Santa Ragione, the award-winning indie studio behind <em>Horses</em>, has categorized this sudden lack of access to PC gaming’s largest consumer bases as <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an existential threat</u></a> and railed against what it describes as “preemptive censorship.” </p><p>Meanwhile, let’s have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jessenorris.xboxera.com/post/3m73zbtxusc2v?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a quick look at what else Steam is stocking these days</u></a> (warning: <strong>NSFW</strong>). Phew, no double standards here.</p><p><em>Horses </em>can be purchased on <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Itch</u></a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses?ref=aftermath.site"><u>GOG</u></a>, and now, once again, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Humble</u></a>.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><div><p>Horror Game Horses Removed From Epic Games Store, Too</p><p>Santa Ragione said Horses is now banned from both Steam and Epic Games Store, but available on GOG.</p><p><span>Nicole Carpenter</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/octopath-traveler-0-everything-we-know/</link>
            <guid>1372174</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Though not a new Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest game, the first two Octopath Traveler games established the series as an important one for JRPG fans to pay attention to. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-eights-great/">Octopath Traveler</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">Octopath Traveler II</a>, could easily be considered two of the best JRPGs to be released in the last decade. Now, Square Enix has continued the series with a prequel for the third installment, with Octopath Traveler 0. Here's everything we know about the turn-based prequel.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">first announced back in July 2025</a>. Its reveal trailer was included as part of Nintendo's Partner Showcase Direct in July, and its release date of December 4, 2025, was announced alongside its initial reveal. Revealing the project and announcing the release date all in one, approximately five months ahead of said release date, was a clear sign from the jump that this game was nearly finished and would not miss its release date from delays, which is exactly what happened.</p>



<p>A prologue demo was also released on November 11, which allows you to play the opening three hours of the game, with your progress carrying over into the full version, should you decide to purchase it after playing the demo. </p>



<p>The standard edition of the game costs $49.99, with the deluxe edition listed at $59.99. Pre-ordering either edition gets you the Travel Provisions downloadable content, which is essentially a bundle of in-game items that you start the game with to give you a leg-up without having to grind for them in the story. The Travel Provisions for pre-ordering either the standard or deluxe edition are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Healing Grape (M) x5</li>



<li>Inspiriting Plum (M) x5</li>



<li>Revitalizing Jam x2</li>



<li>Icewind Mastery</li>
</ul>



<p>If you pre-order the deluxe edition, not only do you get the items listed above, but you also get:</p>



<ul>
<li>Three Action Skills: Triple Strike Mastery, SP Saver Mastery, Extra JP Mastery</li>



<li>8 Types of Nuts (M): Fortifying Nut (M), Magic Nut (M), Tough Nut (M), Resistant Nut (M), Light Nut (M), Critical Nut (M), Sharp Nut (M), Slippery Nut (M)</li>



<li>Festive Town Decorations: Table with roasted chicken, Festive Arch, Large Festive Arch, Festive Flag, Grand Vase</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, the deluxe edition also gets you a digital art book. There's also a massive collector's edition that is <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/octopath-traveler-0">available exclusively from the Square Enix store</a> for $229.99, which includes everything listed above, along with, per the Square Enix store listing, "<em>a physical replica of the in-game key item, the Ring of the Flamebringer; an original-design deck of playing cards; a set of three 8-sided metal dice; a game mat for multiplayer fun; a specially edited art booklet; and an arrangement music CD, available here ahead of its market-wide release.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Like the first two Octopath Traveler games before it, Octopath Traveler 0 is a turn-based JRPG presented in an HD-2D visual style, which blends 2D sprites with 3D environments. It's pixel-art based, and fans of the first two games would have no issue recognizing a screenshot from the game as an Octopath Traveler title.</p>



<p>Set within the fictional continent of Orsterra, unlike the first two games, which feature eight protagonists with their own individual stories, Octopath Traveler 0 focuses on a single protagonist created by the player. After customizing your appearance, voice, Job, and other unique aspects of your character, the journey begins in your hometown of Wishvale, which is tragically burned down by Hermania the witch, Tytos the hero, and Auguste the playwright at the beginning of the game.</p>



<p>It's then up to you to restore Wishvale and take revenge on the three villains who brought your home to ashes.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The tactical turn-based battles will be familiar to players, though there are a few significant changes like evolving from four characters in a battle to eight, giving you more opportunity to mix and match the jobs, action skills, and abilities at your disposal when in a fight. The game also introduces Ultimate Techniques, which you'll learn as the story progresses and allows you to deliver a powerful blow to your enemies in battles, particularly if you wait until your available Ultimate Technique is powered up to its level three maximum.</p>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 also features a new branch of gameplay with the restoration of Wishvale. You'll get to manage elements of Wishvale's rebuild by establishing different facilities and customizing them. Rebuilding Wishvale and upgrading the town's facilities also unlocks key features to the gameplay and provides a mix of things to do in between your adventuring.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>As an HD-2D game with a pixel-art design, Octopath Traveler 0 is by no means a demanding game for any platform.</p>



<p>Here are the official technical specifications from the game's Steam page:</p>



<p><strong><em>Minimum:</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 11 64-bit</li>



<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 2300X / Intel Core i3-8100</li>

            <guid>1372171</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new free mod for <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-ivs-story-is-better-than-gta-vs-1690387521"><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></a> breathes fresh life into the early PS3-era open-world game and its aging visuals, making the dated blockbuster look almost as impressive as some modern releases.</p> <p>Rockstar’s<em> Grand Theft Auto IV</em> launched on Xbox 360, PS3, and (eventually) PC all the way back in 2008. While the console versions were great and are fondly remembered to this day by fans, the PC release was a mess that was often cited as one of the worst AAA ports of that era. <a href="https://kotaku.com/years-later-rockstar-releases-new-pc-patch-for-gta-iv-1789523135">But thanks to some official updates</a> and the hard work of fan modders,<em> GTA IV</em> is very playable on PC in 2025. It even runs well on Steam Deck. And a newly released path tracing mod makes the nearly two-decade-old crime simulator look incredible on a sufficiently powerful computer.</p> <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d">Created by modder Xoxor4d</a>, GTA4 RTX Remix is a mod that adds gorgeous path-traced lighting to the game via Nvidia’s RTX Remix tech. This mod doesn’t change any textures or swap in any higher-res assets. This is still mostly <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> from 2008. But now every light source, like headlights and the sun, reacts more naturally with the objects and environments around them.</p>

 <p>What this mod pulls off without changing any geometry or textures is impressive and, at times, near-photorealistic, <a href="https://youtu.be/vGxPdcMQfwg">as seen in this video</a> that was released when the mod was still locked behind a paywall. And it’s especially impressive when compared side-by-side to the OG game.</p>

  <p>GTA4 RTX Remix is a great example of how realistic, advanced lighting can make even older games look far more impressive. To me, this is the tech I want to see game developers and console makers focusing on as the next big thing. I don’t need 8K resolution or 240 FPS. I want accurate shadows and light bouncing off surfaces naturally. <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-hl-ray-tracing-rt-mod-valve-pc-mod-download-1850150600">As seen in <em>Half-Life</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-mods-modder-max-payne-swat-portal-pc-1849884871">other older games</a>, this kind of tech can make games look truly next-gen.</p>

 <p>Technically, GTA4 RTX Remix has been floating around online for a few months now, but it was only available to folks who subscribed to the mod creator’s Patreon page. However, last week, after it had been thoroughly tested, the mod was made public for all to download and enjoy for free. You can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/gta4-rtx">Xoxor4d’s GitHub page</a>, where the modder has instructions on how to install the mod and how to make it work with the popular <em>GTA IV</em> mod Fusion Fix.</p> <p>While it ain’t perfect, Nico’s head is far too shiny, for example, I still think anyone wanting to replay <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em> in 2025 should get this mod and Fusion Fix working together to experience the best version of the game. Who needs Rockstar to remaster <em>GTA IV</em> when fans are doing it already and for free? Just be prepared for some FPS drops if you are playing on an older PC or don’t use DLSS.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/</link>
            <guid>1372165</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Micron is completely shutting down its consumer brand Crucial, and is ending the line of budget-friendly RAM and solid-state drives (SSDs). </p>



<p>Announced on Wednesday, Micron said that the growth of AI has led to this “difficult decision”.</p>



<p><strong>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,” </strong>Micron EVP Sumit Sadana said in the media release.<strong> “Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.”</strong></p>



<p>Sadana continued to thank the “passionate community of consumers” the Crucial brand has had over the last 29 years.</p>



<p><strong>“This decision reflects Micron’s commitment to its ongoing portfolio transformation and the resulting alignment of its business to secular, profitable growth vectors in memory and storage,”</strong> the company added. <strong>“By concentrating on core enterprise and commercial segments, Micron aims to improve long-term business performance and create value for strategic customers as well as stakeholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Micron says Crucial shipments will continue until the end of February 2026, and they will work with partners and customers to provide warranty service. </p>



<p>The decision to end the entry-level Crucial brand comes at a time when AI and data center growth continue to harm the consumer sector. Because of larger companies buying up all the supply, consumer RAM <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices have even risen by 250%</a> and beyond across different brands. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/moba-project-zeta-announces-signups-are-open-for-final-closed-beta</link>
            <guid>1372162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Try your hand at a five-team race for dominance.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming multiteam MOBA game Project ZETA announced today that signups are open for its next beta test, which will begin on Steam on December 12. This final closed beta will be the last chance to jump in early before the game goes public, and the developers have asked for opinionated players to help shape its future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/1-zeta-shot-010-bi-lb-1764716012578.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not already familiar with Project ZETA, we can catch you up to speed. Developed by Nirvanana, a team built of former Eternal Return devs, it mixes up the traditional MOBA formula in two key ways. First, instead of the standard of having two teams go head-to-head, it pits five teams against each other at the same time in a race to capture Prisms, the game’s most precious resource. There are multiple ways to get Prisms, giving each team the opportunity to follow different paths to victory. And second, it uses a third-person camera rather than an isometric one, making combat more dynamic and action-focused.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That combat is PvPvE, with monsters and bosses populating the map. Defeating monsters will score you XP and shards, which can upgrade your abilities and provide buffs to your stats, cooldowns, and more. Defeating bosses gets you all of that plus Prisms. However, just picking up a Prism isn’t enough, you need to return it to the center of the map in order for it to actually count toward your score.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/2-zeta-shot-020-bi-lb-1764716056984.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where the PvP comes in. Competing teams can ambush you on your way to deposit your Prisms and steal them from you. And that looming threat constantly affects the strategy your team chooses. Do you blitz bosses and try to rush their Prisms to the center of the map to win quickly? Do you bide your time, taking down monsters to scale your team's power and enter the next fight better prepared? Or do you lie in wait near the center of the map to pounce on opposing teams and take their Prisms after they’ve already done the work for you?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/3-zeta-shot-030-bi-lb-1764716093527.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">These are all viable strategies, but the reality is within one match you’ll jump between all three. In Project ZETA, strategies shift dynamically from one moment to the next. With five teams roaming the Aran Plateau, improvisation matters most. Focus too much on one adversary and another might stab you in the back, or worse, run up the score to take a commanding lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your strategy will also be driven by the heroes your team members choose. There are currently 13 heroes, with more to be revealed in the future, and they’re grouped into four categories: Fighter, Marksman, Assassin, and Mage. Each hero has unique abilities that can synergize with other heroes, some of which can trigger devastating multikills if you pull them off at the right time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/7-zeta-shot-090-bi-lb-1764782232839.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been six months since Project ZETA’s second closed beta, and a lot has changed in that time. In fact, it’s been the period with the biggest advancements in the game to date. There are two new heroes, reworked visuals and abilities for most heroes, new game-changing equipables, revamped environments, simplified Prism scoring, team respawn fixes, and lots more, all based on player feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final beta test will offer another chance to provide more feedback and further enhance the game. Anyone in North America or Europe can sign up for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778110/?utm_source=na&amp;utm_campaign=ign&amp;utm_medium=cbt3&amp;utm_content=NAign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>on Steam</u></a>, and both regions will have devoted servers running on two weekends: the first will be December 12–14, and the second will be December 19–21. For those who can’t stop playing, there will also be a custom game server that will stay live for the entirety of the beta, from December 12–21.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/6-zeta-shot-070-bi-lb-1764782127541.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Project ZETA is also available to wishlist on Steam, and if you want the latest info and updates, you can join the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/zetathegame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Discord server</a>, follow on <a href="https://x.com/ZETAtheGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zetathegame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Facebook</a>, or check out its <a href="https://zeta.krafton.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">official website</a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/moba-project-zeta-announces-signups-are-open-for-final-closed-beta]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Kalshi’s CEO is bullish on the future of prediction market betting to solve disagreements for people, or at least make him very, very rich. What if every outcome in your life could be turned into a way to win or lose money? Imagine your very existence has been gamified into a gambling roguelike. “The long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion,” Tarek Mansour said at last month’s <a href="https://www.citadelsecurities.com/news-and-insights/kalshi-founders-tarek-mansour-luana-lopes-lara-on-turning-events-into-assets/?series=future-of-global-markets-2025-conference">Citadel Securities conference</a>.</p> <p>What sounds like a loading screen <a href="https://kotaku.com/gen-ai-fps-tom-clancy-shooter-hyperwrite-2000638861">from<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> was enough to make investors jump at the opportunity to turn angry Reddit threads into stock tickers you can gamble on. Kalshi recently raised $1 billion in its latest funding round this week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/prediction-market-kalshi-hits-11-billion-valuation-in-new-funding-round-c4b1ddfe?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdK-C0DhBc1ROkTdmdjauO7NE1xfoRnplk7FG1xKlaVPgwq1j6G1W_GWZ8c32U%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69309f9c&amp;gaa_sig=hKp-ZWblR1czvzvZi6BU2jUgxKi7W5LCwBBoCgom6lbVg_ldgoo9zy88xGYY8empWbRhMBInY0rli8I8qQBvIQ%3D%3D">leading to an $11 billion valuation</a>. What are investors so pumped about? Here’s the pitch Mansour <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/moreperfectunion.bsky.social/post/3m747g22dcc2o">gave in November</a> on stage with co-founder Luana Lopes Lara:</p>

 <blockquote><p>[Prediction markets are] pretty much already close to a $100 billion a year asset class. It’s pretty easy to imagine it 10x from here. We haven’t even started. It’s been a year. I think a very large number of people care, much larger than traditional markets, and I think retail as a pie has just been growing in the U.S. and I think it’s going to keep growing–it’s growing in the stock market, it’s growing outside the stock market.</p> <p>The long term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference of opinion. And I think if you do build a general purpose exchange that can resolve differences of opinions on anything the [total addressable market] is quite massive, quite a bit bigger than the current TAM of the stock market.</p> <p>Putting aside the retail trading and the institutional trading product there’s sort of this separate product which is we are living in a world where we have an abundance of information but there’s a lot of noise and we don’t really understand what’s real from what’s not and prediction markets are an antidote to that, they do a very good job of surfacing information and distilling truth to people.</p></blockquote>   <p>Mansour’s prediction market, i.e. opinion polls turned into casinos, was established back in 2018. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468">Like rivals such as Polymarket</a>, It’s pitched as a sophisticated tool for hedging risk. Picture some big world event like a war or an election. No one knows the outcome or what it might mean for their business so they trade bets to reduce the chance of losing a ton of money.</p>

 <p>I’m not going to weigh in on whether that makes any sense because that’s not what Mansour is saying is going to make Kalshi go 10X. The real moonshot is being able to take the popularity of betting on stocks with apps like Robinhood or sports with Draft Kings, and apply it to the totality of life. Every outcome, not just one in the market or a football game, will be an opportunity for people to gamble, ahem, I mean hedge risk.</p>

 <p>It all feels very Sam Bankman-Fried-coded. Remember <a href="https://kotaku.com/riot-games-ftx-cryptocurrency-exchange-sponsorship-sue-1849909204">that big FTX crypto debacle</a> from the wunderkind that was also making grand pronouncements on stage at conferences just before it all went belly up? Headlines <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/polymarket-and-kalshi-ceos-say-theyre-changing-the-world/">like this</a> about Kalshi and Polymarket don’t drive confidence. Where’s the prediction market for betting against prediction markets?</p>

 <p>If the post-covid era has taught us anything about the current state of the distraction economy, it’s that we love finding new ways to waste time and money on our phones. I don’t actually think most people want to treat break room debates or dinner table arguments like betting on horse racing. Maybe if it was more like <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>.</p> <p>But I think Mansour does and the people prepared to give his company billions do and that’s all it takes for bad things to happen.</p>

                <p>The dream of <a href="https://skyblivion.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skyblivion</a> goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/" data-ref-id="5000-92151">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's</a> engine to fully recreate and re-imagine <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion</a>. However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yC6W0htYBOc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line.</p><p>When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">remaster as a "win-win" for the community</a>. In recognition for their work, Bethesda gave <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-gave-oblivion-remastered-keys-to-the-entire-skyblivion-remake-team/1100-6531035/" data-ref-id="1100-6531035">copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion</a> mod team.</p><p>However, it hasn't been entirely harmonious for team Skyblivion. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-is-still-aiming-for-2025-even-as-former-dev-calls-it-a-massive-mistake/1100-6534591/" data-ref-id="1100-6534591">a former member of the team</a> spoke out against efforts to rush the mod out before it's ready. As impressive as Skyblivion is, no one is getting paid for it, and the ex-team member is against the crunch-time mindset that was making things more difficult.</p><p>For now, it looks like Skyblivion is worth the wait. Although Bethesda does offer some support for mods on consoles, it will only be available on PC. Skyblivion will also require players to own both Elder Scrolls 5 and Elder Scrolls 4 in order to work.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/madcap-platformer-antonblast-is-getting-one-final-update-this-month</link>
            <guid>1372117</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/summitsphere.com/post/3m73xolgge22w">Summitsphere</a> is giving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/antonblast">Antonblast</a> fans one last hurrah, one year after the game first launched on PC. And it's a content-filled update befittingly titled 'THE END'.</p>
<p>On <strong>18th December 2025</strong>, The End is bringing four brand new bosses, a boss rush, multiple new game modes (including Hard Mode), new music, and new spray cans, among lots of other little additions coming to the 2024 platformer, which is heavily inspired by the <strong>Wario Land</strong> series.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the specifics coming with The End in just a few weeks, courtesy of Antonblast's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is it. THE END of ANTONBLAST will be the game's final content update, bringing the remaining content promised to our Kickstarter backers, as well as a plethora of <strong>BRAND NEW</strong> content!</p>
<p><strong>FEATURING</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE DEMON CORP<br></strong>This band of bastards has been rehearsing each day for the Big Tournament, and now it's their time to shine. That's right, <strong>FOUR</strong> new (smaller-scale!) boss fights against each member of the Demon Corp. Claim your Prize Star by defeating each of them and be granted early access into their big show!<br>
<strong><br>
THE BIG TOURNAMENT: THE BOSS RUSH<br></strong>Danton has been laboring over day and night and has at last fulfilled his contract to bring the Big Tournament to life! Earn your Battle Pass and prepare to face <em>ANTONBLAST</em>'s most grueling challenge: Face against the game's <strong>nine</strong> major boss fights without facing a knock-out and claim your title of Tournament Champion! There is a big cash prize in it for the winner, too.<br>
<strong><br>
THE LIME TRIALS<br></strong>The mysterious <strong>Lime Trials</strong> make their appearance. Defeat the big baddie of each wing of Brulo's Casino, and you will be granted access to a new kind of timed challenge: Collect all Limes in the room before time runs out to recover the <strong>Souvenir Lime</strong>! And, if you feel like showing off after already collecting the Souvenir Lime, claim cash prizes especially if you beat your best time!</p>
<p><strong>NEW GAME MODES<br></strong>As promised to our supporters, our <strong>Hard Mode</strong> and <strong>Stage Rush Mode</strong> will finally make their appearance. In <strong>Hard Mode</strong>, face the challenges of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> with little extra help and stricter, harder stages and bosses. Satan's troops are a little more prepared this time! In <strong>Stage Rush</strong>, blast through the twelve stages and eight bosses of the Adventure campaign as fast as you can! <strong>Hard Mode</strong> will automatically unlock for any players who have already cleared the first stage in game; <strong>Stage Rush</strong> will automatically unlock for any players who have defeated the Final Boss. But, could there be more...?</p>
<p><strong>DANTON<br></strong>Now that Danton's work around the Casino is mostly finished, you will find him perusing the area. Feel free to talk to him, he's <em>really</em> happy about it!<br>
<strong><br>
NEW SOUNDTRACK AND SOUND WORK</strong><br>
Our updated <em>ANTONBLAST Soundtrack</em> will be <em>wholly replacing</em> the existing tracks in the game. Furthermore, we have extensively touched up our sound design and have totally rebalanced and adjusted the soundscape of the game to prevent audio clipping and other nasty artifacts. The result is the game won't be as ear-piercingly loud, meaning you can get a much cleaner view (hearing?) of what is actually going on at any given moment in the game and don't need to turn the audio down so low. It is a much more pleasing experience on everyone's ears. We have also shifted some sounds around, but you'll have to play the game to hear the difference!<br>
<strong><br>
NEW TRINKETS</strong><br>
Brulo's Shop has been restocked with various new items, such as the <strong>Virtual Visor</strong>, <strong>Game Brick</strong> and <strong>Pet Paint</strong> (harmless, non-toxic). Experience Anton and Annie's Adventure under... a different light.<br>
<strong><br>
NEW SPRAY CANS<br></strong><strong>SIXTEEN</strong> new Spray Cans have been added, bringing the total to <em><strong>110</strong></em>. Most will be hidden, strewn around Brulo's Casino and Peanut Park, so be sure to be look around carefully!<br>
<strong><br>
NEW ACHIEVEMENTS</strong><br>
<strong>FOUR</strong> new achievements for you to figure out and, well, achieve! Discover the secrets of Peanut Park and engage with the new stages and boss fights and (re-)claim your Perfect title on <em>ANTONBLAST</em>!<br>
<strong><br>
NEW LANGUAGE SUPPORT</strong><br>
That's right, you will be able to experience the glorious text and interface of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> in a total of <strong>EIGHT</strong> languages: <strong>English</strong>, <strong>French</strong>, <strong>German</strong>, <strong>Spanish</strong>, <strong>Italian</strong>, <strong>Portuguese</strong>, <strong>Latin-American Spanish</strong> and <strong>Brazillian Portuguese</strong>. We hope our more international Blasters appreciate and enjoy the work our community localizers have put into the game!<br>
<strong><br>
LOTS OF BUG FIXES</strong><br>
I mean, I hope you're not surprised about it! The team has put TREMENDOUS work into polishing up <em>ANTONBLAST</em> into being the best game ever. We hope it reached that standard now!<br>
<strong><br>
AND MORE!<br></strong>There is a LOT more that you will see that we have not talked about here. It will all be made clear... in THE END.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a <em>lot</em> for an ending, isn't it? Any excuse to go back to Antonblast, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/antonblast">we loved</a> back when it launched on Switch last year. And it's received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/antonblast-receives-update-on-switch-with-performance-boost-to-60fps">performance boost since launch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Horses, a disturbing indie horror game, was set to launch yesterday on several digital storefronts, but in the past week, many of those retailers have refused to list it, including Steam, the Epic Games Store, and most recently, the Humble Store. It's a move that has sparked controversy online, with many decrying it as unjust censorship of the game’s adult themes. But what, exactly, is in this game that makes it so offensive? Each platform has released its own statement, but<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">&nbsp;in an interview with&nbsp;IGN</a>, Pietro Righi Riva, co-founder of Horses developer Santa Ragione (which previously created titles like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/09/15/saturnalia-an-indie-horror-with-an-art-style-you-have-to-see-captures-october-release">Saturnalia</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/wheels_of_aurelia/b/pc/archive/2016/10/05/on-the-road-again-and-again.aspx">Wheels of Aurelia</a>), explained what he thinks happened.</p><p>The titular horses are not, in fact horses – the game's primary disturbing element is that the farm the player visits has a population of enslaved, nude humans wearing horse masks. The controversy is not solely related to the nudity or enslavement, but about a character's young daughter and her proximity to the "horses."</p>

<p>"The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the ‘horses’ are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one,"<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">&nbsp;Riva told&nbsp;IGN</a>. "What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag."&nbsp;</p><p>Horses was rejected by Steam when it was submitted for review in 2023. Riva claims Steam never gave him a specific moment to explain the rejection, but the rejection message included a line that read, "Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor." Assuming the issue was with the daughter character, they raised her age.</p>



<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7cb19293-6c29-4c15-a9e1-579641aea176" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.none_original_image" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

<p>"We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of Horses, works much better when delivered by an older character," Riva's statement continues. Despite the adjustment, Steam has not changed course. Reportedly, even after repeated contact between Riva and various representatives at Steam, he hasn't even received confirmation of what scene or element of the game caused the ban in the first place.</p><p>Yesterday, the ban expanded when the Epic Games Store, which had been set to sell Horses, reversed course at the last minute. Despite reportedly approving the game earlier in the year, the game was rejected 24 hours before its planned launch. The game&nbsp;<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">has a store page and everything</a>, and at the time of writing, Horses is still listed as "coming soon." Developer Santa Ragione received the following statement from the Epic Games Store, and a representative from Epic later confirmed to&nbsp;IGN that the statement was accurate:</p><p>We are unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies. The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which “contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.” The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology). You have some options on how to move forward: 1. You can make updates to your product to ensure compliance and resubmit it for review. 2. If you believe we made a mistake, you also have the ability to appeal this decision. You can appeal by replying to this email or creating a private discussion on our Developer Support site. Select "Epic Games Store" as the topic. 3. You cannot change the title or content to repurpose it for another game. If you choose not to move forward, we'll refund your submission fee for this product.</p><p>Riva has since claimed that the ban is more likely due to the increased media attention following the news that Steam would not be listing the game, but Epic has not confirmed this fact. Riva has also said that the studio filled out its own IARC questionnaire – a form which evaluates the rating of your game for PEGI, ESRB, and other video game content rating authorities – and unlike Epic's AO rating, Santa Ragione saw its game marked as rated M for Mature.</p><p>As of today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">IGN&nbsp;reports the Humble Store has banned the game as well</a>, and accessing the link the game was previously listed at,&nbsp;<a href="http://humblebundle.com/store/horses">humblebundle.com/store/horses</a>, prompts an error message in the right corner of the screen that reads, "HORSES is no longer available for purchase."&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/controversial-horror-game-horses-gets-kicked-off-the-humble-store-one-day-after-launch-but-its-also-become-the-best-selling-new-release-on-gog/">PC Gamer reports that a representative from Santa Ragione confirmed the game's removal</a>, but at the time of writing, has not received a response from Humble.</p><p><a href="https://www.horses.wtf/index.html">Horses is still available on itch.io and GOG</a>. It probably goes without saying, but the game contains adult and potentially objectionable content, so proceed to those links with caution. It's currently one of the best-selling games on GOG, as its bans have shone a spotlight on it that it might not have otherwise received.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: IGN [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">2</a>], <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/controversial-horror-game-horses-gets-kicked-off-the-humble-store-one-day-after-launch-but-its-also-become-the-best-selling-new-release-on-gog/">PC Gamer</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/03/steam-the-epic-games-store-and-the-humble-store-refuse-to-sell-indie-horror-game-horses]]></content:encoded>

Now the company has taken that same haptic technology and incorporated it into a <a href="https://www.woojer.com/products/mat?srsltid=AfmBOoqvxTBIe161h8eqF7JGeJahgCy7sRaUNebBSMOLdenILvuaKjwN">new mattress topper called the Woojer Mat</a> that will let you feel those same vibrations across your entire body to make what you’re watching or playing feel more immersive. But the company claims that the Mat is also designed to reduce stress, relieve pain and tension, and improve the quality of your sleep.</p><p>The Woojer Mat is available now for $799 through the company’s online store, but is currently discounted to $699. It’s described as a mattress topper but unlike those memory foam pads that stay permanently atop your mattress and under your sheets, at 30-inches wide the Woojer Mat is narrower than even a twin-sized mattress and is instead designed to be unfolded and used only as needed. It’s not a permanent bedroom upgrade.</p><p>Underneath an outer layer of breathable fabric is thin padding embedded with six haptic transducers capable of producing low frequencies up to 250Hz. The mat connects to any device that’s compatible with headphones and speakers using Bluetooth, USB-C, or an analog audio cable, including your smartphone. If you want to continue to listen to a movie, song, or game while their audio is being turned into soothing vibrations, the mat can wirelessly connect to headphones or you can plug them into a built-in amplifier using a cable.</p><p>Connecting the Woojer Mat to its accompanying mobile app also provides access to a “rich library of dedicated vibroacoustic sessions designed for everything from back pain relief to deep relaxation and mental clarity.” If you want to use it without distractions, you can adjust volume and the intensity of the vibrations using a strip of buttons on the mat without reaching for your phone or other devices.</p><p>We haven’t tested the mat and can’t vouch for Woojer’s wellness claims. But like those elaborate chairs that provide an intense full-body massage experience or a white noise machine, the mat’s biggest benefit could be as sensory distraction so you temporarily forget mental stresses that leave you tense or unable to fall asleep.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/837482/woojer-haptic-wellness-mat-vibrations-bluetooth]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/ready-or-not">Ready or Not</a>,</em> a popular (and controversial) first-person tactical co-op shooter and SWAT simulator, is getting a free trial on consoles. The trial will feature full access to the game and will be available for the rest of 2025.</p> <p>On December 3, Void Interactive announced a new limited-time free trial for<em> Ready or Not.</em> The trial is available now on PlayStation 5 (with a PS Plus subscription), Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Once downloaded and installed, players will have access to the entirety of<em> Ready or Not,</em> including every mission. Players can enjoy the game for three hours before the trial ends. After that, all progress made in the trial can be carried over to the full game if players decide to purchase <em>Ready or Not.</em> This free taste will be available only on consoles and only until February 20, 2026.</p> <p>First released in 2021 on PC via Steam early access, <em>Ready or Not</em> has been mired in controversy over the years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-loses-publisher-days-after-devs-remind-fans-about-1848258819">The game lost its original publisher</a>, Team17, shortly before launch. The SWAT sim courted controversy over its subject matter, including a level set in a community college. <a href="https://kotaku.com/controversial-steam-best-seller-ready-or-not-is-an-unse-1848317351">When <em>Kotaku’s</em> own Ethan Gach played the game in 2022</a>, he felt it was unfinished and filled with juvenile humor and unsettling copaganda. I recently played it earlier this year, and while the action is tight and snappy, everything around it, including how it makes you treat every human you meet as a threat, is hard to ignore.</p> <p>In July, it found itself buried in a whole different mess of controversy <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-censorship-update-console-mod-uncensored-1851786403">when a patch was rolled out across PC</a>&nbsp;that made changes to some in-game assets, including the censorship of nudity. This was done to make the game easier to release on consoles. Fans who had been playing for years called foul and review-bombed <em>Ready or Not.</em> A modder rolled back the changes within an hour of the patch going live. Things have calmed down a lot since then, and the game has continued to receive frequent updates.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">Earlier this year, the game’s community manager was fired after joking about Charlie Kirk’s killing.&nbsp;</a></p>

                <p>Legendary game designer and programmer Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island) has revealed that one of his exciting-sounding upcoming projects has been canceled due in part to investors not coming to the table to fund the project.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Ars Technica</a>, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a "large, open-world-type RPG" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen.</p><p>"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," he said. "You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."</p><p>Gilbert previously described his new project as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monkey-island-creators-next-game-is-best-described-as-classic-zelda-meets-diablo-meets-thimbleweed-park" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park,"</a> and a lot of people were excited to find out what that might look like. Now it's not happening.</p><h2>"Horrible" publishing deals</h2><p>Gilbert said he pitched the project to people in the industry but discovered that "deals that publishers were offering were just horrible."</p><p>The kind of game Gilbert envisioned "isn't the big, hot item" so potential publishers didn't invest, he said. "The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this," he explained.</p><p>Gilbert funded 2017's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/thimbleweed-park-review/1900-6416642/" data-ref-id="1900-6416642">Thimbleweed Park</a> on Kickstarter, bringing in more than $600,000 USD. Gilbert also took private investment to complete the project.</p><p>The industry veteran observed that publishers today can be "very analytics-driven" and have devised their own formulas to "try to figure out how much money they could make." The result of this, Gilbert observed, is that publishers take on less risk, and in turn, games that do get made often look the same.</p><p>"You end up [getting] a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year’s games, because that makes some money," he said. "When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money ... I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness."</p><p>Gilbert's latest game is Death by Scrolling, an action game that was released at the end of October this year. Before that, he partnered with Devolver for Return to Monkey Island.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Getting 100% completion in a Metroid game--and metroidvania titles in general--is a satisfying achievement that's part of the genre's appeal. However, in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, there is unfortunately a way to pigeonhole yourself where collecting everything needed isn't possible. Now, the game will warn you about a point of no return, but it's still easy to make a regrettable decision. That's why GameSpot's reviewer for the first-person adventure, Steve Watts, advises players to make a copy of their main save in another save slot before entering the endgame.</p><p dir="ltr">Watts detailed the "confusing choice" that Nintendo and developer Retro Studios made in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>. "When I was ready to proceed to the endgame, I got the usual warnings about a point of no return, but I had figured I could always load an older save to go back and do more exploring to pick up power-ups that I missed," Watts wrote. "But the auto-save now has me locked into the final area with no such apparent option, and my regular save slot--the one that activates when Samus steps into a save station--has been overwritten with a Mission Complete, so loading it prompts me to start a new game."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The main menu does allow you to make a copy of a game in a different slot. If you want to proceed to the endgame to see how the story concludes, while allowing freedom to go back and explore, make sure that you either make a copy of your save or opt not to overwrite with a Mission Complete save. That said, there's always the possibility that Nintendo and Retro address this confusing issue with a future update for the Switch and Switch 2 game.</p><p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4 launches tomorrow, December 4. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-features-a-new-samus-aran-voice-actor/1100-6536668/">features a new voice actor for Samus Aran</a> with Erin Yvette replacing previous Metroid Prime mainstay Jennifer Hale. In addition, Krystle Martin provides the motion capture for the bounty hunter.

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has enjoyed an exceptional year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">becoming the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards</a>. Its cast--Ben Starr, Charlie Cox, and Jennifer English among them--earned major recognition in the show's performance categories, helping cement the game as one of the year's standout achievements. But even while celebrating this success, the cast has been discussing ways the awards could grow, especially when it comes to recognizing the full range of performance work that brings modern games to life.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-cast-calls-for-the-game-awards-to-add-a-motion-capture-category/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, cast members English, Shayla Nyx, Devora Wilde, and Aliona Baranova shared their hope that The Game Awards will eventually expand its performance categories. They explained that, while the nominations are an honor, the current categories overlook many essential performers.</p><p>"If I may, can I put my petition forward for why we need to have a motion capture category?" Baranova said. "It's been decades of actors going in, doing the mocap, and then someone else's voice is popped on top, and those mocap performers just disappear. I forgot that. Nobody knows about them.” Baranova, who worked as a motion capture director on Baldur's Gate 3, noted that this issue has persisted for years.</p><p>She added that recognition could also help audiences better understand the craft. "The audience doesn't know enough about this because there's not enough attention on it," she continued. "If we had an award category for mocap specifically, then studios would be encouraged to release that behind-the-scenes footage because people are desperate for it. Studios keep that a bit quiet because it gives away details on how they made the game."</p><p>Actor Charlie Cox echoed the sentiment last month, saying that although he's "thrilled" about his nomination, credit for his role in Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-actor-says-hes-truly-grateful-for-outpouring-of-support-after-charlie-cox-spoke-out/1100-6536509/" data-ref-id="1100-6536509">must be shared with motion capture performer Maxence Carzole</a>.</p><p>"It needs to happen," Baranova added. "I posted about it online the other day, and some people were questioning like, "How would we do it?'. I don't know, they can figure it out. We need to do it because there are these fantastic mocap performances going on."</p><p>Devora Wilde agreed, saying, "Yes, I was actually surprised about that for The Game Awards. But I think that's always been the case, hasn't it? It's just been 'performance in a game'."</p><p>The Game Awards will stream live from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on December 11, and in case you didn't know, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quick-reminder-you-can-vote-in-the-game-awards-now/1100-6536609/" data-ref-id="1100-6536609">you can also vote in the awards</a>.</p>
