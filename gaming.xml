            <p>The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> game - the first new instalment in over four years, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a> - is reportedly taking a leaf out of Evil Dead: Army of Darkness’ necronomicon by transporting the Doom Slayer back to a medieval world to presumably battle hellspawn. According to a new report, it’s subtitled The Dark Ages and we’ll get an official reveal next week.</p>

</div>
<p>That’s all according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/">Insider Gaming</a>, who claim that Doom: The Dark Ages has been in the works over at Id Software for over four years now. It’s also said to be the final name for the game previously known as Doom: Year Zero, mentioned on a document from 2020 that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">surfaced last year</a> as part of Microsoft’s accidental leak during their legal wrestle with the Federal Trade Commission around the Activision-Blizzard merger.</p>
<p>Insider Gaming claim that The Dark Ages - as the name implies - will be set in a “medieval-inspired Doom world”. Beyond that, we currently know very little - but I do like the idea of the Doom Slayer clashing his Crucible blade against the swords and armour of medieval minions. Of, y’know, ripping and tearing through them with a whole load of guns.</p>
<p>Rumours of a new Doom game have been swirling recently, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-doom-reveal-hinted-at-by-zenimax-trademark">Zenimax registered a trademark for “IDKFA”</a> - harking back to classic Doom cheat codes - and multiple outlets including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls">Eurogamer</a> and <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1789625937480364356">The Verge</a> reported that a nuDoom would appear during the Xbox Games Showcase at this year’s Summer Geoff Fest, which this latest report claims to have verified. That means we should see and hear more in just under two weeks, on Sunday June 9th.</p>

            <p>The director of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and CEO of developers Larian has revealed that the studio experienced crunch in order to get the sprawling Dungeons &amp; Dragons <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">CRPG</a> finished. While Swen Vincke admitted that “it would be a lie to say that we didn't [crunch]”, he insisted that it was less than on past Larian games such as Divinity, staff were paid for the overtime and it seemingly didn’t go as far as working late nights or weekends (for the most part, anyway).</p>

<p>Vincke made the comments during a Q&amp;A session at last week’s Digital Dragons developer conference, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/">GamesRadar</a> spotted, responding to a question about whether finishing Baldur’s Gate 3 had required the team to work excessive hours, as has become a common issue and criticism among <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-devs-deck-nine-accused-of-crunch-sexism-and-abusive-behaviour-amid-allegedly-toxic-culture">many</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-developers-allege-extensive-crunch-in-new-report">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-devs-backtrack-on-no-mandatory-crunch-stance-report-claims">studios</a> working on large blockbuster games.</p>
<p>According to Vincke, the crunch was “certainly less” than the studio had experienced before, but did occur when “things happen[ed] that we didn't foresee”. In an apparent relative improvement from the reportedly unpaid overtime of crunch in other companies, Vincke said that any overtime was paid, and that Larian’s building would typically be empty after 8pm latest. That minimising of overtime was helped by utilising Larian’s other studios <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larians-new-polish-studio-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-for-the-baldurs-gate-3-developers-upcoming-rpgs">around the world</a>, letting the developers as a whole work across 24 hours on the game without staff in any one office have to work late into the night. Staff seemingly only “very, very, very rarely” worked weekends in the office, too.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart-glow.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Larian Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Vincke’s read on the situation is that Larian didn’t “overly crunch” and that any overtime hours weren’t “as long as you would consider crunch”, while still acknowledging that there was at least “a bit” needed.</p>
<p>“To be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together,” Vincke concluded, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-crunch">plenty of evidence to the contrary</a>.</p>
<p>With the marked improvement on Baldur’s Gate 3 compared to their past games and what sounds like at least solid efforts to compensate staff and keep any overtime to a minimum, hopefully <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">Larian’s upcoming projects</a> - which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-dont-know-what-their-next-game-is-yet-but-it-wont-be-baldurs-gate-4-or-baldurs-gate-3-dlc">won’t include Baldur’s Gate 4 or DLC</a> - will see them find even more ways to cut crunch out entirely.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-review-in-progress.882357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A bunch of smarmy teenagers with ridiculous haircuts trying to escape the gloved clutches of an alien race of clowns is the kind of absurd and cheesy premise that makes perfect fodder for the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/friday-the-13th-the-game-review">Friday the 13th</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-review">Evil Dead</a>, and many more licensed games, the 1988 cult classic film Killer Klowns from Outer Space is the latest horror movie to try its hand at capturing our still-beating hearts with high-stakes murder sports. I need to spend some more time with Killer Klowns once its servers go live, but so far I can say that trying to either escape those deadly Klowns with my life or do my best to murder every angsty teenager in sight is already stupid fun no matter which side I was on.</p><p>Bucking the traditional asymmetrical structure slightly, each match pits seven hapless humans against three killers, as opposed to the usual four on one you see in most games that followed in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-review">Dead by Daylight</a>’s bloody footsteps. The Klowns are preposterously over the top, and run around turning humans into sacks of cotton candy with ray guns, hunting teens using a balloon hound on a leash, and mowing terrified victims down with an invisible car. It’s truly some of the zaniest stuff I’ve seen in a multiplayer game in a long time, and it never fails to make me laugh. I especially appreciate the little details, like how the Klowns’ shoes make a comical squeak when you walk, alerting everyone nearby to your presence and leaving cartoonish boot prints all over the floor. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Killer Klowns from Outer Space - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Admittedly, it’s nowhere near as much fun to play as a human because they’re just not as original or goofy as their pursuers. You mostly just sneak around searching for weapons, keys, gas canisters, and other things they need to mount an escape. However, getting away does have a novel twist, because none of the rescue options will allow more than three of the seven teens to leave at once. The boat can be repaired, but only fits three people, while the bridge exit is so rickety it could collapse after it’s been crossed by just two (if they’re not slow and careful as they’re crossing it). </p><p>In the roughly 18 hours I’ve played so far, this has led to several hilarious and tense interactions where someone on our team will panic and use up one of the exits to escape a dicey situation alone, leaving the remaining survivors in a lurch. Because there’s only four or five possible exits on each of the five maps, that makes evacuation for the remaining six humans a lot more difficult, and you don’t wanna be that guy. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Amusing minigames let humans stay engaged even after they’ve completed their role in a match.</p></div><p>It’s also cool that if a human gets killed or manages to get out of Dodge early on, they’re given the option to play a series of simple but amusing carnival-themed minigames, like whack-a-Klown or a Simon Says memorization game. By completing these, they’re able to help out their remaining teammates with items to improve their chances, like health, weapons, or even a keycard they might need to escape through one of the exits. I’ve never seen something like this implemented in this genre before, and it’s a great way to keep you engaged after you’ve completed your role in the match – especially if you’ve got survivor’s guilt after taking one of the exits for yourself and leaving the others to fend for themselves.</p><p>It’s because of things like this that, even though Killer Klowns borrows a whole heck of a lot from the asymmetrical horror games that came before it, it doesn’t feel like an immediately dull carbon copy with yet another cult horror movie’s skin draped over it. Aside from the macabre humor, though, the biggest shakeup is that, with a full 10-player match, there’s a whole lot more action happening around the map at all times. As a human, you might find yourself coordinating with a small group of survivors to repair a boat to make an escape, while another posse across the map stages a daring rescue attempt to free an ally that’s been cocooned in cotton candy and is slowly being turned into Klown juice. Meanwhile, as a Klown, you might find yourself hunting down and killing a teenager hiding in a porta-potty, while elsewhere your two allies are collecting cotton candy to power their Klown machines in order to trigger the Klownpocalypse and win the match. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It feels a lot more chaotic and casual compared to a single bad guy slowly stalking the halls.</p></div><p>Compare that to a single bad guy slowly stalking the halls trying to kill everyone and Killer Klowns feels a lot more chaotic and casual, which fits pretty appropriately with its silly-as-heck vibe. With so much going on in every match, the vast majority of them end with at least a few humans making a successful escape while Klowns cull the weak, whereas the Klowns almost always get at least a few kills, which makes things feel a lot less sweaty. </p><p>Another way it achieves that is that the humans are able to fight back and even kill Klowns relatively easily once they find the right weapons. A solo Klown chasing a squad of four humans is likely to be in quite a pickle once those teens realize they can just turn around and wail on the grinning goof with axes and baseball bats until it’s forced to spend a minute in timeout before respawning. (And there’s no carnival games for you, ineffective Klown!) But because Klowns don’t have to loot to be powerful, don’t run out of ammo, and only die temporarily, there’s still a ton of reasons for humans to fear their wacky assailants, especially since ammo is scarce and human weapons break after just a few swings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This means that both teams, Klowns and humans, have to work together to achieve victory – and my experience so far has been that whichever side forms a more cohesive unit is likely to win. That’s exactly what I want in a game like this, and it’s absolutely fantastic. It’s an all too common problem for asymmetrical games to become one-sided when it’s one baddie versus a group of survivors. But in Killer Klowns nobody can really go it alone, and I’ve been seeing a lot more close matches and interesting interactions than I’d usually expect.</p><p>What I did expect, of course, is that Killer Klowns would have unlockables that are earned by playing matches, including both cosmetic stuff for pure flair and, for the Klowns at least, new character classes and abilities that can have a very real impact in-game. You can get the beefy Tank class that has health to spare, or the small but mighty Brawler, who moves in quickly and uses boxing gloves to knock the snot out of any annoying adolescents. Meanwhile, the humans unlock different archetypes with names like Rebellious and Tough, which are descriptions that sound like they’re supposed to influence how they play but, as of now, don’t appear to. Still, unlocking the various Klown classes has really helped inject some variety into my time so far, and most of them feel great. My new favorite is the Tracker, who is an expert at sniffing out slippery earthlings and turning them into spools of sugar with his shotgun.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Favorite Asymmetrical Multiplayer Games</h3><p>If you're a fan of games with a less traditional approach to multiplayer, here are Travis Northup's top asynchronous recommendations. </p></div><p>The biggest issue I’ve come across has been the stability of the matches themselves, which is always an enormous bummer in an otherwise solid multiplayer game. I and everyone I’ve played with have consistently experienced multiple crashes and a variety of irritating bugs throughout our matches, many of which have ended abruptly when the servers suddenly went haywire and booted everyone back to the main menu, leaving the entire Discord chat screaming with the rage and disappointment of a party that’s been fouled. Time will tell if these issues persist after the day one patch, but I’m currently pretty concerned that we’re careening toward a rocky launch, and these issues have significantly taken the wind out of our collective whoopie cushion.</p><p>So I still have a fair amount more to play of Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game before I put a final score on it - and I’ll especially keep an eye on its live servers once it fully launches. Here’s hoping the issues I’ve seen get smoothed out quickly, because I’d very much like to get back to the business of hunting down naive teens and evading evil Klowns. We’ll see if that holds up, and I’ll be back with a final review before too long. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The sheer number and scale of video games released nowadays means that the infamous Steam backlog is better-fed than ever, gorging on half-played hundred-hour <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, never-touched indies amassed during summer sales and “I’ll get to it one day” PC pipe dreams. If you were hoping to task your descendants with continuing your quest to get <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/259680/achievements">all 1,700-plus achievements in Tales of Maj'Eyal</a> or maintain your ranked leaderboard position in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, bad news: it turns out that you can’t pass on your Steam library after you die.</p>

<p>The legal detail was recently discovered by suitably-titled <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/">ResetEra user delete12345</a> and shared by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/">Ars Technica</a>, after they contacted Steam support to ask whether their Steam account could be bequeathed in a will. Steam Support’s answer confirmed that, nope, both accounts and games on Steam are non-transferrable, so they can’t grant access to someone else or merge your library into another account in the same way as handing down your records or forcing someone to take possession of your lifelong collection of novelty steins.</p>
<p>If you were thinking “well, I’ll just leave them my password instead”, technically you’re not allowed to do that either. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Steam’s terms and conditions</a> specify that “you may not reveal, share, or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve”. (That officially includes by writing your password down, as the terms point out later on.) While Valve might arguably be swayed by your heartfelt plea to hand on the complete Leisure Suit Larry series to your loved ones, by the letter of the Subscriber Agreement, you’d have to get explicit permission first.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, literally writing down your password on a bit of paper and giving it to someone is something that Valve is unlikely to ever know about, even if it technically breaks the user terms - something you might not be so fussed about once you’re dead. Steam has also introduced its own built-in ways of sharing your game library with family members, with the added benefit that they can then play on their own account rather than giving your friends list a shock when you log in after passing on. But in terms of easy, convenient ways to hand on your digital game library, it seems there isn’t one at the moment. Best achievement-hunt while you can.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise to anyone that nearly a decade later, Rainbow Six: Siege continues to bring in crowds of people. It’s such a winning formula that, even for those who aren’t competitive, you can’t help but check out the most recent content or watch a competitive tournament. But there’s always more on the horizon. So, when does the new Rainbow Six Siege season start?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-season-of-rainbow-six-siege">When is the Next Season of Rainbow Six Siege?</h2>



<p>The upcoming season of Rainbow Six Siege, revealed recently as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-operation-new-blood-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation New Blood</a>, will kick off sometime in June. Unfortunately, no one has an exact date yet. What we do know is that Ubisoft generally follows a set schedule for seasonal releases around this time. </p>



<p>Following BLAST R6 Major Manchester, which concluded on May 26, the next season of Rainbow Six Siege will enter its test phase on the beta branch for approximately two weeks. Following this testing period, we’ll see the next Rainbow Six Siege season start. If the timeframe remains similar to previous years, then Operation New Blood begins in mid-June.</p>







<p>What’s New in Rainbow Six Siege Operation New Blood?</p>



<p>While the list of changes to Rainbow Six Siege in Operation New Blood proves extensive, we’ll focus on the biggest, most hard-hitting tweaks coming to the 5×5 game!</p>



<ul>
<li>Boost to anti-cheat and player protection mechanics</li>



<li>Fenrir and Solis nerfs</li>



<li>Full launch of the Rainbow Six Siege Marketplace</li>



<li>Warm-up game mode Endless Drill</li>



<li>Arcade game mode Attrition</li>



<li>New Recruits: Striker and Sentry</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-teaser-90s-gulf-war-confirmed-frank-woods/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For some time now, we’ve been hearing two key rumors about 2024’s entry in the blockbuster Call of Duty franchise – a) that it would be a continuation of the Black Ops series developed by Treyarch, and b) that it would be set during the 90s with the first Gulf War being a focal point. Well, last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> was <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially announced as this year’s CoD title</a>, and now a new live-action teaser has essentially confirmed that 90s Gulf War setting.</p>
<p>A new teaser trailer posted to the Call of Duty YouTube channel entitled “Open your eyes” hits the player with a barrage of 90s imagery, from Chia Pets, to Bill Clinton, to George Bush (the first one). Perhaps most notably, there are also lots of snippets of the Gulf War and few sightings of Saddam Hussein. Since this is a Black Ops teaser, there’s also a conspiratorial tone, and hey, Treyarch will certainly have a wide choice of conspiracy theories to pick from regarding the Gulf War. Oh, and the teaser also contains a snippet of a cheesy 90s drama called “Frank’s Woods,” so you know he’s coming back (not that there was much doubt about that). Anyways, enough of my preamble, check out the teaser for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="open your eyes #thetruthlies" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEjmwoVrF0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Call of Duty YouTube channel is also promising <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V08UPqchVgQ&amp;ab_channel=CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another live action Black Ops 6 trailer will drop tomorrow</a>. The cover image seems to show Saddam Hussein and some coordinates that point to his former palace, perhaps hinting that’s somewhere players will visit?</p>
<p>We’ll get our first real look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 following Microsoft’s big <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, which takes place on June 9. Mark your calendars.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 platforms haven’t been announced, but it’s expected to come to the regular lineup, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-black-ops-6-ps4-xo-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation and last-gen consoles</a>. It’s also expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on Game Pass</a>. What do you think? Up for a little 90s nostalgia? Or would you prefer a different time period?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/27/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The 80s was a great time for fans of slasher films and horror in general, but I’d never heard of Killer Klowns from Outer Space before seeing the modern game trailer for the first time. I did know IllFonic, though, as the custodians of the late <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/friday-the-13th/">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, the more recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/27/predator-hunting-grounds-review-ps4-pc/">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a> and a number of other asymmetrical multiplayer games.</p>
<p><iframe title="How To Survive A Killer Klowns Invasion" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Dq3NrszLYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I was admittedly a little dubious, with some of IllFonic’s licensed games significantly better than others. Friday the 13th was a decent jaunt, sadly passing on with its support ending, but Predator: Hunting Grounds didn’t live up to its expectations. Thankfully for the potential longevity of this game, the film creators, the Chiodo Brothers, seem very on board with making this game a success, talking about how they want to expand the universe of Killer Klowns in a way they were never able to do before with the original movie. Of course, it helps that the game feels like a real winner.</p>


<p>Each match pits three extraterrestrial Klowns against seven humans, with the human players trying to escape the map and the Klowns hunting them down and trying to bring about the Klownpocalypse. It could easily have fit exactly into the formula of all the other asymmetrical multiplayer horrors, but the humans here can fight back, making this very much a battle of&nbsp;attrition compared to the oppressive nature of Killers vs Survivors in Dead by Daylight.</p>


<p>Case in point, I was able to get very tooled up very early as a human in one match – I found a shotgun, some bullets and a handgun – and managed to take down two out of three Klowns in a fight before being killed myself. I like this because it means you don’t have to fear for your life in each game as a human, and alongside various rescue and resurrection options, gives your team a fighting chance even with some early set backs.</p>
<p>On both sides, communication is key and the game is as authentic as possible with in-game proximity chat for humans that all nearby players can hear, while the Klowns can chat at range with… telepath, maybe. It forces would be survivors to explore and try to find your comrades so you can see what items they found and actively work together to escape.</p>
<p>Each map has up to four escape points for which you’ll need to find specific items to open and make a getaway. For instance, the boat requires having its gas tank filled, a spark plug installed and its engine started, each process requiring a skill check (timed button press) to not make noise that alerts Klowns across the map. There’s also the fact that these exits might be coated in a thick layer of candy floss which will need to be removed before you can get out – the Klowns can reapply the coating with their various ridiculous guns, as well.</p>

<p>Dotted around the map are a metric ton of pickups to find; baseballs, hamburgers, a compass, energy drinks, weapons and so much more, all of which are useful at some point during the match. I tried to keep an energy drink on me in case I got discovered by a Klown, necking the energy drink in order to boost my stamina and make a getaway</p>
<p>There are currently five different archetypes to select from; Athletic, Rebellious, Heroic, Resourceful and Tough, each one varying in stats. The Athletic type for instance has a higher stamina stat meaning they can run for longer, while the Tough type has better health.</p>
<p>There’s also currently five different types of Klown, coming with their own unique stats, weapons and skills. The Ranger comes with a cool ability which lets you hypnotise Humans into walking towards gormlessly awaiting an untimely death, while the Tracker can create an awesome Balloon Dog that will pull you in the direction of where Humans are hiding, meaning you are never truly safe from from the Klowns wrath. These abilities are not tied to the specific Klowns either, because after unlocking them, you can mix and match the abilities and guns.</p>

<p>Klowns can generally have hunt down survivors without fear and preventing them from escaping, either by killing them outright, or by using them to trigger an early Klownpocalypse – this happens once the fifteen minute timer runs out, giving one last ditch escape opportunity before the map is covered in cotton candy.</p>
<p>You can get an early Klownpocalypse by hooking up big cotton candy cocoons – either spare ones or created using downed humans – to lackey generators around the map. Each machine has four spaces, and hooking up sixteen of them will trigger an early end game. In the meantime, they will also spawn minions that roam the map, exposing the positions of humans and trying to grapple and hold them for you, making them far easier to shoot and turn into candy… or for performing a Klownality on them.&nbsp;My personal favourite is the pie finisher, where you throw an impossible amount of pies at the poor Human, before topping them off with a cherry.</p>
<p>It’s all very tongue-in-cheek which is very in keeping with the theme of the original movie. It was a horror comedy and that very much feels like the vibe here. The game is not trying to take itself too seriously and be a complete horror experience and is instead focusing on just trying to be fun. Dead by Daylight could learn from this, such as by having an in-game timer to prevent games being held hostage by toxic players.</p>
<p>The game also encourages players to stick around after death. Klowns will respawn, but humans are given minigames to complete, which reward items that you can either pass to living players, or fill your own inventory if you’re hoping for a rescue or resurrection. Some minigames feel better than others,, though success is just about reducing the time before you get a reward. The resurrection machine is a fantastic inclusion that should help massively towards the ‘entitled survivor’ that’s cropping up in these kinds of games recently.</p>

<p>It’s worth a mention, but after watching the movie between sessions playing the game, I was impressed by how accurate the game actually is, right down to how you knock a Klown out – first by stunning them and then by popping their nose – and the way it disappears. It’s very smartly done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our time with Killer Klowns before launch was not without issues. Admittedly playing before the day one patch, we had issues with disconnections, various bugs and glitches, all of which soured the experience a little. Hopefully all of the worst issues have been addressed with the day one patch – the reason why were are not scoring this review just yet is so we can try this out – because the game is a lot of fun to play.</p>
<p>Of course, we have to compare this game to the rest of IllFonic’s releases, and for all intents and purposes, it feels like a reskin that jumbles up the player count and some other gameplay tweaks. Saying that alone doesn’t do this game justice or feel fair, though. Killer Klowns definitely feels like an evolution of the system and is much more fun to play as a result. While not quite as good or as polished as Dead by Daylight, Killer Klowns still has a place in this genre without stepping on anything’s toes or replacing them.</p>
<p><em>We will update this review after the game is publicly available and we’ve tested the live servers and day one update. Code was provided by IllFonic for the purposes of this review.</em></p>

			<p>After over a year of work, the Dark Souls Re-Remastered visual overhaul mod version 1.0 has been released online, introducing a variety of visual improvements.</p>
<p>The mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/642?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, completely removed almost all backed lighting, introducing dynamic shadows to the whole game. The mod also improves lighting, water reflections, distant geometry, ambient occlusion on the player lantern, upscales textures and more. You can check out how the mod improves the game's visuals with the screenshots below.</p>

<p>Following its release in late 2011, Dark Souls was remastered in 2018 with improved visuals and some light gameplay tweaks. You can learn more about the game, which is available now on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-remastered-revisiting-lordran/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Jumping into Dark Souls Remastered again isn't quite the same as your first time through but it's still a magical journey. And if you've never played&nbsp; the game before?

			<p>A PlayStation Showcase may be planned for September to follow this month's rumored State of Play presentation, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Lunatic Ignus, who previously revealed a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-short-but-sweet-new-trailer/">Black Myth: Wukong trailer</a> would be shared earlier this month before it actually went live, said on<a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1795026168610979929"> X/Twitter</a> today that a new PlayStation Showcase will be held in September.</p>
<p>While it will be some time until we learn if a new PlayStation Showcase will indeed be held this September, it makes a lot of sense for Sony to hold one that month. Not only is it the month of the Tokyo Game Show, but it would also be the perfect time to reveal the PlayStation 5 Pro and use upcoming games to showcase the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-36-teraflops/">power of the new system</a> closer to its launch, which is said to be before the end of the year. Still, no matter how likely it sounds, we should take a showcase coming this September with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/">PlayStation Showcase was long rumored to be planned for May</a>, but according to various insiders, this month's event will only be a State of Play presentation. As Memorial Day is celebrated in the US today, if any presentation will be held before the end of May, it will likely be announced tomorrow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-game-review-pratfall-inc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, you can’t say that this one was coming. Whenever a horror icon jumps back into the spotlight, it’s for a crossover in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-chucky"><em>Dead by Daylight</em>, like Chucky from <em>Child’s Play</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/screams-ghost-face-stalks-his-way-into-multiplayer-slasher-dead-by-daylight">Ghostface from <em>Scream</em></a>, or a crossover in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>, like <em>Spawn </em>or… well, Ghostface from <em>Scream</em>, actually. Still, there’s more ammo in the clip in this instance, as 36 years later, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-game"><em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</em></a> has gotten the game treatment.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from Illfonic, most well-known for the somewhat underseen <em>Friday The 13th: The Game</em>, and the exceptionally jank <em>Dead Alliance</em>. Developed in partnership with Colombia-based developers Teravision Games, who are responsible for the VR tower defense title <em>Captain Toonhead vs The Punks from Outer Space</em>, <em>Killer Klowns</em> sees both developers return to familiar territory - Illfonic in structure, and Teravision in aesthetic.</p>

<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty, it’d be remiss of me if I didn’t recommend the original 1988 film the game is based on. A testament to low-budget buffoonery, it’s a near-perfect balance of physical comedy, memorable moments, and practical effects, with just enough ironic winking towards the audience without feeling patronizing. There are even a couple of creepy moments that slip in, intentionally or otherwise.</p>



<p>As for the game, it’s an asymmetrical multiplayer affair, one which somewhat follows the events of the movies. The Klowns have come to Earth in order to transform humans into cotton candy cocoons that the Klowns use for sustenance and energy. In-game, 3 Klowns will face off against a maximum of 7 humans, who look to escape using several methods and fight back against the Klowns to temporarily stop their plans to bring forth the “Klownpocalypse”, a game event that will kill all remaining players if they haven’t escaped.</p>

<p>On the player's side, you have two forms of health: Your hit points, which can lead to death, and a meter showing how much you’ve been cotton candy-ized, which can also lead to death. On the Klown’s behalf, they only have one health bar, which when emptied, can only be killed by a sharp object popping its big red nose. Klowns do have infinite lives however, so it’s only a minor setback.</p>

<p>On the surface, it looks like <em>Killer Klowns</em> is paying more than just lip service to its peers. The cotton candy cocoons have to be hooked up to several generators, something which you can also do to human players if you manage to transform them. However, Illfonic and Teravision seem to be paying attention to how the game flows in its peaks, eliminating concepts like “hook camping” or “tunneling” since the player pool, and scope, is much bigger.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it manages to become its own thing. A vaguely PvPvE experience with just enough tactical opportunities, class variety, different forms of combat, and punchy references to show they’re not being cynical. Whenever you use the “Balloon Dog” and “Invisible Car” powerups, you’ll find it hard not to crack a smile, especially if you’ve seen the movie before.</p>

<p>It also helps that <em>Killer Klowns</em> tends to be a balanced affair, with both sides having enough in their arsenal to be a major threat to their opponent. While teamwork on the human side of things is almost non-existent, the maps' gargantuan sizes and several escape paths are helpful in making sure that even the most neglected players have a chance to come out of the ordeal alive.</p>

<p>With that said, the level designs for the map themselves tend to range from bog-standard to obfuscating annoyances. It’s clear human players are meant to have a more versatile skill set for evading Klown attacks, and some of them exist, like vaulting over obstacles or locking doors, but verticality is almost non-existent.</p>



<p>When it comes to core gameplay, or actually executing actions like evading and attacking, <em>Killer Klowns</em> plays like an awkward version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-by-daylight"><em>Dead By Daylight</em></a> mixed with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-rising"><em>Dead Rising</em></a>. Klowns tend not to focus on melee combat, as their cotton candy weapons are faster than a rubber mallet to the head, but this just makes the human side of things - and indeed, the hit detection when swinging away - all the more worse. Everything has so much weight to it, and almost no feedback, just a small hitmarker on an atrociously-presented UI.</p>

<p>So this will lead to a lot of cheap deaths on both sides, but on the human side of things, death isn’t a “sit back and put the controller down” moment. If you’re spectating another player, you can partake in microgames that can grant said player random items that range from health and powerups to weapons.</p>

<p>It’s actually a really nice touch, encouraging engagement at all times, even though without communication, a lot of the time, you’ll leave a breadcrumb trail of items due to a full inventory, and an intrusive pop-up on their screen each time.</p>

<p>Honestly, <em>Killer Klowns</em>’ biggest issue is that there’s something about the presentation that tends to take itself a bit too seriously. There’s an air to the ordeal, from gameplay to atmosphere, to the general UX, that implies it’s a lot scarier than what it actually is. Is that wrong? Not at all, but the game tends to struggle, even more so than the movie, as to whether it wants to be an actual fear-inducer, or a pisstake among friends.</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that aesthetically, it doesn’t seem to be inspired from the movie all that much, even when you go past visual design. Instead, you have <em>Killer Klowns</em> emulating that typical 80s style, and you know what that means; purple tints, VHS fonts, and fake tracking issues. There’s an alien spaceship shaped like a circus in the film, filled with all types of atypical visual design , and instead, we’re in what looks like Raccoon City, but it’s been attacked by <em>The Blob</em>.</p>

<p>Still, all of this is Illfonic’s wheelhouse, their forte, their particular brand of poison. The edgy jank experience of a unique multiplayer rodeo that juggles between several different mechanics, and this seems to be the first time where, alongside Teravision, they might have a hit on their hands. While <em>Dead Alliance</em> and <em>Friday the 13th</em> suffered from a case of “right place, wrong time”, <em>Killer Klowns</em> has enough mechanical gas in the tank and replay value to justify its presence.</p>



<p>Did I enjoy <em>Killer Klowns</em>? 100 percent, I’d be imprisoned for perjury if I said otherwise, and there’s enough here to bash any nay-sayers who’d propose a more straightforward crossover. It may look generic, both in motion and its arduously forced 80s static, but there are enough inventive ideas under the makeup to see <em>Killer Klowns </em>for what it is.</p>

<p>Not just a competitor, but a fun time.</p>

<p>Songs of Conquest finally left early access after two years on May 20, and with it came immediate success for developer Lavapotion. The studio has announced that Songs of Conquest has sold 500,000 copies in its first week while also revealing a new roadmap for the game.</p>



<p>“Thank you every single one of you who played our game, supported us through Early Access all the way into 1.0,” <a href="https://x.com/songsofconquest/status/1795080252646904196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lavapotion said</a>. “Today we are announcing a huge milestone, as well as a VERY bright future for the game!”</p>



<p>With the new Songs of Conquest roadmap, Lavapotion has committed to new content for the game through 2025, including four new Wielders and four new campaigns for current factions as paid DLC, and even the addition of two new factions with a new Song (large campaign). The two new factions will be known as Vonir (trolls) and Roots (plants).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“The Bleak East lies to the North-East of Patrium, and is the home of descendants from both Arleon and Barya,” the studio says of the new campaign expansion. “Hardy settlers who now live their lives free of their former masters on the coast of the Bleak East. But they are not alone, and we can barely wait to share their Song with you.”</p>



<p>They added: “Both new factions will be introduced through a new Song, a large single-player campaign that will tell the story of how they came to be and how they will affect the larger world of Aerbor.”</p>



<p>Also confirmed was the window for the console release of the game on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in Fall 2025. </p>



<p>Lastly, free updates for the game will include new units, artifacts, and improvement to the game’s multiplayer both from a PvP and Co-Op perspective.</p>

<p>The first gameplay images of Black Ops 6 have been revealed in new teasers that took place this weekend.</p>



<p>It was an event-filled Sunday Black Ops 6 this weekend as a new round of teasers for the game came courtesy of NoahJ456. During his live stream, Noah played a video from Activision, which played a new teaser for Black Ops 6, confirming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-gulf-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">setting to be the Gulf War</a>. As spotted by some eagle-eyed fans, the teaser also contained what appears to be our first glimpses of Black Ops 6 gameplay.</p>



<p>As reposted by ModernWarzone, you can see a very short snippet of two characters, one of which is sliding and shooting an enemy.</p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>1 second of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 gameplay can be seen in the teaser sent to NoahJ. </p><p>All we can learn from it is that shooting while sliding appears to be in the game. 👀<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a> <a href="https://t.co/BduFNooR5D">pic.twitter.com/BduFNooR5D</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1794860361885401367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Admittingly, not much else can be gathered from the gameplay snippet, but soon after NoahJ played the video, the official Call of Duty YouTube channel scheduled a new live-action trailer for Black Ops 6. The latest teaser trailer is set to go live on May 28th.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the game will have its reveal trailer at this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-xbox-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 9, with a more in-depth deepdive on the game in its own special Black Ops 6 direct. </p>



<p>Over the weekend, Insider Gaming also verified claims that this year’s Call of Duty game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6, will be on past-generation consoles</a>.  As for if the game will be coming to the Nintendo Switch (as Call of Duty will now come to Nintendo platforms for 10 years as a part of the Activision / Microsoft deal), Insider Gaming understands that this will begin with the Nintendo Switch 2, which is presumably set to launch next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-makes-brutal-politics-a-fantastic-game-of-survival<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>City builders and survival games can be difficult genres to ease yourself into. They can seem <em>especially</em> daunting when they’re a sequel to a predecessor built on as complex foundations as Frostpunk was. It's pleasantly surprising, then, that Frostpunk 2 feels so welcoming to new players. As someone not fully versed in the two genres it blends so delicately, and with just a handful of hours in the original Frostpunk, I loved my time with its prettier, and thoroughly political sequel. Largely thanks to the neverending series of moral conundrums thrown my way, I had a lot of fun in New London, even if all of the citizens I tried to save experienced the complete opposite.</p><p>Tasked with building and evolving a city to combat the endless cold, Frostpunk 2 shares its objective with the original. But everything has increased in scale in the sequel. Instead of constructing individual buildings, you’ll create entire city districts with the click of a button. Time is no longer measured in minutes, but ticks by in weeks and months. And, perhaps most importantly and most fun of all, a greater emphasis is now placed on the politics of the world and the influence of the factions residing in it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Frostpunk 2 Screenshots [2024 update]</h3></div></output><p>But before I could allow my political machinations to play out, I had to navigate the tutorial – a must for both experienced and newcomer Frostpunk players due to the sweeping gameplay changes. The motto of Frostpunk 2 is “The city must not fall”. Well, it did within 20 minutes. Tasked with keeping a small community of Wanderers safe, they quickly lost faith in me after being left freezing cold and worked to the bone. I learned from my mistakes, though, and treated my humble population with greater care next time around. </p><p>This tutorial may have only been a half an hour prologue but it set up the tension of what it takes to survive in Frostpunk 2 perfectly. I was given 76 weeks to stockpile 40,000 food rations before a severe whiteout arrived, covering the settlement in a thick snowstorm. I achieved this with just two weeks to spare by navigating through a neighbouring ice shelf and locating four different food resource deposits and harvesting them for all they were worth.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It less so positions an angel and a devil on your shoulder, but two devils of which one enjoys harming a certain percentage of the population more than the other.</p></div><p>I did this by engaging with the new “frostbreak” mechanic, which allows you to thaw eight hexagonal areas of the segmented world map at a time so that their resources can be extracted from the frozen ground and utilised. These resources range from fuel, construction materials, and in this case, food. Once frost broken, I was then able to begin building food districts on each spot, and designated a workforce to each. But it quickly became apparent that the rate at which I was stockpiling food would never be enough, so choices had to be made. Did I demand double shifts from each of the workers or sacrifice a local group of sea lions to bolster rations? The animals hadn’t done anything wrong (and let’s face it were likely mostly blubber anyway) so I chose the former option. I was rewarded with great success. All it cost was working almost everyone to death.</p><p>This was just the prologue, though, and a smaller, gentler taste of the sort of ethical decisions Frostpunk 2 loves to throw at you. It less so positions an angel and a devil on your shoulder, but two devils of which one enjoys harming a certain percentage of the population more than the other. And so, it was time to begin the main story and head to New London to solve the coal crisis left behind following the passing of the Captain (the character played in the original Frostpunk) and begin the story mode in earnest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A circular city emanating from its fiery, smoke-belching central generator, New London will conjure up memories for experienced players, but the way it's expanded upon in the sequel is entirely different. Gone are the days of building out in concentric circles and in are the days of the hexagon as you commit urban sprawl out in any direction you choose thanks to the aforementioned frostbreaking.</p><p>It makes for a much more malleable set of construction systems that let you focus on which way you’d like to expand your city and the resources and philosophical direction you’d like to take it in. At first you’ll be given specific goals to achieve, such as increasing coal supplies, but soon you’ll be left to your own devices and allowed to make your own fatal mistakes. </p><p>There also seems like there’s slightly less of an emphasis on resource gathering this time around, and more focus on the people you’re charged with keeping alive – the most precious resource of all. I found myself regularly running out of workforce numbers to man new industrial or excavation districts due to legions of my population coughing themselves to death. Stemming the flow of disease is crucial, and something I wished I realised earlier before it wiped out hundreds of families.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The most interesting of Frostpunk 2’s new additions – the Council system.</p></div><p>People are the key to progress then, and nowhere is this displayed more than in the most interesting of Frostpunk 2’s new additions – the Council system. Building new districts and stockpiling resources may keep your city ticking over, but in order to implement real change, you’ll need to get laws passed in the Council. This parliament-like body is made up (at least to begin with) of three separate factions: The Stalwarts see order as a core tenet of the city and are devoted to the memory of the fallen Captain; the Frostlanders adapt to whatever challenges nature throws their way; and the New Londoners value technology and the advancement of society. </p><p>In order to pass any new law you’ll need to secure a majority of at least 51% of votes. Sometimes this is simple, sometimes a challenge. For example, the very first referendum I faced was one about whether I should remain in charge as steward. I’d already curried favour with the Stalwarts as I funded them with extra members to patrol the city, but they only made up 13% of the council’s numbers. Frostlanders and New Londoners consisted of 43% and 44% respectively and were both neutral towards me, so it was clear I’d need to sway one in order to gain the necessary votes. This is where the war was won as I offered to implement a proposed law of the New Londoners that supported greater extraction efforts which would in turn provide more materials for buildings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This gave me a safe majority, but I could have taken a couple of other riskier options, including letting the vote just play out to see where the neutral voices ended up, or even wielding an iron fist to pressure delegates into voting my way, which would in turn worsen my relations with all three communities. It’s this balance of making the correct decision for the greater good of the city at every turn that is at the core of Frostpunk 2. </p><p>With a girthy book of laws to get your head around there appears to be a lot of room for tailoring the rules of your city to your own image. Some revolve around preventing disease spreading, whereas some revolve around child labour. All have one thing in common however – they’re never going to be universally praised. Even when you think you have everything relatively under control, Frostpunk 2 will throw a new wrinkle your way that changes how you govern everything. For example, the emergence of a new faction. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These political dilemmas and frequent twists and turns that emerge naturally through gameplay make Frostpunk 2 consistently engaging.</p></div><p>Halfway through my play session, 600 Frostlanders defected to form the Pilgrims. A community held together by traditions of ages past, they now held 9% of the vote in any council session, and let me tell you, they weren’t a fan of me and my technologically progressive ways. It gave me a new enjoyable headache to contend with – did I continue on my path to make New London a modern technological marvel, or bend my beliefs slightly to appease the Pilgrims? Doing so and building up enough good faith from them would allow me to periodically trigger their faction ability of sending out search parties to look for extra survivors and therefore bolster that ever-precious workforce.</p><p>These political dilemmas and frequent twists and turns that emerge naturally through gameplay make Frostpunk 2 consistently engaging, even in its relatively relaxed opening couple of hours. I hope that this is something that can still be experienced dozens of hours down the line as things, presumably, get ever-increasingly complicated to manage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s also key to note that Frostpunk 2 is a gorgeous game too, regularly adding a level of sheen and sparkle to otherwise macabre dioramas. Snow and ice twinkle, while the industrial buildings impress with their steampunk-infused architecture. For a world focussed on building bulging cities, the level of detail is truly impressive, not only to the eyes but ears also. The overworld is soundtracked by yearning, swirling Oppenheimer-esque strings, while zooming in on different districts will greet you with a variety of soundscapes ranging from chugging smokestacks to chattering children.</p><p>It’s just a shame that those children may not be playfully laughing for long, then. Frostpunk 2 is a game all about making tough choices in a delicate balancing act that makes you pause at every decision. And, sometimes, those moral conundrums end in you just having to send 112 troublemaking children down the mines, then blocking off their air supply to stop a fire from going out of control and losing that coal deposit completely. It just had to be done. Then 17-year-old George Fairweather has the cheek to tell me he’s missing his little sister. This is a fun game, I promise.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy should never be left in charge of a burgeoning industrial power.

		<p>Square Enix has teased its Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D remake, confirming the game for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, Switch and PC.</p>
<p>Marking Dragon Quest Day, Square Enix posted a teaser video on <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347">Dragon Quest’s social media</a> accounts for the long-awaited remake. The short video shows the Dragon Quest 3 logo being drawn along with the words “the legacy begins” and “The legend of Erdrick draws near.” There’s also the HD-2D logo and launch platforms.</p>


<p>Dragon Quest 3 is actually a prequel to the first two games, set years before the original game, telling the tale of an earlier part of the heroic lineage of Erdrick and depicting the first battle with the fiend Baramos. While it’s Erdrick’s descendants who featured in the first two games, this is generally known as the Erdrick Trilogy.</p>
<h3>Further Reading: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/14/dragon-quest-35-anniversary/">Dragon Quest at 35 – the history of a JRPG icon</a></h3>
<p>Dragon Quest 3 was originally released for the Famicom in 1988, selling over one million copies on its first day of release in Japan. Over the years it has been remade and ported to a number of later consoles, first with the 1996 SNES port, a Game Boy Color adaptation of the original release, and more modern ports to the Wii, 3DS, PS4, Switch, and more.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/27/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-octopath-traveler/">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D remake was first announced back in 2021</a>, with the reveal trailer showing the transformation to the art style popularised by Octopath Traveller. The game is in development by&nbsp;AMATA K.K. and Team Asano.</p>
<p><iframe title="『HD-2D版 ドラゴンクエストIII』ティザームービー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFkbeCsEDrk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>2021 was a big year for the Dragon Quest franchise, with Square Enix celebrating its 35th anniversary with a bevy of announcements. The HD-2D remake was certainly one highlight, but they also officially announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/27/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fates-announced-new-battle-system-unreal-engine-5-global-release-planned/">Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate</a>, the next mainline instalment in the JRPG series. There’s not side of a Dragon Quest XII update right now, good things come to those who wait, as the saying goes.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24157223/how-gravity-physics-work-for-jumping-falling-in-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-secrets-to-gaming-gravity.882249/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157223/how-gravity-physics-work-for-jumping-falling-in-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2PlXzu">“Find the fun.” Game development’s common refrain can manifest as the creation of a new game mechanic, the refinement or combination of existing mechanics, or making something simple — like jumping, flying, and fighting — feel great. Even falling.</p>
<p id="dGmbxJ">In games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/apex-legends/40486"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, plummeting from the open skies to the hard ground below is an experience. Simulated gravity pulls players downward, and game mechanics let them float, spin, and flourish as they fall. Simulated air friction may slow their descent, while visual effects like motion lines and field-of-view trickery help convey a sense of speed. Rocketing back upward to the skies, whether by jump pads or simply the strength of a game character’s two legs, is defined by a separate force that needs to feel fun, too. </p>
<p id="72wWqJ">Gravity is part of the physics engine of every video game, says Chris Winder, leading gameplay engineer at <em>Apex Legends</em> developer Respawn Entertainment. “The gravity in <em>Apex</em> is about twice that of normal Earth gravity,” Winder said in an email to Polygon. “This, combined with similarly increased jump velocities, is one trick games use that can help to make the game feel faster while still feeling within the bounds of realism.”</p>
<p id="gektIA">Physics simulation is generally thought of as a function of simulation games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22957121/gran-turismo-7-review-ps5">the Gran Turismo series</a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/kerbal-space-program/11285"><em>Kerbal Space Program</em></a>, but Winder points out that “it’s present to some degree in nearly every game we play, from <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> to <em>Rocket League</em> to <em>Apex Legends</em>.”</p>

<p id="owES3h">Video games can not only manipulate the strength of gravity to meet their needs, they can simply ignore it when they want to — all in service of making it feel good, said Jeremy Russo, game director at Velan Studios. His studio’s sports title <em>Knockout City</em> uses a gravity effect inspired by fighting games to help the game feel better. (Interestingly, <em>Knockout City</em>’s gravitational constant takes a different approach to <em>Apex</em>; it’s about half of Earth’s gravity.)</p>
<p id="CQWGPX">“Something we do both for gameplay reasons and for improved game-feel is briefly override normal gravity and character velocity for certain abilities,” Russo explained. In <em>Knockout City</em>, the developer makes your character hover briefly while throwing the ball mid-jump. “The gameplay reason for this is because the throw animation takes a few frames before the ball is released, so if we continued the player’s full velocity up or down then the ball was often thrown into geometry. It also just felt wrong, so we took a cue from some brawler and fighting games that briefly hover players in the air when they melee attack.” </p>
<p id="zuAVvI">Russo says “the extra level of polish to make this feel right involved resetting the player’s velocity if they were on their way down, or setting a new slower velocity if they were on their way up, because actually hovering at a specific height for multiple frames also felt wrong.” His team applied this same methodology, with varying degrees of special-case adjustment, to lots of abilities, like catching, dashing, and balling up.</p>

<p id="d6KIfA">“Gravity is a force that pulls stuff ‘down’ every single frame of the game,” said Chris Mercado, technical designer at Velan. “The fun comes from deciding where ‘down’ is! [We] can mess around with both magnitude and direction as much as we want. Some games work with a constant universal down (<em>Super Mario 64</em>), others have custom spherical gravity (<em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>); at the end of the day, gravity works the way the devs need to make the game they want to make.”</p>
<p id="MF8E2x">Those forces go beyond the expected up and down of jumping and falling, Winder said. In <em>Apex Legends</em>, players can use jump pads and gravity lifts to push themselves upward (then fall). The same physics-based approach also applies to things like grappling hooks. </p>
<p id="Y6bzO1">“There’s a lot that goes into how these elements move players around to make each of them feel fun and useful,” Winder said. “This can mean accurately simulating the real physics of a player launching through the air or being pulled by a grappling cable while also enabling some less-than-realistic inputs to this simulation to give players the control they expect.”</p>
<p id="t0LlMR"><em>Apex</em>’s Legend Pathfinder has a grappling hook that pulls the player toward a grapple point, “but looking in a particular direction to the sides applies a small force so that players can ‘curl’ the grapple,” Winder explained.</p>
<p id="60Edl5">Respawn similarly fudges another Legend’s ability. “Horizon’s gravity lift applies an upward force to players but also allows for directional input to move around in the lift and exit it,” Winder said. “There’s also a hidden force that sometimes acts to keep people in the lift so they don’t accidentally fall out.”</p>

<p id="aZPjLG">That kind of air control is innately familiar to players of many games. In Super Mario Bros. and Sonic the Hedgehog games, you can exert a force on a character who’s jumped to achieve better control of their jumps.</p>
<p id="gFNmwK">“As a developer, some of the things I find incredibly interesting are things that are invisible to most players that make platforming significantly more usable,” said Velan’s Jeremy Russo. “The most obvious one is air control… you can’t change your lateral direction mid-air after jumping in real life, but most games give you some amount of control.” Developers apply similar tricks for jumps, Russo said, by letting players jump a few frames after they’ve walked off a ledge.</p>
<p id="2Vll5f">“The amount of control the player has while they’re in the middle of a jump is one of the most fun aspects to mess with,” said Doug Applewhite, a programmer and designer. “It’s a surprisingly difficult situation to feel good and ‘right’, and there’s lots of options you have to play with.”</p>
<p id="UWhTFh">“I think it’s important to realize that the jump is often a player’s first connection to the physics of a game world,” said Hunter Bridges, game director at <em>Penny’s Big Breakaway</em> developer Evening Star. “The jump intuitively tells the player a lot about how the game works, often within the first few seconds of gameplay.”</p>

<p id="Q2VGgl">Bridges explained his studio’s approach to jumping in its 3D platformer, explaining that Evening Star wanted to make sure its titular character’s “jump happened with no startup delay.”</p>
<p id="1036MK">“Penny leaves the ground on the first frame the jump input is detected,” he said. “Some other games may wish to have a few frames of startup delay to illustrate anticipation, or otherwise better match the jump animation.”</p>
<p id="vqcL89">Bridges, who also worked on 2D platformer <em>Sonic Mania</em>, said that crafting jumping in <em>Penny’s Big Breakaway</em>’s 3D space presents a very different challenge from that of old-school side-scrolling Sonic the Hedgehog platforming. </p>
<p id="AZVcVb">“In 3D games, you are always wrestling with the fact that your 3D scene is projected onto a 2D screen,” Bridges said. When a game’s 3D camera pitches or rotates, “it becomes difficult to perceive distance along the camera direction due to foreshortening.” That’s something 2D platformers don’t have to worry about.</p>
<p id="7a4zrj">Developers work around that foreshortening problem, Bridges explained, by making enemies larger, making players’ jumps higher, and being more tolerant of near misses in 3D games by fudging collision detection and giving players recovery abilities. (“This is where Penny’s Ledge Pull move came from,” Bridges said.) </p>

<p id="f1QcB1">One of the most fascinating implementations of physics as it relates to jumping and gravity is how Mobius Digital’s space exploration game <em>Outer Wilds</em> handles the simple act of leaping. It has to consider more than just the player’s movement, but also the physics of a small solar system.</p>
<p id="GqXZRG">“With video games, you [have] to keep the camera near the center of the world’s coordinate space, or [...] everything starts kind of jittering,” explained <em>Outer Wilds</em> co-creator Alex Beachum in a 2020 documentary about the creation of the game. “So we have to keep the player near the mathematical origin of the world. [...] But because [in] ours, everything’s moving relative to each other, what I ended up doing is: Every time we apply a force to the player, we just apply an opposite force to every physics object in the world that’s currently simulating.</p>
<p id="PJHyfF">“So when you jump in <em>Outer Wilds</em>, technically every planet’s jumping out from under you, and you’re more or less not moving. It works,” Beachum said, “and we haven’t changed it.”</p>
<p id="XIeUhF">Beachum’s solution to solving a complicated math problem by simulating jumping in <em>Outer Wilds</em> was implemented out of necessity, but it also serves the higher purpose: finding the fun.</p>
<p id="jfq1Rr">“[A] player’s intuition of how gravity should work is generally more important than reality,” Mercado said. “That’s why most space-combat games have air friction and terminal velocities! At the end of the day, we’re making fun interactive media, so our physics should facilitate that fun.” </p>

			<p>Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil Code Veronica Remakes are in the works at Capcom, a known leaker has claimed.</p>
<p>Some minutes ago, known Resident Evil leaker 'Dusk Golem' took to X to talk about the series, and shared some interesting details about the yet-to-be-announced Resident Evil 9, the rumored remake of the original Resident Evil. In addition, the leaker said that remakes of Code Veronica and Zero are currently in development. "A remake of Resident Evil Zero &amp; Code Veronica in development right now", Dusk Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. He added, "I've talked to many others behind the scenes about this at this point, it's something I heard over a year ago, think it was going to get out whether I was the one to say it or not, &amp; that's about it."</p>
<p>With regard to the rumored RE-powered Resident Evil 1 remake that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-remake-re-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported on</a> earlier this month, the leaker wrote that this, as far as he knows, isn't happening. "RE:1 Remake rumors are bullshit, as far as I know, RE:1 is not in any form of development at all right now", he <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075104663027768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrot</a>e on X.</p>
<p>The same goes for a remake of Resident Evil 5, which isn't said to be in development either.</p>
<p>As said, the leaker also shared some additional details about Resident Evil 9, which was first said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed very soon</a>. Apparently, as shared by Dusk Golem, this isn't happening and the release date for the title has apparently been pushed back to late 2025, or early 2026. "First, I would wipe the expectations of RE9 being announced this summer period. The initial murmurs I heard I now do believe are right, &amp; RE9's announcement", he shared on X.</p>
<p>According to the leaker, the <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075104663027768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game will likely be announced</a> further away than initially expected.</p>
<p>He continued, "RE9 is pushed back to late 2025/2026. If everything I've heard is correct, which I fully believe it is, &amp; I know others have hinted this &amp; I'm not the first to say this publicly, actually, just its not caught on, there's actually".</p>
<p>Of course, none of the information above has been officially confirmed by Capcom in any way. Still, the leaker has proven to be reliable in the past. What are your thoughts about these new Resident Evil remake rumors? Hit the comments below.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/frostpunk-2-story-preview-im-bad-at-this-city-will-definitely-fall</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-story-preview-im-bad-at-this-the-city-will-definitely-fall.882213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/frostpunk-2-story-preview-im-bad-at-this-city-will-definitely-fall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm someone who enjoys getting to relax in video games. Sure some tense moments to heighten the story or when facing a tough obstacle are welcome but for the most part. <em>Frostpunk 2</em>, however, is not one of those games, and as I sat down to play the story mode last week I wasn't sure what I was in for.</p>

<p>Starting off with a tutorial, players are given access to a small valley complete with some resource plots, plenty of snow and ice, and a crashed train capable of generating heat. Breaking ice I gathered oil and set up a camp turning on the engine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the first things your population discovers during the tutorial is The Captain's Legacy, a tool that allows you to decide how The Captain, the playable character from the first <em>Frostpunk </em>title led their city. While you can't transfer over any previously saved data this is a nice way to get some kinda of running start.</p>



<h2>Scale Like None Before</h2>

<p>Creating districts and harvesting food the increased scale of <em>Frostpunk 2</em> is immediately noticeable. No longer are you dealing with your population on the individual levels or making single structures, but working with hundreds of people at a time and creating districts.</p>

<p>Knowing that they were still 'people' that I needed to be harvesting food or collecting oil it still did make the situation feel less tense knowing that I was a few hundred shy and not just two or three.</p>

<p>Decision-making immediately presents itself as you need to obtain 40k food with a set time limit or you're not even able to make it through the tutorial. I heard from others that they'd had to repeat the tutorial a few times to make sure they met the limit, I had an event occur where the elderly volunteered to leave and head out into the ice dropping my requirement to 25k.</p>



<p>With a heavy weight on my consciousness and a lot of extra food, I was able to progress.</p>

<p>In the main campaign of <em>Frostpunk 2,</em> you play as the Stewart, after the death of the Captain, the fate of New England is now on your shoulders. You begin with a sizable city but are immediately informed that coal is running out and it's a race to establish more resources.</p>

<h2>Balancing Spinning Plates</h2>

<p>Playing <em>Frostpunk 2</em> you'll be balancing a lot of the same resources that were important in the original. Do you have shelter to house your population, food to feed them, and fuel to keep them warm? And do you have a large enough population to continue to produce at that level?</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2 </em>does an amazing job of always making you feel like you are so close to balancing your resources but you're just not there.</p>



<p>On my first playthrough of the first chapter, I was woefully unprepared. Every time I felt I'd have one resource managed I'd realize I was running out of food elsewhere, or that colder weather was on the way and I just didn't have the coal to keep the people warm.</p>

<p>After struggling and failing to complete the first chapter I'd restart, knowing where the best resources were and what my later goals were to start moving towards them and I still had an incredibly difficult time.</p>

<h2>What Kind Of Leader Will You Become?</h2>

<p>Social events and making laws is a very different experience in <em>Frostpunk 2</em>. As factions have ideas in New London you'll end up having to vote for bills.</p>

<p>Taking place in the city council you can put forward a law that you're a fan of but you may not have the public perception on your side. This creates a new layer of politics on top of what is already a challenging situation.</p>



<p>You can appease one side for votes, by telling them you'll pass a different law they're interested in or promising them that you'll fund one of their projects.</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> does an excellent job of helping you keep track of all of these promises too. Every subsequent time you bring up that faction's information or go to vote on a new law you'll see icons indicating which you've said you'll assist with.</p>

<p>These kinds of decisions start to steadily become more and more complicated as different factions begin to arise from within your city. While I hadn't managed to make enemies out of the current factions the new one seemed to run opposite to the one I had previously been siding with.</p>

<h2>So Many Things To Keep An Eye On</h2>

<p>By the time I had reached my third attempt at the start of the game I understood where everything was, what I needed to keep an eye on, and what all of the icons scattered across my screen were for, it's a lot though.</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> is not the kind of game to hold your hand, as evident by a tutorial that you could very easily fail if you weren't giving it your all.</p>



<p>I personally found this 'trial-by-fire' approach to teaching a player the ropes a bit daunting. A new player coming into this experience is going to fail, there's not really any way around that, but it's the players that will persist that will get the most satisfaction out of the game.</p>

<p>Knowing which laws to pass early, what resources will be the best to come by in larger quantities, and above all knowing which objectives would be coming next were the only ways I was able to reach the end of the demo period and reach Chapter 2.</p>

<p>Where I left the demo was just after establishing a new settlement, obtaining some oil, and sending it back to New England. Not only will players need to balance resources and keep a stable population in New England, but you'll now be setting up new settlements all over the winter hellscape and balancing resources between them. For a new player, this is definitely a daunting idea but for those who just want more <em>Frostpunk</em> you'll have a good time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Did I Enjoy <em>Frostpunk 2</em>?</h2>

<p>I honestly wasn't sure how I would feel about <em>Frostpunk 2 </em>after spending some time with <em>Frostpunk</em> and being discouraged by it.</p>

<p>Being in a situation where I sat down to play for multiple hours, retry, and even see how my peers were handling different situations did help me with a major breakthrough. Is it the kind of game I normally find myself enjoying? Not really, but completing the first chapter with the city in a positive state, there being plenty of new fuel found, and a happy population I felt an incredible amount of pride in my ability.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of the original I don't see how <em>Frostpunk 2</em> might keep you interested, but if you've already attempted to play the first and it never clicked with you then you likely won't get too much of a different experience with the sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some people think that the Corps run Night City, and fewer still believe that the NC Council has a say. The truth is that the gangs run NC, through their holds over the different sectors, and don't think for a moment that any of them are sitting still, they all want a bigger piece of the pie. This is where you come in. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs Of Night City The Board Game</em>, you pick your gang, and go to war with the others on the streets of Night City, and who knows, you may even meet some NC Legends straight out of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=YynyRfvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=flOnoNxB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em> take place on a map of Night City.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The aim in&nbsp;<em>Gangs of Night City</em> is to gain street cred through actions, with 25 being the total to aim for. But things in <em>Cyberpunk</em> are never that easy, and there are 6 (including the solo mode) story cards that change things up along the way. The story card brings in new rules, and these can change and develop by adding new story cards when certain conditions are met, like a player getting to a set street cred level.</p>

<p>Each turn players can complete 2 actions, and these are marked on their gang board when completed. Those actions can't be used again until a player takes the reclaim action instead of taking their normal turn. The actions players can complete are:</p>

<ul><li>Activate solos - Your solos can move and engage other gang members in a single sector where you have solos</li>
	<li>Activate techies - Your techies and drones can move, and if you control the right areas, you can gain opportunity cards, or hire famous characters from Cyberpunk 2077 as edgerunners to boost your gang</li>
	<li>Activate netrunners - This lets you move along the netrun track for higher and higher rewards as you enter different tiers, but increasing consequences of being caught by Netwatch</li>
	<li>Build a hideout - Players can build up to three hideouts in different areas of NC. This allows you to recruit into that area and also helps towards gaining rewards in that area when you reclaim</li>
	<li>Upgrade a combat card - All players start with the same hand of 4 combat cards. If they choose this action, they draw 2 from the combat deck, choose 1, and return the other to the bottom of the deck. The card they chose then replaces one in their hand, which is removed from the game</li>
	<li>Wild Action - This action can be used as any of the other 5 actions, letting you do one action twice before having to reclaim.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=ATFo_RfW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=fHjET3s3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every player in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game </em>starts with the same 4 combat cards.</figcaption></figure><p>When you decide to reclaim, you move all your action counters on your gang board back to available, gain resources in districts in which you have units, and recruit new units into areas that have hideouts. You don't get to take any actions that turn.</p>

<p>During combat in the activate solos action, the winner is worked out by who has the most firepower in that area. The solo miniatures themselves don't add anything to firepower unless a card or ability says so, they are just there to indicate which areas you can fight in. Firepower is usually gained from abilities, the combat cards you play, like the Crusher starting card that adds 3 firepower, and edgerunners that you hire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=NgPnGKbH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=g5lv3U7f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netrunning in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game </em>is unfortunately a bland affair.</figcaption></figure><h2>Can You Netrun In Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City The Board Game</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs off Night City the Board Game</em> you can netrun, but it's simply a matter of choosing the netrun action, moving spaces along the track determined by the number of netrunners you have. Each point on the track has an action, which can be to gain street cred or eliminate an opposing unit. Then finally, you roll against the netwatch total, which increases in difficulty as you progress and suffer the consequences listed if you fail the roll.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every time you netrun, you also gain corporate secret tokens if you have control of a data fortress on the board. Corporate secrets are a valuable resource and can be spent on opportunity cards that can come up during the game. There's a nice link between the solos controlling areas on the board, and the netrunners, but it doesn't make the netrunning feel particularly thematic beyond the skin over the mechanics.</p>

<p>To those brand new to the <em>Cyberpunk</em> setting, and even those coming from the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> video game, it probably won't matter too much, but those who've got a history with the <em>Cyberpunk</em> RPG (either <em>Cyberpunk 2020</em> or the new <em>Cyberpunk Red</em>), and especially those blessed to have been able to play the card game <em>Netrunner</em>, it doesn't really feel like there's a whole lot of depth to it.</p>

<p>Even combat has cards that you can play to interact differently, here you simply move along a track and try to roll over an increasing number. The mechanics just fall a bit flat. It would have been easy to include another card deck for netrunning, and maybe a random netwatch events deck to go alongside it. Netrunning is a huge part of Cyberpunk, and this element of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 277 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em> just doesn't represent it adequately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=ltgHnP4X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=hp0Dp-_z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The core&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em> includes 4 gangs to play.</figcaption></figure><h2>Do You Play V In&nbsp;Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City The Board Game</h2>

<p>In<em> Gangs of Night City, </em>you are in charge of the whole gang. You don't play a specific character as such, but famous <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> characters will appear as edgerunners you can hire. In the solo mode, you actually play against Johhny Silverhand (also an edgerunner you can hire, but removed from the deck during solo play), and during the Kickstarter that funded the game, a Kickstarter exclusive V was also available as your opponent for Solo games (not available in the retail version we're reviewing here).</p>

<p>Each gang has its own feel. The Voodoo Boys are great at netrunning and can reroll the dice if they fail the netwatch check, whereas the Tyger Claws dish out revenge tokens when their units are taken out, and gain extra street cred when they eliminate units in firefights where revenge tokens are collected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=Dc_-TX8m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=MjQiaGTC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game </em>Families and Outcasts expansion adds 2 new gangs.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night Cight the Board Game Familes and Outcasts Expansion</h2>

<p>The Families ad Outcasts expansion adds several new elements to <em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em>. The first is 2 new gangs, the Wraiths, who gain rewards from raiding and denying opponents district rewards, and the Aldecaldos, who recruit eliminated enemy units and gain rewards based on how many units they have in play.</p>

<p>Both gangs can be used in normal games of <em>Gangs of Night City, </em>adding some variety to repeat plays. It also adds the ability to include a 5th player, with the extra combat cards and an expansion to the Night City map game board. It also includes a new story, Land Grab, and some extra cards for when playing single-player with or against the 2 new gangs.</p>

<p>It's a very good expansion overall. The 2 new gangs are fun and play differently from the original 4 gangs, extra stories are always welcome and the 5th player makes games a lot more chaotic and challenging.</p>

<p><i>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game </i>is a decent board game, there's a lot of tactical elements and the stories and opportunities keep it interesting in repeat plays.</p>

<p>The miniatures are solid and the inclusion of famous faces from the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> video game is fun, but the lack of interaction in the netrunning highlights the skin over the mechanics too harshly.</p>

<p>Each gang does have a unique feel that matches the lore, and you will find yourself playing in that style as it's easier to gain street cred that way, but with the amount of <em>Cyberpunk</em> detail and previous games out there, the setting should be more imbued with the mechanics.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City The Board Game?</h2>

<p>If you want a great board game that works well with 1 to 4 players, with different ways to win and some elements that mix it up on repeat plays, then <em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em> is solid. If however, you're looking for something dark and gritty, with deep netrunning elements, then Gangs of Night City isn't it, and you should check out <em>Cyberpunk Red </em>or the freely available version of <em>Netrunner</em> online.</p>

<p id="WZOnDz">Part true crime series, part sports series, <em>Clipped </em>tells the story of the tumultuous 2013-2014 season for the Los Angeles Clippers. At the time the Clippers were owned by billionaire Donald Sterling, but over the course of the next year, a series of revelations about Sterling shocked the NBA world and led to him getting banned from the sport for life. <em>Clipped </em>follows all the twists and turns of the scandal and includes an all-star cast led by Laurence Fishburne. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="AZ2xde">Disney Plus’ newest Star Wars series, created by <em>Russian Doll</em>’s Leslye Headland, is also the first to ever be set in the seemingly idyllic age of the High Republic. But just because the events of <em>The Acolyte</em> take place long before the days of Luke and Anakin Skywalker doesn’t mean that everything is peaceful in the galaxy. Instead, <em>The Acolyte</em> follows the story of a Jedi Master and her former Padawan as they investigate a series of mysterious crimes and accidentally stumble onto something bigger and worse than they could have ever imagined. The series stars Amandla Stenberg (<em>Bodies Bodies Bodies</em>), Dafne Keen (<em>Logan</em>), Lee Jung-jae (<em>Squid Game</em>), and Carrie-Anne Moss (<em>The Matrix</em>). —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="Lhfuvq"><strong>Release date:</strong> June 13<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>
<p id="qgfX9p">Can’t say much right now, but folks, <em>The Boys </em>is so back — which, after three seasons, feels like a minor miracle. With a new batch of episodes, the adaptation of Garth Ennis’ acclaimed comics series promises more blunt-force satire, more excessive violence, and rapidly escalating stakes for Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and the group of rebels who hope to snuff out the emotionally frail fascist Homelander (Antony Starr) before he laser-eyes the world to dust. Season 3 brought the characters to the edge, with Butcher facing terminal illness due to Temp V abuse, Starlight (Erin Moriarty) properly defecting from Vought, violent psychic Vic Neuman (Claudia Doumit) poised for major political power, and Homelander’s son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) standing at a superpowered crossroads. Expect season 4 to add more new characters, more twists, and, against modern odds, deliver. —<em>Matt Patches</em></p>

<p id="il4v0k">When we left Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan), her dreams were all coming true — literally, with Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) hooking up with her in her carriage and then committing to spending the rest of his life with her. In most romance stories (or even other seasons of <em>Bridgerton</em>), that would be the happily ever after, roll credits. But <em>Bridgerton</em> split season 3 for a reason: Now, Penelope has to see if Colin will love her at her Whistledown. </p>
<p id="gubc28">Considering all the secrets and pain she’s let loose in the world under her pen name, specifically to his family — well, good luck, Penelope. —<em>Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="LzhZ1n"><strong>Release date:</strong> June 16<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>HBO, Max</p>
<p id="JGfLaB">Let’s be honest: Things were never really going to get <em>better</em> between the warring Targaryens. But things got decidedly worse when Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) killed Lucerys (Elliot Grihault), and war between the two branches of the family went from “brewing” to “certain.” </p>
<p id="VNI5gx">Season 2 will follow the early days of the conflict, with plenty of dragons, houses, and Targaryens caught in the scuffle. The fate of Westeros is already set — there’s no way the Greens or the Blacks could know what will happen to their line hundreds of years in the future — but <em>House of the Dragon</em> has succeeded in making the inevitable interesting, and season 2 should hopefully follow suit. —<em>ZM</em></p>

<p id="iOWQQo"><strong>Release date:</strong> June 27<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hulu</p>
<p id="b1MfcE">The evolving series about a Chicago-based restaurant heads into its third season, as probably-still-a-mess chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), his long-suffering business partner Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), and his seemingly much-improved “cousin” Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) try to figure out how to keep the fine-dining establishment they opened in season 2 afloat in an industry where the odds are against them. Expect a lot more yelling, a lot more <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/maps/the-bear-fx-hulu-tv-chicago-guide-to-restaurants-film-locations">succulent food porn</a>, and probably a shifted focus again: Where season 1 zoomed in on the effort to keep a traditional Italian beef stand running, and season 2 addressed the expectations, barriers, and challenges involved in opening a restaurant, season 3 looks to be about the problem of finding and maintaining a regular clientele without compromising on vision or ambition. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="nMBBzV"><strong>Release date: </strong>June 2024<br><strong>Platform: </strong>Dropout TV</p>
<p id="iNSH0S">We know very little about this summer’s new season of Dropout’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24130879/dimension-20-ticketmaster-madison-square-garden-ticket-pricing-controversy-gauntlet-in-the-garden">Madison Square Garden-headlining</a> tabletop series Dimension 20. Just that it’ll be 10 episodes long, it’s called “Never Stop Blowing Up,” and — based on the redesigned GM screen in front of game master Brennan Lee Mulligan — the “blowing up” part is very literal. —<em>Susana Polo</em></p>

<p id="tBfrX4">The spiritual cousin to <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> that was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22442806/batman-caped-crusader-hbo-max-abrams-bruce-timm-matt-reeves">announced in 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23317980/batman-caped-crusader-hbo-max-canceled">canned in 2022</a> during Warner Bros.’ restructuring, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632724/batman-caped-crusader-animated-series-j-j-abrams-matt-reeves">picked up by Amazon Studios in 2023</a> arrives this summer. A collaboration between all-around genre filmmaker J.J. Abrams, <em>The Batman</em> director Matt Reeves, and <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> co-creator Bruce Timm, <em>Caped Crusader</em> borrows Timm’s indelible <em>BTAS</em> design sense for a series that isn’t exactly canon with the beloved 1990s cartoon, but is definitely evoking your nostalgia for it. </p>
<p id="d7mI5S">We don’t know a ton about the plot of the new show, but it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152823/batman-caped-crusader-prime-video-release-date">appears to take place in Batman’s early days</a> before his friendship with James Gordon, with Harley Quinn as a “calculating” serial killer and Catwoman as a spoiled heiress. —<em>SP</em></p>

<p id="DDslJC">The Hargreeves siblings face the end of the world... again. But this time it’s for real, since this is the final season of Netflix’s <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>. Last season left off with the Hargreeves in (another) alternate reality, after pressing a big reset button that recalibrated time and space. But this new reality is a bit different — for one, it seems like none of them have their powers. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

That’s OK, though, because we’ll gladly watch Selena Gomez, Steve Martin, and Martin Short bumble around together in any and every situation. Hollywood, here we come! —<em>PR</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163417/kill-action-movie-thriller-indian-lakshya-train<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ukqUnT">It’s been nice to see the growing popularity of Indian cinema in the States. For many people — especially those not familiar with the work of the legendary Satyajit Ray — their entry place was Aamir Khan’s excellent 2001 cricket drama <em>Lagaan</em>, the most recent Indian film to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. For others, it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23478046/rrr-ss-rajamouli-movies-top-gun-avengers-future">S.S. Rajamouli’s</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22996870/rrr-review-rise-roar-revolt"><em>RRR</em></a>, the exuberant and maximalist epic anti-colonialist saga and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23568882/oscars-2023-winners-list-academy-awards-nominations">first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award</a>.</p>
<p id="uJfDwE">Those movies aren’t very similar in their stylistic approach, but they do have a lot in common: action buoyed by romance, big musical numbers with lavish visuals, and strong anti-colonialist narratives. They — and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23157894/indian-movies-to-watch-streaming">many</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22999893/baahubali-movies-netflix-best-fantasy-action">other</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23342902/brahmastra-part-one-shiva-review">recent</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23989691/netflix-leo-adam-sandler-animated-movie-vs-vijay-tamil-musical">successful</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/22979071/best-hindi-movies-netflix-indian-bollywood-tamil-telugu">Indian</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23653492/pathaan-bollywood-best-spy-movie-like-mission-impossible-bond">movie</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23945067/watch-jawan-netflix-best-new-movie-thriller-bollywood-shah-rukh-khan-srk">exports</a> — contain elements of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_film">masala film</a>,” an approach that first appeared in the 1970s but remains strong today, in large part because of the work of Khan, Rajamouli, and others to reinvent the form and keep it alive. Masala movies are known for blending all sorts of genres together to create an experience that can appeal to as many moviegoers as possible. But not every Indian movie falls into the masala category, and the new hyper-violent Hindi action thriller <em>Kill</em> is here to prove that to U.S. audiences when it arrives in theaters on July 4.</p>
<p id="EkZUvP">After getting back from a long mission, Indian army commando Amrit (Lakshya) has received news from the love of his life (Tanya Maniktala) that she is being forced by her powerful father into an arranged marriage, and the wedding is tomorrow. Along with his friend and fellow commando (Raghav Juyal), he decides to try to stop it, secretly joining the wedding party <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23279231/best-action-scenes-train-fights-watch">on a train</a> to Delhi. But when bandits attack, things go horribly wrong, and violence and mayhem ensue.</p>

<p id="tMjtw7">A tense thriller with terrific extended fight sequences, director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat made <em>Kill </em><a href="https://filmexposure.ch/2023/09/25/ff-2023-interview-with-kill-director-nikhil-nagesh-bhat/">with the intent of making a brutal action movie like <em>The Raid</em></a>, playing off <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/kill-review-1235745857/">a real-life experience he had with a train robbery</a>. He hired veteran action choreographers Oh Se-yeong (<em>Snowpiercer</em>) and Parvez Shaikh (who worked with Oh on the Bollywood blockbuster <em>War</em>) to design the action, and both put in some of their best work to date.</p>
<p id="FuMTRl"><em>Kill </em>makes the most of the close-quarters setting and the many different weapons on display — knives, limbs, fire extinguishers, and the architecture/layout of the train itself all play into the combat. It’s a real treat for action fans, especially when things take a turn 45 minutes in and the violence amps up <em>significantly. Kill</em> doesn’t go from 0 to 60; it starts at 60 and goes to 200. The movie’s action design is basically broken into two halves, allowing the team (and Lakshya as a lead) to show a variety of approaches to the fight scenes. I won’t say <em>too </em>much, to avoid spoilers, but the action design becomes much more lethal in response to the events of the story, which allows <em>Kill</em> to start with a more classic nonlethal martial arts approach to action before transitioning into something closer to what you might find in a horror movie.</p>
<p id="UQrhYz">With some of the most brutal, violent kills you will find in an action movie, <em>Kill </em>is not for everyone — again, this is absolutely not a masala film. But if you like the sound of a movie like <em>The Raid</em>, <em>The Night Comes for Us</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24022711/mayhem-review-action-movie-farang-xavier-gens"><em>Mayhem!</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23602798/project-wolf-hunting-gory-action-horror-movie"><em>Project Wolf Hunting</em></a>, with a dash of <em>Train to Busan</em> and the slasher-infused <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2024/1/13/24034487/best-thriller-movies-netflix-watch-january-2024"><em>Equalizer 3</em></a>, you can’t miss this one. There’s a lot of value in the targeted thrills of a genre exercise, and <em>Kill </em>knows what its intended audience wants very, very well. Next stop on this train ride: cult classic status.</p>
<p id="16WvNC"><small><em>Kill </em></small><small>is out in theaters July 4.</small></p>

  <p id="8uMJ6j">It’s been nearly a year and a half since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dc">DC Comics</a> published the jaw-dropping finale to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22616750/batman-james-tynion-iv-comics-substack">James Tynion IV</a> and Alvaro Martinez Bueno’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22956748/nice-house-on-the-lake-best-horror-comics-james-tynion"><em>The Nice House on the Lake</em></a>. </p>
<p id="KggEIi">The 12-issue, Eisner-winning limited series followed a group of 11 people who are invited to an idyllic house in the Wisconsin countryside for a long weekend vacation by their mutual friend Walter. It’s only after arriving, however, that they discover the terrible truth: Walter is an alien, the rest of the human race has been extinguished, and none of the house guests are allowed to leave.</p>
<p id="hzELW8">This July, Tynion and Bueno return with <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em>, a limited series follow-up to <em>The Nice House on the Lake</em>, this time centering on <em>another</em> group of guests at <em>another</em> luxurious house — this one patterned after an exotic Mediterranean villa — assembled by <em>another</em> shape-shifting extraterrestrial named Max. There’s a few crucial differences, however: Unlike Walter’s group, none of the guests are particularly friends with one another, and each of them willingly chose to survive in paradise while the rest of humanity burned in alien fire.</p>

<p id="NVERS8"><em>The Nice House on the Lake</em> was, and remains, one of the most enthralling serialized mysteries of the past two years. Lawrence Kasdan’s <em>The Big Chill</em>, by way of Michael Schur’s <em>The Good Place</em>, meets Stephen King’s <em>It</em>, the series was an impeccably well-paced, apocalyptic drama. Tynion and Bueno delved deep into the dark secrets of their cast and neatly foreshadowed the story’s ultimate conclusion along the way; a breathtaking and ominous cliffhanger that opened the door for even more fraught mysteries and revelations to come.</p>
<p id="8frvzG">Polygon was given a look at the first issue of <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em> ahead of its publication next month, and it strikes a surprising balance between mirroring the narrative and visual structure of the original series, and contorting its apocalyptic thought-experiment of a original premise into ever more horrifying shapes. If <em>The Nice House on the Lak</em>e was a story about love and the ways in which it can be twisted into something awful, <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em> establishes itself as a story about how the absence of love makes monsters of us all.</p>

<p id="kDPjwn">The amount of craft and care put into the artwork and writing of <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em>, thankfully, in no way reflects the absence afflicting its principal characters. Bueno’s artwork is remarkable as always, contrasting the wooded rural splendor of the original series’ setting with a picturesque biome of breathtaking vistas and ostentatious architecture.</p>
<p id="he0NCl">Because this group of house guests are willing participants in Max’s alien experiment, and by extension accessories in the eradication of human civilization itself, Tynion is able to play with the out-of-this-world technologies he and Bueno initially introduced in <em>The Nice House on the Lake</em>, but that were largely hidden from Walter’s unsuspecting guests until late in the story. From collectively deciding the weather of the day to reshaping your appearance and physique at will, how far would you go before you could no longer recognize yourself as a human being?</p>
<p id="afdwZu">As far as how the series will go about addressing this question, as well as how the participants of Max’s experiment will learn and react to the aftermath of <em>The Nice House on the Lake</em>, we’ll have to wait until the first issue of <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em> is released on July 27th.</p>

                <p>If Frostpunk was about survival, then Frostpunk 2 is about stability--or at least the pursuit of it. Survival is still at the heart of Frostpunk 2’s gameplay and themes, but 11 Bit Studios wants its players to think bigger this time around. How do you create a thriving, expansive metropolis in a frigid and unforgiving wasteland? According to co-game director and design director Jakub Stokalski, “With that type of story, the scale needed to change, and with that came different city building mechanics [and] different depictions of society.”</p><p dir="ltr">If you’ve followed Frostpunk 2’s development or checked out the recent beta, then you probably know what Stokalski means by scale. Frostpunk 2 moves at a much brisker pace than the original. Rather than managing your city hour by hour, Frostpunk 2 moves day by day. Production, as long as your factories are properly staffed, moves at a constant pace. That’s not to say you don’t need to manage your workers and citizens. Like in the original, they still need food, shelter, and warmth in order to survive, but these issues come and go at a quicker rate. To give some perspective, I burned through nearly 200 weeks with a population of over 10,000 in just two hours.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Frostpunk 2 Director Breaks Down Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In order to match the scope and pace of Frostpunk 2, 11 Bit Studios needed to rework some of its fundamental city building mechanics. Rather than constructing facilities on a radial grid, Frostpunk 2 lets you create entire districts inside of hexagonal tiles. This gives your city a more freeform structure as different districts spill out from the city center and expand across the frozen tundra.</p><p dir="ltr">You can’t just build anywhere, though. Every tile needs to be frostbroken before districts are erected, and that requires resources and a small workforce. Additionally, you can only frostbreak tiles adjacent to other frostbroken tiles. This means if you see a natural resource in the distance, you must first carve a path through the ice before you can build an Extraction District and start harvesting its resources.</p><p dir="ltr">The frostbreaking mechanic adds a natural push and pull to Frostpunk 2’s progression and city expansion. You could focus all your efforts on frostbreaking nearby tiles to expand your domain, but if you prioritize that over building housing, food, and extraction districts, your city won’t last long. There’s a thin line between expansion and development you need to walk in order to succeed. These changes give a fresh perspective on the world of Frostpunk, and--in the early hours at least--provide a different kind of challenge than the original.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308500-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308500" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308500-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308500"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308500-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The human element also plays a huge role in this push and pull between expansion and development. At the outset, Frostpunk 2 has you managing a much bigger population this time around, and with that comes new factions, laws, and hierarchies. You could enact double shifts at the factories to earn more resources, but this could lead to discontent, sickness, and even death. If you let any of those issues get out of hand, your city could fall. Conversely, if you’re too lax on your workforce, you may not be able to keep up with your city’s growing demands. Like the original, Frostpunk 2 feels like a delicate balancing act that routinely asks you how far you're willing to go for the greater good. Are you willing to exile the elderly population in order to conserve food rations? Apparently I am.</p><p dir="ltr">A big part of managing Frostpunk 2’s population is communing with the council and passing laws. Gone are the days of Frostpunk’s Captains. Instead, the Steward alongside a council of 100 delegates are responsible for proposing and passing laws. The council regularly meets, and during those meetings you can review and propose a law for the council to vote on. Much like in the first game, these laws range from child labor to work compensation laws. However, in order to pass a law you need a majority vote. The delegates will typically vote based on your performance, but you can negotiate or pressure delegates if things are looking dire. If you’re doing a really poor job, the council can even vote to remove you from office. Alternatively, Frostpunk 2 also has Twitch integration that will allow viewers to assume the role of the council--something that will surely make the experience much harder or significantly easier depending on the community.</p><blockquote><p>In order to match the scope and pace of Frostpunk 2, 11 Bit Studios needed to rework some of its fundamental city building mechanics.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Your performance isn’t the only thing the council factors into their decisions. Your relationship with different factions can also play a huge role. If you abuse the Frostlanders, don’t expect them to back you during the next town hall. Factions are much more than just political pawns, though. Each faction has its own set of beliefs that can inform your play style and shape your city. Some laws and research might directly support one faction while simultaneously harming another.</p><p dir="ltr">As Stokalski puts it, “Every faction has a vision that ends in something they would call utopia: a set of ultimate technologies [and] ultimate laws that for them is the ideal world. The trick is [...] that every utopia ends up being a dystopia for someone else. The core meaning of the game lies in you trying to navigate these different visions, and trying to find your way through it [to] build a society that you, as a player, leader, and human being, are comfortable with.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308501-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308501" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308501-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308501"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308501-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_07.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, Stokalski stressed that these difficult decisions aren’t built around shock value or gratuitousness. Choices designed to simply shock or frustrate the player have a short shelf life. The key, as he puts it, “lies in the fact that every step we [try] to include you, the player, and your values, worldview, and outlook into the game’s system itself.” It’s not always about picking the lesser of two evils, but filtering these decisions through your own beliefs and trying to make sense of the immediate consequences and the eventual repercussions.</p><p dir="ltr">Going into Frostpunk 2, my biggest concern was that the shift in scope would overshadow the intimacy of the original. Your meager population and how they reacted to your decisions brought that world to life, and that back and forth between you and your citizens gave Frostpunk character. It felt like the pace and mechanics of Frostpunk blended perfectly with its difficult decisions and tactile consequences. In theory, the more 11 Bit Studios zooms out and expands on that original idea, the more it could trivialize those intimate moments, but that isn’t the case here. Based on my preview, it seems Frostpunk’s cold, icy heart is still intact, despite its many shake-ups.</p>

This suggests Square Enix is close to revealing a proper look at the game and perhaps a release date, potentially during a showcase in summer 2024 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/e3-is-dead-for-good">when E3 once took place</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-remake-octopath-traveler">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake was announced as a recreation of the 1988 original</a>, meaning it will arrive more than three decades later. The HD-2D style was coined when Square Enix released Octopath Traveller for Nintendo Switch in 2018, which had 2D characters moving through high quality backgrounds in a tribute to classic turn-based RPGs.</p><p>These graphics contributed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-review">the game's 9/10 review from IGN</a>.
