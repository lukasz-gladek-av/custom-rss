		<p>Nintendo has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2’s</a> Joy-Con 2 controllers will not feature Hall Effect analogue sticks, which is sure to raise fears about Joy-Con drift rearing its head for the new generation console.</p>
<p>Having been rather coy about the underlying technology in press Q&amp;A sessions last week, Nintendo Life were able to get an actual answer out of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks">Nintendo of America’s Nate Bihldorff</a>, who confirmed that the new Joy-Con will not have Hall Effect sticks… but doesn’t state definitively whether that applies to the new Pro Controller.</p>


<p><strong>Nintendo Life – &nbsp;Let’s jump off the sensitivity stuff then and talk about the stick of the Switch 2 Joy-Con because it feels so different to the original Switch’s analog stick. So is it a Hall Effect stick? Were you inspired by the Hall Effect stick?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nate Bihldorff</strong> – Well, the Joy-Con 2’s controllers have been designed from the ground up. They’re not Hall Effect sticks, but they feel really good. Did you experience both the Joy-Con and the Pro Controller?</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life – Both!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nate Bihldorff</strong> – So, I like both, but that Pro Controller, for some reason the first time I grabbed it, I was like, “this feels like a GameCube controller.” I was a GameCube guy. Something about it felt so familiar, but the stick on that especially. I tried to spend a lot of time making sure that it was quiet. I don’t know if you tried really whacking the stick around but it really is [quiet]. I’m thinking back to my Smash Brothers days, where you just whack it. [The Switch 2 Pro Controller] is one of the quietest controllers I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>There’s certainly the possibility that the new Pro Controller has Hall Effect sticks, given that it has added features like back buttons that are typical of pro controllers, but we wouldn’t put money on it.</p>
<p>Having new analogue stick modules that are “designed from the ground up” could make them more resistant to the issue, but this will stil be massively disappointing for anyone who’s had Joy-Con Drift through the Nintendo Switch generation. Potentiometer analogue sticks use physical contact to determine the position of the stick, but this is prone to being worn down over time, and can have dust and residue build up that prevents a good contact. As this happens, Joy-Con can start to “drift” giving an incorrect reading from a neutral position that leads to a consistent directional input.</p>
<p>By contrast, Hall Effect sensors measure magnetic fields instead of using direct contact, making them nigh on impervious to the problem.</p>
<p>It’s not an issue that is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch – there’s definitely been an uptick in awareness of the problem amongst PlayStation and Xbox gamers as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/22/nintendo-joycon-drifting-fix-drift-legal-action/">Joy-Con Drift led to lawsuits</a>, to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/03/nintendo-will-fix-all-drifting-joy-con-for-free-in-uk-and-eu-even-outside-of-warranty/">Nintendo implementing blanket repair programmes</a> in certain regions, and a cottage industry of DIY repair kits on any open online marketplace. It even went so far that some accessory makers started to produce Hall Effect sticks and both offer them standalone, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/10/the-nyxi-wizard-is-a-gamecube-style-switch-joy-con-with-drift-proof-analogue-sticks/">use them extensively in third party and pro controllers</a>.</p>
<p>At the very least, we hope that Joy-Con 2 continue to use easily replaceable modules, as opposed to soldering the analogue sticks in place, making them better for repair, both at repair partners and by end users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/nintendos-ego-is-likely-why-switch-2-welcome-tour-isnt-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It goes without saying that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 showcase</a> and its announcements will be the biggest news of the year, but it was soured somewhat by an egotistical and elitist decision by Nintendo. They decided to make the greedy decision to charge money for what is nothing more than an interactive manual.</p>

<p><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>is a neat idea for a game to showcase the unique features of the Switch 2. You move a character around a huge Switch 2 to learn in message prompts and tech demos how everything works. A simple idea that I think most people would happily at least check out. We'd rather play something to show us what's new on Switch 2 than read about it, right?</p>

<h2><em>Welcome Tour</em> Is Certainly Not An <em>Astro's Playroom</em></h2>

<p>I am very down to screw around with whatever little clever demos Nintendo will have to show off the weird features that their first-party games will likely be the only ones to use. Pay for the privilege of participating in what is essentially marketing material though? Nintendo, you’re out of your mind.</p>

<p>The natural comparison is <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, the free game that comes with every PlayStation 5. It shows off all the cool features of the DualSense controller in a cleverly designed platformer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would have no problem paying for <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> at all, as there’s still the meat of a game to sink into even if I don’t care about the neat PlayStation easter eggs or DualSense showcases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-welcome-tour-slideshow.jpg?itok=V2GdkJx3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-welcome-tour-slideshow.jpg?itok=cECsYTmk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love PowerPoint, <em>Welcome Tour</em> may just be for you.</figcaption></figure><p>While I haven’t had a chance to check out <em>Welcome Tour</em> myself, there are <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/04/a-premium-instruction-manual" rel="nofollow">plenty of previews</a>&nbsp;from outlets that did have an opportunity. All come to a similar conclusion: <em>Welcome Tour </em>is not a game and no one knows what audience exists, if any, that would happily pay for it.</p>

<p>What makes this all even more baffling is that Nintendo had what is inarguably the greatest sales multiplier ever packed in for free in a console with <em>Wii Sports</em>. The Wii’s motion controls were novel and everyone had an immediate showcase of why they were so awesome. I bet a ton of homes still have a Wii hooked up and in use from time to time just for bowling.</p>

<p>Obviously, <em>Welcome Tour </em>doesn’t seem set up in the least to fill the same role as something like <em>Wii Sports</em>, but Nintendo has seen what free launch games can do. If this is nothing more than some mere marketing material in a snazzy presentation, I can’t quite understand the rationale to get to the decision to charge for it.</p>

<p>Maybe they see <em>Welcome Tour</em> as a mere curiosity that most aren't interested in so they want at least some return, where the potential value of getting something like <em>Wii Sports</em> into people's hands right away is readily understood. I refuse to believe that they think the attach rate for <em>Welcome Tour</em> will be all that high, though who knows what a company that seems to spin gold thinks about anything they create.</p>

<h2><em>Wii Sports</em> Was Free, So Why Not <em>Welcome Tour</em>?</h2>

<p>Nintendo hardly ever gives us insight into their decision making, design process, etc, though, so we'll never get a straight answer. They are pretty happy to go at their own pace and do their own thing. Obviously, it works out for them the majority of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We did get some insight from a book by Reggie Fils-Aimé, the former President of Nintendo of America, however. You can find an outline of the relevant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/reggie-had-to-fight-for-wii-sports-as-a-pack-in-and-miyamoto-wasnt-happy" rel="nofollow">excerpt here from Nintendo Life</a>.</p>

<p>As a quick summary, Reggie and others, particularly from Nintendo of America, were making the argument to include <em>Wii Sports </em>as a free pack-in with the Wii to then President of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata. Obviously, their arguments won out in the end, but there was strong disagreement from legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of <em>Mario</em>, <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and more.</p>

<p>Miyamoto is quoted as saying, “We do not give away our software,” citing the difficulty that comes in creating games.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nitnendo-welcome-tour-golf-minigame.jpg?itok=eh4zfmEv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nitnendo-welcome-tour-golf-minigame.jpg?itok=6tePiPSB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wii Sports</em> had golf, too, just a whole lot more of it.</figcaption></figure><p>In this context with <em>Wii Sports</em>, I am completely sympathetic to Miyamoto’s position here. Obviously, any game, particularly one trying to introduce a whole new way for players to interact with games, is incredibly hard to make well. I think Miyamoto and Nintendo’s track record overall speaks for itself in just how seriously they take making games and making them extremely well.</p>

<p>To toss in a game for free despite all of the hard work, sacrifice, and effort that it took to get it made in the first place? I can see why someone on the creative side like Miyamoto would be annoyed. It can easily come across as a devaluation of game designers’ work overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting back to <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour,</em> well, it’s no <em>Wii Sports</em>, <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, or even <em>Nintendo Land</em> for that matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Welcome Tour</em> is a virtual tour that looks more like a museum exhibit with PowerPoint presentations and minigames (emphasis on the mini) scattered throughout. As a real-life exhibit to showcase anything from Nintendo, that sounds pretty rad. A game from the company that emphasizes fun in all aspects of their game design that amounts to pretty basic edutainment is certainly not comparable.</p>

<h2>Not Everything You Touch is Gold, Nintendo</h2>

<p>So, Miyamoto and Nintendo overall, I totally stand with you on the righteous side of properly valuing the hard work of creatives. <em>Welcome Tour</em> just isn’t that, though, is it?</p>

<p>That is not to discount the hard work that went into its creation, however. But this is not a piece of software you're selling, it's an interactive instruction manual that should be categorized as marketing more than anything. Consumers aren't scrambling to pay for obvious ads, though. People don’t pay a premium to have ads put back into their services, right?</p>

<p>While Miyamoto’s quote above wasn’t about <em>Welcome Tour</em>, it’s hard not to see its potential influence in such a weird decision here. The arrogance to believe that this is in the same realm as something like a new <em>Mario </em>game is ego gone too far—this is just souped-up marketing material if Nintendo is being honest with themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope Nintendo reevaluates their position on this one, but it doesn’t seem like people will miss much if they don’t feel like shelling out for it anyway.</p>

"We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers. Their artistic capabilities. Their insight into how people play.

At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Looking outside Nintendo, Electronic Arts boss Andrew Wilson believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">AI could be used to develop games more quickly</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>'s live-action movie adaptation has reportedly found its writer and director, with A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski said to be at the helm.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-quiet-place-day-one-michael-sarnoski-death-stranding-1236360094/">Deadline</a>, Sarnoski - whose other directorial credits include 2021's Nicholas Cage-starring Pig and the upcoming Death of Robin Hood - will serve as director <em>and</em> writer on the project, which is a joint venture between Kojima Productions and A24.
</p>
<p>
A Death Stranding movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">initially announced in December 2022</a>, when it was said to be "on the fast track with development underway". Not long after, Kojima revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-taking-an-arthouse-approach-with-death-standing-movie">he's "aiming for a more arthouse approach" with the movie</a>, so it made total sense when last year brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">news of his partnership with A24</a> - the production and distribution company behind the likes of The Brutalist, Hereditary, Everything Everywhere All At One, and The Zone of Interest.

<p>
Beyond Sarnoski's reported involvement, little has been revealed about the Death Standing movie so far. It'll take place in the same post-apocalyptic setting as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sams-from-all-over-the-world-are-still-delivering-celebrates-kojima-with-latest-death-stranding-milestone">extremely popular</a> first game - which presumably means it'll also features invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, and other outlandish delights - but it's unclear if it'll be a direct adaptation or a brand-new story.
</p>
<p>
Either way, it sound like the Death Stranding movie is still some way off - but it's unlikely series fans will be too concerned given a fully fledged game sequel is launching very soon. As revealed last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> launches for PS5 on 26th June, complete with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">its very own fake Snake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">stop-motion puppet companion</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025.1157580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warzone Season 3 marks the long-awaited return of the Kilo 141 to cause chaos in Verdansk. Our Loadout will make the iconic AR dominate just as much as it did back in 2021.</p>



<p>Longtime series veterans will feel right at home on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> in Season 3. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/">HDR</a>, Grau, and Kilo 141 are all back, giving players access to the four weapons that initially reigned supreme on the map.</p>



<p>In addition, Verdansk has a fresh coat of paint, as Raven Software improved the beloved map with enhanced visuals, lighting, and new textures. As players return and try to determine which AR is the best in Season 3, the Kilo 141 stands out as a clear contender.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Which Optic you use comes down to personal preference, but the other attachments are a must. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/wz3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueGameData</a>, The <strong>AK-74 and CR-56 AMAX</strong> have the <strong>two fastest time-to-kill speeds</strong> among long-range meta weapons. In saying that, the Kilo 141 isn’t too far behind, and the AR is easier to control due to its forgiving recoil pattern and steady fire rate.</p>



<p>Although you won’t get the same damage output from the Kilo 141 as with the CR-56 AMAX or AK-74, the reliable AR has a faster fire rate and bullet velocity than other top choices and shines even brighter with this set of attachments. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Willis 3X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Monolithic Suppressor </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>UnderBarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II </li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Be aware that this SMG does have some kick despite the attachments. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the Kilo 141 is better suited for medium and long-range engagements, the best sidekick for this AR is an SMG to support short-range gunfights between 0 and 10 meters. </p>



<p>After having its maximum, medium, and minimum damage ranges buffed in Season 3 and its upper torso damage multiplier, the Kompakt 92 has the fastest time-to-kill of 550 milliseconds up to 13 meters away. A difficult-to-reign-in recoil pattern means using this SMG requires significant skill, but it’s lethal in the right hands. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Compensator </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Infiltrator Stockn</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Scavenger</strong>, <strong>Tracker</strong>, and <strong>Alertness</strong> are the best trio of Perks in Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1: </strong>Scavenger (Start equipped with maximum reserve ammo for your primary weapon. Resupply ammo equipment and plates from dead enemies)&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2: </strong>Tracker (See enemy footsteps. Bullets you fire briefly outline an enemy for you and your squad)</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Alertness (Sense enemies when enemies are nearby. Tell when you are being aimed at by the enemy)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Since armor plates are so hard to come by, <strong>Scavenger</strong> is a must-use Perk for every loadout because you can get more armor off dead enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, losing enemies while chasing after them on Verdansk is easy, so <strong>Tracker </strong>allows you to see their recent footsteps. Also, hitting an enemy further away increases the time they are outlined. And even though Raven Software added new objects on the map to provide cover in open areas, there is always the danger of getting taken out by a one-shot sniper or an enemy with better positioning than you. <strong>Alertness</strong> alleviates this issue by pinging your screen when someone sees you.</p>







<p><strong>Overkill</strong> is the best Wildcard to use. In Season 3, Raven Software removed the ability to purchase loadout weapons from the Buy Station. As a result, the only way to acquire loadout weapons is through loadout drops. </p>



<p>So, while having three extra attachments on a weapon with the Gunfighter Wildcard would be nice, we recommend using Overkill to give you a second primary weapon because acquiring one will otherwise be difficult. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-kilo-141-in-warzone">How to unlock Kilo 141 in Warzone</h2>



<p><strong>The Kilo 141 is a reward in Warzone’s return to Verdansk event, meaning all you have to do is log in to the battle royale to unlock the AR instantly.</strong></p>

This video game movie has had the support of various toy marketing campaigns from the very beginning, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Minecraft Movie LEGO sets</a> as well as McDonald's toys targeted specifically at adults. But if you're in the market for a Nerf gun after seeing the movie in theaters, you also already have quite a few options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is offering new discounts on a variety of Nerf <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Weapons">Minecraft weapons</a> based on <em>actual </em>Minecraft weapons. Each of these Nerf picks have the ability to shoot darts, even if they don't necessarily appear to be able to. They are also all fairly cheap compared to other Minecraft toys on the market right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Nerf Minecraft Deals at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four Nerf Minecraft deals at Amazon right now, and almost all of them are at their lowest prices of 2025. The best deal within this list is the Minecraft Pillager's Crossbow, which has only recently <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CSLJH4M5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">droppped to its lowest-ever price</a> of $19.99. This is one of the most affordable Nerf crossbows you can buy, and it also doubles as a wonderful Minecraft gift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of this blaster, there's also the Nerf Minecraft axe and hammer, which are each under $20 and at their lowest prices in 2025. While they don't function as effectively as a standard Nerf gun, they look awesome and are still able to fire darts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Nerf Minecraft option that is on sale is the Sabrewing Motorized Blaster. Although it is arguably the coolest thing on sale right now, it is nowhere near its lowest price of 2025. It is, however, still priced below $20 and is the most enticing actualy Nerf Blaster on this list. It also has the largest dart capacity at eight darts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Nerf Ammo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you’ve secured a Nerf Blaster, grabbing some extra darts or rounds is always a good idea. If you’ve ever played with one of these before, you know that ammo goes missing way too quickly. Luckily, a range of nerf darts are on sale. Big 100 packs for an epic war with friends or smaller, ultra-cheap sets to replace a few missing darts are all discounted right now. Just be sure to grab the right ammo.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 7, 2025 4:58 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/">La Quimera</a> is a new story-driven, sci-fi co-operative shooter from the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, now known as Reburn. We now have a release date set for this new shooter.</p>
<p>It'll be arriving on PC on Steam at the end of this month, on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2025</strong>, though anyone who is keen to try the game as soon as possible can request to be a part of a closed beta test the studio is hosting for 24 hours beginning this Saturday, April 12, 2025. You can register your interest for the beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>La Quimera takes players to a dystopian version of Latin America in the year 2064, where most of the global systems we know today have collapsed, and humanity continues on in fractured segments around the world. It's a confusing and chaotic time, but it's also the golden age for private mercenary forces, which is where you come in.</p>
<p>That setting is also what lends the game to its cooperative experience while also being a story-driven game. You can play through the story with two friends alongside you, taking advantage of all the futuristic gadgets you'll have, like exoskeletons that make you stronger and faster and weapons that are unlike any of the killing machines we have today.</p>
<p>Along with announcing the release date, Reburn also revealed a new gameplay trailer, which you can check out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, Reburn's chief executive officer and co-founder, also added in the announcement that "<em>Our Reburn team can't wait to finally share our hard work and vision for La Quimera on April 25. </em><em>[...] As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn't be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we're profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience."</em></p>

One solution to this problem is to use Hall Effect thumbsticks that are basically resistant to drifting as they use <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor#Human_interface_devices&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor#Human_interface_devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetic fields</a></span> and are less susceptible to parts wearing down and failing over time. Unfortunately, Nintendo isn’t using Hall Effect sticks for the Switch 2 Joy-Cons and that has a lot of fans nervous. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with <em>Nintendo Life</em></a></span>, Nate Bihldorff, senior vice president of product development &amp; publishing at Nintendo of America, confirmed that the Switch 2 doesn’t use Hall Effect sticks. </p><p>“Well, the Joy-Con 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up. They’re not Hall Effect sticks, but they feel really good,” said Bihldorff. </p><p>Bihldorff further explained that the sticks on the Pro Contoller are very quiet and feel great, but didn’t specify if they are Hall Effect thumbsticks or not. Based on the fact that Bihldorff’s media training kicked in when asked about stick drift (a negative topic) and he pivoted to something related, but positive, I’m guessing the Pro Controller also doesn’t have Hall Effect sticks. </p><p>The VP did reiterate something Nintendo previously confirmed, which is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers have been completely redesigned from the ground up. </p><p> “As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up from scratch, and they have been designed to have bigger movement and smoother movement,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-stick-drift-joy-con-eshop-fix-better-nintendo-1851774614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-stick-drift-joy-con-eshop-fix-better-nintendo-1851774614">said Switch 2 hardware design lead Tetsuya Sasaki last week during a press event.</a></span> </p><p>That’s nice and all, but if you look at the replies to<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nintendolife/status/1909230951323877448&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nintendolife/status/1909230951323877448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Nintendo Life</em>’s tweet about the lack of Hall Effect sticks</a></span>, you can see a lot of people who are worried that the Switch 2 will be plagued with stick drift issues. This news, coupled with high prices, delayed pre-orders, and questions about what is included in a Switch 2 physical game case, have really overshadowed what was likely supposed to be a big, fun reveal for Nintendo. It will be interesting to see how the company navigates the current storm. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 will be released on April 8 across all platforms. It will bring improvements, bug fixes, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-title-update-1-0-2">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2</h2>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows development team has been working on this first batch of improvements since launch, and the changes in this update have been inspired by player feedback. Title update 1.0.2 for AC Shadows features several highlights, including selling and dismantling multiple items, the ability to reset mastery nodes, horse improvements, an Investigation Board shortcut and PS5 Pro enhancements. Check out all the new improvements and changes in the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 below:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-horse-improvements">Horse Improvements</h3>



<p>The first significant improvement from tomorrow’s AC Shadows update features changes towards the horse. Players can activate the pathfinder to enable Auto-Follow, and the horse will automatically follow the road to the destination. Also, horses are now quicker in cities, so players can glide through these areas much faster.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-mastery-nodes-reset">Mastery Nodes Reset</h3>



<p>Many fans will appreciate this change as it lets them fine-tune their builds according to their preferred play styles. Players can now reset Mastery Nodes for both Yasuke and Naoe, allowing you to test different play styles before finding what suits you the best. It also lets you explore all the game has to offer gameplay-wise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-selling-and-dismantling-multiple-items">Selling and Dismantling Multiple Items</h3>



<p>This is an exciting update for players who have been hoarding resources during exploration. It will allow them to manage and utilize their surplus items efficiently. The new update will add an option to tag and sell/dismantle multiple items in shops or while dismantling gear at the Forge.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-investigation-board-shortcut">Investigation Board Shortcut</h3>



<p>One of the features of the new update will let you reach the investigation board faster than ever before. After the update is released, you only need to hold the ‘Options’ button for a few seconds to teleport to the Investigation Board. A single press will still let you open the inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-ps5-pro-improvements-for-ac-shadows">PS5 Pro Improvements for AC Shadows</h3>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has received dedicated PS5 Pro improvements in Title Update 1.0.2. Firstly, PSSR support has been added, and players playing before the upcoming update must manually enable this mode through video settings. Also, the balanced mode will feature ‘Raytraced Specular,’ providing visual fidelity close to PS5 Pro Quality mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-other-improvements-in-new-ac-shadows-update">Other Improvements in New AC Shadows Update</h3>



<p>The upcoming update includes some miscellaneous improvements across the game; you can check them in the list below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>The Hideout framerate has been uncapped to above 30 fps in Performance Mode.</li>



<li>Boss fights have received improved balancing.</li>



<li>An issue where the pathfinder line appeared in photos taken in Photomode has been fixed.</li>



<li>Inconsistencies with the ‘Throw a Kunai at the closest enemy after an assassination’ perk when ‘The Tool Master Gear’ is equipped on Naoe have been fixed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Double Assassinations have been improved.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Naoe’s responsiveness, in some instances, has been improved.</li>
</ul>

What follows is a series of intense mech battles as the warring factions fight for control of the world.</p><p>You can customize your Arsenal (mech) and explore Titanic Scion's open world solo or alongside up to two friends in the online cooperative mode. The sequel has been pitched as a standalone experience, so you don't need to play the original before diving in. That said, it is worth checking out regardless.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to Aftermath’s second Inside Baseball week, a whole week of stories about the ins and outs of video game development, games journalism, and what it’s like to run a worker-owned website.</p><p>We did our first <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/inside-baseball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inside Baseball</a> week back when Aftermath was just four months old, and it turned out to be one of the most fun (and successful) weeks in the site’s history. In the time since, we’ve been doing <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of the</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kind</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of work</a> that inspired that first theme week, and we want to use this Inside Baseball week to celebrate the best of what Aftermath can do: tell the stories of real people in game development and games journalism, dig deeply into niche topics, tell you how journalism works, and do the kinds of off-the-cuff blogs that other sites have less and less room for in their owners’ pursuit of traffic and ad dollars.</p><p>We tell you this a lot, but we can only do all of this because of YOU, our readers. The growth of the site since our first Inside Baseball week has been incredible; thanks to you, we’ve been able to bring on a new contributor, run more freelance stories, start a new podcast, and more. (We’ll have a bigger update on our goal this week.) If you’re a subscriber, <strong>thank you</strong>–every single one of you who believes in what we’re doing here, who sends us tips, who makes our Discord fun and our comments worth reading, who shares our work or says nice things about the site on social media or in our inboxes. We’ve been at this a while, but it still amazes us that Aftermath isn’t just working, but growing and thriving. None of that would be possible without you and your support.</p><p>If you aren’t a subscriber yet, but you’ve been curious about us or enjoying our work, we’d love to have you. We have a <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">range of subscription tiers</a>, as well as gift subscriptions if you have a journalism-loving person in your life. We know times are tough right now, so if a subscription isn’t in the cards, we’d love it if you’d spread the word about Aftermath, contribute to our <a href="https://aftermath.site/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tip jar</a>, or just let us know you're enjoying the site.</p><p>We started Aftermath when things were looking pretty bleak for journalism, and… well, they aren’t looking much better. But this site has been a bright spot for us–not just because it helps pay our bills, but because we can get up every day and make the work we want for readers who want it too, without having to squeeze in ad breaks or justify ourselves to owners. We’ll keep doing it for as long as we can, and we're so glad to have you with us.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders"><h3>Nintendo’s Long Line Of Hits Followed By Misses Might Continue With Switch 2</h3></a><p>"The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Jack Black’s Steve introduces the newly arrived humans to his village, young teenager Henry sees a pig walk past wearing a crown. He asks, “Is he some kind of king?” And for those in the know, the blubbing begins.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re a follower of <em>Minecraft</em> on YouTube, or the parent of one, you’ll inevitably have heard of Technoblade. The YouTuber, whose real name was Alexander, tragically died from cancer in 2022, aged only 22. A member of Dream SMP, which featured many of the biggest names in the field, Technoblade became known for his incredible skill at the game, and for a YouTube channel with 11 million subscribers.</p><p>Since his untimely death, Technoblade has been canonized by his contemporaries and followers, his name spoken with a lovely reverence. My own kid, only really getting into <em>Minecraft </em>YouTube since Technoblade’s passing, has learned this reverential tone and almost whispers his name. The point is, he was a great YouTuber, respected by his peers, and someone who actively fought against fame for the protection of his family. (His first name only became known after he died, and his last name is still unknown.) One of the many lines of text that can appear when you launch <em>Minecraft </em>reads “Technoblade never dies!”</p><p>So back to that scene in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. The bejeweled pig that Henry spots is a reference to Technoblade, whose in-game avatar was a bipedal pig wearing a crown (as seen in the image at the top of this article). The character asks, “Is he some kind of king?”</p><p>“No,” says Jack Black, before a long pause. Then with gravitas adds, “He’s a <em>legend</em>.”</p><p>You can see the moment in somewhat dubiously sourced footage in the following video:</p><p>Before the line had been delivered, just when the pig appeared on screen, all around me in the movie theater I heard kids going, “Technoblade!” with absolute delight in their voices. My son leant over to me and whispered with wide eyes, “That was Technoblade! That pig was Technoblade!” When he explained the reference to my wife in the parking lot as we left, and then solemnly delivered the “No, he’s a legend” line, she cried. She’d never even heard of him before, but the sincerity and touching nature of the tribute—it’s making me well up a bit as I type.</p><p>It turns out it’s only in the movie thanks to the kid playing Henry. According to an interview with director Jared Hess <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Collider</em></a></span>, Sebastian Hansen approached him during the film’s prep and said, “Look, there’s this amazing <em>Minecraft</em> player named Technoblade who passed away, and I would love to be able to honor him somehow in the film.” Hess says he spoke with the design team, and they worked it all out.</p><p>It’s fun to note there were many other easter eggs hidden in there for <em>Minecraft</em> diehards, like a Totem of Undying in Steve’s collection that would make the characters’ journey so much easier if only they knew what it was. And there was another theaterful of excited murmuring when Mojang’s Jens Bergensten appears as a silent waiter in a blink-or-miss-it moment. But of all the film’s fleeting nods to this or that, the tribute to Technoblade is the most special, and no doubt the one that will cause the most lips to quiver with emotion.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-12-year-low-amid-company-uncertainty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s stock prices have continued to fall, hitting a 12-year low on both the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBI-FR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paris Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">London Stock Exchange</a>. As of the markets closing in the region, Ubisoft stock is trading under €9 for the first time since April 2013.</p>



<p>As of publishing, the stock is sitting at €8.80 after falling another 7.83% on Monday. At one point it sat at €8.27 before it rose back to the closing number.</p>



<p>The reasons for the continued drop of Ubisoft’s stock prices should be surprising to anyone who has followed the company over the years. Since April 2024, Ubisoft’s shares have fallen 62.9% from its 52-week high of €23.70 to the €8.80 it currently sits. The company’s shares fell under €10 back in late October 2024 when it was announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows would be delayed to 2025. However, it rebounded slightly back to over €14 per share not long after.</p>







<p>Fast forward to late March and early April, the company’s prices continued to gradually drop again. The big drop came, however, after Ubisoft announced it had reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a deal with Tencent</a> on a new subsidiary that would include the publisher’s three biggest franchises—Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin’s Creed—and give Tencent a 25% stake in the new venture. After a slight uptick, stock prices fell from €13.15 on March 27, the day of the deal, to €10.70 in just three days of trading. Since then, the prices continued to fall to what they are now. </p>



<p>There’s also the global uncertainty surrounding a potential recession that has the entire market falling over the last handful days. </p>

                <p>Grammy-winning artist Sabrina Carpenter is on her way to Fortnite with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">skins, music packs, and more</a>. Officially announced in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-hearts-fortnite-festival-in-season-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Fortnite website, the artist will headline Fortnite Festival Season 8 as this season's Icon, beginning on April 8.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Festival is sort of like a Rock Band-like game mode that lives within Fortnite and lets up to four players perform together online. Carpenter is the latest of Festival Icons joining Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-4-adds-lots-of-metallica-and-a-pvp-mode/1100-6524173/" data-ref-id="1100-6524173">Metallica</a>.</p><p>"I've always found it exciting for fans to be able to interact and engage with music through different art forms and to interact in a way that’s genuinely fun," Carpenter told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/sabrina-carpenter-fortnite-headliner-1235311131/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> in a statement. "So, for the fans that haven't been able to come to the tour, or to any new fans, this is such a special way to still be a part of Short n' Sweet world."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471959"></a><figcaption>Give your game a shot of Espresso with these looks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg"></figure><p>By unlocking the Season Eight Music Pass, players can access a ton of new Carpenter-inspired content, including new Jam Tracks "Juno" and "Nonsense," which are fully playable as performances with others in Festival. Of course, the biggest selling point is the ability to play as Sabrina herself, who comes with two skins (each with two color variations) based on outfits from her recent Short n’ Sweet tour.</p><p>To purchase the music pass, Fortnite players need 1,400 V-Bucks (roughly $13). After that, players will immediately unlock the yellow babydoll Sabrina Carpenter Outfit--with an included Lego Style. The outfit resembles the one she wore on her most recent tour. At the end of the pass, players will receive a similar bodysuit, another look from her tour.</p><p>One of the bigger changes coming this season will be the renaming of Fortnite emotes; all of those that include dancing will now be aptly called dance emotes in the Locker. While using a dance emote, any player can do the same dance with you--even if they don't own the emote. There will be two Sabrina-inspired dance emotes this season: the Taste Emote and the Please Please Please Emote, which are each choreographed to the song they're tied to.</p><p>As the season progresses, players can unlock more Sabrina goodies like a skirt and boots inspired by another tour look. This has a pink default Style, a Baby Blue alt Style, and another Lego version. There will also be a matching lipstick-stained purse with both pink and blue stylings. Lastly, customizations like her own Battle Bus contrail and microphone.</p><p>Since launching in late 2023, Fortnite Festival has been bringing in a new headlining artist every three months or so. The current season is headlined by virtual pop star <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassin-creed-shadows-latest-patch-brings-fan-requested-features-and-ps5-pro-improvements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft is poised to release another patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and it's the game's most substantial update yet, introducing a range of fan-requested features alongside the likes of enhancements to improve visual fidelity on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ever since Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch at the end of last month, fans have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">sharing their wishlist of features</a>, and Ubisoft has clearly been listening. Tomorrow's 1.0.2 update brings back the "follow path" option seen in previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>, for instance, meaning mounts can now Auto-Follow the road to a marked destination when the pathfinder is enabled. Additionally, horse speeds have been increased in cities.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, players can reset Mastery Nodes in Naoe and Yasuke's skill trees if they fancy trying out different playstyles, and it's also possible to sell and dismantle multiple items to save time. That applies both when trading with merchants and when dismantling items at the Hideout's Forge. And here's another time-saving addition: update 1.0.2 lets players quickly access the Investigation Board by holding down the Option button for a few seconds.

<p>
As for those aforementioned PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, patch 1.0.2 introduces PSSR - which will need to be manually enabled if you've already been playing on the console - and adds Raytraced Specular support to Balanced mode. This, says Ubisoft, will bring visual fidelity closer to PS5 Pro's Quality mode than Performance mode.
</p>
<p>
There's actually quite a bit more going on in patch 1.0.2, too, including the removal of the 30fps frame rate cap while in the Hideout when using Performance mode on consoles. That's in addition to boss fight balancing, improved Double Assassinations, and improvements to Naoe's responsiveness "in some instances". All the above arrives alongside a sizeable list of bug fixes, as <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/2FUDlIPb2uWk5Ldb8OhKej">detailed in Ubisoft's patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Shadows creative director Jonathon Dumont previously discussed Ubisoft's plans to address fan-requested features post-launch, noting the studio was "always listening and monitoring what players are doing" and considering "constructive feedback". Dumont did, for instance, confirm Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-actively-looking-at-adding-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode">"actively looking at" introducing a tougher difficulty</a>, although that particular addition sounds like it might be further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows has, of course, got off to a strong start, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">topping over 2m players</a> in its first couple of days - a figure Ubisoft says means it's "now surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey". Its critical reception has been positive too, with Eurogamer's Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">calling Shadows "majestic in scope" and "impressive in detail" in his four star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-death-stranding-movie-has-found-a-writer-and-director-in-a-quiet-place-day-ones-michael-sarnoski/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When the announcement was made that a<a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/"> Death Stranding film</a> adaptation was in the works, fans immediately assumed that Hideo Kojima would direct the film and potentially even pen the script. Kojima's well-known love for movies and cinema had everyone assuming he'd be in the driver's seat for the adaptation.</p>
<p>That's not the case, though, as Kojima explicitly said at <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/">2024's Tokyo Game Show</a> that he absolutely does not have time to direct the movie himself. He also explained that because he had originally viewed the story of Death Stranding as a game, it wasn't in his interest to "<em>look back at it and try to see it from a movie perspective.</em>"</p>
<p>That is why the search for a director would go beyond Kojima, and as&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-quiet-place-day-one-michael-sarnoski-death-stranding-1236360094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline</a> reported on Monday, the search is over. Michael Sarnoski, the director of A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig, has been chosen to write and direct the Death Stranding film adaptation.</p>
<p>According to the report, the adaptation will "<em>delve into the mysteries surrounding the 'Death Stranding' - a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.</em>"</p>
<p>It's been more than two years since the film adaptation of Death Stranding was announced, and now that the project has a writer and director confirmed, it'll likely be another two years at least, before we can expect to see any news regarding a release date.</p>
<p>Sarnoski also won't be jumping on the project until he's wrapped up post-production work on his next upcoming film, Death of Robin Hood, which is also being produced by A24. At least now we know that real work on the project can move forward with Sarnoski officially at the helm. The next big question is whether the star-studded cast from the game will return for the film.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kojima Productions is currently finishing its work on Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 26</a> for PlayStation 5.</p>

You can even break off chunks of the world and use that to destroy stuff.

If you go off and explore a corner of the map for 30 minutes, when you return to where you started you’ll see all the damage you previously wrought. And all of this devastation is recreated in real-time in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>’s in-game map!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-recommend-id="image://13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-recommend-id="image://13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Not only can you punch and destroy nearly every square inch of the levels in <em>Bananza</em>, but all this material behaves differently depending on what it is. </p><p>For example, a chunk of soft mud can’t break hard rock or metal, but you can toss it at enemies or walls and it will stick. On the flip side, harder materials can be ripped out of the ground and used as temporary hammers to increase Donkey Kong’s destructive power. It’s the kind of feature that’s hard to sell in a trailer but will likely help the game feel more next gen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-recommend-id="image://8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-recommend-id="image://8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Bananza </em>you don’t simply have a punch button. Instead, you have three punch buttons letting you punch up, down, and forward. You can also slap the ground to reveal hidden items buried beneath rock and dirt. Or just slap the ground to break stuff in a different way. Whatever you feel like.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-recommend-id="image://b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-recommend-id="image://b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Why is Donkey Kong destroying everything? What is his motivation? Well, he’s trying to collect a new material that has appeared call Banandium. This is a valuable mineral that can be found hidden around the map and which act like Mario’s stars. However, Donkey Kong eats Banandium when he finds it. Seems dangerous, but what do I know?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c42f43285190ba62b4369eb42ba6665c" data-recommend-id="image://c42f43285190ba62b4369eb42ba6665c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c42f43285190ba62b4369eb42ba6665c" data-recommend-id="image://c42f43285190ba62b4369eb42ba6665c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is very different than past <em>DK</em> games, Nintendo isn’t ditching the past completely.

But he can  destroy them, too. And when you fight these baddies you’ll notice that they can damage the environment just like you can. This means that battles against enemies will leave permanent potholes and divots around the world.

Marathon is Bungie's first new game since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> in 2017, though Destiny has received regular updates and expansions since then.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans still don't have many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">official details of what playing Marathon will entail</a> aside from the usual extraction genre staples of competing against other teams to make it out alive with a bag of precious loot (though a brief teaser clip for the gameplay reveal does include a pink robotic cat). Bungie provided a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-gets-its-first-update-in-over-a-year-albeit-with-few-new-details/1100-6527427/" data-ref-id="1100-6527427">detail-light update in October 2024 that hinted Marathon would be bringing a hero shooter</a> approach to the genre, implying some of what some "Runners" (Marathon's name for player characters) would be able to do. A report from around the same time indicated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/" data-ref-id="1100-6526561">Marathon would be $40</a> and not free-to-play, but it's unclear if that is still Bungie's plan or if plans have changed.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-as-employees-fear-more-layoffs-report/1100-6521967/" data-ref-id="1100-6521967">new game director, Joe Ziegler,</a> in late 2023 following layoffs at Bungie. He previously worked at Riot on its popular free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a>. The game's old director, Chris Barrett, was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-marathon-director-chris-barrett-sues-sony-and-bungie-after-unfounded-firing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly let go from Bungie</a> for alleged misconduct towards women coworkers, and is now suing Bungie and parent company Sony alleging he was fired without cause. Another round of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">layoffs at Bungie, which affected 220 people</a>, happened in July 2024 following the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but does not have an official release date or window just yet. No doubt more information will be revealed at the Marathon gameplay showcase, so fans won't have to wait long for more news.</p>
