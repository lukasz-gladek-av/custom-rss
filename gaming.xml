<h2>Fly Like a Blood Eagle</h2><p>One of the major selling points of <em>Cloudheim</em> is its fast-paced, high-flying combat. You begin the game with a triple jump by default; that alone should give you an idea of the tone being set here.</p><p>Combat mainly involves fighting a dozen small enemies and a couple of larger (usually armored) enemies and scoring dozens or hundreds of hits in a single battle. You have a few abilities that you can use situationally, and damage can be avoided by dodging on the ground or in the air.</p><p>That's not to say that you can bounce around the battlefield forever. Every ability — including your dodge — has a certain number of charges. Use up those charges, and casting that ability again will cause "mana burn" to build up.</p><p>If you fill up the mana burn meter, you both slow down and lose the ability to cast any of your abilities. In principle, the idea is to use combos and abilities carefully to take down enemies without building up too much mana burn.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current state of combat feels a little bland. I successfully button-mashed my way through 50 or so hours of gameplay with few problems; as long as I dodged the more serious enemy attacks, I was fine. Another layer of complexity is needed here for the combat system to truly feel engaging.</p><figure role="group">

The back of this turtle serves as a safe haven where you can build crafting devices, specialized structures, and decorations.</p><blockquote><p>The shop you run on Odin's Shell is critical for progressing the building system and unlocking more support structures.</p></blockquote><p>You're not alone on this island, either. Adorable little creatures called "Blins" inhabit this place with you, and they can be assigned to certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-building-guide-how-to-get-blins" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="de5d4611-4621-4a93-b9c8-33c18678a2e4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">buildings</a> to work for you. You could, for example, assign a Blin to a prospecting site. When you next return to Odin's Shell, you'll find that it is filled with crafting materials for you to mine.</p><p>Perhaps the strangest inclusion of all is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-shop-guide-how-to-sell-items" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="314316d3-dc01-4826-a864-237ed4ac24e4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shop</a>. Though it only occupies a small part of the game's description, the shop you run on Odin's Shell is critical for progressing the building system and unlocking more support structures.</p><p>Alternating between exploring the world, advancing quests, and selling items in your shop forms the core gameplay loop of <em>Cloudheim</em>. It can be fairly engaging and entertaining (combat shallowness aside) — at least when it comes to the systems that are actually implemented.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Missing Mechanics</h2><p>A casual scroll through the building options or the in-game archive makes it seem like <em>Cloudheim</em> has a lot to offer. My actual experience with the pre-launch version of the game, however, painted a somewhat different picture.</p><p>Important systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-forge-guide-purify-and-smelt-ore" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="496c455c-6646-4c23-ac60-1f9c6601e4e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">smelting and forging weapons</a> are implemented, and they work well enough. In the early game, it doesn't really feel like anything is missing. This changes as you advance deeper into the game and the building system.</p><p>Take Alchemy, for example. You can find and grow plants that can then be converted into potions. However, the potions you get are entirely random, and they have no gameplay effect whatsoever; currently, potions are only used as stock for the shop.</p><p>This also applies to cooking. Menus allude to cooked food, and you can find bits of food (such as cheese wheels) as random loot, but you can't actually do anything with food other than sell it.</p><p>The lack of practical cooking and alchemy applications also renders the fishing system somewhat useless. I'm sure the alchemy, cooking, and fishing systems will get fleshed out some more in future updates. For now, there isn't much there.</p><p>I also encountered one major chunk of missing content at the end of the second island. Although the map implies that you can visit four major regions, the final dungeon at the end of the second island simply doesn't open. Progression tends to drag toward this point, making it much more difficult to move on to the third and fourth islands.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Cloudheim</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Like many games of this style, <em>Cloudheim</em> has a lot of potential. The first island of content is solid, and the second island has a good chunk of content on it. You can probably expect a solid 20 or so hours of gameplay from what's there.</p><p>That said, there are still plenty of rough edges that need to be ironed out. If you're fine with trying a game that is very Early Access in a lot of ways right now, you should consider checking out <em>Cloudheim</em> and enjoying a somewhat different take on the whole Viking thing.</p><hr><p><em>Cloudheim</em> was previewed over approximately 50 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2070270/Cloudheim/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher.

From developer The-Mark Entertainment, this indie cozy sandbox‑building game will transport players to the most tranquil and gorgeous locations, where the main objective is to design and build their dream getaway home.</p><p>As such, they will have plenty of tools and customization options at their disposal to make their perfect getaway retreat worthy of gracing the pages of Architectural Digest and House &amp; Garden. So, to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/petit-planet-preview-hoyoverses-foray-into-life-sims" rel="nofollow">budding cozy gamers</a>, maybe wondering if Log Away is the ultimate destination sandbox building game to hit the shelves, or maybe the best holiday destination is right at home?</p><h2>Bags Packed And Ready To Go</h2><p><em>Log Away</em> is the indie cozy sandbox‑building game developer The-Mark Entertainment, where the main goal is to design, build, and decorate their dream cabin retreats. Set against the backdrop of some of the most awe-inspiring, picturesque locations that can be described as locations that would be found on National Geographic, no two cabin homes will be the same, as players have access to unique construction tools and customization options to decorate their exterior and interior spaces to their hearts' content.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As one who thoroughly enjoys cozy games with robust building components in their gameplay, one was pleasantly surprised by how much content players will have access to in helping them create some gorgeously designed spaces. Whether it's a warm and cozy retreat perfect for finishing that novel along the snow-capped mountains, a mostly soundproof home to record that next radio smash hit, or a beach house to welcome family and friends for the holidays, there's plenty of design and decorating elements for players to explore and have fun with.</p><p>Sure, not everything featured in <em>Log Away</em> is perfect, and there are a few missed windows of opportunity that could've been capitalized on, aside from some technical issues experienced; this indie cozy sandbox‑building game makes for the ideal game to escape the toils and troubles of the world. And to celebrate the game's release, players can adorn their home in time for Christmas with themed seasonal items as part of a free DLC available until December 11th, 2025.</p><h2>Synergized Hearts And Spaces</h2><p>Jumping into <em>Log Away</em> comes with some hand-holding before players can truly let their creativity run freely, as a tutorial will guide players in learning gameplay and control basics. Additionally, they'll have access to plenty of building and decorating components and items to lay the foundations of the dream vacation home, from minimalist, rustic pieces to modern chic and beach-themed items, and, of course, seasonal Christmas items available through the themed DLC.</p><p>While the primary goal is to design and build their home away from home, they also have a Coziness System, which is fronted by the Cozy Heart. This unique mechanic, akin to a "thermometer" is an in-game meter that gradually gets filled up based on how cozy your living spaces are, or as the developer states, "a reflection of coziness" and this can be achieved by the number of items placed on the plot, where they're placed and more importantly, if these placed items match similar items to develop a synergy (think a table and chairs).</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>One will admit they didn't pay much attention to these synergies at first, as they were stumped when they realized the Cozy Heart meter wasn't gradually building up as one wanted; it was after rereading the tutorial that one realized that placing similar items together increased one's coziness meter. Additionally, it could be said that items from the same destination, pick, or interest may help increase a home's coziness; however, this was challenging to track and confirm.</p><p>Regardless, by default, we were placing similar objects together, for example: items attributed to the Writing interest or from a seaside/beach landscape can help increase the coziness if placed together in the same area. This may help and guide players into designing and decorating their indoor and outdoor spaces more thematically, and once maxxed out, they'll earn mementos called Keepsakes, each of which has an associated backstory and memory, and can be placed within their spaces to showcase them proudly.</p><p>These Keepsakes are specific to the interests players selected for their retreat, as there are 24 Keepsakes per interest to discover and obtain, but they cannot be acquired in a single retreat, so multiple retreat builds are likely needed for all Keepsakes to be unlocked. Nevertheless, players will be able to enjoy what Log Away has to offer without time constraints or pressure from them, and instead can be best enjoyed in their own time.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>To make the most of their in-game cozy experiences while designing and building their dream retreat, there are a few additional features to enjoy, including a photo mode with unique filters and options to capture their beautiful homes (which can make for great postcards). The game also features soundtracks to serve as the main playlist while building their homes, as players can change up the soundtrack, but also toggle day and night time, and seasons to find the perfect weather conditions to warm up to in their beautifully decorated homes.</p><h2>Not Quite A Warm Welcome</h2><p>As mentioned before, not everything included or offered in <em>Log Away</em> is picture-perfect, and we had our fair share of issues we've encountered during the review process. Gameplay-wise, the biggest gripe during the review process is the lack of real estate when building our holiday cabin, as players will only have a 7x7 plot to work with.</p><p>As someone who's spent hours in <em>Tiny Glade</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/palia-starter-guide" rel="nofollow"><em>Palia</em></a>, both games which provide massive plot for players to build and decorate their homes, this small-sized plot is quite restrictive and at times, quite challenging to work with, especially towards maxxing out the Cozy Heart meter. Switching gears to game optimization and performance, when loading a saved game file or starting a new retreat, the graphics appeared distorted or grainy/grain-like, which, coupled with slow loading times, was a slight annoyance to be confronted with.</p><p>While the game controls are simple and easy to understand, toggling between building, furnishing, and decorating (or BFD stamps) can be clunky at times; the camera movement is what quickly became a slight nuisance. Whether it was to zoom in to place an object carefully or remove flowers or pathing, or zoom out to get the full view of our progress on the project, the camera movement and speed are extremely clunky and laggy, which makes using Photo Mode quite frustrating.</p><h2><em>Log Away</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<p><em>Log Away</em> provided the ideal form of escapism, transporting players to tranquil destinations where they could build and decorate their dream vacation home. With plenty of building tools, furnishings, and decor items available for players to access on top of the thematical items and the Christmas DLC, players will be well occupied in designing, building, and decorating their spaces.</p><p>The game's coziness system is at the very heart of creating the ideal ambiance for their perfect getaway home by maximizing what space they have with the pieces they've selected to increase the coziness and, by doing so, unlocking Keepsakes. However, there are a few issues with optimization and performance due to buggy camera movement that hampered our experience in building, furnishing, or decorating mode.</p><p>This can also be transferred onto the Photo Mode, which made taking snaps of our completed projects or projects in progress a challenging process, as zooming and panning over the property gets laggy. Alongside these issues, the decision to lock players to a 7x7 building space on a massive plot is an interesting choice, as one hopes the plot size increases to give us more room to create more beautiful spaces and unlock more treasured memories to own as Keepsakes.</p><p>After all, we'll still be here for the cozy vibes and the profound memories from those treasured Keepsakes.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Log Away&nbsp;</strong>was reviewed on PC via Steam, with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours&nbsp;- all screenshots were taken during the review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass has gone through some turbulent times of late, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">sheen completely coming off the subscription service</a> as it made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">its cheaper tiers much less worthwhile</a>, followed by a series of price increases building to October’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">sudden 50 percent hike</a>. $30 a month is a heck of an investment, given that in 2023 it cost half of that, so if you’re paying, you’ll want to get the best out of it. And with over 400 games currently included, finding the stuff worth playing gets harder and harder. So to make life easier, we’ve gone through the jumbled pile and picked out the 10 best RPGs to play.</p> <p>There are, by Microsoft’s count, 307 games on Xbox Game Pass that it considers to be RPGs. But given that <a href="https://kotaku.com/genres-fps-hero-shooter-adventure-rts-action-opinion-1851772168">genre titles mean close to nothing now</a>, and all genres are merging together, a fair number of them are stretches. For instance, this list isn’t going to include any&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, no matter how many RPG elements the series has begun to include over the years. They can have their day in a Best Action Games list and be happy about it.</p>

 <p>Anyway, here are 10 of the best RPGs to install on your Xbox if you’re subscribed to Game Pass, with a good mix of the blatantly obvious and the somewhat more obscure.</p> <hr> <h2>Avowed</h2>  <p>I said it’d include the obvious, but it’d be criminal not to recommend one of the best new RPGs in&nbsp;<em>years</em>. Obsidian’s first/third-person free-roaming take on its glorious&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity</em> series proved to be <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">an absolutely cracking success</a>. It’s real-time magic-n-swords combat works brilliantly, in a world that’s as rich and detailed and packed with character as either of the previous, more traditional <em>Pillars</em> games. Plus, it offers so many extraordinary choices that you can play it all over again as soon as you’re done.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Dragon Age: Origins</h2>  <p>If you prefer, you can assume this entry to be for any of the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games, given EA has all four of them included on Game Pass, including last year’s <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. But the first one, <em>Origins</em>, will always be the best. It was the result of ten years of work, with an obvious depth of lore and history showing the results of such an extraordinary investment of time. It also plays out with a combination of real-time and pauseable combat, allowing you to approach it new-school or old. It is one of the most wonderful RPG stories ever told.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Fallout: New Vegas (PC Only)</h2>  <p>Yes, you can play the more recently revamped&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em> on Game Pass too, but if I’m picking just one of the series’ first-person era, it has to be Obsidian’s <em>New Vegas</em>. It’s scientifically proven to be the best of the lot, and it remains a gruesome tragedy that it’s not received a modern glow-up. But what better time to play this incredibly deep, post-apocalyptic RPG than in the weeks before Amazon Prime’s stunning&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> TV series reaches Vegas in its second season?</p>

 <hr> <h2>Moonlighter</h2>  <p>At a time when so many would-be RPGs have split off into the realm of the roguelite,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em> straddles the two fields like a mighty but modest titan. This adorably splendid game combines running a local store with the need to go off on deathly adventures to find loot to sell in said store. The result is a gorgeous mix of action-RPG and shop-running, town-building loveliness. There’s a sequel in early access on Game Pass too.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>  <p>One of 2025’s breakout hits, not least thanks <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-xbox-goty-2000650073">to its inclusion on Game Pass</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has made turn-based RPG combat sexy again. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">definitely-not-an-indie game</a> from French developers Sandfall Interactive has a story that twists and turns as its chapters progress, a uniquely interesting defense system, and a voice cast to die for.</p>

 <hr>   <p>There’s no escaping it. It might be 14 years old (although this Special Edition is a mere nine), but <em>Skyrim</em> is still one of the best RPGs ever made. Bethesda’s colossal open-world RPG (long before everyone else was doing that) is still one of the most splendid ways to wile away a spare couple of months. Grab a horse, climb a mountain, find a mysterious cave, turn into a vampire, join a cult, and begin a life of crime, all before lunch.</p> <hr> <h2>Arx Fatalis (PC only)</h2>  <p>I’ve tried to stick to RPG games that can be played on both Xbox consoles and PC, but I can’t leave&nbsp;<em>Arx Fatalis</em> off the list. This is from Arkane, the creators of <em>Dishonored</em> and&nbsp;<em>Prey</em>, and it’s every bit as much a demonstration of that (monstrously closed) studio’s talent. Originally released in 2002, despite being great, this was a first-person RPG that your dad loved but was a commercial flop. Thanks to the same hateful deal that killed Arkane, the game is now in Microsoft/Bethesda’s library and on Game Pass.</p> <hr> <h2>Citizen Sleeper 2</h2>  <p>Both&nbsp;<em>Citizen Sleeper</em> and its sequel are on Xbox Game Pass, so you can start at the beginning of these dark, cyber-noir RPG adventures if you so choose. The original game takes place around a single planet, the second an entire solar system, where the roll of the dice decides so much of the fate from which you’re endlessly trying to escape. They’re <a href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-review-steam-rpg-scifi-cowboy-bebop-1851751947">fantastic games</a>, unlike anything else out there, with stunning writing and the sensibilities of the best of tabletop gaming.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Diablo IV</h2>  <p>As much as I may have moaned about genre blurring at the start, there’s no question that action-RPGs are RPGs. For a while, the genre was so specifically dominated by <em>Diablo</em> that it was known as “Diablo-likes,” and it remains the case that Blizzard’s creations rule the roost. Yes, there are those who play these games for their endgame loops and grinds, but don’t let that put you off: clicking your way through the story and combat of the core game is a rewarding experience in its own right.</p> <hr> <h2>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</h2>  <p>Has there been a more consistently great trilogy of RPG games than&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>? Well, have it out in the comments. But in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Legendary Edition</em> is all three of the&nbsp;<em>good</em> games in the series, remastered in 4K, and with all 40 pieces of DLC. It’s a glorious story, and while many were unsatisfied with the (excellent—fight me) ending, the space adventure trilogy remains one of video gaming’s all-time highlights.</p> <hr> <p>Your favorite Game Pass RPG isn’t here? That’s because we found out you like it so much and deliberately left it off the list to make you mad. So get revenge by explaining what you’d have included instead of&nbsp;<em>Arx Fatalis</em> in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Dumps This Mini PC at Its Cheapest Price Ever, a 4.5-Star Windows Backup Even if You Own a Mac Mini]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-dumps-this-mini-pc-at-its-cheapest-price-ever-a-4-5-star-windows-backup-even-if-you-own-a-mac-mini-2000650495</link>
            <guid>1373122</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk space can be pretty limited, so the last thing you may want is a bulky PC tower taking up half of it. A mini PC is a great solution, offering the same functionality while taking up hardly any room. Whether you’re a business owner, student, or casual user, a mini PC is ideal—and it’s usually more affordable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6214/">Take a look here: the GMKtec Mini NucBox G5 PC is typically priced at $260, but right now, it’s available at a 31% discount, bringing it down to just $180—saving you $80.</a></p>
<p>This compact device measures just 2.83 x 2.83 x 1.75 inches, making it small enough to fit in your pocket. It’s powered by an Intel 12th-generation Alder Lake N97 processor, capable of reaching speeds up to 3.6GHz. This should be more than enough for everyday tasks like web browsing, light creative work, software development, or playing casual games. It comes with 12GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which you can upgrade to as much as 2TB if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With Wi-Fi 5 support, you can enjoy fast upload and download speeds when connected to a Wi-Fi 5 network. The mini PC also features Bluetooth 5.0, making it easy to connect to various accessories. Ports include two USB 3.2 slots on the front and one on the back, plus a USB-C port. The HDMI output supports up to 4K resolution at 60Hz, and with dual HDMI ports, you can connect two displays at once—no need for a docking station. There’s also an AUX jack for connecting headphones or desktop speakers.</p>
<h2>Why Choose a Mini PC?</h2>
<p>If you’re living in a small apartment or sharing a space with roommates, you probably know that every inch of your desk matters. A large PC tower can take up precious room that you may not be willing to sacrifice. A mini PC, on the other hand, offers a lot of the capabilities of a desktop PC but in a much smaller footprint. This one is even small enough that you could feasibly mount it to the back of a monitor, so it effectively would have no foot print at all.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also make great multimedia players. While many modern TVs have smart features with the ability to play from apps like Netflix and Hulu, a mini PC can still make for a better option that just using what’s built into your TV. It’s a full Windows device, meaning it can handle more types of media formats (especially for locally saved files) than your typical smart TV or streaming stick.</p>
<p>Additionally, a mini PC is perfect for running a PLEX server, allowing you to access your media library from anywhere. They’re also great for emulating retro games, as they don’t require much processing power to run ROMs. Just make sure you legally own the games you are emulating, but also I’m not the one checking up on you. You do you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank">Welcome to <em>Total War: MEDIEVAL III</em></a> – Game Director Pawel Wojs</strong></p><p>Hi <em>Total War</em> Community!</p><p>Here we go, the first official blog about <em>Total War: MEDIEVAL III</em>.</p><p>First and foremost, welcome to TotalWar.com and the <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> hub, our official space where we will discuss anything and everything related to the game.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>My name is Pawel Wojs, I’m the game director for this exciting project and I’m here to kick off a series of blogs about our early vision for it. This is a series we know means a lot to many of you, and having personally worked on <em>MEDIEVAL II</em> almost 20 years ago, it’s beyond my wildest dreams that I get to lead the team bringing its sequel to life.</p><p>Our intention for announcing this early is simple; <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> is important to us, and we know it’s important to you, so we want to give you the opportunity to get a bit closer to it. Our goal is to talk to you more about what we’re working on and why we’re doing it. It is a very new way for us to communicate about these early phases of game development, but we’re excited to take you on the journey.</p><p>The main purpose of this hub is to share news &amp; updates on our progress and it’s a place where we’ll discuss parts of the game directly with you. We’re expecting to have updates on a roughly quarterly basis as development at this stage is very fast moving, so this will allow us to present ideas that are more likely to stand the test of time. If you want to be involved in the conversation, please feel free to sign up.</p><p>So, let’s dive into the big questions: What is <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>? Why is now the right time? And how are we going to bring this vision to life?</p><p>Our vision is for <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> to be the definitive <em>Total War</em> sandbox set within the Medieval world and to be the ultimate “What if?” game where you can alter the course of history. We aim to set the scene by immersing you in the historical authenticity you expect from <em>Total War</em>. As you play, the world responds in ways that feel genuinely plausible. You can choose to follow the course as written in the history books or take a bold step towards rewriting it.</p><p>As development progresses, we’ll have more to show and discuss about its design direction—and in some cases, we’ll give you a voice to shape certain decisions. But game development is challenging, so we’re only going to be able to discuss certain areas when we’re confident they’re ready to be shown. Through this, we hope to provide more insight than ever before into the development of a <em>Total War</em> title. We’re going to make some mistakes, but we’re excited to make this journey with you.</p><p>Creating any <em>Total War</em> game takes time and immense effort, not just to make, but to ensure it hits the quality expected by you and us. The truth is, we’ve wanted to make this game for a very long time. We made attempts to bring it to life in the past, but we never felt we could truly do it justice.</p><p>So, what’s changed? For starters, we now have Warcore—the next evolution of our game engine. It’s unlike anything we’ve worked with before, offering a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks—all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve.</p><p>We also knew it was essential to bring together the right people—a team with decades of experience and a deep understanding of what makes historical strategy so compelling. This expertise, combined with the passion of those who helped shape the series, gives us the foundation to build something truly special.</p><p>Right now, the game is in early pre-production, so think about it being years away, rather than months, meaning we’re just past the opening stages of its long journey. This phase is about laying the foundations: defining scope, prioritizing features which number in the hundreds at this stage, and shaping how our vision will translate into an unforgettable experience.</p><p>We have never talked about one of our games this early on in pre-development before, so it is a very exciting prospect for us, but of course as with anything new, we will have to expect bumps and bruises along the way, so please bear with us whilst we find our rhythm. This is particularly important when we are in the middle of big project milestones as we won’t be able to talk much, so we just want to set clear expectations for the instances in which we’re busy focusing on the game.</p><p>We still have work to do before we can show you the game in its early state, but we’re ready to talk about things like our vision, the magnificence of the medieval time-period, how we aim to bring the game to life – and of course, introduce you to our talented development team.</p><p>This means that alongside the community <a title="Genres > Management [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> team, we will have members of the development team chatting to everyone, so you can hear all of the juicy details directly from them.</p><p>We will also have our brilliant community moderators supporting us on the CA Community hub, so we also expect it to be a safe space and respectful for any and all to join in on the conversation. The usual community rules apply here, and we won’t tolerate any breaches of them.</p><p>To begin with, we want to start sharing our vision; from discussing the Medieval time period to game and art pillars—and why these are important foundational building blocks. While we may not talk about game features just yet, this will be a great opportunity for you all to understand a bit more about how we tackle development from the early stages. Not everything we say in the future will be major news, and some things might be light touch but still very interesting for us all to get our teeth into.</p><p>You’ll hear plenty more from me in the weeks and months ahead, but if you’re looking to know even more about what Med III truly is, click here to go straight to Our Vision for <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> from creative director Leif Walter, and learn all about our vision for this game.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and welcome to the <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> team!</p><p>—Pawel Wojs, Game Director</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank">Our Vision</a> – Creative Director Leif Walter</strong></p><p>Hey everyone, Leif here, creative director on <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>.</p><p>I’m sure we all have our “origin story” of how we became fans of this franchise. For me, it was writing and reading “After <a title="Genres > Action [3,249 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Reports” on TWCenter back in the day. I always felt like <em>Total War</em> shines the most when it works as a powerful story generator. We all love the strategy in it, the tactics, going through the details of leading a realm. But it really comes together when the game tells awesome stories.</p><p>These stories exist in a variety of forms; from retelling history and reliving pivotal moments, to diverging from history and telling your own story. Your own timeline where your realm took over the Mediterranean. Memories of the great generals and politicians, key decisions made and fates being changed.</p><p>With <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>, we want to push this further than ever before. Our guiding motto is “Rewrite History”. We want to create the ultimate medieval sandbox where the outset is defined by impeccable authenticity, but from there, the story is yours to tell. We want to empower you to do this in more meaningful ways than ever before, leaving less to pure ‘head canon’, and instead giving you more ways to influence the world, while also creating greater opportunity for how the world will speak back to you and react to your actions.</p><p>We want you to shape the history of a realm throughout the medieval era, and embark to tell fantastic stories, write alternate histories, or relive the pivotal moments of medieval history.</p><p>Imagine for a moment like this:</p><p>The year is 1187.</p><p>You defend Jerusalem against Saladin; the Kingdom of Jerusalem prevails.</p><p>Constantinople is never sacked; the Byzantine Empire never falls. With the Byzantines as your allies, you defeat the Mongols.</p><p>In 1412, the Holy Roman Empire disintegrates into small, German kingdoms.</p><p>As the Kingdom of Jerusalem, you proclaim yourself defender of the Catholic church, and Jerusalem becomes the capital of the Christian world.</p><p>Trade with India and Asia blossoms.</p><p>Columbus never sails to America…</p><p>This is what <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> is all about: You pick a realm, seize your glory, and rewrite history—or kneel before it!</p><p>Of course, this is only one of many possible stories we want players to tell within the sandbox of <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>, but it is still a great example of the vision we have for the player fantasy.</p><p>We want you to feel like being the Architect of Feudal Realms. The realm—your faction—is really almost like the main character in an <a title="Genres > RPG [17,832 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> game. It’s the “build” of your campaign that will allow you to forge your own legacy throughout the era.</p><p>Imagine, London, 1318. A fictious king of a Danish dynasty, Ragnar IV, has ascended your throne as the ruler of England. Yet you decide to abolish the monarchy and call out a League of Free Cities of England. And as England is now entering a hypothetical second Viking Age, your prosperous urban centres will dominate European trade for centuries to come…</p><p>What version of England will you create?</p><p>To do all of this, we want you to become a master of grand strategy, where foresight, planning, and the exploitation of interlocking systems is rewarded.</p><p>Imagine, Cairo, 1352. As Mamluk Egypt, your trade relations with Venice have lead to Italian enclaves along coastal trade towns. Contrary to history though, you decide to promote Italian culture through lawmaking and reforms. Thirty years later, Italian General Nicolo di Brindisi, now Grand Marshal of Egypt, is leading a mixed force of Mamluk cavalry and Italian Crossbowmen to defend the realm against the Timurids…</p><p>How will you exploit decisions across decades?</p><p>And once you go into battle, we want to make sure you feel like a real leader of your soldiers. <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter the tides of morale, discipline, and evolving battlefields.</p><p>Imagine, Manzikert, 1221. Leading your byzantine army into battle, your right flank is suffering from high fatigue, and on the left, your light infantry is being pushed back by heavy enemy troops. But when the rain starts, dirt turns into mud. The enemy sends in a last group of reserves to crush your retreating troops. Yet in the forming mud, and bolstered by your General’s presence, your light infantry withstands the charge in a heroic brace. A park in the darkest hour that ripples through your army and starts to turn the tide in battle…</p><p>Can you snatch victory from the jaws of defeat?</p><p>And finally, we want you to be the manipulator of the world as a stage. The medieval world is your canvas, and you are the agent of change across realms, and of the world itself.</p><p>Imagine, Riga, 1278. As the Teutonic Order, you are leading the Baltic crusade. You deforest regions to stimulate timber trade and found new cities to attract settlers from Western Europe. Farmland and mines expand on the map through your decree. You build new castles on the map to fortify your new home. Central European architecture spreads to the Baltic.</p><p>Your presence will transform cultures, cities, and the land itself.</p><p>All in all, we want you to think about:</p><p>What kind of kingdom will you create?</p><p>What dynasties will lead it?</p><p>And what peoples will inhabit it?</p><p>So, there you go! This is the creative vision for <em>MEDIEVAL III</em> and our experiential north star. Whenever we are in discussions within the team; whenever we are considering a variety of options – we come back to this north star. Will this feature help us deliver this vision? Which version of it will contribute the most towards it? And equally, for the conversations here with all of you, it would be great to calibrate ourselves around this vision, too.</p><p>How do YOU want to rewrite history?</p><p>Ultimately, this is what we want all of you to experience. We want you to experience a sandbox that carries the signature blend of <em>Total War</em>, where immersive tactical battles blend with your campaign story to shape kingdoms, religions, cultures, and estates. A sandbox to rewrite history across the turbulent centuries of medieval history.</p><p>I would be thrilled to hear some of the great campaign and battle stories you were able to tell in the past, and what you would be looking for with <em>MEDIEVAL III</em>!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>—Leif Walter, Creative Director</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/total-war-medieval-iii-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Creative Assembly has revealed Total War: Medieval 3, a new game in the long-running strategy series that's returning to its historical roots to celebrate its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>The second Medieval game was released back in 2006 - since then, the studio has explored multiple time periods and civilisations (most recently Ancient Egypt in Total War: Pharoah), as well as multiple games in the fantastical Warhammer universe.</p>
<p>This newly-announced third Medieval game is currently in pre-production, so there's no release date yet. Creative Assembly promises it will be the "ultimate medieval strategy sandbox" and allows players to "immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before", while its mix of historical authenticity and "unprecedented player agency" mean this isn't just a sequel but "the rebirth of historical Total War".</p>

<p>It certainly sounds ambitious. You can check out the trailer above.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Creative Assembly hasn't forgotten its Warhammer games, which will celebrate their tenth anniversary in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 - Lords of the End Times will be released next summer, introducing four new Legendary Lords into the campaign experience. The first of these is Nagash, the great necromancer.</p>
<p>A free End Times Update is also planned, which will transform the campaign with new scenarios and cataclysmic events. The studio also noted this isn't the end for its Warhammer series, however.</p>

<p>In further news, the studio has developed its proprietary game engine, with a new evolution called Warcore. Not only does this offer more advanced tools for its developers, it means future games will be released on PlayStation and Xbox in addition to PC.</p><p>Lastly, another new game is set to be revealed at The Game Awards next week. It will be the next major release in the series and is "one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history". Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-development-at-creative-assembly">a report suggested the studio was working on Total War: Star Wars</a>, so could this be revealed?</p>
<p>"It's incredible to think Total War is 25 years old," said Roger Collum, vice president of Total War.</p>
<p>"We're extremely grateful that we get to make games that our community get to play for decades, and without them we wouldn't be here. This year was a moment where all Total War fans; old or new, historical or fantasy, could come together and celebrate the exciting next chapter in our story. Here's to 25 more years!"</p>
<p>After the release of Total War: Pharoah, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-apologises-for-missteps-with-total-war-series-offers-pharaoh-refunds">studio apologised for "missteps" and offered partial refunds</a> to players. That followed the high profile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">cancellation of looter shooter Hyenas</a>. As such, the studio is now returning to its roots, perhaps in an attempt to garner goodwill from its players.</p>

<p>A long time coming</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It has been eight years since Nintendo first announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>. It has been 18 years since the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>. And now, after all that time, Beyond's launch trailer is finally here.</p>
<p>Those who have kept up with every trailer drop until now won't find too much new footage in this one, but we challenge anyone who's been waiting for the best part of a decade to watch without feeling a little tingle down their spine.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a bit more story-based than we've seen in previous trailers, with a gritty narration teeing up Samus' might and narrative predicament, before a boatload of sequences show her in action. And stick around until the end for a particularly mysterious stinger!</p>
<p>The game has launched today on Switch and Switch 2. On the new hardware, we described Prime 4 as "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>, and our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">impressions of the Switch 1 version</a> were equally optimistic, despite the resolution drop.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/sony-bad-robot-games-the-designer-of-left-4-dead-are-making-a-new-co-op-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1373086</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Bad Robot Games have announced a partnership to create a new game together. SIE will publish Bad Robot’s first internal game project, which is to be a four-player cooperative shooter directed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> designer Mike Booth. The game is in development for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PC.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment allows us to bring our new IP to life, with an expansive vision for this new universe,” said Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games. “With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.”</p>


<p>Booth has been at Bad Robot Games since December 2020, and has been Chief Creative Officer since 2022, managing the company’s in-house game developments. Booth is obviously most famous for his work in creating Left 4 Dead, at Turtle Rock Studios which he had founded in 2002. He stayed with Valve for a couple years after Turtle Rock was shut down and refounded separately, but left in 2012, joined Blizzard for a time, worked on social VR projects with Facebook in the late 2010s, and eventually landed with Bad Robot in 2020.</p>
<p>Which is to say that, while he was there for the beginning of Left 4 Dead and the co-op shooter genre, he’s not been involved with later attempts at this and adjacent genres – Turtle Rock went on to create Evolve and Back 4 Blood, but neither saw the same level of success and stature as Left 4 Dead. Can Booth, who created the AI Director that managed the dynamic ebb and flow of zombie attacks and monsters through the game, come up with a fresh perspective and hook to revolutionise the co-op shooter all over again?</p>

<p>We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

As far as we know, it's set to arrive on PC and Xbox Series X|S, with an Xbox One version also in development, although given Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-hardware-revenue-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba6a7b14-7c36-438c-952b-7ec1e2422993" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">position in the hardware market</a>, that version may be scrapped in the fullness of time.</p><p>Back in August, Sad Cat revealed that <em>Replaced </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/replaced-spring-2026-release-window" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1909a0a-08c9-41e1-bf76-76966ced7965" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set for a spring 2026 release window</a>, with project lead Yura Zhdanovich acknowledging at the time that the project had been delayed numerous times but assuring fans that the studio was doing what it thought was best for the game.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-xbox-bethesda-e3-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8f02423-4316-4b53-9fae-e0c65906486c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">all the way back at E3 2021</a>, <em>Replaced </em>is a 2.5D narrative-driven action platformer that takes place in an "alternate 1980s America scarred by nuclear catastrophe".</p><p>You play as R.E.A.C.H., an AI (as in a real one, not a glorified chatbot) stuck in a human's body, and you must discover the reason for your creation while exposing the sinister agenda of Phoenix Corporation. It's a cyberpunk story, so obviously, the corporation has a sinister agenda.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Replaced </em>appears to be paying homage to the cinematic platformers of time gone by; think <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, <em>Out of This World </em>(also known as <em>Another World</em>), and <em>Flashback</em>, and you'll be roughly in the right ballpark.</p><p>The game will blend exploration with "fluid movement and fast, responsive combat" in which you'll use both melee and ranged options to take down your enemies.</p>
<p>Thunderful Publishing will no doubt be hoping that <em>Replaced </em>is a hit; recently, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/coatsink-layoffs-half-workforce" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dcff6b51-8929-4c5a-be4c-7c30472c88e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laid off half of the workforce</a> at subsidiary Coatsink, and it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bf6695fa-ab97-46be-9d58-8cb656c8713e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly had</a> the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd190875-f6e6-478f-9ed2-35e6192ff578" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">secure eighteen months or so</a> either.</p><p>In any case, <em>Replaced </em>will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/replaced/9mz1c8d26b7h" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spry Fox, the studio behind cozy games like <em>Cozy Grove </em>(the clue's in the name, I suppose) and <em>Spirit Crossing</em>, has been sold back to its original owners by now-former parent company Netflix.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game File</a>, the sale of Spry Fox is part of an ongoing effort on Netflix's part to reconfigure and reassess its gaming division, an operation that has already seen <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9711bede-314c-4ee1-8135-fe8d85504170" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Boss Fight Entertainment closed down</a>, along with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5effee2-78cf-4130-87e2-24dccd22c939" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">star-studded internal studio full of industry veterans</a>.</p><p>Unlike Boss Fight and the mooted Team Blue, however, Spry Fox hasn't been closed; rather, it's been sold back to Daniel Cook and David Edery, and will remain operational as an independent studio, according to Game File's report.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Cozy Grove</em>'s Spry Fox is no longer a Netflix studio.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Edery told Game File that his studio is "grateful" for its time under the auspices of Netflix, which will still publish <em>Spirit Crossing </em>on mobile. The studio will, however, be free to ask other publishers to take the game on for other platforms, which Edery says is "truly the best thing" for the project.</p><p>Netflix isn't the only streaming giant to be taking a long, hard look at its role in the gaming industry. Back in October, Amazon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced a major overhaul</a> to its Luna streaming service, which involved a refocusing on party games and smartphone-based play.</p><p>The retail giant also revealed that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96fc63cd-c591-42ec-8af0-59f8445fa07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">end development on MMORPG <em>New World</em></a>, with several staffers in Amazon's gaming division also losing their jobs as a result of that decision.</p>
<p>Spry Fox's split from Netflix doesn't seem to have affected the studio's plans in the near term; <em>Spirit Crossing </em>is still in development, and <em>Cozy Grove </em>remains available <a href="https://cozygrovegame.com/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">across PC and consoles</a>, with versions of <em>Spirit Crossing </em>for those platforms also seemingly in the works. Stay tuned for more on this.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Pushes the Razer Customizable Gaming Keypad to Its Lowest Price as Stock Runs Out]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-pushes-the-razer-customizable-gaming-keypad-to-its-lowest-price-as-stock-runs-out-2000650248</link>
            <guid>1373068</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday and Cyber Monday having passed, you might be thinking times up for finding great deals on tech and gaming stuff. But oh, my friend, you could not be more wrong. Amazon still has a number of deals still active following the huge savings weekend. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6204/">For instance, this Razer Tartarus V2 gaming keypad went on sale just before Black Friday to its lowest price on record and has remained since</a>. The gaming keypad usually goes for $80, so that 25% ends up chopping off $20—bringing the price you pay to only $60. No telling when the price will jump back up, so if you’re still shopping for the right gift for your gamer pal or are just looking to upgrade your own gaming setup, now’s the time to do it.</p>
<p>Let’s chat about mice, keyboard and controller for a moment. For some genres, the best way to play is obvious. A real-time strategy game? That’s gotta be mouse and keyboard. Racing games? Need to go with controller for those analog triggers. Though, some genres are debatable—particularly the first-person shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6204/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With a mouse, you have pin-point control over your aim, able to accelerate naturally, as fast as you can move the mouse. And yet, movement is limited. the W, A, S, D, control scheme doesn’t allow for precise control over your walking speed. Plus you’re limited to exactly eight directions of movement.</p>
<p>On controller, you can decide how fast you move, and have a full 360-degree range of movement with the left analog stick. However, your view relies on the right analog stick, which can only turn so fast and offers a much more limited control.</p>
<h2>Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p>Hannah Montanna knew best. You need the best of both worlds—and the Razer Tartarus V2 is just that.</p>
<p>The Tartarus looks like someone hacked up a keyboard and glued a joy-stick to the side (complimentary). With it, you now have a directional thumbpad for more natural controls, closer to what console-oriented players are used to. And then your remaining four fingers can still have access to all the keys you need. There’s also a scroll wheel.</p>



<p>The Razer Tartarus V2 features 32 mecha-membrane keys. They provide the tactile feedback and satisfaction of pressing down a mechanical key. They are are individually programmable so you can set it however you like to support your gaming or for use in creative workflows such as video or photo editing. You can even program macros, allowing for multiple key and keypress combinations in order to execute complex commands.</p>
<p>The gaming keypad is built with an ergonomic palm rest which is both adjustable and detachable, so you can customize your set up to whatever best matches your preferences and comfort.</p>
<p>And it of course would not be a proper Gamer with a capital G accessory without proper RGB lighting. The Razer Tartarus V2 gaming keypad offers full Razer Chroma supports. You can have the keypad fully synchronize with the game you’re playing or even with your Philips Hue lights if you’d got them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Can’t Catch A Break: ‘All Year Call Of Duty’s Numbers Have Been Quite Low’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-helldivers-2-lava-skyblivion-delay-2000650525</link>
            <guid>1373065</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The analysts have seen enough: <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s having a bad year</a>. Also <em>Helldivers 2</em> is sending players into lava pits and a major <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fan game gets another understandable delay. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s a big day for new game releases with <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-the-kotaku-review-2000650015"><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242"><em>Routine</em></a> all coming out at the same time. I wish I could find the time! Instead, I’ll be busy facing new bosses in<a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreigh-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launch-time-patch-notes-2000650150"><em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s first DLC</a> and muddling my way through a good but all-too-brief new <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-power-reset-2000632488"><em>Destiny 2 Star Wars</em> campaign</a> called&nbsp;<em>Renegades</em>.</p> <h2>The biggest<em> Elder Scrolls</em> mod project going gets another delay</h2>  <p><em>Skyblivion</em>, to almost no one’s surprise, won’t make its planned 2025 release date after all. The long-standing fan project that recreates <em>The Elder Scrolls IV</em> inside <em>Skyrim</em> using the latter’s engine needs a bit more time to cook. Considering it’s the work of over 70 unpaid volunteers, I think the wait is understandable. Plus, it will give it more of a buffer from Bethesda’s own <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> launch earlier this year.</p>

 <h2>Sony is publishing JJ Abrams’ production company’s first game developed by Left 4 Dead’s director</h2> <p>It’s a buzzy mouthful indeed. Here’s the press release: “Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) today announced a partnership with video game studio Bad Robot Games, a division of Bad Robot, the film, television and theater production company founded by JJ Abrams, for SIE to produce and publish the studio’s upcoming project, an unannounced four-player, cooperative shooter directed by Mike Booth&nbsp;<em>(Left 4 Dead</em>).”</p>

 <p>The game will come to PS5 and PC, but there’s currently no other information known about it. Maybe a tease at The Game Awards?</p> <h2>“Fewer people are playing <em>Call of Duty</em> this year than they have been before”</h2> <p>That’s according to Chris Dring of<em> The Game Business</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">who spoke to<em> Eurogamer</em></a> about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-player-count-battlefield-6-2000646316">relative crickets</a> around <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s launch. Activision hasn’t shared any hard data on player counts or sales figures, though the metrics analysts are tracking and estimating sound much worse than usual.</p>

 <p>“But actually, I track daily active users, and all year <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s numbers have been quite low-lower than usual. There have been some exceptions though, January was great coming off <em>Black Ops 6</em>, there was a boost in April / May, but generally speaking, fewer people are playing <em>Call of Duty</em> this year than they have been before,” Dring said. “That’s despite <em>Black Ops 6</em> as the previous game being brilliant in people’s eyes. In fact, in September, it was the lowest point I’ve seen <em>Call of Duty</em> since the launch of their <em>Call of Duty HQ</em>.”</p>

 <p>He and Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliot blame a lack of innovation, a <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358">bad, always-online campaign</a>, poor marketing, lots of competition in the shooter space, and general franchise burnout for the lackluster response. Will any of that actually stop <em>Black Ops 7</em> from being one of this year’s top-sellers? <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review-impressions-2000647644">Probably not</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> just got lava planets</h2>  <p>The extraction shooter’s latest “Into the Unjust” update has taken players into a fight with the automatons on <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s version of <em>Mustafar. “</em>Too hot for humans, too unstable for farming, too explosive for tourism—yet rich in minerals,” reads the description. “Minerals the Automatons steal with every drill.

The top-selling hardware option was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">the Nex Playground</a> at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU.

If that happens to be AI--which is becoming increasingly popular in the games industry as of late--then that's what Sega will use. It just won't be everywhere all of the time, apparently, but it will be there.</p><p>"Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development, we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI," the company said.

            <p>Replaced, the cyberpunk action-platformer from Belarusian developer Sad Cat Studio, finally has a release date and is set to arrive on PC and Xbox Series X/S on 12th March.</p>
<p>Set in an alternate 1980s, it's got all the trappings of the cyberpunk genre as you can see in the trailer below: a dystopian neon-lit setting; a corrupt, controlling corporation; and flying cars.</p>
<p>But that's all presented in a unique 2.5D style that blends pixel art with environments full of depth.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">studio was forced to delay the game due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2023, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2024">delayed in 2024</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/25d-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2025">delayed once more into 2025</a>. Now it'll be out in 2026.</p>
<p>"It feels great to finally have a set date for the release of Replaced," said game director Yura Zhdanovich. "It's no secret that it's taken longer for us to get here than we initially thought and we want to thank everyone for your continued patience and support. We're looking forward to making it worth your while on March 12th!"</p>
<p>It certainly looks like it will be worth the wait. It's coming to multiple PC stores (Steam, Epic, GOG), and will also be added to Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<figure data-uuid="3a50f58e93e84"><a title="Kirby Air Riders/Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3a50f58e93e84/kirby-air-ridersinazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I've been having an interesting run lately of games that shake things up, even if it's just a little bit, in the controls department.</p>
<p>Back in the good old days — or at least my nostalgia blinkers have made it seem this way to me — the idea of being bored rigid by a game's control systems wasn't something that ever entered my mind. Was it because I was less of a pro gamer in the 1980s and '90s than I am now? Well, yes, obviously, nobody can be <em>this</em> pro for <em>that</em> long, but that's not the actual reason. Not this time.</p>
<p>No, for all the pot shots you can take at old games for being a bit naff and aged and wrinkly and incontinent and what-have-you, you cannot so easily disrespect them when it comes to their controls. There just seemed to be more variety back in the crazy, lawless days of early video games. Or maybe I just feel that way because I wore a Nintendo Power Glove and a cheap rumble backpack for most of my childhood. A rumble backpack!</p>
<p>Whatever the case, I think it's fair to say things are more homogenised now; players expect, and developers deliver, on a certain style of controls for a certain type of game, for the most part. When the latest shooter shows up, we expect to know exactly how to chuck a grenade, crouch, or run without having to refer to a guide.</p>
<p>And I don't like it. I mean, I like games that control nicely...so I guess <em>I do</em> like it, technically. They've got me there. But sometimes you get your hands on something that really does things differently — whilst still controlling nicely — and remember, 'Hey, unique control schemes can really tie this whole thing together!'</p>

<p>In this way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has been a genuine surprise to me in how deep and addictive its chaotic racing is, whilst still managing to be radically different to the norm at its core. It's been the main culprit in bringing all of this stuff to my mind. I got a bit fed up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, you see, as it feels overwhelmingly like more of the same once you're on the track and racing (which is fine, but I've had enough after a decade of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">8</a>), and so I've left it all behind and feel a little deflated with the series now as a result.</p>
<p>The thing with Mario Kart, though, is that it's so refined you know they're never changing it. Well, not massively. Why would they? And so, with Air Riders, there's real excitement in digging in, because it's so unique in its <em>slightly mad</em> take on careening around courses and knocking the stuffing out of opponents.</p>
<p>Rather than your usual racing experience — one button for accelerate, another for brake (and a handbrake button for crashing) — Air Riders is kinda like...well, it's like slingshotting around a course rather than driving the route. It's akin to strategically pulling back an elastic band at just the right moment on corners and then letting rip down straights at its core, with a bunch of <em>other stuff</em> then added on top.</p>
<p>I'm immediately way more invested thanks to this, and mostly just because it's a switch-up, a refresh of the things I'm normally doing with my hands and brain whilst controlling a game. It's something to sink my teeth into. Something new to learn. And it gives Kirby's racer a real unique flavour and strength all of its own.</p>

<p>In a similar way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> takes football and turns it into something a little more unexpected and unique in its segmented, RPG-esque control scheme. It's really nothing like what you may be expecting if you're a newcomer.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't quite the same sort of comparison (this isn't a pure footie sports game after all), but even then, when approached differently in this way, when a match is started and completed in such a mechanically and narratively different manner, with limited controls and time on the ball interlaced with super skills, boosts and boons — whilst still remaining every bit as compelling as a game of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> in my mind — it makes me wish there were way more examples of certain types of games being approached <em>differently</em>, just to spice things up a little. Y'know.</p>
<figure data-uuid="419784181ad1f"><a title="Joy-Con 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/419784181ad1f/joy-con-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo, to its credit, has been better than many when it comes to control experimentation; you only have to look at the recently released (and very good, thanks) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, to see how they've taken something rather, well, it's not the most mind-blowing concept, but it's made way more appealing by the introduction of a unique control scheme. You've got me learning stuff; how to turn on a dime and speed up, how best to take a shot or pull off a trick. It instantly raises what could have been a totally forgettable thing into something that had us all talking when we caught sight of it for the first time.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Switch 2, as much as some have had a go at its screen quality and a few other things in the early months, has already been delivering the goods big time in giving us mouse mode to add to our options for shooters, RPGs and so on. Granted, you're just giving us what PC players already have in some cases, so it's not the same brand of 'unique'. However, the option being there, just having the ability to do things differently on the screen, can make a no-buy into something I'll go ahead and purchase.</p>
<p>Of course, a premium- — or even nuclear- — grade example of Nintendo trying new things in the controls department (and one that actually paid off, I won't hear otherwise) is Sakurai's 3DS belter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a>.</p>

<p>I've heard so many people bemoan this one; I've heard lots of "This should have been a twin-stick shooter!" because of how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/random-sakurai-explains-why-true-twin-stick-controls-werent-possible-for-kid-icarus-uprising">heinous they found its control scheme</a>. But I loved it. And it's a game that will forever sit with me because of those controls. Doing things differently is good! I mean, I did still buy a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/10/retro_city_rampage_to_utilise_circle_pad_pro">Circle Pad Pro</a> because this one gave me sore wrists at points, but don't tell anyone.</p>
<p>Oh, and whilst we're on the subject of unique controls on Nintendo consoles specifically, and I know there are lots of examples, but this one stick out personally; did you know you could hold two NES controllers like Switch Joy-Con to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/smash_tv">Smash TV</a> back in the day with a double D-pad setup? Yes, you could, and it was great.</p>

<p>So, yes, these are all games that would've still sold well, no doubt, without the unique elements they bring to the table with their controls, but they just wouldn't have the same flavour at all in my mind. They'd never be so memorable, regardless of how divisive or even frustrating they can be at times (yes, Kid Icarus, yes, you were).</p>
<p>Whilst new horizons on the old mechanical front can sometimes come a cropper, let's hear it for games that are out here taking risks and making players do stuff a little differently than usual, and let's hope we see plenty more in the near future. I'm well tired of holding the same buttons to do the same things ad nauseam.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Feel like games could do with getting back to experimenting a bit more with controls? Hate/love any of the games I've mentioned due to their unique control schemes? Let us know!</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netgear Nighthawk RS700S Wi-Fi 7 Tri-Band Router Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/netgear-nighthawk-rs700s-wi-fi-7-tri-band-router-review/</link>
            <guid>1373029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Setting up a new Wi-Fi router used to fill me with dread. The idea of pulling all the cables out, rummaging behind the sofa, finding the extremely poorly placed power socket, and then going through the rigmarole of changing every single item in our house over to a new network with increasingly difficult to enter passwords used to rank amongst the worst tasks in modern life.</p>
<p>Thankfully, networking companies have realised they can make things easier for you, while also putting out some of the fastest, most cutting-edge Wi-Fi tech around. It’s clear that Netgear have put serious thought into their brand-new Nighthawk range of Wi-Fi 7 routers, and, after a simple onboarding process, your home’s internet will be ripping along faster than ever before.</p>



<p>In the box, you’re getting the top-of-the-range Nighthawk RS700 router, a power brick with both UK and US attachments, and a standard 2m ethernet cable for connecting to your incoming cable or fibre internet doodah. As you’re pulling everything out of the box, the immediate thing you’re going to notice is how big and imposing the Nighthawk router actually is. It’s a chonky, wedge-shaped beast, with silver metal venting at the top and gloss finish on the LED displays that gives it a real Cyberpunk feel.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that big a step away from the back plastics and glowing LEDs of the BT, Virgin, EE and other routers that are sat in most of the homes in the UK, but if you’re moving from something like the dinky and understated white boxes of an Eero setup, you’re certain to notice a change in aesthetics.</p>

<p>The Nighthawk RS700S is heavy. If it’s going to sit in a hallway, in danger of being knocked by flailing coats and grasping children’s hands, you might want to make sure it can’t fall off the side of a table and put a dent into your flooring. That weight does mean it’s fairly settled in place, but its tower-like design means that it’s not completely safe from toppling over.</p>

<p>You begin setup via the Nighthawk app, with some nice, streamlined QR codes pointing you towards the app on either iOS or Android. From there, the cabling experience is similarly straightforward, with a 10Gbps socket for your incoming connection or fibre internet signal, and then five ports for your home network – four at Gigabit speeds, and one at 10Gbps.</p>
<p>There’s also a USB-A 3.0 port for connecting a storage device, which you can then use via Readyshare, which is a really handy inclusion in multi-platform households or workplaces. You can access this drive remotely as a pretty literal interpretation of Network Attached Storage, and if you’re looking for a router that can truly sit at the centre of your home network setup, the Nighthawk makes it as easy as possible. That said, I’d have liked to have seen a USB-C port here as well in 2025.</p>
<p>The Nighthawk app talks you through connecting everything, and it also gives you the option of immediately swapping out the network ID and password, so you can easily just fill in the details of your old network and avoid some of the annoyance of reprogramming everything. I say ‘some’ of the annoyance, as a few of our devices still required me to reconfirm the details, while our LG TV made me completely reconnect. Whether that’s down to the shift from WiFi 6 to WiFi 7, a change in bands the device is connecting to, or a switch to a newer password security protocol, I’m not sure, but it was only a minor bump in the road, and still much faster than a wholesale change.</p>

<p>It’s little surprise to find that the Nighthawk made a clear and perceptible change to the WiFi connection and internet speed in the house. While our previous Eero setup was, on average, providing 715Mbps of download speed, the Nighthawk RS700s provided closer to 1Gbps on our individual devices through most of our testing time. It boasts a combined potential speed of 19Gbps across all its bands, though that’s admittedly a purely theoretical figure, combining 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz bands, very wide spectrum usage (which might be impractical in a busy environment), and accommodating many devices in use at the same time.</p>
<p>It’s also got three times the capacity, allowing connections to up to 200 devices. Even our, incredibly tech-heavy house doesn’t come close to touching that, but in a workplace or office setting, that’s a real selling point, and we ran multiple multiplayer gaming, streaming and chatting sessions, with everything feeling ridiculously snappy and fast.</p>
<p>I’ve also been testing GeForce Now across a number of devices, and the Nighthawk RS700S allowed for a seamless streaming experience over WiFi, while our previous WiFi 6 Eero setup had, at times, struggled to do it justice. Chomping my way through the incredible Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, its timing-heavy combat was still on point, and, unbelievably, I never felt at a disadvantage while playing via streaming. I’ve spent a great deal of time playing over streaming services like Stadia and Microsoft’s Cloud Streaming, and the Nighthawk RS700S brought more stability than ever before. Admittedly, that is as you’d hope, with the WiFi 7 protocol able to halve the latency of WiFi 6. Still, it absolutely played out during our real-world testing.</p>
<p>Range then, is perhaps the final question mark, and the Nighthawk RS700S is capable of 3500 square feet (325 square metres) of coverage. That doesn’t account for walls and ceilings getting in the way and attenuating signal, but through our three-storey townhouse, with the router on the ground floor, I still received a 100% signal on the top floor, albeit with a reduced 512Mbps speed. That’s still excellent, and for most home settings, I think a single Nighthawk router will suffice. If you need even wider coverage, you might want to look at a mesh system rather than a sole router, or a WiFi extender, but these have their own limitations, and can cause you interference rather than improving your internet experience.</p>
<p>At £550 RRP, the Nighthawk RS700S is an extremely expensive addition to your home network setup, but it’s one that has clear and immediate benefits, especially if you’re bringing the latest WiFi 7-equipped tech into your house like the iPhone 17, Honor Magic V5 or the PlayStation 5 Pro. It’s likely only going to truly appeal to those on the cutting edge, but with its ease of setup, comprehensive app support and tangible results, the Nighthawk RS700S is a winning combination, especially in gaming-centric homes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4 – Fury Green Item Locations Walkthrough]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/metroid-prime-4-fury-green-item-locations-walkthrough-missile-expansion-energy-tank/</link>
            <guid>1373026</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The inevitable happens at the start of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, and Samus Aran is depowered by the time she wakes up on Viewros. Time to search out a whole host of new abilities, weapon power-ups, energy tanks and ammo expansions then!</p>
<p>The first biome in the game, Fury Green, is mainly a tutorial area your first time through, keeping things simple as you gain your first handful of new abilities. You will regularly return to Fury Green through the story, though, and that means there’s time to revisit corners of the map to access blocked areas and secrets.</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of all the items in the order in which you can find them.</p>


<p>But first, if you want to keep spoilers to a minimum for how you need to explore the world, know that the game does feature item maps that you can unlock once you’re into the final stretch of the game. We’ll soon have a guide on where to find all of the Scout Bots for each location.</p>
<p>Now, onto the Fury Green walkthrough.</p>

<h3>Energy Tank</h3>
<p><em>Requirements – Psychic Glove</em></p>
<p>You really can’t miss this, it’s a core part of the first run through the Fury Green region, with a strange orb that asks you to drag an item across its face using the Psychic Glove. Do this and you’re rewarded with an Energy Tank.</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Missile Launcher</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve earned the missile launcher, you can start smashing the hard orange resin all around this area. In the Grove of the Sacred Tree, just after rescuing MacKenzie and the save station, make sure to blow up the resin wall on the left which hides a Missile Expansion</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Psychic Bomb</em></p>
<p>After defeating the boss within Fury Green, you will have to take a new path to get back to MacKenzie which eventually gets you back to familiar ground. In the ball tunnel between the Psychic Seed and where MacKenzie is waiting, look out for a brightly coloured seed on the side. Place a Psychic Bomb next to this and you’ll have your first Missile Expansion from the game!</p>

		
		

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Psychic Bomb (and Psychic Boots)</em></p>
<p>This needs some back tracking and is only possible from the second time that you visit Fury Green – it’s best to just get this once you’ve got some further upgrades not to waste time. You can start at the original entrance to Fury Green without Psychic Boots, or if you have this double jump, then you start at MacKenzie’s location and backtrack across the bridge.</p>

		
		

<p>On the map, look for Resin Creek, which adjoins with a save station. Here you’ll find a pool with two whipping tentacle plants, where you’ll find an elevated seed that you can blow up with a Psychic bomb. To reach it, bounce yourself up using a bomb, then place a second while in midair.</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Psychic Boots</em></p>
<p>If returning to or leaving Fury Green via cargo cannon, there’s a missile expansion off to one side up in the air. Double jump up and over the scenery to reach a place with hazy purple smudges that you can scan using the visor to turn into platforms, which you can just jump across using your Psychic Boots.</p>

		
		

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Psychic Boots</em></p>
<p>In the Cliffside Gate area, near to where you first obtained the Psychic Glove, look for the purple signs of psychic platforms, which you can create to lead up to a Missile Expansion on a ledge.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>Between MacKenzie and the Cargo Cannon is a door locked by a Fire Shot lock. This leads to the Sacred Flame Ceremony room. Standing on the central plate and using the Psychic Visor lets you move a circular viewer along purple glowing channels, which you can move in and out in addition to left and right.</p>

		
		

<p>Lining this up with the stone balls opens them up, allowing you to set wooding pyres alight inside. Light all of these up and another grand door opens leading to a statue with a Shot Expansion waiting for you as a reward.</p>
<h3>Shot Expansion (7)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>In the Jungle Path area on the route you first took back after defeating the Fury Green boss, turn to the cliffside by the boss-side entrance and a flammable blocker can be destroyed, letting you morph ball and jump in to get a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion (6)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>With the fire shot, you can grab a few more items by backtracking to the earlier part of Fury Green. In the circular path that you followed to meet MacKenzie, the Isopod Lair features a flammable obstacle which hides a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion (8)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>Keep backtracking to reach the Ravine Overlook area, where a flammable blocker exists in the roots under a tree. It hides another Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Ice Shot</em></p>
<p>With the Ice Shot newly unlocked, return to the Sacred Flame Ceremony room and unlock the ice door. This leads to a little puzzle room. Use the ice shot to lock the left platform being raised by water, then use the visor to grab the power mote and power up the right platform. Use the ice shot to lock this in place and then jump up to be able to reach the Shot Expansion on top of the structure.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>The container in the cargo preparation room next to home base needs to be shot on both ends with an electric bolt to award you a Shot Expansion.</p>

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>Return to the ceremony area once more and now open up the electric locked room. Here you’ll find a puzzle that requires you to use the Psychic Visor to grab metal objects on the ceiling, pull them all down and turn them to point at the central structure. Now shoot each one with the Thunder Shot and you’ll be rewarded with a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Energy Tank</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve completed all three of the elemental puzzles, the statue next to the main Sacred Flame Ceremony room will dish out an Energy Tank for you. Handy!</p>

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Super Missile</em></p>
<p>Remember Betsy? You were introduced right at the start of the game! Once you’ve obtained the Super Missile you can revisit her and blow up the storage container by her feet to net yourself another Missile Expansion.</p>

<h3>Psychic Power Bomb Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Power Bomb</em></p>
<p>Back track to the earlier area of Fury Green and the Quiet Clearing. There’s a statue leaning off to the side here which says it contains something inside, when scanning. Use the huge explosion of the Power Bomb to break it up and reward you with… more power bombs!</p>

		
		

<p>And that’s everything there is to find in Fury Green!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-banjo-kazooie-sequel-remake-game-built-in-dreams-impressive-2000650541</link>
            <guid>1373020</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It seems very unlikely that we’ll get a new <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> game from Rare and Xbox anytime in the near future. And while an impressive-looking fan-made <em>Banjo</em> game created in <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-perfect-creepy-dreams-ps4-2000640924"><em>Dreams</em></a> isn’t quite the sequel or remake people might want, it’s probably the best we can hope for in 2025. It’s also wildly impressive for something made in Sony’s five-year-old abandoned game maker.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Eupholace/status/1996263228205080843">On December 3,</a> William Butkevicius, a level designer at Moon Studios, shared a trailer for <em>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania</em>, a new non-official one to two-hour game starring everyone’s favorite bear and bird. It looks really good.&nbsp; <a href="https://x.com/Eupholace/status/1996347110762106931">According to the creator</a>, it took about “14 months” and “800+ hours of work” to make <em>Mumbomania</em>. Here’s the trailer for the game, which is out now and available exclusively in <em>Dreams</em> on PS5 and PS4.</p>

  <p>Impressive stuff, right? In fact, if you had shown this to me without telling me it was made in <em>Dreams</em>, a PlayStation-published game-creation tool from the devs behind<em> Little Big Planet,</em> I’d have likely just assumed this was created in Unity or something by a talented team of people. And in a way, it was created by a talented team of creators, as <em>Mumbomania</em> contains various assets built by other <em>Dreams</em> users, <a href="https://indreams.me/dream/mSFcdDKSMkr">all of whom are listed in the game’s credits page</a>. This was one of the coolest things about <em>Dreams:</em> The way it let people collaborate and made sure everyone got credit for their input.</p>

 <p>As for the game’s plot, here’s the setup according to Butkevicius: “The bear and bird are back for their first buddy-trio adventure! Mysteriously disembodied, Mumbo joins Banjo and Kazooie to help collect, fight, and transform into a variety of strange beings.”</p> <p>Sadly, because Sony never did much with <em>Dreams</em>, like porting to PC, the only way to play <em>Mumbomania</em> is to own <em>Dreams</em> on PS5 and PS4 and<a href="https://indreams.me/dream/mSFcdDKSMkr"> play the <em>Banjo</em> fan game</a> there. If you don’t own <em>Dreams</em>, <a href="https://youtu.be/I8GogASuUqE">you can watch this walkthrough of the <em>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania</em></a> to see just how much work went into making this thing look, sound, and play like an authentically Rare <em>Banjo</em> sequel.</p>

              <p>An old, slow, or just subpar monitor is one of the surest ways to completely kill a fun PC gaming sesh. That’s especially true if you’re in a multiplayer online game where your quick hand reflexes need to translate to quick game reflexes, and a laggy moment or worse will spell your (virtual) demise.</p>
<p>Gaming monitors are usually a “get what you paid for” proposition — the cheap ones are mediocre, and the high-end ones are pricey. That equation doesn’t apply here, because the Samsung 27-inch Odyssey G3 Series FHD Gaming Monitor comes with a terrific picture, AMD FreeSync, and killer response time and refresh rate, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6205/">right now it’s only $143 thanks to a limited-time Amazon deal that cuts the price down by 38%.</a> That puts it right at the intersection of budget price and great performance, which is of course the best place to buy from.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-Time Reactions</h2>
<p>Even more than the size, resolution, and picture sharpness, the refresh rate and response time are by far the most crucial components of a gaming monitor. The Odyssey G3 Series comes in with an exceptionally brisk 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time to keep all of your moves happening in real time and your screen blur- and freeze-free. Those numbers aren’t usually associated with a gaming monitor with a $230 price tag like the Odyssey G3 Series usually carries, and virtually never with the $143 price it’s carrying now during this limited-time Amazon deal.</p>
<p>The Odyssey G3 Series gaming monitor adds AMD Radeon FreeSync to the package as an additional guard against lag and other game-killing visual delays. FreeSync keeps the monitor and the graphics card of your PC or console in perfect lockstep to thwart both lag and image tearing. The result is a smooth, seamless picture that endures even during the fastest action and most detailed scenes.</p>



<h2>Use the Crosshairs</h2>
<p>With the Virtual Aim Point in place, your shooting accuracy in battle royal and melee action will never be better. Virtual Aim Point puts actual crosshairs on the screen to help guide your shot with amazing precision. And when your foe finds a dark corner to hide in, the Odyssey G3 Series’ Black Equalizer feature allows you to adjust even the blackest areas on the screen to expose the danger.</p>
<p>The borderless design of the Odyssey G3 Series extends your gaming field to the absolute limit of the monitor’s frame, and it also allows you to line up a second borderless monitor to create a massive, seamless screen. Deploy the Eye Saver Mode and the monitor’s blue light is minimized and the screen flicker reduced, so you can play longer and more safely.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6205/">The Samsung Odyssey G3 Series comes with far more features and performance than any 27-inch gaming monitor should at its current price of just $143 at Amazon</a>. But the fat 38% discount is only good for a limited time, so don’t miss out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Three Fields Entertainment is a studio in dire straits. The developers of the recently released Wreckreation have revealed that the entire company has been put on redundancy notice.</p>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn on Thursday morning, CEO Fiona Sperry wrote a length message about the situation. </p>







<p>Wreckreation launched in October, and was published by THQ Nordic, a subsidiary of Embracer. However, based on her messaging, there hasn’t been much in the way of support from the publisher.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-ugcPost-7402348124054376448-Yfpq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her statement</a>, Sperry says that Three Fields Entertainment <strong>“will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future.”</strong> The studio, she said, has had to self-fund for most of 2025 and through all of the post-launch content.</p>



<p><strong>“Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form,”</strong> Sperry said. <strong>“Making this decision has been unbelievably painful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“This is a heartbreaking moment for all of us. What makes it even harder is that we have so many things in the pipeline — multiple features, updates, and creative ideas that we were excited to bring to the game, many of which are showcased in the video we’re sharing today. These are things we genuinely believed would have continued to strengthen Wreckreation and grow its community.”</strong></p>







<p>Sperry writes that her hope is that by showing the latest internal work publicly for the first time, it will lead to funding or interest from a different company.</p>



<p><strong>“But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team,” </strong>she said. <strong>“I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it.”</strong></p>

            <guid>1373008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The creators of the Fallout TV show have confirmed Season 2 avoids making any New Vegas ending canon by taking what they call "the fog of war approach."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Fallout video games had wondered how Season 2 might reflect the endings of Obsidian’s much-loved Fallout New Vegas, given the show is canon and is set 15 years after the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A quick reminder of where we’re at in the Fallout timeline: the Fallout TV show is set in 2296, nine years after the events of Fallout 4 and 15 years after the events of Fallout: New Vegas. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-fans-are-convinced-a-brotherhood-of-steel-airship-confirms-one-of-two-canon-endings-from-fallout-4"><u>We’ve already seen a debate about which Fallout 4 ending should be considered canon</u></a>, if any. Based on already released trailers, we know Mr. House is in Season 2, so does that suggest a canon ending is being used?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on the choices the player, aka The Courier, makes throughout the course of the game, New Vegas can end with victory for the player during the Battle of Hoover Dam, which drives out all factions including Mr. House himself, a victory for Mr. House in which he remains in control of New Vegas and takes over Hoover Dam, a victory for Caesar's Legion, or a victory for the New California Republic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are variations within these endings, but given Mr. House is in Season 2 in a post-war setting, and is alive (sort of) when the main characters turn up at New Vegas, it seems he survived the events of New Vegas the video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does Season 2 make a decision on who <em>won</em> Fallout New Vegas? It does not, executive producer, creator, and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet and executive producer Jonathan Nolan told IGN in an interview.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nolan said Geneva Robertson-Dworet and co-showrunner Graham Wagner took “the fog of war approach,” which he called "an absolutely brilliant way to make a bit of an end run around that whole question."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This was a really early decision that Graham and Jonah, and I made together,” Robertson-Dworet added, “was that we wanted to try, as much as possible in our show, to honor all gamers' experiences and all the choices they might make as they play the game. So we always wanted to avoid trying to make one canonical ending <em>the </em>ending that led to the events of the show.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Season 2, all the various factions at play think they won the events of the New Vegas video game. “We had the delicious idea that at the end of a conflict, 15 years down the line, every faction might think they won, which I think has a bit of a poetic quality to it,” Nolan said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's like, the story of history depends on who you ask,” Robertson-Dworet added. “That was the idea.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one fan-favorite minor faction in New Vegas who very much did not win: the Kings. In the video game, the Kings are a street gang made up of people who discovered an Elvis impersonation school and decided to live their lives according to the King’s ideals. But in Fallout Season 2, we see they have become ghouls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It hasn't worked out very well for the Kings, at least some of them,” Nolan teased, confirming the Elvis ghouls we see in the show are indeed the Kings characters from the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nolan continued: “One of the fun ideas is that, with all the factions, whether it's the Legion, or the NCR, or the Kings, is that in any version of the ending, there'd be some rebuilding to be done, right? Whoever won, whoever lost, all these factions would be in rebuilding mode, and the sort of sanctity of Vegas, this place that House very carefully protected, has been, for reasons we'll come to understand in the season, has been removed or violated, which means that the folks who were in the game, safe and sound, have had some hard times.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/f-1764845484020.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Kings have had a rough 15 years.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there is much about Season 2’s New Vegas that fans of the video game will find familiar. Robertson-Dworet described the Strip, for example, as “a very sacred kind of location.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You really feel like you're almost going into the heart of the game when you reach the Strip. And so it was really unbelievable to see what our production designer, Howard Cummings, pulled off. We took over an abandoned shopping mall and built there, and the scale of it was just phenomenal. So that was really exciting to see come to life. Freeside was also unbelievable, also because it's shot on the same street that Westworld was shot on and Deadwood. So just seeing that transformed at a place that's had so much TV history, for me, as a fan, as well as now making a show there, was really, really exciting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Season 2 kicks off December 17.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Lorenzo Sisti/Prime.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Escape a deceptive nightmare of rainbows and unicorns by making its happy creatures cry.</p><p><strong>A Genre With No Name</strong></p><p><em>Kill Joy</em> is an experiment in complex systems design where a single interaction (swearing) can produce many consequences. That also means that because exploring the rules of the system is the fun part, we won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to make sense of this insane world yourself.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Swearing is Not Combat—It’s How You Explore</strong></p><p>In <em>Kill Joy</em>, you don’t shoot, punch, or cast spells. You swear.</p><p>Swearing at creatures is how you interact with this world. Sometimes a creature laughs, sometimes it panics, and sometimes it weeps—and when it cries, the illusion breaks. Every reaction is a mechanical clue. Every rude word is a probe into the rules of a place that desperately wants you happy, calm, and blind.</p><p><strong>A Pastoral Hell</strong></p><p>On the surface, this world is a manic dream of rainbow meadows, talking bunnies, and friendly unicorns. Underneath, something is very wrong:</p><ul><li>Happy creatures with glossy, empty eyes.</li><li>Joyful clouds humming in unsettling harmony.</li><li>Perfect little critters who desperately want you to smile.</li></ul><p>You know better. You can feel something gnawing at the edges.</p><p><strong>Break the Illusion</strong></p><p>Some illusions are “anchored” to certain entities. Their happiness is a spell holding reality together. Make them cry, and the spell cracks. Behind each illusion is something real:</p><ul><li>Hidden passages.</li><li>Suppressed memories.</li><li>Twisted, half-digested hints left by previous victims.</li><li>And the scattered fragments of your own mind.</li></ul><p><strong>Reassemble Your Mind</strong></p><p>Your mind has been shattered and projected outward onto the landscape. Each dispelled illusion yields:</p><ul><li>A word.</li><li>A question.</li><li>A fragment of meaning.</li></ul><p>Piece them together through small, elegant deduction challenges. Rebuild the logic of your thinking. Recover your identity. Find out what’s eating you—and why.</p><p>If you’re tired of games that tell you what to feel, where to go, and how to think…</p><p>If you want something genuinely new…</p><p>If you’re ready to swear at a unicorn until reality fractures—.</p><p>Welcome to <em>Kill Joy</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="You've NEVER played a game like this." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M4THd1pA3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/systems-driven-exploration-game-kill-joy-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

Many landed on Earth. Since then, magic is real, myths have moved in, and the fabled live side by side with humans in relative peace. Present day and the rifts are back… but this time they bring sinister threats into our world. You and your friends team up as the new generation of fabled citizens whose forgotten powers are awakened by the return of the rifts—you must master your emerging and growing magical abilities to fight the invasion and save the city you now call home.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What genre is it?</strong><ul><li>The game genre is online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [649 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> cooperative action. The genre for the setting is urban fantasy. It blends and deconstructs fantasy and folklore, twisting them into a brand new reality set in London. It’s a familiar backdrop intertwined with fantastical wonder, delivering a sense of newness and nostalgia, discovery and familiar favorites. It’s fantasy in a modern jacket.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What’s the core gameplay loop?</strong><ul><li>Squads of players face overwhelming enemies and supernatural threats, creating high-stakes cooperative moments where success depends on teamwork. Run-based missions call upon players to employ their fluid magical traversal and visceral spell-casting to defeat threats that stand between them and their objectives. Players will utilize tight combat, special moves, team synergies, tag-team casting and team-up moves to save the city from invasion or liberate occupied districts.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Is it <a title="Genres > Open-World [784 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a>?</strong><ul><li>It’s not open-world. We want every district, every street, and every corner to be filled with fun activities and encounters. Using wide-linear maps, we balance large urban playgrounds, which are ripe for player-driven chaos and emergent gameplay, with scripted set-pieces that deliver boss-like encounters and epic moments, set against iconic backgrounds.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What’s the maximum number of players?</strong><ul><li>Currently, the game supports two-to-four players.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Are there player-versus-player modes?</strong><ul><li>At this time, we are focused on delivering the best player-versus-environment experience, but in the future, we look forward to opening up more modes and different ways to play.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Can I play single player?</strong><ul><li>No. We have an ambition to deliver an uncompromising, true cooperative experience where players are not simply side by side but connected by the gameplay. The nature of our design is that you need at least one teammate to amplify your powers. It’s a playground for you, your friends and the community.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What platforms are you supporting?</strong><ul><li>We believe in a cross-platform ecosystem and plan to release <em>Cast Outs</em> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
