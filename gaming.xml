<p>Despite its initially rocky launch, developer Creative Assembly stuck with Total War: Warhammer 3 since day one, unleashing bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and brand-new content in the form of expansions and faction packs to expand upon the game’s core armies significantly. Well, the game’s about to grow larger. CA has announced the Omens of Destruction for Total War: Warhammer 3, featuring three new playable Legendary Lords, one each for Khorne, Ogre Kingdoms, and the Orcs.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Omens of Destruction Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83chO9NuWAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The three new Legendary Lords include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gorbad </strong>– Orcs</li>



<li><strong>Golgfag </strong>– Ogre Kingdoms</li>



<li><strong>Skulltaker </strong>– Khorne</li>
</ul>



<p>The three new pieces of DLC will launch simultaneously on December 12. While the price tag is currently unknown, going by past Legendary Lord DLC, we suspect each pack will cost $8.99 apiece. A bundle containing all three will be available for approximately $23, with a slight discount for packaging them together.</p>



<p>Alongside the new DLC, we’ll receive update 6.0 for Total War: Warhammer 3, and the 100th Legendary Lord, Arbaal the Undefeated, a champion of Khorne, utterly free as part of the update. </p>

                <p>Australia has built a reputation as having one of the strictest video game rating systems on the planet, and it appears as though another highly anticipated game won't reach the country's shores when it's released next year.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact, the fighting game based on the popular anime, has been refused classification by the Australian Classification Board (ACB), officially preventing the game from being sold in the country. The group listed no reason for the decision, but with the ACB having set a precedent with other games with similar ratings, and the reasoning behind them, it could be a few possibilities.</p><p>The main suspected reason is how drug use has a gameplay benefit, like granting speed or strength, or portraying drug use in a positive light. For example, if a character even gets health restored from narcotics, that game would likely be refused classification (RC). Disco Elysium: The Final Cut was originally banned because of this, but that decision was later overturned after the ACB agreed that player performance actually showed "negative impacts from depictions of drug use."</p><p>Other potential reasons include on-screen depictions of sexual violence and sexualized depictions of characters who appear to be under 18. South Park: The Stick of Truth was banned for the same reasons as the game involves an underaged main character getting anally probed by aliens. A censored version was released replacing those scenes with a card of a koala crying explaining what has been cut out.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact is being developed by Eighting, a close collaborator with Nintendo, having contributed to Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Pikmin 4, and Nintendo Switch Sports. The game is scheduled to be released on PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC, but unless publisher Arc System Works decides to appeal, Australian fans will sadly miss out.</p>

                <p>Section 9 Interactive, a studio composed of former Tarsier Studios devs responsible for the first two<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares/"> Little</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares/" data-ref-id="5000-456964"> Nightmares</a> games, has announced today it's inked a deal with Epic Games Publishing to bring its upcoming game to PC and consoles. The game doesn't have an announced name yet, but by the looks of it, some of the Little Nightmares aesthetic will carry over into this debut project from the studio.</p><p>Despite the creepy enemies and shadowy atmosphere, the studio doesn't describe the game as horror. Instead, it considers it a "sci-fi action-adventure" game built in Unreal Engine 5. Still, some of the enemies shown in the game's work-in-progress assets like the one below have a certain "In space, no one can hear you scream" vibe about them. No release window has yet been revealed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405888" data-ratio="0.56070287539936" data-width="626" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405888"></a><figcaption>I'm not sure what to call this thing, but instinctively, I know to run from it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png"></figure><p>For Epic, this signing follows its most high-profile work yet in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a>, which launched last year on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 to universal acclaim. The game originally launched as a digital-only title, but as of a few weeks ago, it now has a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-physical-edition-preorders-are-live-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x/1100-6524001/"> physical version available for consoles</a>. Echoing what Remedy had said of its partner, Section 9 said Epic Publishing has "given us incredible support and the freedom to fully explore our creative vision, which is all we can ask for in a publisher."</p><p>Other ongoing Epic Publishing deals include the long-gestating next game from Playdead, the studio behind indie darlings <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/limbo/" data-ref-id="5000-70518">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inside/" data-ref-id="5000-285251">Inside</a>, as well as Fumito Ueda's studio GenDesign.

Tarsier, the series' original developer, is making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/reanimal/" data-ref-id="5000-640431">Reanimal</a>, while Supermassive has been handed the reins to create the next sequel in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-599972">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>

But you’ll likely find reliable favorites among the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Assault Rifles</strong>: Dnipro</li>



<li><strong>Grenades</strong>: F-1 Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Launcher</strong>: RPG-7U</li>



<li><strong>Machine Guns</strong>: RPM-74</li>



<li><strong>Pistols</strong>: Rhino</li>



<li><strong>Shotguns</strong>: M860 Cracker</li>



<li><strong>SMGs</strong>: Shah’s Mate</li>



<li><strong>Sniper Rifles</strong>: M701 Sniper</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you have a favorite weapon in Stalker 2 yet? I’m still running Skif’s Pistol with a suppressor and the Dnipro, and they’re both so very satisfying to use! Let us know in the comments below, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> to discuss the game!</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, CD Projekt Red released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3-official-modding-tool-arrives-soon-will-let-users-edit-almost-anything/1100-6523245/" data-ref-id="1100-6523245">REDkit</a>, the official modding tool for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>. While that opened up a world of possibilities for PC players, the core game has just received an incredible visual upgrade that may even surpass the title's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">2022 next-gen update</a>.</p><p>A modder who goes by Halk Hogan released The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project: Next Gen Edition, which claims to raise "the game's visuals to the highest level yet and enhance it to a truly next-gen masterpiece." To back up those remarks, Halk Hogan has posted a 15-minute side-by-side comparison on YouTube that shows off the improvements.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD1mNA4Efcw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jD1mNA4Efcw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project: Next Gen Edition is now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9963" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NexusMods</a>. According to the description, "Everything is carefully made with attention to every detail. All this is aimed at making the game more detailed, realistic, consistent and as faithful as possible reflecting the atmosphere of the dirty world of the Witcher."</p><p>As part of an earnings report earlier this week, CD Projekt Red revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">The Witcher 4 is officially in production</a>, and the announcement came alongside an enigmatic teaser image. That game is probably still several years away from reaching players. In the meantime, Liam Hemsworth will be taking over the role of Geralt from Henry Cavill in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look-as-geralt-revealed-by-netflix/1100-6523641/" data-ref-id="1100-6523641">The Witcher Season 4</a> on Netflix.

Customization is the main reason. The Ultimate has two remappable back triggers and a dedicated app for PC, Mac, and mobile devices that lets you tweak various features. You can remap inputs, set up three custom profiles to cycle through on the fly, and adjust the sensitivity of the sticks, dual rumble motors, and triggers. You can also create dead zones and program macros.</p><p>And unlike the Switch Pro Controller, the 8BitDo Ultimate has Hall Effect analog sticks, which mitigates the risk of stick drift.</p><p>The Ultimate is a well-designed controller that feels great to hold. I think the Switch Pro Controller has slightly better ergonomics, so I personally switch back and forth between the two controllers. If I'm playing a game with a bunch of control inputs like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or Echoes of Wisdom, I like the convenience of the back buttons on the Ultimate.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth comes with a matching charging dock with a compartment housing the 2.4GHz adapter. You can use the optional adapter on PC, Mac, or Steam Deck to play wirelessly on those platforms.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - AKA Project Polaris AKA "the first instalment in the new Witcher saga", as it continues to be referred to in lieu of a publicly announced name - is another step closer to release, with CD Projekt confirming its development has shifted to "full-scale production".
</p>
<p>
"I'm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development," joint CEO Michał Nowakowski wrote in a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-third-quarter-of-2024/">statement accompanying its Q3 2024 earnings report</a>. "We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication."
</p>
<p>
Nowakowski's update follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">progress report in August</a> anticipating Project Polaris' full production phase would start "soon", and CD Projekt's confirmation that milestone has now been reached was celebrated on social media by Polaris game director Sebastian Kalemba. "With new challenges just around the corner," he <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571">wrote</a>, "it's the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what's on the other side of the coin!"

It has, of course, been a little over two and half years since CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">revealed</a> development on the next game in The Witcher series had begun, but the project still remains a bit of an enigma. About all we know so far, beyond whatever speculation can be eked out of the single bit of tantalising promo art shared alongside Polaris' announcement, is that it "won't focus" on Geralt of Rivia. That bit of news was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">shared by Geralt actor Doug Cockle earlier this year</a>, although he did at least confirm the character would be a "part of" the new game.
</p><p>
Alongside CD Projekt's Witcher news, the studio has provided updated sales figures for some of its older titles, confirming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> has now surpassed 30m copies sold. That's 5m more than the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sales-top-25m-cd-projekt-red-announces">shifted last October</a>, with the well-recieved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion also selling a further 5m copies in the same timeframe, bringing its total sales up to 8m. "These are impressive figures," Nowakowski added. "I'm very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games."
</p>
<p>Additionally, CD Projekt has reiterated, as per a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpeetmZuc80">teaser in September</a>, it'll be following the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">2022's acclaimed Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> with a brand-new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, although no further information has been revealed.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt previously announced Cyberpunk 2077 is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">launching for Mac next year</a>, but one thing the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro">won't be getting</a> is any kind of update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.

<p>Despite recent downfalls, like that of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a>, the free-to-play hero shooter genre continues performing relatively well for a select few titles. It’s hard for a newcomer to make a dent, but it appears Theorycraft Games’ Supervive, launched on November 20, outperforms much of its competition. But it leaves many questions open for fans on the sidelines. For instance, who are the Supervive hunters?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-supervive">What is Supervive?</h2>



<p>Supervive is a free-to-play hero shooter with battle royale and MOBA elements from developer Theorycraft Games. It’s a fast-paced, PvP-oriented experience that favors frantic gameplay in which players will dash and glide while unleashing attack combos to deal damage and complete objectives. Every hero in the game, known as a Hunter, is flexible and allows various abilities and equipment to alter playstyles and change up the match.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-hunters-in-supervive">What Are Hunters in Supervive?</h2>



<p>Hunters in Supervive are this game’s version of heroes. They’re playable characters, each of which fall into five categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fighter</strong></li>



<li><strong>Initiator</strong></li>



<li><strong>Frontliner</strong></li>



<li><strong>Protector</strong></li>



<li><strong>Controller</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike your typical hero shooter, Supervive heavily leans into its MOBA roots to combine elements of the compelling lane-based gameplay in its PvP-focused free-to-play hero shooter.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-are-all-of-the-supervive-hunters-available">Who Are All of the Supervive Hunters Available?</h2>



<p>There are a total of sixteen playable characters in Supervive currently, including:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Brall</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bishop</strong></li>



<li><strong>Celeste</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elluna</strong></li>



<li><strong>Felix</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ghost</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hudson</strong></li>



<li><strong>Jin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Joule</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kingpin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Myth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Oath</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shiv</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shrike</strong></li>



<li><strong>Void</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zeph</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 is getting another new show adaptation on Netflix.</p>



<p>“I’m also very happy to announce that we’re working on another animation project set in the Cyberpunk universe, which will be released on Netflix,” CD Projekt Red Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said during the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s earnings call</a> on Tuesday.</p>







<p>There was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-releases-trailers-for-cyberpunk-devil-may-cry-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser for a new project</a> from Netflix released in September. However, nothing had been officially announced by CD Projekt Red before the call on November 26. </p>



<p>No other details for the upcoming project were announced by the studio. That information is expected to come in the coming weeks and months. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, a spin-off of the series, is currently available to watch on Netflix. That series was produced by Studio Trigger.</p>



<p>In addition to the outside projects of the series, CD Projekt Red is continuing work on the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Known as Project Orion, the game currently has 64 people —  just under 10% of the company — working on it. The game is expected to come after the release of the next game in The Witcher series, Project Polaris.</p>

We have the descriptions and effects of all these artifacts, so you have the luxury of picking and choosing what you’ll look for!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compass</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in gravitational anomalies. It is believed that whoever discovers and holds the Compass will gain the ability to navigate the Zone safely. Maximum Radiation, Maximum Physical Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Hypercube</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in thermal anomalies. The full potential of this artifact has not yet been discovered, but it emits ultra-long radio waves and could be used in space navigation. Maximum Thermal Protection, Maximum Radiation, and Maximum Bleeding Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Ball</strong>: A child’s oddly heavy ball, this legendary “altered item” is often mentioned in hushed tones. If you equip it, it is said to reduce bullet damage in combat while standing still. Unique Effect—Reduces bullet damage when standing still.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Flower</strong>: A unique-looking flower, this legendary “altered item” is often not directly mentioned. If you sleep with this flower on your belt, its fragrance can mask your scent for a limited time. Unique Effect—Sleeping with the flower will cause its fragrance to mask your scent, though the effect diminishes over time.</li>
</ul>







<ul>

Unique Effect—Promotes rapid blood coagulation when attached to your belt, but the wounds will take longer to heal.</li>



<li><strong>Heart of Chornobyl</strong>: A mythical artifact that functions as a psi-radiation amplifier. The degree of amplification depends on the source’s capabilities and characteristics. Its properties are not fully understood, but it is thought to encapsulate the original structure of the Zone’s matter. Unique Effect—Used in Kalmanov ending.</li>



<li><strong>Thunderberry</strong>: A legendary artifact found in electro anomalies. When heated gradually to 78 degrees Celsius, it produces vibrant collective hallucinations that present a utopia. Maximum Radiation, Maximum Endurance.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/top-down-roguelike-guidus-zero-launches-in-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Venture into The Scar and take on corrupted enemies in real-time grid-based combat.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam’s Early Access recently got a new addition: Guidus Zero, a top-down dungeon crawling roguelike developed by indie South Korean studio Izzle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story takes place in a world where a war raged for ages without a clear victor. After it ended, the central continent was declared a neutral zone. A massive sinkhole called The Scar opened on that continent, and from its depths comes a mysterious substance known as Black Blood that spawns corrupted beings. It’s unknown how this sinkhole came to be, where the Black Blood is coming from, or what waits in the deepest regions of The Scar. That’s where you come in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll join a cast of characters in The Scar, traveling deeper and deeper beneath the surface while facing all manner of enemies that have been corrupted by the Black Blood. You’ll have several different controllable characters to choose from, each with their own strengths and abilities. There’s real-time action combat with a bit of a twist: You and your enemies move between tiles on a grid in which you can only navigate in the four cardinal directions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When an enemy is about to attack, an exclamation mark will appear above their head and the ground will be highlighted showing where their attack will land. Different enemies have different attack patterns — some strike directly in front of them, some hit a long line, and others target a larger area of the grid. You’ll face several enemies at a time, forcing you to stay on your toes and react quickly to dodge attacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While moving, you can roll to make yourself invincible, but each roll consumes stamina. And since you can’t move diagonally, you’ll need to be strategic about which direction you move and how often you roll. You don’t want to end up trapped between attacks you can’t avoid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat isn’t all about avoiding damage, though. You need to be able to dish it out too, but how you do that changes depending on what character you pick. Before each run, you’ll choose a character and their starting trait. In classic RPG fashion, killing enemies gains experience, which makes you level up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you level up, you’ll unlock choices for skill upgrades that are unique to the trait you picked at the start of the run. These will define the playstyle of that run, so even if you play the same character, runs can play differently depending on the starting trait and upgrades you pick. Your levels and progression selections are exclusive to that run, so when you die, they’ll all reset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything will reset, though. During the course of a run, you’ll come across ore veins you can break to obtain stones, which have their own stats. All the stones in your bag will add together, and reaching certain stat thresholds will give your character buffs. You can equip stones in available slots, which will preserve them even after your run ends. Any unequipped stones in your bag when your run ends will be converted into stone fragments, which can serve as currency or be reforged into new stones by an NPC blacksmith.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During each run, you can also discover special rooms with treasure chests where you can find artifacts. They grant unique buffs and improve your abilities, and over time can build up stacks of elemental effects. If an artifact reaches five stacks, it becomes bonded with a spirit that corresponds to that element and allows you to use unique elemental attacks and effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Becoming bonded to Ignis, the fire spirit, gives you access to a burn debuff that deals continuous damage. Atlen, the water spirit, slows enemies and freezes those with a wet debuff. Rathorus, the lightning spirit, inflicts a shock debuff that deals additional damage. Enryl, the wind spirit, increases your movement speed and enhances multi-hits with a sprint buff. Terrania, the earth spirit, inflicts a petrify debuff that causes fragments to shoot out when you attack petrified enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all adds up to a roguelike with a classic “one more run” feeling. Stones provide permanent growth, while your choices for character, starting trait, and ability upgrades make every run different. If you’re interested in checking out Guidus Zero, it’s available now in Early Access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3072640?utm_source=IGN&amp;utm_campaign=EarlyAccess_PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_content=Native_Article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Steam</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They’re celebrating launch by offering a 10% discount that will last until Dec. 9. Guidus Zero is also considering future releases for Xbox and Nintendo Switch, but a console release has not been officially announced.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dayz-dev-uses-beatles-song-to-respond-to-players-review-bombing-27-dlc-for-being-too-expensive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Long-running zombie game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dayz-stand-alone">DayZ</a> is currently embroiled in a Steam review-bomb campaign after releasing $27 DLC deemed “too expensive” by disgruntled players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DayZ Frostline launched in October priced $26.99. The expansion adds a new snow-covered map called Sakhal that spans 83km² (not including ice sheets). There’s a winter wilderness with new challenges and opportunities for survival. “Brace yourself for a truly immersive adventure where the environment itself is as much your adversary as the infected and other survivors,” reads developer Bohemia Interactive’s description.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DayZ players, however, have reacted negatively to Frostline’s price, with Steam user reviews saying it’s “not worth the money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... Sakhal does have SOME neat stuff to it, but it is absolutely NOT worth its asking price as of right now,” reads one negative review. “Maybe in time they'll add more interesting features to the map to justify its existence, but right now you can get much better maps for free and Bohemia knows it. If you really want a frozen hellhole experience, play Namalsk. But if you play DayZ on PC I'm sure you already have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recent reviews for Frostline now have the dreaded ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam, which Bohemia boss Marek Spanel clearly takes issue with. In a <a href="https://x.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Spanel revealed that the Czech studio has received less than 10 cents for each hour of live online gaming DayZ has tracked since the game went live over a decade ago, when you factor in the average hours played and dollars spent by the game’s eight million users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yet DayZ Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for ‘just a map,’ and some users demand ‘gimme more for less money,’ Spanel continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hmm. Please Please Me.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dayz?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Dayz</a>? That means we received less than 10 cents for an hour of live online gaming, for which we host the online infrastructure and have been… <a href="https://t.co/zOMQNvEPtq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zOMQNvEPtq</a></p>— Marek Spanel (@maruksp) <a href="https://twitter.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That last line is a reference to the Beatles song, Please Please Me, which includes the lyrics: “I don't want to sound complaining, But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart), I do all the pleasing with you, It's so hard to reason with you, Whoa, yeah, why do you make me blue?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding further to X / Twitter users, Spanel said “nobody is forcing anyone to buy DayZ Frostline; the base game is still running for all users.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The official DayZ account was perhaps a little more diplomatic, <a href="https://x.com/DayZ/status/1861419562027163746" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quote-tweeting Spanel’s original post</a> to say it’s listening to the feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also don't forget about our amazing modding community - and yes, they've got tons of free maps that'll keep you busy if you are not ready to join people on frosty Sakhal just yet!” Bohemia added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While continuing to update DayZ, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bohemia-used-a-live-concert-to-announce-arma-4-coming-in-2027">Bohemia is also working on Arma 4</a>, which recently received a release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Unfortunately the reaction so far has been largely negative, and that’s because of the apparent prevalence of cheaters who are ruining the integrity of the mode. And yes, as has become Call of Duty tradition, console players are turning off crossplay in a bid to avoid PC cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it’s made over 19,000 ranked play bans since the mode launched, and that it was continuing to ramp up its AI systems with code optimizations to accelerate enforcements. “Thanks for your patience as our team continues to fight against cheaters,” Activision added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tweet was met with a healthy dose of scepticism from players, including high-profile Call of Duty content creators and pros. 100 Thieves founder Nadeshot, for example, called Activision’s tweet “complete propaganda.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... I have played the same cheaters since day one and not a single one has even a scratch on ‘em,” he <a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/1861245061368787123" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “How could there possibly be 19K accounts banned when the most egregious abusers are giving us the middle finger on the leaderboard? Are we crazy? What is going on?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputational issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match">it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applies to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place. Upgrades were set to launch alongside ranked play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly – they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-is-getting-the-new-spear-weapon-very-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NCSoft and Amazon Games announced that a new weapon type will be released very soon, on December 5, for the MMORPG Throne and Liberty: the spear. In a dedicated video, the developers went into what makes it unique compared to other melee weapons already in the game:</p>
<p><em>The spear is a fire-attribute close-range weapon. Although it's a melee weapon, you can gain combat advantages through its long reach and pocking plays with throwing mechanics. It enables combo-based combat with fast-tempo skills and has initiating skills that allow you to leap into battle instantly. Overall, it's a hybrid weapon that can fulfill both Tank and DPS roles – what we might call a Bruiser or Fighter – designed specifically for these roles. The existing four Ranged weapons have been performing relatively well in combat by utilizing distance advantages and positional elements.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, we needed a weapon that could change the tide of battle. The Spear's image started from concepts like Warrior, Berserker, and Assault Captain. It has defensive characteristics, good mobility, and many utility skills. We designed it to have strategic value on the battlefield. You can look forward to Spear skills useful for dealing with multiple opponents, combat through distance control, and special Spear-specific skills.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><iframe title="THRONE AND LIBERTY | Feature Reveal: The Spear" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFF6kgNugGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful debut outside of Korea</a> (even in the face of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-wants-to-grow-throne-and-liberty-into-a-respected-global-ip-but-cancels-two-games-amid-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal restructuring at NCSoft</a>), Throne and Liberty just received four new endgame 2-Star Dungeons last week: Carmine Rage Island, Voidwastes, Island of Terror, and Valley of Slaughter.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Amazon Games Globalization Design Manager Daniel Lafuente (whom we interviewed before the game's launch) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y91MABfDFc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the new PvP War Games feature will be introduced to Throne and LIberty on December 5 as well.</p>
<p><em>War Games provides a custom Lobby feature for Conquest battles or Rift Stones and Boon Stones. Within the War Games menu, players can create their custom lobby, selecting what stone they want to fight over, the number of teams that will fight, and the size of each team. Then players join in, and once the lobby is full, you start the match. My favorite thing is you can do private and public matches, so we think the use cases for players is going to be that huge competitive PVP guilds can use it for practices, while less competitive guilds can do inner Guild skirmishes with their friends.</em></p>
<p>There won't be any rewards related to War Games for the time being, but that might change in the future after Amazon and NCSoft have gathered the community's feedback.</p>

            <p>
Just when you thought you'd played all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> - maxed every last stat, drained the XP of every last creature, tap-danced your way along every branching questline - CD Projekt have announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> is in "full-scale production".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"I'm pleased to announce that several weeks ago it moved on to full-scale production," chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said of the game, currently codenamed Polaris, during the company's <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf">latest quarterly earnings presentation</a> to investors (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-says/">VGC</a>). "Of all our projects, this one is currently the most far along, and we're starting the most intensive phase of development."
</p>
<p>
Game director Sebastian Kalemba has also been <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571">talking the announcement up on social media</a>. "No stopping now!" he thrilled. "Stay tuned for what's on the other side of the coin!" The post accompanies a photograph of a coin - see this article's header - on which are engraved rays of light above a cliffside and some runes. Do you know what, I bet there's a picture of a Witcher on the other side of that coin! Perhaps a picture of a Witcher accompanying the words "Witcher 4".
</p>
<p>
The next Witcher game may not be called The Witcher 4, mind you. I attended a sci-fi writing class once in which the tutor grouchily remarked that book publishers get leery about overtly episodic fantasy stories, because "why would I buy Frostblazen Book XII when I haven't bought and read Frostblazen Books I-XI". I imagine video game publishers have similar concerns. It's been a fair old while since The Witcher 3's release - calling it Witcher 4 might scare away players who missed the last game. Perhaps they'll give it an annoying subtitle, instead, or just chicken out and call it "The Witcher", as with Lords Of The Fallen.
</p><p>
As of this March, there were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-4-is-more-than-the-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-promise-cdpr-as-over-400-devs-work-on-polaris">over 400 CD Projekt staff</a> working on Polaris. It'll be the first in a new trilogy of Witcher games. CD Projekt's other current endeavours include a Witcher 1 Remake, developed in collaboration with Fool's Theory, Project Sirius, a Witcher spin-off with multiplayer elements from The Molasses Flood, and Project Orion, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">the next Cyberpunk game</a>. 
</p>
<p>
What does "full-scale production" mean? It's a blurry category, but basically, it's the longer part of development after the more open-ended <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-latest-next-cyberpunk-game-might-have-multiplayer-witcher-4-enters-production-phase">pre-production phase</a> when things like character models, environments and combat systems are actually being made and finished. I am very much squinting at the tea leaves, here, but it's probably safe to say that CD Projekt will formally announce the thing and share a few videos and images next year.

<p>The world of the extraction shooter continues growing monthly as indie developers jump into the fray with their vision of the genre. Some choose to combine horror elements; others stick with tried-and-tested realism formulas. But one king reigns supreme, and that’s Escape From Tarkov. It’s the one extraction shooter every other title strives to topple. Thanks to a Black Friday deal, you can score Escape From Tarkov cheap!</p>



<h2 id="h-buy-escape-from-tarkov-for-25-off-for-black-friday">Buy Escape From Tarkov for 25% Off for Black Friday</h2>



<p>If you’re one of the many who don’t yet own Escape From Tarkov but have your sights set on the extraction shooter genre, this Black Friday deal should be on your radar. You can score the extraction shooter king cheap—<strong>25% off</strong>—for a limited time between <strong>November 28 and November 30</strong>.</p>



<p>This deal includes all of the game’s various editions. That said, Battlestate Games was quick to tell everyone the 50% discount for upgrading from the Edge of Darkness Edition to The Unheard Edition does not, unfortunately, stack with the Black Friday discount.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it doesn’t appear any of the expansions or additional packages available, like the stash upgrade, will receive similar discounts.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-each-edition-of-escape-from-tarkov">What’s Included in Each Edition of Escape From Tarkov?</h2>



<p>There are currently four versions of Escape From Tarkov available, ranging in price from $50 to $250 without the current Black Friday discount. Again, that discount kicks in on November 28.</p>

The storyline continues with the Requiem crew after their escape from Terminus. And in the first cinematic trailer for the new map, the team runs into an old friend, Sergei Ravenov.</p><p>Most of the trailer takes place from Sergei's perspective, and he's genuinely surprised to see his old allies alive. But this isn't a social call, as the team is looking for a man named Craft who "may be able to bring back Maxis." Presumably they're referring to Samantha Maxis, an adversary-turned-ally before her untimely demise when she sacrificed herself to seal the Dark Aether portal.</p>

		<p>King of Meat is getting a closed alpha test in December, Glowmade and Amazon’s chaotic four player gameshow dungeon ’em up opening the castle gates to invited played on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> for a limited period of time – <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/news/articles/king-of-meat-lights-camera-alpha">you can sign up here</a> for a chance to take part.</p>
<p>But what is King of Meat? Well, here’s where a handy new series of videos comes in, explaining the over-the-top medieval world, the co-op hack ‘n’ slash action, and how user generated content comes into the mix as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="What is King of Meat Episode 1: Co-Op Mayhem" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KbFIZ1jlMB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Taking place in the world of Loregok, King of Meat tasks players with completing quick dungeon courses filled with dungeons, trolls, skeletons and traps. But this isn’t actually back in the heyday of fantasy, because there’s all of the glitz and glamour of gameshow stardom, the hyper-capitalism of the modern world smashed into the fantasy setting.</p>
<p>You’ll have to work together with your team to overcome each room of enemies and traps, but at the same time, you’ll want to be the first among equals. On the other hand, you might want to instead be the best level creator out there, earning plaudits for your devilish creations as teams take them on.</p>

<p>You can really see Glowmade’s heritage shining through here, with the studio based in Guildford and featuring developers who previously worked on LittleBigPlanet at Media Molecule and Fable at Lionhead.</p>
<p>For the time being, Glowmade is keeping King of Meat testing private. This is a closed alpha test that is invite-only and will require you to agree to an NDA. Invites will be sent out on 3rd December, before the test gets underway on 4th December for a limited time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This afternoon, CD Projekt RED VP and Game Director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571?t=qKSrHnijalfbeBpYM8C1lw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via Twitter (X) that The Witcher 4 is officially in full scale production after recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ending</a> the pre-production phase. He also shared his confidence that the new saga could be a remarkable experience for fans.</p>
<p><em>I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase! With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!⚔️</em></p>
<p>Kalemba shared a picture with the tweet. This could be our very first look at The Witcher 4.</p>

<p>We first heard of the new game over two and a half years ago when CD Projekt RED also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>they were abandoning their own REDEngine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. At the time, they called it a true partnership where they would also contribute back to the game-making tool. CTO Paweł Zawodny said:</p>
<p><em>From the outset, we did not consider a typical licensing arrangement; both we and Epic see this as a long-term, fulfilling tech partnership. It is vital for CD Projekt Red to have the technical direction of our next game decided from the earliest possible phase as; in the past, we spent a lot of resources and energy to evolve and adapt REDengine with every subsequent game release. This cooperation is so exciting, because it will elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools. I can’t wait for the great games we’re going to create using Unreal Engine 5!</em></p>
<p>The switch could speed up the development of future games, but that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-not-speeding-development-cdpr-hopes-helps-in-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't apply</a> to The Witcher 4, since the team is still familiarizing itself with the new tool. When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-aims-to-go-beyond-current-rpgs-says-cdpr-itll-be-a-good-entry-point-for-new-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about the new installment last year, Sebastian Kalemba teased that the studio aims to surpass current RPGs with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-wont-just-retread-the-last-game-adding-new-features-and-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features and mechanics</a> that break boundaries. Moreover, the new The Witcher game will be a great entry point for newcomers.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-polaris-first-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> the first actor who will work on the game. That info also revealed how voice-over and motion capture will begin in 2025. It's hard to say exactly when The Witcher 4 could launch, but it will be at least a couple more years if not more. Until then, you can beautify The Witcher 3 NextGen Edition with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HalkHogan's definitive texture mod</a>.</p>

The closure was announced i<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">n a post on the company’s LinkedIn page</a>. “Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations,” the post read.</p><p>Humanoid Origin was founded by Hudson in 2021 when it was then known as Humanoid Studios. Hudson started the studio after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22151192/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-leaving-dragon-age-mass-effect">leaving a 20-year career at BioWare</a> where he worked as a producer and director on several of the studio’s seminal titles including <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Hudson left BioWare in 2014 for a brief stint at Microsoft Studios before returning to BioWare in 2017. Then in 2020, he left BioWare for good saying it was time to, “make way for the next generation of studio leaders.”</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Key Art from Humanoid Origin’s unreleased game</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Humanoid Origin</cite></p></div></div><p>In 2022, Humanoid Studios <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/3/22/22991023/mass-effect-casey-hudson-humanoid-new-sci-fi-game">announced its first project</a>, “a multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative in an&nbsp;all-new science fiction universe.” Beyond concept art on the studio’s website, little was known about the game. Humanoid Origin’s closure is just the latest data point in the second year running of devastating layoffs and closures impacting the video game industry. <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Closing+out+2023">According to unofficial tallies</a>, over 23,000 jobs have been lost over the last two years with 2024 seeing the shuttering of studios like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks,</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
