It's got hexagonal maps, flesh trees, gangly Evangelion-grade giants, "otherworldly hymns of decay", nuclear bombs, and a player-led "blend of magic and cyberpunk" that extends from the city architecture to the research component. All of which is my cup of giblets. Here's the launch trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>OK, as and when I play, I'm probably going to turn off that unit dialogue. Why does everybody sound so chipper about being forced to trade blows with tentacle beasts? But the putrid scenery is inviting, and I like the sound of a "combat-focused" 4X with battles taking place on the same map as exploration and construction. I also like the premise of, essentially, deciding what particular flavour of sci-fantasy you want your civ to become. Will you field a robot army dolled up with alien gadgets, channel dark forces from beyond the veil, or some combination of the two? Here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Humanity emerges, hesitantly, into ruination. Almost nothing is left of the world as we knew it--settlements, forests, seas, mountains--all have been blasted into unfamiliarity. Horribly mutated animals hunt in packs through deformed woodland. Decrepit military robots stumble unknowingly through the ruins, sensors and logic centres blown. Alien soldiers, once impossibly powerful, cower in the wrecks of their ships, praying to heedless gods for rescue.</p>
<p>Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some numbers. Over 50 unique units in battle! Over 150 technologies! Six kinds of climate to worry about as you paint the map! 11 tiered resources to account for when running your economy! OK, that's enough numbers. Don't fret, there are more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/">the Steam page</a>.</p><p>The aforesaid Gladius came out in 2018, at the height of the pre-Edwin period. It appears to have been well-received. How terribly embarrassing, then, for my vaunted predecessors at Rock Paper Shotgun, who never managed to review it. Fraser (RPS in peace) did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-gladius-relics-of-war-killed-off-all-the-diplomats">write about the absence of diplomatic options</a>. Zephon appears to be cut from the same cloth, even if it's comparatively deficient in Tyranids.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-comic-hunters-board-game-review.1031367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-comic-hunters-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Collecting comic books has been a thing for as long as the comic industry has been around. There's an almost irresistable allure to having that one issue featuring the debut of your favorite hero or the one where a lovable character dies. I have dipped my toe into the comic-collecting hobby from time to time, and that was why I had to have Comic Hunters, if for nothing other than all the official comic covers the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">Marvel-themed board game</a> features. </p><div catalogid="b2d5765a-319b-4a3d-95dc-44885f751402" id="210193"><div id="210193" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel Comic Hunters</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Robert Coelho with Art by Diego Sa, Comic Hunters was initially released exclusively in Brazil back in 2020 but, thanks to Spin Master and Arcane Wonders, has now been released in the United States. In Comic Hunters, anywhere from one to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> compete with one another, traveling from flea markets to auction houses, in the attempt to snag those classic Marvel comic issues to make the most valuable collection of them all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The core idea of Comic Hunters is that players draft cards to make the most valuable collection of comics. Each game allows you to set the market value either randomly or by hand-picking which heroes or types of comics are the most sought-after. To keep things interesting, drafting is done in five different ways, including players taking a card from a drawn hand of cards and passing the remainders to the next player, bidding on a blind pool of cards, and more. Once you have your new set of comics, you build your collections, paying for the cards you keep with the other cards you drafted but are opting to discard. The more of a certain hero or type of comic (first appearance, outfit change, epic battle, etc.) the more points you will get at the end of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a process that, once you've gone through it once or twice, you and the other players will fly through. It results in a game that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024">doesn’t take long to play</a> at all, but that initial time figuring out how all the different methods of drafting works can be a bit tedious as the rulebook doesn’t explain it very clearly. Multiple times during my first game, I had to stop and reread the rules to figure it out. Luckily, though, the whole game flow is quick and smooth once you wrap your brain around it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With being playable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> or with up to four players, Comic Hunters feels like a different game depending on your player count. My favorite setup is playing it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board game</a> against one other person. With two players, cards and player collections are manageable enough (each player’s sets are openly displayed in front of them) to make it a game where you can not only strategize what cards are best for you to expand your sets but also what could hinder your opponent too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At three and four players, the number of cards out and around the table can get overwhelming and instead often changed into more of a solitaire experience where I was only focused on my own sets and not stopping others, which admittedly may be more attractive to many players. For me, though, I appreciate the addition of that little bit of conflict. Fair warning: Comic Hunters can trigger decision paralysis, so be wary if that's an issue for you or the people you want to play against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are several avenues to score points come the end the game – the sets of hero comics you have, the types of issues you have, the star tickets you have left that you didn’t use during auctions – so depending on how many comics you’ve managed to get, counting up the various symbols and figuring out how to best organize your sets for the most points can be a bit of a chore. My best recommendation to alleviate this is to simply keep track as you play with tally marks on how much of any one type you have in a set at any given time and adjust after the end of each set-building phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comic Hunters’ initial “WOW!” factor and draw is thanks to all of the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics/marvel-comics">Marvel comics</a> featured on the cards. It’s longevity and how well it keeps your interest will depend entirely on how much you like drafting and set collection games.  I had a fine time with the game (especially with the added adversary aspect at lower player counts mentioned earlier). I found the inclusion of having multiple drafting types helps the experience, but I never stopped wishing that there was another layer to the game. Maybe you could trade with others, or maybe there was a way to influence what the most desirable comics were midgame to try and swing things in your favor. Instead, you get drafting with a side of drafting, with a bit more drafting. The most interesting aspect of Comic Hunters is how you pay for the cards in your set with other cards you drafted, causing me to look for things I wanted and also chaff that I could snag to pay for the cards I wanted to collect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the art of all the covers is nice, and it was fun to stumble across issues featured in my own collection, the same can’t be said for the quality of the components themselves, with the gameboard being the only part that felt solid. The cardboard used for the player markers and comic-type tokens is incredibly thin, and even when I was punching them out of the board, they came on, I was worried I would tear them. The cards don’t feel much better; in my copy, the cards seemed to have an odd lip around them, with paper that's stiffer than I would like. In an ideal world, I would love to have a bit larger and sturdier cardboard tokens or better-feeling cards, but with the game coming in at $25, I can give the lower quality a bit of a pass.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODE6D?object_uuid=7265e117-ee68-4d71-b34a-ef48d7ab8436&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6J24?object_uuid=7265e117-ee68-4d71-b34a-ef48d7ab8436&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Barnes &amp; Noble</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 8, 2024 7:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">With a small box, a low price tag, and a healthy dose of Marvel nostalgia, Comic Hunters is an enticing game. For fans of drafting and set collection board games, Comic Hunters is an easy recommendation. If that mechanic isn’t quite your thing, then this may not be the game for you, even if you are a massive fan of Spider-Man and friends. Comic Hunters has a great idea and theme behind it. The idea of trying to hunt down that one elusive comic to complete your collection could easily be applied to versions that feature sports cards, DC comics, video games, and more.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/what-we-played-slitterhead-metro-awakening-ps5-pro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s always fun getting a big new console launch, and while the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> hasn’t sparked quite as much excitement as the PS4 Pro, thanks in no small part to the price, it’s still an interesting bit of kit. I’ve still only scratched the surface with our review unit so far, but am pulling together the various gameplay comparisons that we need for our review. So I’ve played lots of games in 10 minute sections, then changes some graphics settings and done it again, then switched console and done it again…</p>
<p>It has been…. repetitive, with my only respite coming in the hour-long session I had with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">Project ARC</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s jump on over to the much more interesting gaming that everyone else has been getting up to. <strong>Ade</strong> has played a little bit of Helldivers 2, has been reviewing Redacted, but has mainly spent a very complicated game of real life Tetris as he puts his life in boxes so that he can move house next week – “It’s stressful and confusing and I really can’t recommend. ????”</p>
<p>All the best with the move!</p>


<p>There’s much less moving and shaking for <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s been locked in on Black Ops 6 multiplayer – “My combat report is showing a much improved kill/death ratio now that I’m starting to memorise map layouts and get to grips with the speedier player movement. There are some things about COD that never change, however, with squad mates completely ignoring objectives so they can work on their killstreaks being one of them. Still, I’m having an immense amount of fun and can’t wait for the first big content drop.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been on the Final Fantasy XVI warpath still, grabbing all the DLC and completing Echoes of Fallen already. He’s now moving on to the Rising Tide DLC, and found the new powers to be rather handy. He also dipped a toe back into Hydrophobia: Prophecy for a look back feature, and started replaying the wonderful Tearaway on his Vita.</p>
<p><strong>Nic</strong> loves three kinds of games: monster games, card games and walking around games. So… he’s obviously been playing a lot of Pokémon TCG Pocket this week, while enjoying all the delights of having a 6-month old. “Great little game that’s fun to dip in and out of. I’m considerig writing a review this afternoon (if I can find the time).”</p>

<p>As for our resident horror acolyte, <strong>Steve</strong>? Well, he was naturally on hand for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/slitterhead-review/">Slitterhead</a>, “a game that will definitely find a cult following but had too many issues for me to rate it as highly as I thought I would from the style alone. I think it’ll be one of those (like the recently remastered Shadows of the Damned) that’ll be the spur for lots of retrospectives and YouTube video essays and I’ll almost certainly be doing something with it academically regarding the setting and blood powers.</p>
<p>And then he has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/mario-luigi-brothership-review/">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> arriving today for a total change of pace on some upcoming commutes.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Phasmophobia some more, “which takes ages to get to grips with because there’s too many ghosts, but is still fun in a deeply scary way. Doesn’t help that there’s only two of us playing either.”</p>

<p>And rounding things out for the week, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> had a bloody great time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro Awakening in PSVR 2</a>, which had him so wrapped up in the terror and suspense that his flatmate was shouting at him to stop screaming!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

The update is bringing more loadout options, maps, and teases for mid-season zombies reveals. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,195371" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a lot, especially when all crammed onto a single roadmap. <em>Black Ops 6 </em>Season 01 will go live on Thursday, November 14 at 12:00 p.m. ET across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. In addition to the multiplayer, zombies, and Warzone content and changes coming, the seasonal update also features skins for the operator Sevati “Sev” Dumas, as well as revised battle pass with both free and premium unlocks. It is by far the most complex and overwhelming battle pass I have ever seen. </p><p>Here is a top-line overview of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Control&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything coming to <em>Black Ops 6 </em>in season 1</a></span>:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Maps</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>﻿Hideout<br></li><li>Extraction </li><li>Heirloom</li><li>Racket (in-season)</li><li>Hacienda (in-season)</li><li>Nuketown Holiday (in-season)</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ransack</li><li>Prop Hunt</li><li>Multiplayer Ranked Play</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hand Cannon Scorestreak</li><li>Shadow Perk</li><li>High Roller Wildcard</li></ul><p><strong>Zombies</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Terminus (directed mode)</li><li>Liberty Falls (directed mode)</li><li>3 New Gobblegums</li><li>Citadelle Des Morts map (in-season)</li></ul><p><strong><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Maps: Area 99 (Resurgence), Urzikistan, and Rebirth Island</li><li>Gameplay: Omnimovement, BO6 Weapons, Equipment, and Perks, Prestige System, Body Shield, Dedicated Melee, Emotes &amp; Sprays, Streamlined Inventory, Mastery Camo, Killstreaks, and Wildcards</li></ul><p><strong>Weapons</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Krig C (Battle Pass AR)</li><li>Buffer Weight Stock (Attachment)</li><li>Dragon’s Breath (Attachment)</li><li>AMR Mod 4 (In-Season Event Sniper Rifle)</li><li>Cleaver (In-Season Event Melee)</li><li>Maelstrom (Event Shotgun)</li><li>Power Drill (Event Melee)</li><li>Sirin 9MM (Event Special)</li><li>Saug (Batatle Pass SMG)</li></ul><p><strong>Misc.</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Sevati “Sev” Dumas Tier 100 operator</li><li>Brightmare Bundle</li><li>Tracer Pack: The Replacer</li><li>Golaith with Companion Finishing Move</li></ul></blockquote><p>Like I said, that’s a lot! Directed Mode is a notable addition for Zombies that will take players on a more guided tour through the wave-based mode’s story beats and objectives. Then, throughout the season, Zombies will get additional content, including a new Perk-A-Cola, Field Upgrade, Ammo Mod, and 18 more Augments to research. It sounds like most of that stuff won’t be hitting until mid-December at the earliest. </p><p>In the meantime, the update to<em> Call of Duty: Warzone</em> that integrates it with <em>Black Ops 6</em> will be the biggie. The free-to-play battle royale spin-off will be incorporating the ominimovement gameplay of the latest entry in the series, as well as bringing over all of its weapons, skins, and other knickknacks. The season 1 battle pass is $10 and includes a series of instant reward unlocks, including the pink-haired operator Sev as well as a helpful XP boost. </p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em> is currently part of Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S and PC. It’s a good deal for those who like to dive in for a month or two before moving on, though died-in-the-wool COD lifers are still better off buying the whole package upfront. For those still on the fence, however,  Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has said</a></span> Microsoft’s Netflix-like subscription service has helped get more people playing <em>Black Ops 6</em> than ever before. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sequel hasn’t panned out the way Blizzard promised after it reportedly canceled the story campaign that was the whole point of a sequel. So it’s easy to look at all the changes <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has implemented and wish we could just go back to the original game. Well, it looks like Blizzard might be teasing something that will poke at the yearning veteran fans are feeling, as a rebrand of its socials has fans wondering if something like a “Classic” <em>Overwatch </em>might be in the works.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It all started today, November 8, when the <em>Overwatch </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayOverwatch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social channels</a></span> were updated with images spotlighting poster girl Tracer in her original game design, rather than the updated look she dons in the sequel.

The trailer itself includes the old school Tracer art as the thumbnail, but is otherwise pretty nondescript.</p><p>It’s unclear if this might be a proper <em>Overwatch Classic </em>similar to the <em>World of Warcraft Classic </em>Blizzard released in 2019 that brought the MMORPG back to basics or if this is in reference to the previously announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742">6v6 test</a></span> that will allow players to engage in 12-player matches like they did before <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s release. If it’s the latter, it seems a little soon considering those tests aren’t set to begin until Season 14, which begins in December. But whatever’s going on, this mystery trailer seems to be about something old becoming new again.</p><p>Will reverting back to 6v6 put <em>Overwatch 2</em> in fans’ good graces again? Part of me wonders if the stink has just gotten too potent for some people to ever come back and stay for an extended period of time. But I’ll take anything that makes the game feel fresh again <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081">instead of a giant bummer</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Intel is gearing up to announce and launch its next-generation Battlemage GPU. According to known leaker Golden Pig Upgrade, Intel is aiming to going to launch the Battlemage graphics card in December.</p>



<p>No specifics about the card weren’t part of the claim nor was any information on how many cards will be part of this lineup. However, the leaker was clear enough about the timeline.</p>



<p>“Looking forward to the wonderful performance of Battlemage next month,” the <a href="https://weibo.com/3219724922/5098080466897502">Weibo post</a> reads via on-site translation. </p>



<p>Battlemage is the second-generation discrete GPU from Intel. It’s the follow up to the Intel Arc from 2022. Intel released three versions of the Arc graphics card: Arc 3, Arc 5, and Arc 7. With Battlemage, it’s been rumored that Intel will only be releasing budget-friendly cards that sit on the lower end of the market. A competitor to Nvidia’s or AMD’s top offerings shouldn’t be expected.</p>



<p>Still, even if the low-end rumors are true, more graphics cards can only be viewed as a positive for PC enthusiasts. More and more players are heading to PC gaming, and the more options there are, the better the cost becomes for everyone. </p>



<p>Intel hasn’t responded to Insider Gaming’s request for comment on the rumored pending launch. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. Until then, please take the latest claims on Intel Battlemage with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>In addition to Intel’s pending new launch, both AMD and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-nvidia-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-release-date-rumors-continue-to-circulate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia are expected</a> to announce new graphics cards in early 2025 around CES.</p>

The emergence of a playlist for 10v10 might be what has most frothing at the mouth, though, as it offers bigger lobbies across many of Black Ops 6’s Multiplayer maps. Included in the list of maps is Nuketown, a map that is already notoriously chaotic in 6v6 matches, so expect even more chaos when hopping in for 10v10. While the standard Nuketown 24/7 playlist option will remain, fans can also now enjoy a new Stakeout 24/7 playlist.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/ss-0d3fffebfd9343ff4233a87967a6f63cc81757a5-1920x1080-1730718138609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 patch nerfs Recon and adds 10v10 playlist.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another highlight involves an additional nerf for Recon, which has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>a common complaint from players</u></a> for weeks. The Perk combo bonus gives players a few advantages in combat, including the ability to briefly see enemies through walls after spawning. The effect previously lasted for a whopping two seconds, with many drawing comparisons between it and unofficial cheats like wallhacks. It didn’t take long before Treyarch brought down that timer to only 1.5 seconds, and as promised, that’s now down to only one second with today’s patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer regulars will notice that they are no longer able to exit the map in Lowtown, too, with other more general changes tackling stability and XP earn rates. Zombies received a number of tweaks as well, including fixes for a few glitches and a patch for a Tactical Raft exploit that was being used to make the vehicle airborne on Terminus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Black Ops 6 patch is smaller than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-patch-notes-detail-spawn-logic-fixes-and-assault-rifle-balance-updates"><u>some of the others we’ve seen this past week</u></a>, but that’s only because Treyarch is on the verge of dropping <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-revealed-details-on-maps-weapons-and-more"><u>a gargantuan Season 1 update</u></a> next week. We learned more about the inaugural season of content just yesterday, with the team promising that more Multiplayer maps, Zombies additions, and a revamped Warzone will arrive next week. Even more goodies will come with a mid-season refresh in the future, too, with Ranked Play also set to drop later this month.</p><div id="black-ops-6-tier-list-best-guns-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3><h3>Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 got off to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">a great start</a> when it launched for PC and consoles October 25, and we think its success is deserved.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> developers Digital Extremes have announced a new round of early access for their 2025-bound fantasy action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a>, which I saw a bit of last year and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframes-full-reveal-shows-a-slow-and-pensive-fantasy-rpg-built-on-the-bones-of-warframe">think is pretty promising</a>. They're now adding 2000 players to a Preludes build of the game every week, with each invite email including an additional four invite codes, so you can get your friends involved.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you're new to Soulframe, it's a stately swords-and-sorcery affair with a hazy golden open world and procedural dungeons. It has the same visual opulence as Warframe, with richly woven costumes and an interface of painted scrolls and sigils, and the same appetite for screwy jargon-tastic lore writing. But it plays things quieter. Everything looks old and dusty and the pacing of exploration and encounters seems closer to From Software's work - you'll weigh up every blow. Last year, director Steve Sinclair summarised it as follows: "Where Warframe is fast and frenetic, Soulframe is going to be slow and pensive."</p>
<p>A bit of plot: you're a downfallen amnesiac soldier who must form pacts with the spirits of their ancestors. These pacts are the game's loadouts, encompassing character stats and sets of abilities. You also get access to the Nightfold, an extra-dimensional progression hub akin to Bloodborne's Hunter's Dream. You can expand the Nightfold's crafting and customisation facilities by asking your ancestors to move in.</p>
<p>Soulframe is another free-to-play offering from Digital Extremes, and the big worry as ever is how much the monetisation will sabotage the experience. That aside, I'm looking forward to it. Some smaller flourishes: when you die, you reincarnate as a bird at the last respawn site and have the option of flying back to resurrect your body. When you move between dimensions, your character falls backward through a portal with arms outspread, as though tumbling into bed at the end of a long day.</p><p>You can sign up for Preludes access <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/signup">here</a>. If you don't manage to scrape an invite, Digital Extremes have also lifted restrictions on streams and videos of the Preludes area, so by all means fire up the Youtubes and have a gander. I'm sure somebody's published a 10 hour Let's Play already.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, if you have a really good 4K TV and you care about framerates and ray tracing, then it’s an impressive machine that provides truly fantastic looking upgrades to games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-cloud-cross-save-ps5-pro-mass-effect-1851691865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-cloud-cross-save-ps5-pro-mass-effect-1851691865"><em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span><em>.</em> But unless you look up a list online, its hard to actually find which games in your library or on the store are PS5 Pro enhanced. </p><p>When I booted up the PS5 Pro, the first thing I did was hop into my library to see which of the games that I already owned supported Sony’s new powerful console. This isn’t easy. There is currently no symbol or text on a game’s tile or cover to indicate if its PS5 Pro enhanced. Even when I click on game and it opens up a sub menu, there is still no indication if it’s going to take advantage of the new features.</p><p>Currently, the only way to figure this out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-specs-list-enhanced-upgraded-games-elden-ring-1851688507?_gl=1*18f4ggf*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTA4NjIyNC4yMi4xLjE3MzEwODcwMDYuNDcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-specs-list-enhanced-upgraded-games-elden-ring-1851688507?_gl=1*18f4ggf*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTA4NjIyNC4yMi4xLjE3MzEwODcwMDYuNDcuMC4w">besides checking our list  or Sony’s website</a></span>, is to look at the PSN Store. You can either do this directly in the store or via a “Show Product” option in your game library. There you’ll see a PS5 Pro Enhanced badge, letting you know that yes, this game will look and run better on your new expensive machine.</p><h2 id="h157170"><a id=""></a>Sony, steal this idea from the Xbox Series X</h2><p>At first, when I got the PS5 Pro last week, I assumed that Sony would have a plan to make it easier to find Pro Enhanced games while using the console and its store. So I waited until after the PS5 Pro launched on November 7 and... nothing. I still can’t quickly tell at a glance what is or isn’t enhanced.</p><p>Sony has added a PS5 Pro enhanced section to the store, but as far as I can tell it doesn’t show every game that is actually enhanced. And for a day or so it showed <em>Dead Rising 2</em>, which is a PS4 game that isn’t at all enhanced. (It’s been removed since and replaced with<em> Dead Rising Deluxe Remaste</em>r, which <em>is</em> enhanced.) </p><p>Thankfully, there is now a PS5 Pro enhanced filter you can apply to the store, which is helpful. However, this filter can’t be applied to your own library of games, which seems silly! </p><p>As someone who plays a lot of Xbox Series X, I really appreciate that Microsoft uses icons to quickly indicate what games are native Series X/S titles and which ones aren’t. I hope Sony looks into adding some indicator or icon for games that run better on PS5 Pro, so its easier for folks to actually take advantage of the most powerful PlayStation console ever made. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In a new interview, Nintendo executives stated that they are skeptical of big budgets and want to rely instead on "new ideas." Nintendo itself conducted the interview as part of its earnings briefing for this fiscal year, which ends March 2025 (you can find the full English translation <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>).</p><p>During the interview, various Nintendo executives--including Mario-creator Shigeru Miyamoto--were asked about the company's recent efforts, such as the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">Nintendo Music</a> and the announcement of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/" data-ref-id="1100-6527598">Switch 2's backward compatibility</a>.</p><p>When asked about rising development costs throughout the video game industry, Miyamoto replied that the company wishes to cultivate good ideas and refine games until the developers are confident in what they've made. While this does have costs, not all games need to be expensive. Miyamoto said, "it is possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs."</p><p>Senior executive officer and corporate director Ko Shiota emphasized an efficient development environment. Because developers are already familiar with the Nintendo Switch, the company wishes to "maintain a similar basis for development environments," according to Shiota. In conclusion, Shiota added, "I believe the most important thing for Nintendo is how we create new ideas. Bigger budgets do not necessarily equate to better ideas."</p><p>In the same interview, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-i-am-no-genius/1100-6527661/" data-ref-id="1100-6527661">Miyamoto said that he is not a genius</a>. Nintendo also emphasized that it would generally prefer to "organically expand" rather than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-acquisitions-arent-always-best/1100-6527609/" data-ref-id="1100-6527609">acquire new companies</a>.

                <p>Early Black Friday deals are now live at <a href="https://howl.link/2bh12xay4ou1b?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17310566375492?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>, and a nice list of laptops is included in the event. Products from Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, and Microsoft are part of the event, with models seeing discounts up to $750. Whether you’re shopping for an affordable rig to stream content or a premium gaming laptop, there’s bound to be something that catches your eye.</p><p>One of notable deal is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hp-victus-gaming-laptop-is-only-430-at-best-buy-in-early-black-friday-doorbuster-sale/1100-6527616/" data-ref-id="1100-6527616">15.6-inch HP Victus gaming laptop</a>, which part of Best Buy's first round of limited-time Door Buster deals. The laptop is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5-7535HS processor, AMD Radeon RX 6550M graphics card, 8GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD--which, in plain terms, are modest gaming specs, but considering the laptop is just $430 (down from $800) until November 10, it's a solid deal on an entry-level model.</p><p>The rest of the laptop deals are part of Best Buy's main Black Friday sale, so they're sticking around longer than the Door Buster deal above. One exciting deals is for the <a href="https://howl.link/ufyazqd85t4vq?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17310815472243?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Vivobook Pro 15 OLED Laptop</a>. Equipped with the premium Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB RAM, RTX 3050, and 1TB SSD, it’s capable of handling most tasks with ease. The 15.6-inch OLED display should also look great whether you’re gaming, streaming movies, or knocking out some work. The RTX 3050 is a bit underpowered for heavy gaming, though everything else about the laptop makes it an absolute steal at $800 (was $1,300). </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4397062-mixcollage-08-nov-2024-08-54-am-7617.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4397062" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4397062-mixcollage-08-nov-2024-08-54-am-7617.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4397062"></a><figcaption>Microsoft Surface, Dell Inspiron, and Lenovo Yoga 7i</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4397062-mixcollage-08-nov-2024-08-54-am-7617.jpg"></figure><p>The <a href="https://howl.link/gusx7s7yludsh?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17310815651478?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HP OmniBook X</a> is also down to $800 (was $1,200).
