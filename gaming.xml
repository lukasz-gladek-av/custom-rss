		<p>The use of AI is one of the most contentious points in modern culture, as people lean on it more and more, for everything from research and programming through to fashion tips and companionship. Within gaming and the wider arts, its use to replace voice actors and other professionals has opened up questions about putting hard-working actors out of work, and where these AI models have been trained – almost certainly on copyrighted material that has not approved that use. SAG-AFTRA, the labour union that represents 160,000 actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers, news editors, program hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, voiceover artists, influencers and other entertainment and media professionals, has made a fresh statement on where they stand on the use of AI performers.</p>
<p>The following statement was released following the announcement of “Tilly Norwood,” an A.I.-generated “actor” that is reportedly seeking representation:</p>


<p>“SAG-AFTRA believes creativity is, and should remain, human-centered. The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics.</p>
<p>“To be clear, “Tilly Norwood” is not an actor, it’s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation. It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we’ve seen, audiences aren’t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn’t solve any “problem” — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.</p>
<p>“Additionally, signatory producers should be aware that they may not use synthetic performers without complying with our contractual obligations, which generally require notice and bargaining whenever a synthetic performer is going to be used.”</p>

<p>This conversation isn’t going to go away any time soon. AI should be used to improve and ease humanity’s daily struggles, not replace our artistic and creative ventures.</p>

<figure data-uuid="30c0e42f95afc"><a title="RE Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30c0e42f95afc/re-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was announced for the Switch 2, we must admit to being a little surprised that the game could conceivably run well on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>We weren't the only ones either. According to a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53825">Famitsu</a> (thanks, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/">wccftech</a>), director Koshi Nakanishi said that the development team itself was also surprised at how well Requiem ran on the Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>To begin with, this game is made to be fairly scalable. We've been making it by adjusting various options so that it can be compatible with a wide range of specs, from high to relatively low, so the Switch 2 can be optimized to suit the specs quite smoothly.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>"We haven't tried to force something made for high-end performance to slow down, but have assumed a variety of spec conditions in advance. Even we were surprised when we first saw it, how beautifully it ran. I think it was thanks to the engine team's hard work that it ran so smoothly.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, our recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">hands-on time</a> with Requiem revealed that the game has been remarkably optimised for the Switch 2. Playing at TGS 2025, Lowell Bell said that it "has broken me of that Nintendo stigma that third-party blockbusters can’t run on their hardware".</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is currently scheduled to launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. If that's not enough, native ports of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> will also land on the same day. The series will be celebrating its 30th anniversary next year, so we're expecting to see even more big things from Capcom's survival horror behemoth in the months to come.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-revision-dualsense-v3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-playstation-5-pro-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-with-new-dualsense-v3-controller.1312252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro revision is reportedly launching together with a new version of the DualSense controller, which will sport a highly requested feature, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/384532/nowe-ps5-pro-i-kontrolery-dualsense-z-pozadana-funkcja-zdradzamy-szczegoly.html">Polish publication PPE</a>, the same source that correctly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 would be coming this year on PlayStation 5</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/">game's official announcement</a>, the rumored PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision will be 3% more power efficient than the current model. This information lines up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">what reliable leaker billbil-kun revealed last week</a> regarding the rumored new revision for Sony's current generation console.</p>



<p>According to the report, the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision won't be the only revised product launching before the end of the year. Reportedly, a new DualSense V3 controller will hit shelves this November. Replacing every controller model available to date, this new controller will come with a removable battery, which is a great addition, as this will allow users to replace the battery of the controller if it fails, extending its life considerably over the older models. This controller will also reportedly be bundled with the new PS5 Pro hardware revision.</p>



<p>Although this source has proven to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new details on the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision and DualSense controller with a grain of salt until they are officially revealed, or hit stores like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/">new base PS5 model with a smaller SSD </a>did this month in Europe. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see these new products hit shelves and learn how they improve the current hardware.</p>

                <p>Nearly three years ago, Ken Levine <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-new-game-from-the-creators-of-bioshock-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509890/" data-ref-id="1100-6509890">shared the first look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/" data-ref-id="5000-577619">Judas</a>, his long-awaited follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bioshock-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-82374">BioShock Infinite</a>. Players have noticed some obvious visual similarities between Judas and the BioShock games, but according to Levine, it represents "the biggest radical departure" for him since the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bioshock/" data-ref-id="5000-22526">BioShock</a>.</p><p>"There are parts of Judas that are more similar to BioShock, and there are parts of Judas that are really really radically different," explained Levine during an appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbdgQpA6Uc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MrMattyPlays</a>' YouTube show. "I'm sure people notice there's a gun in one hand [and] powers [in] the other hand. We have an additional hacking thing which we haven't shown off that much. But the way the game works, the way the game is populated, and the way you choose between these relationships is something we've never ever done before. The way the world is decorated, the way encounters come in, the way you choose paths in the game, those are all so radically different. ... This is probably the biggest radical departure we've made since I did BioShock."</p><p>Judas is the name of the game's main character, who finds herself trapped on a generational spaceship called the Mayflower. The Mayflower is carrying the last survivors of humanity, and their fate may be tied to three powerful individuals on the ship and Judas' decisions to befriend or alienate them.</p><p>During the interview, Levine described his new story engine as "narrative Legos," which can place important events at different parts of the story depending on which choices the player makes. Levine also indicated that he is "placing trust in your audience and being okay with them just missing stuff" if they choose one narrative path over the other.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Levine stressed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creator-says-new-game-judas-bucks-all-these-major-gaming-trends/1100-6533130/" data-ref-id="1100-6533130">Judas will avoid live-service elements</a> and other major gaming trends in favor of preserving a single-player experience. Levine also demonstrated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-release-date-isnt-ready-to-be-revealed-yet-but-heres-how-youll-make-frenemies-in-it/1100-6534315/" data-ref-id="1100-6534315">how players will make friends and enemies</a> among the three major characters in the game.</p><p>Judas doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">$55bn private acquisition of EA</a> is expected to run smoothly, the Financial Times has reported, due to the influence of Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia on The White House.</p>
<p>The acquisition announced yesterday will see a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and investment firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, acquiring EA, the publisher known for its sports games, BioWare's RPGs, The Sims, and many more.</p>
<p>Though the acquisition won't be completed until Q1 FY27, a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">report from The FT</a> suggests it won't face much opposition.</p>
<p>That's due to Saudi Arabia being considered a key ally to the US, as well as the involvement of President Trump's son-in-law Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>"Kushner has a personal relationship and he has deep ties in Saudi Arabia. He is very comfortable operating in the Middle East. It created a basis of trust," a person briefed on the talks told the FT.</p>
<p>Another source stated: "We are in a regulatory environment that is welcoming of [Saudi Arabia]. We are not in what was the previous regime."</p>
<p>"What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?" stated another source close to the inner workings of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The involvment of Saudi Arabia's PIF is controversial, due to the country's ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman chairing the fund. He's been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, and has upheld <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">the country's notoriously poor human rights record</a>.</p>
<p>While the last big video game acquisition - Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard - was met with opposition, it seems this latest deal for EA will be less contested.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted the US Federal Trade Commission for comment on EA's private acquisition.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">further report from the FT</a>, it's suggested the deal is a huge bet that AI can significantly cut EA's operating costs.</p>
<p>The $55bn buyout is backed by $36bn in equity and $20bn in JPMorgan debt, which EA will need to cover. AI will therefore be a key factor in cutting costs, according to sources involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">EA CEO Andrew Wilson stated AI is "the very core of our business"</a> at the company's Investor Day 2024. "For years we have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different," he said. "We predict that with generative AI we will truly be able to fulfil this promise for billions of people for billions and billions of hours."</p>
<p>One area of AI innovation for the company is efficiency, which Wilson described as not just about cost saving but "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality".</p>
<p>With the growing reputation of AI tools being used across the games industry, no doubt this presentation proved influential in the eventual acquisition by private investors.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ceo-of-ea-says-values-remain-unchanged-following-sale-saudi-investment-firms">statement to employees yesterday</a>, Wilson stated EA's "values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged". However, the deal has sparked fear among fans for the future of EA's most queer-friendly franchises, including The Sims, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, due to the involvement of Saudi Arabia.</p>

			<p>Styling itself as a spiritual successor to the popular Silent Hunter series, UBOAT is a World War II submarine sim that places you in command of your own crew, patrolling the North Sea. Developed by Deep Water Studio, it offers a rich, detailed simulation that, like most games in the genre, comes with a steep learning curve with many plates to spin. Console players will also have to contend with inherently awkward controls, sifting through menus and action screens that were clearly designed for keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p><iframe title="UBOAT - Full Release Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pu93U02aUjo?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can jump into one of several campaigns, each taking place during different flashpoints as the war rages across Europe. This timeline will determine several factors, such as the occupation of various ports and territories, as well as the availability of more advanced torpedoes. Whatever campaign you choose, and whichever submarine you start with, there’s no option to change your faction. As the name implies, UBOAT is focused on the Kriegsmarine, which naturally means playing from the perspective of Nazi Germany.</p>


<p>UBOAT wants you to develop an intimate knowledge of the vessel under your command. Actions that sound relatively simple, such as mapping a course, scanning for enemies, or firing a torpedo, each require several steps to complete, with various factors and resource checks determining their success. For example, attempting to track down another vessel in the North Sea will require assigning a crewmate to listen for contacts, using the hydrophone to triangulate a location. You’ll need to then assign another crew member to man the periscope and manually identify any vessels that come into sight, all while trying to keep a low profile. This is all done while keeping an eye on not just your fuel, but electric power, morale, and air quality too.</p>


<p>Even on its most casual difficulty setting, UBOAT throws players in at the deep end. It’s just that kind of game. Fans of hardcore simulations will revel in the game’s immersive web of overlays, dials, gauges, and menus, while newcomers may want to pare back many of these features, offloading and automating tasks such as setting daily schedules for each crew member. If you’re a total maniac (or just so happen to be a submarine boffin) you can go the opposite way, micromanaging to your heart’s content and engaging in the most authentic, most rewarding UBOAT experience.</p>
<p>The tutorials do a decent job of explaining core concepts, though it will take a long time before you feel adept at handling engagements with other ships. Launching torpedoes is where the real action is at, though these set pieces take a lot of preparation to pull off, calculating the size, range, speed, and bearing of a target before lining up a missile perfectly. Again, for those playing on harder difficulties, this process is a lot more involved, as you use rulers and protractors to work out your calculations, even whipping out a stopwatch to monitor how fast an enemy ship is moving while monitoring them via the periscope.</p>
<p>Those moments of practiced ingenuity, narrow escapes, and unexpected scenarios will form an emergent narrative as you progress through the campaign. Not only will your knowledge of the game’s systems grow over time, your crew will also advance and learn new skills as you unlock various submarine upgrades, allowing you to tackle tougher assignments.</p>

<p>Bringing such a dense simulation game to consoles wasn’t going to be the smoothest of transitions. While it’s perfectly playable using a gamepad, there is a constant sense of unwieldiness as you cycle between the various icons and menus, using a combination of button shortcuts and the on-screen mouse. This is very much a PC-first game, and although UBOAT only hit version 1.0 a year ago, the game spent half a decade in early access being tweaked and refined for players who favour keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>The visuals aren’t exactly pushing console hardware to the max, either, though it’s hard to poke too many holes in UBOAT’s presentation. The menus and UI manage to streamline a wealth of information in a way that’s easy to process, even under pressure. There’s nothing uncanny in the way crewmates look or move around the submarine, though you’ll usually be seeing them from a distance, focusing more on the carefully recreated vessels themselves.</p>

            <p>Dark Ties, the Like A Dragon spin-off game that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-drops-in-early-2026-as-rgg-pair-remake-with-a-new-spin-off-starring-baddie-mine">set to arrive alongside Yakuza Kiwami 3 next year</a>, was originally just going to be a video. That was, obviously, until devs RGG studio opted to let folks wander around in the shoes of Yakuza 3 antagonist Yoshitaka Mine, whose karaoke singing to a picture of a follically-challenged gangster they've now also explained.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These bits of info come from an interview Kiwami 3 director Ryosuke Horii and Yakuza series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto gave to Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53863">Famitsu</a>, which has been partly translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-dark-ties-was-originally-supposed-to-be-just-a-viewable-movie-but-rgg-studio-couldnt-miss-out-on-its-last-opportunity-to-make-mine-playable/">Automaton</a>.</p>
<p>According to Horii, the original plan was for Dark Ties to ship with the remake, but be “something that could be viewed like a video”. However, the devs decided to make Mine playable as a tip of the hat to players who've rendered him one of the most popular Yakuza characters, despite only appearing in Yakuza 3 - unless you count the character's likeness being used in series spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin.</p>
<p>Horii also acknowledged that the team were aware they likely wouldn't get another chance to let folks step into Mine's shoes, given his lack of appearances.</p>
<p>Naturally, because Yakuza, one of the results of that call to make calculating businessguy Mine playable is that players can do the series' usual array of wacky side activities as him, including belting out Baka Mitai at a karaoke booth. We've already gotten a taste of just that via videos of Kiwami 3 coming out of the Tokyo Game Show (head to the ten minute mark below). While flexing his pipes to deliver the sad ballad  made famous by Kazuma Kiryu, Mine stares at a photo of himself and bellicose underworld sidekick Tsuyoshi Kanda.</p>

<p>Dark Ties delves into the relationship between Mine and the bald Yakuza brawler, so it's not a huge surprise, but it did catch some long-time fans a bit off guard given that the former's presented as arguably having an even closer relationship with Tojo Clan chairman Daigo Dojima in Yakuza 3.</p><p>Famitsu asked Horii and Sakamoto why they opted to go with a snap of Kanda over Daigo. As a warning, I have relied on machine translation for the following answer from Horii, but it's too important a remark not to convey: "Well, that's where the punchline really hits home, isn't it? (laughs) If it were too ordinary, it would actually be rather disappointing."</p>
<p>Well, from now on that's how I'll be summing up the Yakuza series whenever anyone asks me if the games about duffing up tatted goons before getting up to zany hijinks are worth a go.</p>

<p>
RICHAAAARRRRD. RICHAARD WAAAAALKER. RICHARD WALKER, DEPUTY EDITOR OF XBOX ACHIEVEMENTS. RETURN IT TO ME, RICHARD. RETURN WHAT IS OWED. YOU KNOW OF WHAT I SPEAK. J'ACCUSE, RICHARD. J'ACCUSE YOU OF DÉROBING MA JEUX PORE LE ORDINATEUR. VOULEZ VOUS COUCHER AVEC MON TACTICS RPG, RICHARD?? LE VAUTOUR ENCERCLE LA CARCASSE, LE BOL EST SUR LA TABLE - COMMENT PUIS-JE ME RENDER CHEZ LE BOULANGER????
</p>
<p>
The year was 2010 when you took it from me, Richard - the mother of all grid-based battlers, one of the greatest digital fables of all time, a thrilling study in dynastic intrigue and medieval warfare. I had yet to even finish the game myself, having long coveted it as a youth consigned to PS1 PAL purgatory. But I could not resist your overtures, Richard! I assumed that you would return it to me in a month, perhaps two. Little did I know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>' acclaimed branching Job system would school you in the dark arts of back-stabbing and betrayal, that it would poison your dove-white temperament and set you upon the road to villainy.
</p>
<p>
I thought we were bros, Richard! Kindred spirits forged in the flame of mutual incompetence! We came up in this business together! Remember when I held your dictaphone for you while you interviewed BioWare's Ray Muzyka, Richard? I was terrified it wouldn't pick up his audio, so resorted to kneeling between you like a penitent sinner, waggling the mic back and forth! We looked like idiots, but it's fine! It's fine! We got over it! I barely ever think of the scalding embarrassment and humiliation!! Muzyka is some kind of magic medicine brewer now, anyway - who gives a fuck what he thinks? The key thing is that it was a bonding experience, a foundation for everlasting trust! What did I ever do to you, Richard!? What crime have I committed for you to treat me this way?!?!
</p><p>
I name you, Richard, I name you in the public forum, in the court of our peers. With bleeding hands I carve these words in ten-feet high letters upon the mausoleum of posterity: "Here stands indicted Richard Walker, bastard. Faithless one! Breaker of oaths! Smudger of covenants! Pact-shirker! Dog-leech! Cut-purse! Larkspell! Trencher-mouth! Let none welcome him. Let all faces turn from him. Let all doors be closed to him! Let his food taste like ashes and his favourite videogames play like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a>!"
</p>
<p>
You thought I had forgotten, Richard. And to be honest, I did forget, because <em>it has been such a very long time, Richard</em>, but Square Enix did not forget - today, they release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1004640/FINAL_FANTASY_TACTICS__The_Ivalice_Chronicles/">a new version of the game on Steam</a> with enhanced visuals, and lo do I rouse in horrified recognition from my dreamless sleep in the murmuring silt of the abysmal sea, lo do I rise in the coruscating incandescence of my absolute fury and indignation to burst upon the surface world and accost the traitor! 
</p>
<p>
RICHAAAARD. RICHAAAARD WAAAALKER. My PSP's battery may have swollen up like a diseased appendix, but I still have my 32MB Memory Stick Duo with a campaign save. It cries out to me for vengeance! Vengeance upon that great unclean soul and fugitive from justice, Richard Walker, Deputy Editor of Xbox Achievements!

<p>The buyers are committing $36 billion of their own equity (briefly and inexpertly, "equity" is the value of your assets after you deduct anything you owe), including the value of the PIF's existing investments in EA. They're making up the rest of the total thanks to a $20 billion loan from JPMorgan Chase Bank. How will they manage that massive debt? According to the Financial Times, who cite unnamed insiders, they're gambling on the deployment of generative AI tools as a gigantic cost-saving measure.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"The investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA's profits in the coming years, people involved in the transaction told the Financial Times," the paper <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">wrote</a> (paywall) in their own coverage of the story. The FT elsewhere commented that the acquisition "is a huge bet that artificial intelligence can significantly cut EA's operating costs, allowing the equity consortium to manage a large debt load on a company that historically carried limited net debt."
</p>
<p>It isn't hugely surprising to hear that generative AI is part of the vision for EA's second coming as a private company, though the multiple billion dollar loan situation certainly raises the stakes. Like Microsoft and Ubisoft, EA have already poured a lot of resources into generative AI tools, via such initiatives as the Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division - not a reference to the mercs in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, apparently - whose efforts include <a href="https://www.ea.com/seed/news/siggraphasia2024-skull-carving">this intriguingly nightmarish blog about "skull carving"</a>. 
</p>
<p>They have also <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-desperately-wants-investors-to-know-it-s-on-the-generative-ai-bandwagon">touted the tech at length to investors</a>, in language that ranges from daydreams about "deeper", "richer" experiences to the quieter prospect of "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality."  
</p>
<p>Back in May 2024, CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/ea-boss-doubles-down-on-commitment-to-ai-believes-more-than-50-of-our-development-process-will-be-impacted/">assured moguls</a> that generative AI would make EA's game development processes "more efficient", commenting of the publisher's licensed football sims that "we've moved from being able to create stadiums in six months to six weeks", and that the technology would in general allow devs "to get to the fun more quickly."</p><p>Efficiency doesn't automatically mean "cutting staff", of course, but as Microsoft have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">amply demonstrated</a>, workforce reduction is a conspicuous element of the great generative AI tomorrow. Wilson's gushing about stadiums came a few months after EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">laid off 5% of their workforce</a> - around 670 people - and around a year before EA laid off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">a further 300 people</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-shut-down-studio-they-opened-less-than-two-years-ago-cancel-black-panther-game">closed one of their headline new studios</a>. I'm not sure these are the Extraordinary Experiences the people are searching for, Andrew.
</p>
<p>Best of luck to EA game developers navigating all this. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2027, pending approval from regulators, which could be a whole saga in itself - Microsoft spent years fighting the US Federal Trade Commission in courts after announcing that they would purchase Activision Blizzard. For a lot of EA teams, I suspect the greatest worry may be how being co-owned by the investment wing of a notoriously repressive country will affect their livelihoods and work. If you're an EA staffer and you'd like to chat about it all in anonymity, my email is in my bio.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a> beefy update 1.2.5 arrives today, September 30th. Developers Firaxis have laid out its major tweaks and additions, which include new map types and city states, plus a revamp of the construction interface and a hefty helping of balancing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">polarising</a> 4X strategy nation-builder has gotten the likes of auto-explore and world wonder reworks in its last couple of monthly updates, with Firaxis having settled in for the long haul after an initial flurry of post-release tweaking. 1.2.5 is the first update the game's gotten since an undisclosed number of workers - "dozens of people", according to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis">Game Developer</a> sources - were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">laid off at Firaxis earlier this month,</a> in what publishers 2K told RPS was a "staff reduction" as the studio "restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity".</p>

<p>As outlined in the developer update video above, which is set to be followed by the full notes when the update goes live later today, the headline changes of 1.2.5 include the introduction of two new map types. These are dubbed Continents and Islands and Pangea and Islands, with both making use of improved map generation techniques in the form of Voronoi diagrams to grow their landmasses. For more on that, check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-dev-explains-how-the-revamped-4x-map-generator-bolts-together-continents-from-voronoi-diagrams">Edwin's piece on Firaxis senior graphics engineer Ken Pruiksma's recent deep-dive</a> into coloured geographical blobs.</p><p>Also new are two types of city state, which can crop up in any era. Expansionist states, as their name suggests, are most focused on population growth via acquiring land and food, while diplomatic ones are focused more on keeping their citizens happy and doing, well, diplomacy. Both come with different bonuses if you become suzerain of them, with existing city state bonuses also having been revamped.</p>
<p>That balancing has also been applied to various other aspects of Civ 7's economy, such as the maintenance costs of larger armies being uppe, so you've got to think a bit more about whether you need fifty different mobile cannons. That and other things you might spend gold on in later ages have been rendered a bit more expensive, in an effort to ensure the precious metal isn't too valuable as you get into modern times. It'll be interesting to see if those tweaks have nailed the right balance and don't potentially end up frustrating folks who prefer to spend a bit more freely.</p>
<p>In terms of Leaders, Napoleon's Emperor and Revolutionary forms have been buffed, with the former getting greater rewards from the use of sanctions, while the latter earns more culture from battles. Finally, as part of continued efforts to revamp Civ 7's initialy panned interface, building menus have been retooled to offer more info in terms of the numerical effects changes to tiles will have before you make them. "We won't tell you the best tile to pick, that's still up to you," Firaxis senior game designer Taymoor Rehman said of these tweaks in that dev video. "But the UI should take a lot of the guesswork out." The studio have also put out a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/from-the-devs/developing-settlements/">larger blog</a> diving into the fine details of these number-heavy interface revampings.</p>
<p>That's it in terms of big changes in this update, but Rehman did indicate that the balancing bits of it are "only step one of a larger balance pass", so there's more number tweakage to come down the line as Firaxis keep cranking away at cash and goods-related knobs and levers.</p>

		<p>FBC Firebreak, the 3v3 co-op shooter set in the Control universe, blasted onto the scene a few short months ago, and while it was relatively well-received, the team at Remedy have set out to make sure it reaches its full potential with the game’s first major new update, coming under the title Breakpoint. This massive update includes various new improvements, including new missions, additional gun mods and a host of new enemies to blast to smithereens.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak – Breakpoint Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFx8yMOC67w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Based on the update trailer, Breakpoint really does look like it takes the game up a notch, and the idiosyncratic action of Firebreak looks better than ever before. The key changes and additions that the team have made are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Playable Crisis</b>&nbsp;– Outbreak: A mission set in the Research Sector where Firebreakers face a dangerous Mold infestation, new enemies, and unique challenges.</li>
<li><b>Crisis Board</b>&nbsp;– A redesigned structure that replaces the Job Board, delivering curated missions with more dynamic and unpredictable play.</li>
<li><b>Gun Mods</b> – 27 weapon modifiers that add customisation, power, and flexibility to every loadout.</li>
<li><b>Expanded Arsenal</b>&nbsp;– Three new heavy weapons and three new grenades for added firepower and tactical depth.</li>
<li><b>New Threats –</b>&nbsp;Five additional enemies, including Mold-specific foes and new Hiss enemies with variants.</li>
<li><b>Economy &amp; Progression Overhaul</b>&nbsp;– Gear is now fully powered upon unlocking, and currencies have been streamlined for a clearer, more rewarding experience.</li>
<li><b>Improved Onboarding</b>&nbsp;– A new tutorial, orientation videos, and redesigned early-game flow make it easier for new players to join the fight.</li>
<li><b>Gameplay Improvements</b>&nbsp;– More impactful augments and devices, improved harmful condition visuals, better survivability options, and full Crisis Kit access from level one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remedy have said that they’re going to continue to expand <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> with further, completely free updates. The next major Update, codenamed “Rogue Protocol”, will arrive in late November 2025, introducing a brand-new game mode and much-requested cross-platform voice chat to strengthen teamwork. A balance and tuning update will then follow in December, before another Major Update is currently planned for March 2026, which will add new content to the game, including a new Crisis Kit.</p>
<p>Tef <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">quite liked Firebreak FBC at launch</a>, but he felt it still had a ways to go, saying, “I quite like FBC: Firebreak, but I wish I could like it more. There’s the amusing ideas of plaguing players with haunted sticky notes and rubber ducks, there’s discovering unique level quirks for how to deal with picking up radioactive orbs safely, and the inherent joy of getting through tense backs-to-the-wall moments with allies by your side, but those moments of delight dissipate through a clunky user interface, abbreviated mission structure and too few levels to take on. This can still grow into something special, but Remedy might have to explore new directions to manage that.”</p>

<p>With Breakpoint, it really feels like Remedy are addressing some of those issues, and here’s hoping that it’ll bring even more people into the Firebreak fold. As part of that, the game is 40% off on Steam from today, so if you’ve been on the fence about jumping in, now is the perfect time to.</p>

<p>"I find myself torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="14da3b0318c97"><a title="FF7 Remake - Cloud" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14da3b0318c97/ff7-remake-cloud.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> will finally make its way onto the Switch 2 early next year on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>For many, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">1997 original</a> stands as one of the most iconic games of all time, and it's certainly up there as one of the best entries in the long-running series. For Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of the Remake Trilogy (of which the latter two entries have also been confirmed for Switch 2), tackling such a monumental project comes with its own sense of pressure.</p>
<p>Speaking via an <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-interview">internal interview at Square Enix</a>, Hamaguchi-san says that he finds himself "torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis", but nevertheless finds the whole thing a "worthwhile challenge" to undertake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Final Fantasy VII has always been a special game for me. When it was originally released, I was simply another player immersed in it and I was strongly drawn to the story of Cloud and Sephiroth. The game opened my eyes to the power of storytelling, something that’s stayed with me ever since. I feel it’s still at the core of what I do as a creator.</p>
<p>"I am now in the position of where I interact with Final Fantasy VII on the creative side and am working hard to bring Remake Intergrade to multiple new platforms and deliver the FFVII experience to even more people. I’m also right in the middle of developing the third and final part of the trilogy, the final phase where we bring the series to an epic conclusion - and a fitting culmination of everything in Final Fantasy VII.</p>
<p>"Because Final Fantasy VII is a game that fans have such a strong attachment to, I find myself torn about how best to adapt it on a daily basis. I feel a great responsibility to get it right. However, I believe this also makes it a worthwhile challenge to take on.</p>
<p>"Personally, I feel that the essence of Final Fantasy VII is the freedom to mix together many different elements and not get caught up in the restrictions of a single genre. How to bring that to the current generation is the challenge I’ve set myself at the moment."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from the reception so far, we reckon Hamaguchi-san and his team have been doing a pretty good job on the trilogy. If you've not played Remake yet, you're in for a treat when it lands early next year. It seems that it'll run remarkably well on Nintendo's new console too, with Digital Foundry's John Linneman recently stating that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">"the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2"</a>.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and the untitled third entry, there's no indication as to when they'll release on the Switch 2, but you can bet we'll be keeping a close eye on any potential developments in the coming months.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-between-ai-pivot-and-20-billion-of-debt.1312189/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just a few days <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the original rumor</a>, Electronic Arts (EA) confirmed yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it is indeed getting a $55 billion buyout</a> from a Consortium of investors that includes PIF, Saudi Arabia's sovereign investment fund, Silver Lake (an American global private equity firm), and Affinity Partners, an American investment firm founded in 2021 by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of current United States president Donald Trump.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has started to settle, though, the first reports from reputable sources suggest that there might be massive layoffs on the way at EA, and it's not just history suggesting that after what happened with Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. According to a paywalled report <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by the Financial Times</a>, the investors from the aforementioned Consortium are planning to use the latest AI advancements to cut EA's operating costs and manage its substantial debt, suggesting a potential shift towards incorporating AI in games and therefore reducing manpower, both when it comes to development teams and acting talent.</p>



<p>Speaking about that debt, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/ea-agrees-to-sale-in-largest-leveraged-buyout-on-record?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg's report</a> reveals that this deal is partly funded by $20 billion in debt sourced by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. This is the most significant debt commitment ever registered for a buyout. Moreover, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonschreier_ea-agrees-to-55-billion-sale-in-largest-activity-7378438808637243392-QqT5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a LinkedIn post from Bloomberg's Schreier</a>, they will be put on the books of EA:</p>



<p><em>That will mean a significant amount of cost-cutting. I would expect mass layoffs, more aggressive monetization, and many other measures. The interest alone could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars per year. For context: this is nearly four times as much debt as the Toys R Us LBO, and I think everyone knows how that went.</em></p>



<p>This is very worrying, especially for EA employees. One studio that might be targeted in case of mandated cost-cutting measures is BioWare, which did not deliver a financially successful game with Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Canadian developer already suffered some layoffs and, last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had fewer than a hundred employees left</a>. Hopefully, they will get one last chance with the next Mass Effect game.</p>



<p>Former CEO and co-founder of analyst firm SuperData, Joost van Dreunen, also chimed in on the massive $55 billion deal, the second biggest in gaming history (after Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard) and the biggest buyout of all time, topping the $48.4 billion buyout of TXU Energy in 2007. <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/electronic-arts-55b-buyout-doesnt?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In his SuperJoost Playlist Substack newsletter</a>, the games analyst focused specifically on PIF. The Saudi Arabian private investment fund already owned roughly 10% of EA's shares, which made their part of the transaction less onerous. Even so, the analyst says their strategy is to 'throw staggering amounts of money at establishing market dominance', and given that they have nearly infinite investment resources, it may well succeed. </p>



<p>Van Dreunen also posits that private companies are generally better insulated than public companies when it comes to market pressure, so the new owners of Electronic Arts could technically forego short-term profits in favor of the long-term view. However, PIF is not the only one in the Consortium - Silver Lake and Affinity Partners may hold a different mindset.</p>

            <p>Riot Games has released a gameplay trailer for Teemo, the 10th character coming to 2XKO. This trailer, which introduces the infamous Yordle Scout to the fighting game genre, presents him with a cute and jubilant aesthetic as well as an absolutely rancid moveset.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Teemo is a beloved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> champion that was part of that game's base roster all the way back in 2009. Known for his blow pipe and frustrating shenanigans, he's been recreated in 2XKO with a lot of his trademark moves and more.</p>
<p>As you can see below, Teemo is coming with a new stage alongside the game's Early Access launch on the 7th October. This stage in the release schedule for 2XKO will also mark the introduction of the game's first season as well as the final content reset for the game, meaning anything earned is yours forever.</p>

<p>This trailer shows a fighting game character designed by maniacs. Teemo has various projectiles, a brush you can teleport to, poison and flame effects, mushrooms he can throw out that stick on the screen and provide him ample cover. He can also delay his fall speed to bait out anti-air attacks from his opponent.</p><p>One of Teemo's supers brings out a giant mushroom that bounces whimsily towards his opponent and while being projectile invulnerable, which is nasty work. Oh and he can turn himself invisible too for a short period of time, which is really just the cherry on top of a nightmarish monster of a character.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds negative you're forgiven for thinking so, but the truth is that this is exactly what Teemo should be like when brought over to a fighting game. To live up to his character in League of Legends where he was first let loose on the world, he needs to strike that balance between cute and utterly infuriating. Anyways, it probably won't be that hard to play against… Just block, bud.</p>

            <p>Sony has released a revised digital PS5 model in Europe, with less storage and a new matte finish - but the price hasn't been reduced.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, reliable insider <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">Billbil-Kun</a> reported the digital-only model of the PS5 would receive a downgrade from 1TB of storage to 825GB. This model went on sale in Europe this month - and crucially costs the same (€499) despite less storage.</p>
<p>Now, a new unboxing video on YouTube from Austin Evans confirms the storage downgrade, as well as the use of cheaper parts, based on a new console purchased from Germany.</p>

<p>Both the black central casing of the console and the white outer sleeves now come in a matte finish rather than a glossy finish - no more fingerprints!</p>
<p>The newer console is also 100g lighter than the previous slim version - and 1.3kg lighter than the launch model.</p>
<p>As for the SSD, the actual amount of usable storage on the newer model is 667.2GB (compared with 848.0GB of usable space on the previous model). That's a 27 percent reduction and not a huge amount of space, especially considering this is a digital-only model</p>
<p>Inside, the fan is lighter, plus the motherboard design has been refined and is thinner.</p>
<p>While Evans notes the internal engineering is excellent in maintaining the same power and performance, ultimately the reduced SSD makes this iteration of the console considerably worse.</p>
<p>For Sony, it's presumably cheaper to make. But that saving has not been passed on to the consumer, considering all PS5 consoles cost more now than ever.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony raised the price of the digital edition in the UK and mainland Europe</a> from £390/€450 to £430/€500. And this was the second price increase, as it originally cost £359.99/€399.99 at launch, meaning the digital edition is €100 more than five years ago.</p><p>More recently, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-price-of-ps5-ps5-digital-and-ps5-pro-in-the-us">price of all versions of the console went up in the US</a> as the company continues to "navigate a challenging economic environment". It's unclear yet if the revised version of the console with storage reduction will be available in the US as in Europe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ah, Advance Wars. Now <em>there</em> was a perfect strategy game. While we have had an Advance Wars game in recent memory, it wasn’t really a new one, not least because developer Intelligent Systems seem far too busy Fire Embleming to fit one in. So, it falls to other teams to advance the armed forces side of the tactical strategy genre. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/03/tiny-metal-review/">Tiny Metal</a> was certainly a decent first attempt, but with its full sequel, the team at Area 35, Inc. are looking to bring the genre hurtling like a cannon shell into the modern day.</p>
<p><iframe title="TINY METAL 2 Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y7bFiHvjcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That fundamentally means a complete reworking of the visuals. This is what an Advance Wars game should look like in 2025, and the stylised anime-style visuals retain a hand-drawn roughness that makes it feel more like it’s a manga come to life. Tiny Metal 2 switches up the viewpoints when your units engage in combat too, and this simple dose of variety makes them all the more alluring. We’ll all still eventually skip through them on our way to global domination, but they look great.</p>


<p>Our hands-on demo at TGS framed its combat around the Tokyo Game Show itself, tasking the player with protecting it from the incoming threat posed by the evil enemy general Tsukomo. In reality, I’m not sure how accurate the battle map was to downtown Chiba, but it was still a nice touch.</p>


<p>As with the original game, you’re invited to choose your general to take their army into battle, or should that be generals? In a new wrinkle, you pick a second leader to back you up as an ally and add their units as support to your own, but this also opens the door to playing Tiny Metal 2 in two-player co-op, handing this second commander over to another player. This will give players even more tactical options, looking to combine two generals that have synergetic skills and abilities, and bringing friends together as they forge their way across the battlefield. I wonder whether that extends to local head-to-head play too, but there’s certainly support for massive 8-player online skirmishes.</p>
<p>Our playthrough showcased two of the returning allied generals, with Nathan your standard, balanced everyman option, while his ally, Wolfram, turns things up a notch with her versatile infantry.</p>

<p>It’s hard to get a full grasp of the nuances of tactical warfare in the midst of the cacophony of the Tokyo Game Show floor, but Tiny Metal 2 really does go for an ‘if it ain’t broke’ outlook, delivering grid-based strategy that will be instantly recognisable to fans of Advance Wars and the first Tiny Metal game. This sequel’s major new contribution to the tight tactical action is the addition of sea-based combat to the mix. The ocean-based craft we see here – a cruiser, a lander, and a submarine – are all directly related to their inspiration’s own units, and Tiny Metal 2 isn’t exactly shy about it.</p>
<p>When Intelligent Systems doesn’t seem to be about to bring us a Fire Emblem-esque reimagining of its more down-to-earth army franchise, though, it’s hard to knock Tiny Metal 2 for taking the genre forward.</p>

<p>The turn-based action does exactly what it needs to, giving you the clear visual markers to help you develop your strategy, showing you how far each unit will go, and how far it can fire. There’s also a clear indicator for each unit about its strengths and weaknesses, which should help players get up to speed quicker than ever before; particularly useful for multiplayer, where you might end up playing with people who haven’t played an Advance Wars title or something similar before.</p>
<p>While the visuals and the art design have taken a huge leap forward, one of the key things that felt like it needed tweaking was the strength of the audio. Weak gunshots alongside huge explosions create an audio disparity that I found really distracting, and I hope they can tweak the sound levels just a little before launch.</p>
<p>Tiny Metal 2 takes a bold step across the grid-based genre with reinvigorated visuals nestling up to instantly recognisable tactical combat. I’m really interested to see how much importance is placed on the game’s narrative – particularly with the game engine and visuals adding a heap of character – and, for me, it’s immediately jumped into my list of 2026’s must plays.</p>

			<p>When CAPCOM announced that Resident Evil Requiem would also be released on the Nintendo Switch 2, several fans expressed doubts about how the game would run on the console, which is notoriously less powerful than all its current generation counterparts. However, some off-screen footage from last week's Tokyo Game Show 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed the game running quite smoothly</a> on Nintendo's latest gaming platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Japanese website Famitsu</a> during the Japanese gaming convention, CAPCOM's Game Director Koshi Nakanishi admitted that even the developers were surprised at first to see Resident Evil Requiem running that well on Nintendo Switch 2. Nakanishi credited much of the result to the RE Engine.</p>



<p><em>To begin with, this game is made to be fairly scalable. We've been making it by adjusting various options so that it can be compatible with a wide range of specs, from high to relatively low, so the Switch 2 can be optimized to suit the specs quite smoothly. We haven't tried to force something made for high-end performance to slow down, but have assumed a variety of spec conditions in advance. Even we were surprised when we first saw it, how beautifully it ran. I think it was thanks to the engine team's hard work that it ran so smoothly.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, elsewhere in the Famitsu interview, Game Producer Masato Kumazawa said that the TGS 2025 demo stations offered Nintendo Switch 2 and laptop PCs as options. Indeed, if Resident Evil Requiem runs smoothly on the Nintendo Switch 2, we expect it to do the same on a wide range of computers, though CAPCOM hasn't shared the official PC system requirements yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We do know that the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and path tracing on PC</a>. Presumably, other upscalers will be supported as well, like AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution and Intel XeSS, but they haven't been officially confirmed yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Party Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-party-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-party-review.1312171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that the LEGO brand has been slapped onto almost every kind of family-friendly multiplayer game you can think of at this point, from kart racers to Super Smash Bros clones and even a Rock Band spin-off, it’s surprising that it’s taken this long for the world’s biggest brick maker to construct its own monument to Mario Party. LEGO Party is something more than a block-based knockoff of Nintendo’s long-running virtual boardgame series, though. Sure, it might use Mario Party’s fundamentals as a baseplate to build upon, with a host of wacky minifigs in place of the Mushroom Kingdom’s finest, but every last piece here is absolutely pulsating with personality and there isn’t a single stud-based dud in the 60 minigames on offer. If lots of laughter is what you’re after, LEGO Party has all the right parts for assembling a fun night in with friends and family. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever played one of Nintendo’s party-starters before then the basics of LEGO Party will be as easy to grasp as a tiny coffee mug in a minifig’s fist. In this instance, the goal is to collect gold bricks and studs instead of stars and coins, as you and three other players move around four uniquely themed game boards littered with various stud-sapping hazards and potentially lucrative event spaces to land on. Depending on the board you choose, each session can be as short as six rounds or roughly 45 minutes but can be extended all the way up to three-hour-long, 24-round epics, and each round pits all four players against each other in a minigame designed to be easy to pick up for LEGO Juniors and old-timer Technic fans alike, but tricky to master.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Party Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Everybody can carry up to three power-ups that can be bought with studs at the shop or collected from Wheel of Fortune-style spins, and these can have dramatic leaderboard-levelling impacts, like teleporting your minifig directly to a gold brick space, or slowing your roll so you can increase your chances of moving the exact number of spaces you need. Many of these basics have been established in the Mario Party blueprint several times over, and Lego Party takes an ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fish the dog-eared instruction booklet out of the toy chest and rebuild it’ approach to keeping many of these proven core concepts intact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there are some key elements to be found in LEGO Party’s Pirate, Ninjago, Space, and Theme Park boards that set them apart. For starters, each minigame is chosen democratically by moving your minifig in front of one of three options presented at the beginning of each round, and I liked that it meant my party was given a bit more control over which events we were able to enjoy in each evening’s session. (Of course, if you prefer a more randomised minigame experience like Mario Party, you can opt for that too.) I also prefer LEGO Party’s system of letting the results of each minigame determine the order of turns in each subsequent round, as opposed to Mario Party’s more rigid setup of dictating the order via a dice roll at the start and sticking with that all the way to the end. I find that LEGO Party’s results-driven method increases the ebb and flow of each board and brings extra incentive to do well in each minigame.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each of LEGO Party’s wonderfully candy-coloured and brilliantly detailed boards has a number of special construction zones to land on.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More notably, each of LEGO Party’s wonderfully candy-coloured and brilliantly detailed boards has a number of special construction zones to land on, giving you the choice of two structures to build on that space that can dramatically alter the map and introduce a variety of game-changing additions. For example, in the Theme Park board you might opt to build the Extreme Zone, which introduces a gauntlet run of twitchy stunt challenges to successfully pull off in order to earn a gold brick. Alternatively you could go for the Royal Ramparts, which brings with it a ballista-based minigame for quickly snaring studs, and a catapult for lobbing you at another random player and stealing one of their gold bricks. Mixed in with the various other board-specific features, like when the Space map briefly transforms into a turn-based battle against a giant green alien, and each go-around of these game boards has felt fresh and fun over the dozen or so hours of playtime my family and I have put in together so far.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Everything is Awesome</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also been consistently funny, and that’s largely due to the inclusion of Ted Talker and Paige Turner, LEGO Party’s own quip-cracking commentary team. Seemingly inspired by gag-making game show playcallers like those of Wipeout or Holey Moley, Ted and Paige provide colourful context to each turn taken, as well as responding in real time to each player’s performance in a minigame – either bigging them up when they’re on top, or hilariously dragging them when they’re struggling. Surprisingly, even after multiple playthroughs of each of LEGO Party’s four boards I’ve barely heard the same joke twice, although in fairness that could be because half the time the commentary has been completely drowned out either by fits of uncontrollable laughter or salty bickering as a hard-earned gold brick is ruthlessly snatched away from another player. Seriously, if you’re playing with a competitive group, that tends to sting harder than suddenly finding a lost LEGO brick with the fleshy part of your bare foot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the comedy in LEGO Party stems from the competitive chaos of the challenges themselves, and developer SMG Studio – who previously entertained with the slapstick-based shenanigans of its Moving Out series – has really outdone itself as far as crafting a construction derby of morish minigames. From memory-testing challenges to physics-driven races and rhythm-based dance-offs, Lego Party’s roster of minigames is as diverse as it is diverting, dripping with personality and creative flair. Besides, it’s always a great indication for how immediately engaging multiplayer minigames are when players get caught up in the competition without realising they haven’t even left the pre-game practice screen, which has been a regular occurrence during my time with LEGO Party so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some minigames are terrific, toybox tributes to other titans of multiplayer mayhem, such as the obstacle course dash that feels straight out of Fall Guys or the zero-gravity space shuttle soccer that’s very much in the same orbit as Rocket League. Others lean into the familiarly tactile feel of playing with LEGO itself, like the one that involves trying to build monsters out of a pile of different-shaped blocks without being provided any instructions. There’s one challenge with four soccer goals to defend from an ever-increasing number of balls that plays out like an inverted game of Hungry Hungry Hippos, and another that sits each minifig on a LEGO motorbike and challenges you to navigate an undulating course like a cutesy recreation of Trials HD. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the most popular minigames amongst the contestants on my couch are the ones that feel like nothing else we’ve ever played. There’s the frantic, four-way battle to smash your opponents’ LEGO vase with a brick boulder that gradually speeds up as it’s deflected off each player, or the nightclub-themed showdown that sees each of you scramble to fling your minifig onto a floating dance floor with elastic grappling hooks. Of course, everyone in my party has their own personal picks: I love anything on four-wheels, my son’s really into the zero-gravity games, while my daughter’s favourite is… basically whichever minigame she won most recently. But the quality of challenges here is so consistent across the game board, that even when we opt for a random minigame choice we’re rarely disappointed with whatever comes our way.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Everything is Cool When You’re Part of a Team</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I also appreciate that success in these minigames is mostly reliant on a combination of skill and luck. You won’t find any cheap button-mashing challenge types here like the ones that often pop up in Mario Party, which I always felt put unnecessary wear and tear on my expensive game controllers, not to mention seeming somewhat unfair to the younger players in my lounge room who haven’t had decades of button-pressing practice pumped into their biceps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There also aren’t any lopsided three-vs-one match types to force the majority to unfairly gang up on an individual, as LEGO Party’s minigames are always evenly split – either every man for himself, or face-offs in teams of two on the occasions you land on a Brick Battle square. These team-based clashes range from the pure intensity of a doubles game of air hockey through to more ridiculous co-op tasks where one person aims a T-shirt cannon and the other fires it at an audience of shirtless minifigs, and all of them demand effective communication and coordination between duos in order to get the win. In fact, I enjoyed these Brick Battles so much that I was slightly disappointed to find there were only nine of them included in the roster.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, I am happy that LEGO Party doesn’t bother with random participation awards at the end of each board, like many Mario Party games do. There’s still plenty of twists and turns as fortune-changing chance spaces are sprinkled across the map in the closing stages, and many games I’ve played have seen the lead constantly change hands all the way through to the final round, but the winner is always clearly defined by the time you reach the end – not unfairly elevated into first position after the fact purely because of some arbitrary, unseen statistic like they happened to land on the most event spaces. It makes victory feel like it was achieved through genuine merit rather than more mystifying means. That doesn’t mean that other players won’t take any opportunity to knock you off the winner’s podium, though – and I mean that quite literally, especially during the riotously interactive results screen that typically devolves into delirious slap fights, slipping on banana peels, and background breakdancing.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some minigames are terrific, toybox tributes to other titans of multiplayer mayhem.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While LEGO Party’s lineup of playable minifigs might not feature anyone as iconic as Mario or Yoshi, it makes up for it in terms of sheer numbers and the substantial suite of options for character customisation. Playing through each of the game boards or one of the curated minigame playlists earns XP that gradually unlocks new minifigs along a series of simple progression paths, as well as awarding you carrots that can be spent unlocking a separate collection of minifigs in the shop. There are more minifigs here than you could shake a mini twig at – by my count well over 200, from goth kid minifigs to person-shaped pizza slices and stylish ninja warriors – and as you unlock each one their individual parts can be used to craft entirely new creations of your own. Want a minifig with tigerprint pants, a Miami Vice-style linen jacket, and an American football helmet? Weird combination but sure, it’s all yours. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite LEGO Games</h3><p>I'm brick games, b!tch!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bolting things together, I’d love to see LEGO Party leverage the many pop culture partnerships that the Danish brickmaker has amassed over the years and bring them to the party either in the form of expansion packs or future sequels. A LEGO Star Wars board with minigames designed around lightsaber battles and Death Star trench runs would be a treat, as would a LEGO Indiana Jones board that had event spaces to trigger Raiders of the Lost-ark style booby traps and boulders. Given Nintendo’s cosying up with the LEGO brand in recent times, it’s not inconceivable that we could even see a LEGO Mario LEGO Party expansion, at least in the Switch versions, to really bring things full circle. To be clear, nothing of this nature has been announced and I’m merely thinking out loud, but I’ve had a blast with LEGO Party so far, and I really hope that it’s set the fantastic plastic foundations for a series that’s here to stay.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">LEGO Party doesn’t completely reinvent the tried-and-true Mario Party formula, but it does introduce some welcome tweaks to its structure, a uniformly high quality collection of minigames hard-tuned for hilarity, and an enjoyably silly game show-style presentation that’s yet to overstay its welcome. The four game boards on offer might be a few less than Super Mario Party Jamboree’s collection, but the transformative nature of their layouts brings welcome variety and surprise to each session, and the considerable minifig customisation options are a joy to tinker with. Creative, colourful, and a consistent crack up, LEGO Party is purpose-built to turn any boring old night into a block party filled with belly laughs.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-party-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo recently kicked off Mario's 40th anniversary, and it appears other companies are joining in on the celebrations.</p>
<p>One of them happens to be First 4 Figures, with the "high end" collectible maker announcing its Mario and Yoshi statue (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/03/pre-orders_for_mario_and_yoshi_statue_go_live_on_first_4_figures_website">which we previously covered here on Nintendo Life</a>) is now back in production - with standard, exclusive and definitive editions available to pre-order.</p>
<p>The definitive edition also comes with the bonus Bowser Checkpoint Flag and is priced at $749.99 / £558.03. The standard edition starts at $549.99 / £409.22, and the exclusive edition will set you back $599.99 / £446.42. There's also an early bird special if you place an order before 13th October 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Calling all Super Mario fans! We're thrilled to announce that we will be heading back into production to complete the edition size of our Mario and Yoshi statue, featuring the Standard, Exclusive, and Definitive versions!"</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250930.html">official press release</a>, Nintendo Singapore was established last week on 26th September 2025. It aims to accelerate the growth of the company's business in Southeast Asia and will be led by managing director Takahiro Miura. Here's the announcement and overview:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The same announcement also mentions how Nintendo is considering establishing a local entity in the Kingdom of Thailand to accelerate business in this location. Earlier this year, Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-sets-up-new-subsidiary-in-taiwan">set up a new subsidiary</a> located in Taiwan, including the launch of the Nintendo eShop in this location.</p>
<p>This follows the launch of the Switch 2 in June, with sales of the new system already off to a flying start. In less than a week, the unit sold over 3.5 million units worldwide, and as of the end of the first month, the device had already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">sold more than 6 million units</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, the focus is on "stability improvements" to make the new and old hybrid hardware super stable. Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>

<hr>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1972886876018123087">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> has shared some insight about this latest update on social media. While the patch notes list the sole change as "stability", there is apparently "some code related to handling accounts and system time" that's been updated (<a href="https://switchbrew.org/wiki/20.5.0">via SwitchBrew</a>). As for Switch 2, there are no additional details about these patch notes right now, but according to the same source, there could still be some compatibility fixes for existing Switch titles.</p>
<p>If we find out anything else about this latest update (or if there are any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/more-switch-games-have-received-switch-2-compatibility-fixes">compatibility fixes for existing Switch titles</a>, similar to the previous update), we'll let you know. This follows an update at the start of this month, which also included stability improvements. Nintendo released multiple stability fixes in July and earlier in June as well.</p>
<p>To manually perform this latest system update, navigate to System Settings &gt; System Update &gt; and from there you should be able to download and update your system. Nintendo also updated its music app today, adding a new track from Princess Peach's Switch outing.</p>
