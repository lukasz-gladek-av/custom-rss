But that time’s over. Rockstar announced that it would reveal the game’s first trailer on Tuesday, December 5th, 2023, at 6AM PT / 9AM ET. Unfortunately, an early leak prompted the company to release the trailer more than half a day earlier than planned, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">revealing <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will bring the series back to Vice City</a>, and it showed off a new protagonist, Lucia.</p><p>Though Rockstar Games has kept mum on what to expect from the next installment in the series, we do have a bit of an idea of what the game looks like thanks to a hacker leaking 90 videos’ worth of material. In 2022, Arion Kurtaj — a member of the Lapsus$ hacker ring — leaked the videos, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23842746/lapsus-member-uber-rockstar-games-hack">a London jury found him responsible for the act</a>.</p><p>There have also been unconfirmed reports of another, more recent <em>GTA VI</em> leak in the days before the trailer’s world premiere, showing off a bit of the game’s map <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-may-have-just-come-from-a-rockstar-employees-son">that allegedly came from a Rockstar employee’s kid</a>.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>GTA VI is still coming this fall.</p><div><blockquote><p>Looking ahead, this calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for Take-Two, as we plan to launch Sid Meier’s Civilization VII on February 11th, Mafia: The Old Country in the Summer, Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall, and Borderlands 4.</p></blockquote></div><p>Take-Two also revealed that the over-a-decade-old <em>GTA V</em> has sold more than 210 million copies globally.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Mjc5MDg=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">Grand Theft Auto VI is launching in fall 2025</a></h2><div><p>In Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fourth-0">Q4 2024 earnings report</a>, the company stated when gamers can expect the next entry in the <em>GTA</em> series.

The trailer looks great, and good news: <em>Digital Foundry</em> is “inclined to believe” that the footage “is representative of the actual game,” <em>Digital Foundry’s</em> Richard Leadbetter writes in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-does-grand-theft-auto-6-deliver-the-generational-leap-we-were-hoping-for">a written analysis</a>.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The GTA VI trailer is already breaking viewership records on YouTube.</p><p>Despite Rockstar <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games">releasing the <em>GTA VI</em> trailer early</a> following a leak, it still managed to rake in 72 million views and counting. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-has-smashed-through-60-million-youtube-views-in-12-hours/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a> points out this makes it the most-viewed non-music video on YouTube in the 24 hours following its release — a record <a href="https://gamerant.com/mrbeast-video-breaks-most-views-24-hours-record/">previously held by MrBeast</a>.</p><p>It’s also getting close to dethroning <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/24/entertainment/bts-youtube-record-dynamite-intl-scli/index.html">BTS’s “Dynamite” music video</a>, which currently holds the record for getting the most views on all of YouTube in 24 hours.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>GTA VI isn’t launching on PC.</p><p>Unfortunately, the absence of PC isn’t too surprising, given that the PC version of <em>GTA V</em> was released more than a year and a half after the game first came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

In the more immediate future, <em>GTAV</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> will release on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S on March 15th.</p><p>The popularity — and profitability — of <em>GTAV</em>’s online component has meant that there’s been an unusually long wait for a sequel. The game originally released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, over eight years ago. In contrast, <em>GTAV</em> released a little over five years after 2008’s <em>GTAIV</em>. “With the unprecedented longevity of <em>GTAV</em>, we know many of you have been asking us about a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series,” Rockstar Games writes. “With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to significantly move beyond what we have previously delivered.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917783/rocstar-games-gta6-active-development-gta5-ps5-xbox-series-x-patch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On social media, the OpTic Gaming team revealed that Pred is making his way back into the OpTic Texas starting roster ahead of Major II of the CDL 2025 season. This news comes more than two months after Pred went on a hiatus from the team after struggling with a personal situation that was never clearly explained.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-pred">Return of the Pred</h2>



<p>Pred has returned to OpTic Texas, and Huke is now out in the open, with his future sitting in an unknown state.</p>



<p>Here’s what OpTic posted on socials to address that situation:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Thank you </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Huke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Huke</a><span> for your dedication &amp; passion playing for OpTic.

We appreciate you always, best of luck.</span></p></article></div>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Huke joined OpTic Texas</a> on December 11, joining the team and taking up a familiar mantle while Pred took a break from competing to deal with his mental health. He mentioned during a stream yesterday that his return wasn’t far off, and just one day later, he’s back on the team.</p>



<p>The return comes just as the Call of Duty League prepares to land in Texas for an OpTic-backed Major event.</p>



<p>Recently, OpTic Texas fell short at the Madrid Major, being kicked out of the elimination bracket by the Carolina Royal Ravens, who ultimately ended up going through to finish in fourth place.</p>



<p>The Major in Madrid was the first EU-based CDL tournament ever, and it was a boon for OverActive Media, the event’s host. The event saw 12,000 people attend – 80% of which came from <strong>outside </strong>Spain. The broadcast also picked up 250,000 peak viewers on platforms like YouTube.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Pred back on OpTic Texas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">announced an autumn 2025 release target</a> for GTA 6 last May, narrowing down what had previously only been a 2025 window at the time of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">first trailer reveal</a>.

<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">report last March</a> suggested Rockstar had originally been targeting a "spring" 2025 release but that development had "fallen behind". An autumn launch was said to be more likely - just as 2K later announced - but it was claimed a 2026 release could happen as "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">later called the rumours unfounded</a>, and Take-Two has continued to stand by its autumn launch window, even if it still hasn't quite got as far as revealing the release date the entire games industry is waiting for.</p>
<p>
Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has acknowledged the mounting anticipation around GTA6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">in an interview with IGN</a>. "I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organisation is super excited."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rockstar Games has once again reconfirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 will launch in 2025, despite the lack of a new trailer.</p>



<p>The announcement was made during <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take-Two Interactive’s quarterly earnings</a> for Q3 2025.</p>



<p>“Looking ahead, this calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for Take-Two, as we plan to launch…Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall,” it read.</p>



<p>The news may come somewhat as a surprise to some readers, as online discourse for the past few months has led most to believe that the game will undoubtedly be delayed due to the lack of updates.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, GTA 6 has not received its second trailer, with the first being released in December 2023. From trailer one to trailer 2, it’s now the longest time between trailers seen for a Rockstar Games titles.</p>



<p>That being said, Rockstar Games and take-Two Interactive seemingly are in no rush as the games reveal trailer broke several YouTube records, including, Most Viewed Video Game Reveal on YouTube in 24 Hours,’ ‘Most Viewed YouTube Video in 24 Hours,’ and ‘Most Liked Video Game Trailer on YouTube in 24 Hours’.</p>



<p>In short, Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games are confidence that no matter when the next GTA 6 trailer releases, it’s going to do big numbers and with a staked lineup for Take-Two releases this year, they might be thinking that focusing the spotlight on other games for the time being makes the most sense.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to GTA 6? And do you think it will actually release in 2025? </p>

                <p>Rockstar's highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI remains on schedule to launch in Fall 2025, parent company Take-Two announced as part of its earnings briefing today. Some expected Rockstar to announce a delay given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">Rockstar's history of delaying its big games</a>, but it did not happen.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said there is "always a risk of slippage," but he feels "really good" about the game making it out on time in Fall 2025.</p><p>"Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep.

Red Dead Redemption II has now sold 70 million copies, up from 67 million just three months ago.</p><p>GTA VI is not the only big game that Take-Two has in the works for 2025, as the company is also launching Sid Meier's Civilization VII on February 11, PGA Tour 2K25 on February 28, and WWE 2K25 on March 14. Looking beyond that, Take-Two has Mafia: The Old Country lined up for Summer 2025, with GTA VI landing in Fall 2025, and Borderlands 4 at some point in calendar 2025.</p>

			<p>Chipmaker AMD revealed in their <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-beat-intel-earned-13-5-more-data-center-ai-revenue-in-q4/">Q4 Earnings Call</a> that this console generation has been incredibly strong, with the company's cumulative unit shipments surpassing $100 million during the fourth quarter. Those units are semi-custom processors that are used to power a vast majority of the gaming consoles that exist right now. This includes chips for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and even the Steam Deck. Although this is a huge milestone for AMD, it was unfortunately overshadowed by their revenue totals in the <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earnings Call</a>.</p>
<p>It was said that AMD gaming revenue was down by 59% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. AMD's gaming segment made $563 million in the three-month period ending December 2024. When comparing it to the year before, it was a pretty massive drop. The company made $1.4 billion in gaming revenue in the same period in 2024. However, revenue as a whole for AMD was a record $7.7 billion, growing 24% year over year, with the growth coming from the Data Center and Client segments.</p>
<p>However, it's said that annual revenue in the Data Center segment nearly doubled, and Client Segment revenue grew by 52%, which helped offset the declines from the Gaming segments.&nbsp; CEO Lisa Su said that she expects gaming revenue to continue to be down from the previous quarter but not as significant a decline as other parts of the business. Looking into the future, Lisa says that channel inventories have normalized, with semi-custom sales returning to historical patterns.</p>
<p>The Earnings Call also mentioned the plans for the next year in the AMD gaming segment. Lisa Su goes on to say, "Our focus with this generation is to address the highest volume portion of the enthusiast gaming market with our new RDNA 4 architecture. <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-steam-console-powered-by-rdna-4-might-be-in-the-works-at-valve/">RDNA 4</a> delivers significantly better ray tracing performance and adds support for AI-powered upscaling technology that will bring high-quality 4K gaming to mainstream players."</p>
<p>It's expected that there will be "modest increases" in the Gaming and Embedded businesses. For the 2025 financial reports, AMD plans to combine the client and the gaming segment into a single segment. It's also been said that revenue is expected to be approximately "$7.1 billion plus or minus $300 million, up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our data center and the client business."</p>
<p>While AMD had a successful fourth quarter of 2024, it has been mentioned multiple times that revenue is expected to decline in the gaming segment, which other areas of the company will offset. However, with the rise of handheld gaming PCs, AMD may end up in a better position than it once thought. Especially with the potential of a new Steam console being released, which will most likely utilize AMD.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-cs2-active-duty-map-pool/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve and numerous community creators have created hundreds of Counter-Strike maps over the years, but CS2 currently utilizes what’s called the Active Duty map pool. Active Duty maps, in Valve’s own words, represent the most balanced and competitive maps in the total pool.</p>



<p>But the Active Duty pool is subject to change, in order to keep the iconic first-person shooter gameplay from feeling too stale.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-current-cs2-active-duty-map-pool">What is the current CS2 Active Duty map pool?</h2>



<p>The Active Duty map pool consists of seven maps that are used in CS2’s primary competitive mode, Premier. The Active Duty map pool is also the selection of maps used at every competitive tournament, from smaller online and local events to the illustrious Majors.</p>



<p>While Valve doesn’t always make a change to the Active Duty pool after every Major, the changes do occur then. This gives pro teams time to get used to the current map pool before the start of the next Major.</p>



<p><strong>Here is the current Active Duty map pool in Counter-Strike 2:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ancient</li>



<li>Anubis</li>



<li>Dust II</li>



<li>Inferno</li>



<li>Mirage</li>



<li>Nuke</li>



<li>Train</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Train is the newest addition to the Active Duty pool</a>, having been added in January 2025 after making its CS2 debut months earlier. Mirage is the longest standing map in the Active Duty pool, and it is the only map that has never been rotated out. Mirage has been played at every single Counter-Strike Major, dating back to DreamHack Winter 2013. Overpass, Cobblestone, Vertigo, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-is-cache-in-counter-strike-2-answered/">and Cache</a> have also spent time in the Active Duty pool.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Active Duty pool is only a fraction of the total number of maps available in Counter-Strike 2. CS2 also features newer community creations like Edin and Basalt, or the maps specifically made for modes like Wingman or Arms Race. Still, Active Duty maps are the most recognizable ones to most Counter-Strike players.</p>



<p>How would you change the Active Duty map pool after the next Major? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The tease of wireless mouse functionality for the new Joy-Cons on the Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be more than just that. A recently <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">discovered patent</a> seems to explain the feature while also providing drawings of the mouse functionality.</p>



<p>According to the patent, the Joy-Con features a “mouse operation sensor” that “detects reflected light from the detected surface that changes by moving on the detected surface with one of the first side surface and the second side surface placed on the detected surface.”</p>







<p>The sensor is located under the side of the Joy-Con—callout 170 in the images below. Based on the images, it appears players will be able to use one Joy-Con as a mouse while using the other in a standard way. Both Joy-Cons, however, appear to have the mouse sensor feature.</p>



<p>You can see the patent drawings depicting the feature below (click the image to enlarge).</p>

<p>Full details on how this new use for the Joy-Con have yet to be revealed. However, it could be assumed that Nintendo will go into more detail on that when it hosts its Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-direct-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">direct event on April 2</a>. During the show, Nintendo is expected to reveal full specs about the console as well as show the first set of games for the system. A price and release date announcement is also anticipated.</p>

That means Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can run their own Super Bowl simulations before the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles meet again on Sunday.</p><p>EA has traditionally released its Madden NFL Super Bowl predictions ahead of the game, but the publisher has yet to do so this year. Officially, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-super-bowl-predictions-over-the-years-how-often-does-ea-get-it-right/1100-6487137/" data-ref-id="1100-6487137">Madden NFL's Super Bowl projections</a> have only been right six out of the last 13 years, which gives it a 46% accuracy rating.

                <p>Microsoft's next big game, the RPG Avowed from The Outer Worlds developer Obsidian, is capable of running at up to 60fps on Xbox Series X, game director Carrie Patel has confirmed.</p><p>Patel said on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtStowg2Rk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax podcast</a>, "You can get up to 60[fps]" on Xbox Series X. The use of "can" here might indicate an alternative graphics mode that prioritizes image quality over frame rate, but we don't know for sure as of yet.</p><p>The frame rate reaching 60fps on Series X is newsworthy in part because Obsidian previously said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-will-be-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-allowing-for-juicier-visual-effects/1100-6526077/" data-ref-id="1100-6526077">only capable of reaching 30fps on Xbox Series X.</a> Obsidian said this decision was made early on in the development of the game and has allowed the studio to get "a lot juicier" with visual effects. Things have changed since then, though, and Avowed can now run at a higher frame rate on Series X.</p><p>Patel also told fans to expect some amount of bugs and issues. "You gotta accept a little jank to do something fun and creative, I think," Patel said.</p><p>Avowed was previously set for release at the end of 2024 but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">delayed to February for scheduling purposes, not due to quality.</a> The game officially launches on February 18, but the $90 Premium edition unlocks five days early, beginning February 13.</p><p>Like Microsoft's other first-party games, Avowed is included with Game Pass Ultimate at launch. Members can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">buy an upgrade add-on to the Premium edition for $22.50 to get all the perks</a>, including early access.</p><p>Avowed is Obsidian's first new release since 2022's Pentiment. It's not Obsidian's only in-development project, either, as the studio is also making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is planned for release this year.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-steelbook-premium-edition-is-up-for-preorder-comes-with-five-day-early-access/1100-6527801/" data-ref-id="1100-6527801">Avowed preorder guide.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">For the first week of each Content Commissioner takeover, players will "chase glory together to complete Community challenges and ultimately determine how many Apex Packs will be up for grabs the following week," according to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/takeover-game-updates" rel="nofollow ">a new blog post</a> on the official Apex Legends website.</p><p dir="ltr">The community goals for the first week of each takeover are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 1 challenges:</strong> 10 Apex Packs earnable</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 2 challenges:</strong> 15 Apex Packs earnable</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 3 challenges:</strong> 20 Apex Packs earnable</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The second week of each takeover is when players will get a chance to earn those Apex Packs. Players will be faced with five in-game challenges.

            <p>
With February upon us, it's time to vigorously rub hands together as subscription services up and down the land lob a fresh batch of titles at their members, expanding those already bulging backlogs to increasingly calamtous extremes. And now it's Amazon's turn, with the company having announced 20 more titles it's bringing to Prime Gaming before February is through.
</p>
<p>
This month's offerings - as is customary for Prime Gaming - arrive over the course of several scheduled content drops. And following the inclusion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-2">BioShock 2</a> Remastered in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reveals-16-titles-heading-to-prime-gaming-in-january">last month's Prime Gaming bucket</a>, February's line-up continues the theme with the inclusion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>. That's available right now, alongside the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-talos-principle">The Talos Principle</a>: Gold Edition, which bundles together Croteam's excellent philosophically minded puzzler and all its DLC.
</p>
<p>
Then, as we get further into February, Prime Gaming subscribers can look forward to a whole bunch more title,s including sci-fi salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, RPG deckbuilder Dark Sky, isometric stealth adventure El Hijo – A Wild West Tale, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>. Additionally, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wolfenstein-youngblood">Wolfenstein: Youngblood</a> pops up before the end of the most, which is mostly notable for the fact its Microsoft Store code means it's playable on both Xbox and PC. The full list of incoming titles (plus the stores they can be grabbed from) are below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hi-rez-studios-lays-off-developers-from-smite-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The last layoffs from Hi-Rez Studios came in late 2024, and now they have seemingly conducted layoffs again this week. At the time of writing, approximately 30 employees have revealed that they were impacted by these layoffs across social media. Their announcements have been compiled into a single <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ij5sjy/hirez_layoffs_megathread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit megathread</a>.</p>
<p>So far, the reason behind the layoffs hasn't been disclosed.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7293312305092599809/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Lucky suggests</a></span> that the cuts to the team are "massive," with most of the layoffs impacting the Smite team, with a team currently working on Smite 2, which is in Open Beta.</p>
<p>The previous layoffs at Hi-Rez came in <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/">October 2024</a>, with the impacted staff working on cosmetic and system features on the original Smite. However, this new round of layoffs seems to have impacted a wide variety of roles across the company. This includes producers, designers, programmers, and even Esports commentators.</p>
<p>It's uncertain whether Hi-Rez will make a comment about these layoffs or whether they are trying to keep them on the down low. However, when the layoffs in October took place, CEO Stewart Chisam took to social media to explain the reasoning behind the layoffs, saying that it was to ensure the longevity of Smite 2, with hopes that the game would "last into the 2030s."</p>
<p>However, since those layoffs, Chisam's X account has been deleted, which is where he originally made his announcement regarding the layoffs. His announcement was also posted on LinkedIn. At present, there has been no sign of an announcement or explanation behind these layoffs.</p>
<p>The staff impacted have been releasing their statements regarding their time at Hi-Rez Studios and also going on to express their frustration regarding the layoffs. Some stated that they knew that it was coming, even though they felt it shouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>It's likely that this is part of a strategy shift, much like the layoffs that took place in October, to downsize the amount of staff that are currently working on the original Smite. Whether any of the staff members impacted will be given an opportunity to transfer to other departments within the company remains to be seen, alongside whether or not Hi-Rez Studios will be aiding the staff impacted.</p>

The publisher behind <em>Borderlands, Mafia, Bioshock, NBA 2K,</em> and more has marked down nearly all of its games available on Valve’s PC storefront. The exact discount varies game to game, but overall this is a massive sale that includes newer games like<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-midnight-suns-impressions-xcom-firaxis-pc-rpg-1849793171"><em>Midnight Suns</em></a></span> and older games like <em>Civilization III.</em> The sale ends on February 20, which is cute. </p><p>The biggest deal in the 20th Anniversary sale, though, is the “20 for 20" bundle. This brings together 20 games into one big package that only costs $20. Here are the games included in the bundle: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization® IV, </em></li><li><em>Sid Meier’s Pirates!</em></li><li><em>Sid Meier’s Railroads!</em></li><li><em>Railroad Tycoon 3</em></li><li><em>BioShock</em></li><li><em>Borderlands Game of the Year </em>(And its DLC)</li><li><em>The Misadventures of P.B.

Seems like a great deal! And it is, but whether or not it’s a great deal <em>for you </em>depends on something. See, this bundle doesn’t give you a discount if you already own one or more games in it. And you don’t get extra copies of those games you already own. </p><p>So if, for example, you own<em> BioShock, The Darkness II, </em>and <em>Borderlands</em> already, you still have to pay $20 for this bundle and you don’t get digital copies of those games to give to friends. In that example, the deal becomes less great. It’s still not bad and you might still want the other games in the 20 for 20 bundle, but just double-check what you own already before purchasing the package. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft is releasing a manga that will dive into the prequel story of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1887426010427089267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) announced the arrival of this Shadows Prequel Manga today. Interested players can purchase it in Japan when the game releases on March 20, 2025. Availability for other regions will arrive later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows prequel manga will focus on the journey of “a young Assassin apprentice.” It isn’t clear whether Naoe is this “Assassin apprentice,” as the cover art features a different woman. This Assassin will fight “against the growing presence of the Templars order in Japan.” The cover art features a woman perched on a roof, wearing the famed white Assassin hood. She holds a katana in her right hand and the iconic Hidden Blade in her left.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some commenters have predicted that the woman featured in the cover art could be “<a href="https://x.com/SuperDropKick17/status/1887532530879942672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Naoe’s Mom</a>.” Others wonder why nothing related to <a href="https://x.com/readonlyac36188/status/1887451162103763304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yasuke</a> was included in the cover art. More details about the manga should be revealed closer to release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows can now be pre-ordered for $69.99 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file size</a> of Assassin’s Creed Shadows was revealed through its listing on the Mac App Store. The game’s art book, which showcases new art, also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked recently on an 18+ website</a>. What are your thoughts on the Assassin’s Creed Shadows prequel manga?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

While the movie got a sequel two years later, Fox axed plans for a full trilogy and we didn’t see Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch or The Thing back in theaters until the much-maligned 2015 reboot.

The <em>Fantastic Four </em>movie is weighed down by too many of the worst aspects of its mid-2000s era, and I’m not just talking about very ropey CGI. There’s cheesy butt rock that follows the chaotic playboy Johnny Storm in nearly every scene he gets by himself, half the scenes are bogged down by a stilted Disney Channel awkwardness that never quite reaches endearing camp, and there’s even a blatant, intrusive ad for the original Xbox featured prominently onscreen at one point. But even with these aspects put aside, the movie fails to scratch the surface of why the Fantastic Four have been mainstays in Marvel’s catalog.</p><p>Sure, it hits the two major bullet points: The quartet goes up into space and is exposed to a cosmic cloud that alters their DNA and gives them superpowers, and a person going by the name Victor Von Doom is the baddy. The problem is that <em>Fantastic Four </em>portrays the fiery familial passion of the group with the intensity of lightly flavored mineral water. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba’s Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman are devoid of any romantic magnetism, but I’m supposed to believe they have a storied, angsty past as they argue about Reed’s meticulous nature in a flat monotone. Julian McMahon’s Doom is supposed to complete a love triangle, but everyone in this group talks to each other as if they just met at a bar, aren’t interested in each other, and are trying to politely let each other down. Making matters worse, Doom is such a non-presence in the film that when he starts to do villain-y things, it feels like someone speaking up at a party after sitting in the corner alone for an hour. I don’t believe he loves Sue (or even thinks he does) when he proposes to her. I barely believe that he’s human, even before he gets hit with cosmic rays and turns into a deteriorating metallic villain. Doom as a bastard billionaire instead of a mystical tyrant probably focus-tested better 20 years ago, but it’s another example of the movie robbing the <em>Fantastic Four </em>of any vibrancy.</p><p>The saving graces of the cast are Chris Evans as the Human Torch and Michael Chiklis as the Thing. Though I’m not thrilled with the throat-destroyingly gravelly voice Chiklis puts on, there are affecting moments when he struggles with his new golem-like appearance, trying to find people who will accept him now rather than cower in fear. Evans is the standout, however, and it’s not surprising that he would be the one to stay in the superhero business after these movies. He lucked out, being the only character who’s happy with this superpowered turn of events, but he’s also the only actor who seems excited to be there.</p><h2 id="h441"><a id=""></a><strong>Fantastic Four’s biggest problem is that it’s boring</strong></h2><p>While many are wont to claim the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the harbinger of the end of cinema, at least many of its movies aren’t a complete slog. <em>Fantastic Four</em>, on the other hand,<em> </em>carries itself with a dreary level of self-seriousness. It’s a superpowered soap opera that lacks the charisma or chemistry that makes you care about the drama. The stoicism of this film is so suffocating that even Evans’ joy is smothered.</p><p>That’s <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s biggest problem: not the weird deviations from the source material, but just how boring it all is. Emotionally, visually, and cinematically, everything about the film is flat. I’m surprised that its memetic notoriety for being bad has persisted this long because it’s not even bad in any way that’s interesting; it’s simply forgettable. For a group of heroes known as a family above all else, it’s jarring how much this version of the Fantastic Four feels like coworkers acting out a corporate-mandated skit. It’s giving when your corpo boss says “We’re a family” and throws a pizza party.</p><p>It’s encouraging that <em>First Steps </em>seems to have learned some lessons from Fox’s failures, with the group’s proper MCU debut leaning into a distinct retro-future aesthetic that distinguishes it from the rest of the franchise. Hopefully it feels like the proper adaptation the First Family deserves when it premieres on July 25.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
