			<p>A sequel to Avowed is reportedly in the making at Obsidian Entertainment, but the studio has not greenlit a third The Outer Worlds game yet. The rumor comes from former Obsidian co-founder Chris Avellone, who <a href="https://x.com/ChrisAvellone/status/1986510753025704307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>Apparently, aside from DLC plans for Outer Worlds 2, it seems like Obsidian is making no plans for Outer Worlds 3 (but they are doing Avowed 2).</em></p>



<p>It's worth noting that Avellone left the studio ten years ago, following notorious disagreements with CEO Feargus Urquhart. That said, Avellone, who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-joins-republic-games-to-work-on-dark-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined Republic Games to work on an upcoming dark fantasy RPG</a>, might still have a few contacts within the company.</p>



<p>Avowed launched on February 18, 2025, opening a very busy year for Obsidian (which also released Grounded 2 in early access). The game offered an action RPG take on the fantasy world of Eora, originally introduced to the studio's fans with the Pillars of Eternity series of cRPGs. When I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed the game</a>, I had a lot of praise for it, rating it 8.8 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through. The visuals and performance are also praiseworthy. There are a few shortcomings, but if you're a fan of Western RPGs, you don't want to miss Avowed. It may have started as a spin-off, but it could go on to be the main series in Eora.</em></p>



<p>I have since played The Outer Worlds 2 as well, and I largely agree with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Carcasole's review score of 8.5</a>. It's another great RPG from Obsidian, not to mention an improvement over the original, but I believe Avowed is slightly superior, mainly due to better and more challenging combat, as well as more interesting companions. As such, if I had to choose, I'd rather get a sequel for that game.</p>



<p>Clearly though, if it is indeed true that the studio isn't currently planning to make more games in The Outer Worlds series, that might leave space for something else. Either a third, higher-budget Pillars of Eternity game, which Josh Sawyer <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said he'd love to do</a>, or perhaps the game that a lot of fans would like them to make: Fallout New Vegas 2. A few years ago, Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-fallout/">left the door wide open for that</a>. Bethesda doesn't seem too keen on it, but Microsoft reportedly desires to get new Fallout games out more quickly following the success of the Amazon TV show, and one way to do that, considering that BGS is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep in development on TES VI</a>, would be to give it to a sister studio.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-confirms-bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-will-launch-by-march-2026.1349656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has once again reconfirmed that Bungie’s extraction-based shooter, Marathon, will launch by March 2026.</p>



<p>The confirmation came during the company’s quarterly earnings call, where Sony’s CFO, Lin Tao, said that Bungie’s Marathon was still in active development and that the company was “fully dedicated” to launching the game in the current fiscal year. Sony’s fiscal year ends March 2026, suggesting that Marathon will likely launch sometime in February to March, if we were to guess.</p>







<p>Marathon has had an uphill battle since it was first announced earlier this year, with the game struggling to captivate players and the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing a slew of plagiarism allegations</a>, of which Bungie later admitted. The issues facing the gam<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> led to a delay of an undisclosed length</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-is-marathon-good-now">But is Marathon Good Now?</h2>



<p>However, as recently as the game’s latest playtests at the end of October, which were apparently under NDA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-leaks-closed-test-reveal-positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie has apparently been able to turn things around</a> with its game. </p>



<p>According to those who played the latest version of the game, it’s apparently in a much better state now, with players looking forward to its release in the coming months.</p>



<p>The game was said to be a ‘significant improvement’ since the playtests in the summer, yet the game still had some minor issueswhich were said to be easily fixed.</p>



<p>Whether Marathon will be a success on launch remains to be seen, but with GTA 6 now slipping into November 2026 and the start of the year seemingly being relatively quiet now, it could launch to some interest. </p>







<p>ARC Raiders is clearly the game’s most immediate competition, but if Marathon launches in March 2026, ARC Raiders’ playerbase and hype will likely have whittled down considerably. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to giving Bungie’s Marathon another go when it releases? Let me know what you’re thinking on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> has not reached expectations following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony's $3.6bn acquisition</a> of Bungie.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonypre.pdf">earnings report</a>, Sony has recorded a loss in profit in its games segment due to "impairment losses against a portion of Bungie, Inc.'s intangible and other assets in connection with Destiny 2."</p>
<p>Expanding on this during a Q&amp;A, Sony CFO Lin Tao stated: "Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectations we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie."</p>

<p>She continued: "While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie."</p>
<p>Still, Tao noted Sony's live-service games "overall accounted for more than 40 percent of our first-party software revenue", citing the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and MLB: The Show 25 (and their respective Xbox releases).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-destiny-2">Destiny 2 player numbers have drastically dropped in recent months</a>, with fears it could be nearing the end of its life.

<p>Let's go, Tokyo!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a little something to make you smile. The Pokémon Company has today shared another look at its upcoming theme park, 'PokéPark Kanto', and announced that gates will open on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Tickets to this new section of Tokyo's Yomiuriland Amusement Park will open for Japanese residents on 21st November and will be distributed by a lottery. There's currently no information on how those of us who live in other countries can nab tickets, but the official English booking website currently hosts a "Coming Soon" message, so keep an eye out for updates in the coming months.</p>
<p>But what's this PokéPark all about? This permanent outdoor Pokémon experience — the first of its kind, surprisingly — is divided into two areas: the Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the forest area will be your chance to see Pokémon 'in the wild'. Okay, it's actually just a bunch of statues dotted throughout a woodland walk, but you can expect photo ops aplenty with the likes of Pikachu, Eevee and Nidoran.</p>
<p>Sedge Town is more of a commercial area, with a Pokémon Center and Poké Mart you can pop into for merch, rides like the 'Pika Pika Paradise' and 'Vee Vee Voyage', and the 'Sedge Gym' show area.</p>


<p>It all looks really rather sweet, if you ask us. If you happen to find yourself in Tokyo next February, you know this'll be worth popping into.</p>

            <p>A beefy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> update has just dropped, and it aims to take care of a couple of bugs and exploits which have become infamous bugbears over the last little while. No longer will people be able to fly up to rooftops by smacking drones with sledgehammers, and no longer will lock-guided missiles cheekily ignore countermeasures.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This and more can be found if you leaf through the notes for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-update-1-1-1-5">update 1.1.1.5</a>, which has rolled out this morning on the fine day of November 11th. Those lead with the fix for the drone exploit, which was seeing folks hop atop the unmanned aircraft and whack them with hammers so they flew into the air, acting as lifts to rooftops from which you could then snipe with impunity. Personally, I'm sad such a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzT9L4llKzk&amp;t=1s">fun fairground ride</a>'s been outlawed, but I also die every 12 seconds in each match to someone playing properly, so hadn't really noticed the exploiters.</p>
<p>The lock-guided missile fix is one we've known was coming since last week, when EA opted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-devs-temporarily-confiscate-the-infantry-fighting-vehicles-bugged-lock-on-missiles">temporarily disable them</a> until this patch rolled out. Beyond those, vehicles should now spawn as intended during breakthrough and conquest matches, and "multiple battle royale issues affecting match flow, squad revives, and end of round transitions" have been dealt with. Those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-redsec-best-guns">REDSEC</a> fixes include instances of kills following respawns leading squads to be instantly eliminated and matches deciding not to end after the last team are wiped out.</p>
<p>In terms of player-specific stuff, the update's seen EA make it easier not to have your aim knocked too far off course when landing or sliding and reduce bullet "dispersion" being too high because it hasn't adjusted properly to you moving more slowly than the speed of sound. Good news for people who like tearing through the middle of battles like a toddler having an almighty sugar rush. Some progression blocks on challenges have also been lifted.</p><p>If you've participated in any of the drone hammering, remember to apologise to the next one you see for all of the trouble. We'll have to wait and see what ends up being the next glitch dubbed the scourge of the battling fields now this boogeyman's been snuffed out.</p>

<p>A fresh update has been deployed for Battlefield 6, introducing a variety of quality-of-life tweaks that impact various aspects of the game, and we’ve got the patch notes.</p>

<p>The biggest updates included fixing an exploit that allowed players to access unintended areas when standing on a Recon Drone, fixing an issue where enemy countermeasures did not effectively counter Lock-Guided Missiles, and vehicle spawning issues in Breakthrough and Conquest.</p>



<p>In REDSEC Battle Royale, multiple issues impacting match flow, squad revives, and end-of-round transitions were fixed, as well as a specific progression issue.</p>

<p>Fortnite is set to make a controversial addition in a future update, it’s claimed, with gambling mechanics set to be directly added to the title.</p>



<p>Huge updates are on the cards for Fortnite with Chapter 7 due to kick off later this month, and the annual switch in chapters usually results in the biggest gameplay changes of the year.</p>



<p>While we’ve already seen leaks suggesting huge collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> are on the cards, the apparent addition of gambling will ruffle some feathers.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-will-add-gambling-mechanics">Fortnite Will Add Gambling Mechanics</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big deal. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1988203466146410851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reliable leaker ShiinaBR</a>, gambling mechanics are “coming soon” in Fortnite and will be available to games created using the Unreal Editor in Fortnite.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear whether official Fortnite experiences will support gambling, or whether content link loot boxes will be added to the Item Shop, but it appears that it will be available in community-created experiences.</p>



<p>According to leaks, random items will be purchasable with V-Bucks, but creators will be required to disclose gambling odds—something commonplace in gaming to align with international laws. Additionally, due to laws in some nations, experiences with gambling involved will be blocked in some nations.</p>



<p>While gambling aspects are already available in some user-created experiences within Fortnite, including pet eggs with a rare chance to hatch specific creatures in games like Pet Heroes Adventure, the major difference is that these are paid for with in-game soft currency that is not purchasable.</p>



<p>With this update, V-Bucks will be directly available to spend on items that provide random rewards, though it’s unclear at this stage what exactly that will entail, and it will likely depend on the experience being played.</p>

            <p>Bungie's Marathon is still aiming for a release this financial year, Sony CFO Lin Tao has confirmed, adding "as needed, we will make corrections" following recent playtests.</p>
<p>The online shooter was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">indefinitely delayed back in June</a> due to "passionate" fan feedback, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a> over the use of an external artist's work.</p>
<p>Now, in today's earnings report, Tao confirmed Sony and Bungie are "fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule".</p>

<p>Marathon received a technical test back in October, focused on gameplay and retention. "We are in the process of analysing the performance against those KPIs," said Tao, "and as needed, we will make corrections."</p>
<p>"We are fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule," she added. "We will assume that we will launch this within this (financial) year, and that is included in the forecast."</p>
<p>That means Marathon should still be released by March 2026.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sony reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-playstation-5-celebrates-its-fifth-birthday-with-a-nice-surprise-sales-are-up-and-ps5-shipments-have-topped-842m">PS5 shipments have now topped 84.2m units</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-sells-over-33m-units-in-one-month-which-makes-it-about-twice-as-popular-as-astro-bot">Ghost of Yotei has sold over 3.3m units</a> in its first month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For all that technology moves at an alarming rate, there’s something hugely reassuring about hanging onto the trappings of the past. We’re suckers for that in gaming, keeping consoles tucked away in attics for their eventual glorious return to the light, usually so that our children can look at them in dismay at how awful and old they now feel, and what do you mean you need to <em>blow</em> on the <em>cartridge?</em>&nbsp;We’re also constantly looking to the next thing on the horizon, watching and waiting for the latest game, newest console or better peripheral. The Retro Fighters Battler GCPro manages to straddle those two lines, bringing the technology of the past and shoving it full of modern updates. If you’re a longtime fan of Nintendo’s consoles, this is a beautiful piece of nostalgia that’s more than ready for the present day.</p>

<p>The Retro Fighters BattlerGC Pro is bright purple, which is a good starting point, and it’s immediately recognisable as a modern take on the classic GameCube controller. It’s furthered by the large green ‘A’ button, dinky red ‘B’, kidney-shaped X and Y inputs and the bright yellow right analogue ‘C’ stick with its octagonal gate. This is a Gamecube controller… kind of.</p>


<p>Outside of the button and stick layout, the actual form sits far closer to the current Switch 2 Pro Controller than it does its older inspiration. There’s then two fully-analogue triggers, both ending in the Gamecube’s trademark digital switch, and both L and R shoulder buttons above them, and a further two ‘pro’ styled back buttons beneath the grip. The other most noticeable change is that there is a full-size D-pad, rather than the tiny one on the original Gamecube controller – I still get ghost hand cramps on rainy days from the memories of playing Capcom vs SNK 2.0 with that thing.</p>
<p>Under the hood things have changed as well. Both analogue sticks now host Hall Effect magnetic sensors, helping to keep stick drift at bay, and they’re clicky for L3 and R3 inputs, while the digital switches in each trigger are fitted with high-quality Kailh switches. Besides that, you’re getting both Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless connections and a built-in rechargeable battery life of 10 hours. As an upgrade over the original GC controller, it’s immense.</p>


<p>You can actually use it with your GameCube as well. The GC wireless dongle – also bright purple – works with original hardware, so that means you can hop right into original gaming on the GameCube, Wii and Wii U – assuming you have the right era Wii, and a further USB controller dongle for your Wii U. There’s also a USB-A equipped 2.4Ghz dongle for PC and Switch play, though right now this doesn’t work with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. There you have to rely on the Bluetooth connection, but the team at Retro Fighters have said they’re actively working on updating the controller firmware for the latest console. All in all, it’s an incredibly versatile package.</p>
<p>It feels solid in the hand. The Hall Effect-equipped sticks have been tuned to feel very close to the original GC hardware, and I was immediately at home with the sensations of using the BattlerGC Pro. Both of the stick tops are also accurate, and they just feel right when you’re settling down to play Super Smash Bros.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the biggest draws right now is the steadily growing library of GameCube games through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/luigis-mansion-added-to-switch-online-for-halloween-but-wheres-the-gamecubes-scariest-game/">Switch Online</a> the Nintendo Switch 2, and there’s a true joy to experiencing The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker or F-Zero GX with something that feels like the original hardware, especially when the controls match up properly.</p>

<p>You can play whatever you want with the BattlerGC Pro, and it feels so good that you might well be tempted to. I reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, and spent a good bit of my time using the BattlerGC Pro to mash up the hordes of Hyrulean enemies. Things would have been even better if there was the ability to customise the controls – surely in 2025 that should be a standard in-game feature? – but that’s not the BattlerGC Pro’s fault.</p>
<p>I really like the triggers and great-feeling digital switches for playing FPS games, though whether you can get on with the octgonal stick gates will be entirely up to you, and it is something of a shame that you can’t swap these out for regular circular ones. Maybe we’ll get that in a future Pro Pro version.</p>
<p>There’s a purity, though, to the BattlerGC Pro, and fundamentally, that purity is really targeted towards Super Smash Bros. and original GameCube hardware. If you’re heavily into the competitive scene for Smash, the layout and build quality of the BattlerGC Pro make it practically a must-buy. Attacks feel crisp and controlled, even as you’re hammering away at that huge A button. If you’re thinking about the BattlerGC Pro for Dolphin emulation, you need to be aware that getting the digital trigger inputs to work requires a bit of tinkering, though if you’re into emulation, chances are that won’t put you off.</p>

<p>There are a few other options outside of the BattlerGC Pro if you’re looking to relive the GameCube heyday. There is, of course, the original GameCube hardware, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-controller-review/">Nintendo’s recent revised version</a> that came out for the Switch 2, but both of these options are limited to the hardware they’re designed for and lacking in the shoulder button department for modern gaming, while the BattlerGC Pro is compatible with a host of different platforms, thanks to the dual wireless dongles and Bluetooth compatibility. Outside of these, it’s worth looking at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/10/the-nyxi-wizard-is-a-gamecube-style-switch-joy-con-with-drift-proof-analogue-sticks/">NYXI Wizard 2</a>, which retains a little more of the classic shape, and can be used docked with the Nintendo Switch as well.</p>

<p>Nintendo surprised us all last month when it announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> would be getting a free content update at some point in November. Well, that "some point" finally has a date — it's today!</p>
<p>Yes, Pikmin 4 was officially updated to ver. 1.1.0 this morning, adding new gameplay options like difficulty modes, the 'Field Camera' item, Decor Pikmin and more. It might not be the grand 'Switch 2 Edition' that we were all secretly hoping for (you'll find no additional perks on the new hardware here), but it <em>is</em> an excuse to dive back into a new save file, and we could all do with that.</p>
<p>Besides these content additions, the update also includes new control options, bonus <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pikmin_bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> connectivity, and a handful of bug fixes. The patch has even rolled out to the game's free demo, so you can see some of these newbies in action without having to spend a penny.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/62986/~/how-to-update-pikmin-4">Nintendo Support website</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 4 ver. 1.1.0 (11th November 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Newly Added Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now choose from three different activity levels for creatures: Relaxed, Normal, and Fierce.
<ul>
<li>This can be changed at any time from Settings in Options (- Button).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now take pictures with the “Field Camera” item and decorate them with stamps and frames.
<ul>
<li>The Field Camera is added to your bag on the morning of day 2.</li>
<li>If resuming save data from before the software is updated, it will be added to your bag when you return to the Rescue Command Post and morning arrives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>”Decor Pikmin” will now appear in the story.
<ul>
<li>To have Decor Pikmin join your squad, after rescuing the Rescue Corps Ranger Dingo, use the Field Camera to take pictures of a Decor Pikmin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By sharing the data of Decor Pikmin who have joined your squad in the full version of Pikmin 4 with the smart device application Pikmin Bloom, you can also get seedlings for those same Decor Pikmin in Pikmin Bloom.
<ul>
<li>You can send the Nintendo Account ID and discovered Decor Pikmin data when you finish exploration on the day the Decor Pikmin was discovered.</li>
<li>The Nintendo Account must be the same between the user playing Pikmin 4 and the one playing Pikmin Bloom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now use “Roll Over” in which you begin another playthrough, carrying over some of the save data on a file that has cleared the story.
<ul>
<li>With save data present that has cleared the story, select an empty Rescue Database on the file selection screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have ever reached the morning of day 2 in the story, you may skip that introduction when playing again from the beginning.
<ul>
<li>You begin from exploration day 2 in which you head for Sun-Speckled Terrace after creating an ID Badge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Newly Added Controls</strong></p>
<p>The following control settings have been added to Settings in the Options menu (- Button).</p>
<ul>
<li>You may switch between enabling and disabling Auto Target Lock for Cursor.</li>
<li>You may select either the cursor or the player avatar as the center point of the whistle.
<ul>
<li>This is set to “Player Avatar” when you begin with the activity level set to “Relaxed,” but this may be changed at any time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may now select either “Normal” or “Precise” for the speed of the arrow that appears when you hold down X to aim. Setting this to “Precise” will make it easier to adjust the direction of the Pikmin’s Charge and Oatchi’s Rush.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed other issues to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A patch with the same changes has also been distributed for the Pikmin 4 demo (Ver. 1.1.0). The demo version cannot link to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Exclusive news.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> has sold 3.3 million copies in its first month on sale, Sony has confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of its latest financial results, Sony said Sucker Punch’s PlayStation 5-exclusive action adventure sold 3.3 million units in the 32 days since going on sale on October 2 — so sales up to and including November 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced the figure without any commentary, so it’s hard to know whether the company is happy with the result. However, there is a great deal of context we can add that helps us paint a picture of Ghost of Yotei’s commercial success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first comparison we should make is to its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima. It sold 2.4 million copies in its first three days after going on sale exclusively on PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, then hit 5 million after 118 days (just shy of four months). It’s now up to 13 million copies sold, including sales of the PC and PS5 Director’s Cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it’s worth remembering that while we don’t have a figure for a comparable period of sales, it looks like Ghost of Yotei is selling about as well as Ghost of Tsushima before it, a suggestion backed up by sales data <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yoteis-us-launch-was-perfectly-fine-not-amazing-not-bad-says-analyst-but-the-true-test-will-be-in-the-months-ahead">from the U.S.</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sales-of-ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-yotei-in-line-with-ghost-of-tsushima-in-europe-new-data-reveals">across Europe</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is that good enough? We need to consider that Ghost of Tsushima came out on the PS4, which in the summer of 2020 had a much bigger install base than the PS5 does today, and amid the stay-at-home gaming boom fueled by lockdowns. Ghost of Yotei also sold for $70, which means its dollar sales are greater compared to the cheaper Ghost of Tsushima, whose standard edition launched at $60.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of each release differs also in that Ghost of Tsushima came out in the summer, and Ghost of Yotei came out in the fall. Yotei has the crucial holiday season coming soon, and it will surely be a popular pick for those buying a PS5 for the first time or upgrading to the PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out at some point in 2026, which will undoubtedly give Ghost of Yotei a shot in the arm next year. And we all know that Ghost of Yotei, like Ghost of Tsushima before it, will eventually launch on PC in Director’s Cut form. Perhaps there will even be a PS6 version, whenever that console rolls around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Ghost of Yotei has some way to go before it matches the total sales figure of its predecessor, but is has plenty of opportunity to catch up. And, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3wthi4twc2u" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Circana’s Mat Piscatella said last month</a>, its launch sales were “perfectly fine... Not amazing, not bad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next from developer Sucker Punch, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out. But, he suggested, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-we-were-good-at-juggling-four-projects-yeah-wed-have-a-remaster-ghost-of-yotei-dev-sucker-punch-says-it-will-remain-a-single-project-studio"><u>don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review"><u>Ghost of Yotei review</u></a>.

            <p>Well, it could have been worse. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s all-important script extender modding tool has taken less than 24 hours to be updated to work with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s freshly released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-fallout-4-and-new-vegas-again-say-bethesda-and-also-a-release-date-for-fallout-76s-burning-springs">anniversary update</a>. It joins an ever-growing list of mods which have been categorised as updated over on Nexus Mods, while Bethesda are seemingly still looking into issues around the anniversary update's extra creations stuff not showing up properly for Steam players.</p>
<p>As with last year's Fallout 4 next-gen update, this re-release playing some degree of havok with mods was guaranteed going in, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ditch-any-fallout-4-mods-which-mess-with-the-main-menu-ahead-of-its-anniversary-edition-update-bethesda-warn">Bethesda issuing a specific warning</a> against ones which edit the game's main menu. As modding platform <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15400">Nexus Mods predicted</a>, the list of mods requiring updates to work with the new version has been larger than just those.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The most important mod that'd need to be updated was <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42147?tab=description">Fallout 4's script extender</a>, which, like other games' script extenders, serves as a key backbone of a lot of the game's more complex mods. The good news is that the F4SE Team led by modder Ianpatt delved straight into analysing the new version as soon as it arrived and have already pushed live F4SE 0.7.4, which includes support for the anniversary update.</p>
<p>Beyond the script extender, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout4/mods?tag=Anniversary+Update+Compatible&amp;tags_yes%5B%5D=4831&amp;sort=endorsements">67 mods</a> including the likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/191">Darker Nights</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18547">Better Companions - All In One</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12986">Weapons of Fate</a> ballistics overhaul, and a fix for the game's infamous <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31028">rusty face bug</a> have also had their anniversary compatibility updates confirmed thus far. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/66051">Munitions - Ammo Expansion Project</a> and quest mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51787">Attack of the Lobotomites</a> are others among the updated mods I'd consider if I was starting to rebuild my load order right now.</p>
<p>Oh, and how can I forget the two <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41134">most</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33532">important</a> Fallout 4 mods of all time?</p>
<p>Something also worth being aware of if you're planning on buying Fallout 4 again for some reason is that Bethesda have been having some issues getting creation club stuff included in the anniversary update to show up as useable for those who've bought it. Based on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/1164632579866104032/1437544383447699466">latest message on the topic in the studio's Discord server</a>, this looks to currently still be affecting some Steam users. If you run into it, following <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/72891">these instructions</a> might help resolve things.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not even contemplating a return to The Commonwealth until I know I can safely ride my <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/71401">Wolverine-clawed steed</a> across the wastes again.</p>

            <p>A major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> update introduced today has fixed a bug allowing players to fly into the sky on top of a recon drone by hitting it over and over again with a sledgehammer. This had allowed players to reach otherwise inaccessible positions on maps, to the dismay of ground-bound fighters.</p>
<p>This bug had been present in the game since launch, with some abusing the exploit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o9khsv/devs_please_fix_this_people_are_using_the_drone/">to reach incredibly high areas of the map otherwise out of reach for regular players</a> on the other team, leading to one-sided death-from-above firefights.</p>
<p>Sure you could fly a jet or helicopter into these people, but at high cost and not necessarily on all game modes. So, it really did have to be fixed, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oeq9ug/patch_the_drone_glitch_already/">was at the top of the community's demands</a> long before the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-has-its-season-one-trailer-showing-new-weapons-maps-and-a-tactical-game-mode">Season One and RedSec update came out</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Alongside the death of the drone glitch, the update also fixes a lock-on missile issue where players in jets and helicopters were struggling to counter them with flares; these should be easier to avoid with vehicle counter-measures now. The update also fixed vehicle spawn issues on Conquest and Breakthrough game modes, as well as a myriad of battle royale issues and general progression, audio, and UI issues.</p><p>All in all the update appears to strike at the heart of several major complaints all at once. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-players-are-gobbling-up-ghost-of-yotei-on-ps5-but-things-look-a-bit-different-in-the-west">Battlefield 6 is still doing well on PlayStation and PC</a> as the military FPS continues to build excitement among its dedicated community.</p>

<p>Of course, because you simply <em>have</em> to make some sort of connection to Stranger Things itself, Matarazzo also insinuates that the Depths within Tears of the Kingdom is similar to 'The Upside Down', which... yeah, okay, we can allow that.</p>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom is, of course, one of several games to receive the 'Nintendo Switch 2' treatment alongside Breath of the Wild. Both titles run at a much higher frame rate and resolution on Nintendo's new console, with a new 'Zelda Notes' feature for those who just cant stop looking at their phones.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sony announced in its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q2 2025 quarterly report</a> that PS5 shipments have reached 84.2 million units. In the last quarter, Sony shipped 3.9 million PlayStation 5 consoles, slightly more than in Q2 2024, when it had shipped 3.8 million hardware units. PS5 sales remain behind those of the PlayStation 4 when launch dates are aligned, due to a variety of factors. Meanwhile, its main rival, Microsoft's Xbox, is experiencing its worst console generation in sales since the original Xbox.</p>



<p>Full game software sales also increased in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024: 80.3 million units compared to 77.7 million units. First-party sales went up this quarter, too: 6.3 million units, whereas Q2 2024 registered 5.3 million units sold. This is largely thanks to the launch of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yōtei game, which sold 3.3 million units in its first thirty-two days on the market. Ghost of Yōtei sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are also slightly behind Ghost of Tsushima</a>, but that's fairly normal as that game launched in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and had a much larger install base of PlayStation 4 consoles compared to current PS5 shipments.</p>



<p>I enjoyed the game almost as much as I did the original installment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">as explained in my review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>



<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-developer-doesnt-close-door-to-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might get a DLC</a>, similar to the first game, in addition to the Legends multiplayer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that's scheduled to launch next year</a>.</p>



<p>Lastly, in the Q2 2025 financial report, Sony revealed that the number of monthly active users (MAUs) on its PlayStation Network is up, from 116 million in Q2 2024 to 119 million in Q2 2025.</p>

                <p>With the inclusion of Cosmetics in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a>, you have almost complete freedom to tinker with how your plot of land looks. If you have a theme in mind, chances are that there are enough appropriate items to decorate the surroundings. With each new event, you can purchase or win more and more of these items, each one of which you can find in the designated cosmetics menu.</p><p>Of course, given the many trends of Grow A Garden’s mechanics, it’s not just a simple case of being an optional extra that you don’t need to engage with. The rarest of cosmetic items may be required to trigger the abilities of some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-pets-tier-list/2900-7008/" data-ref-id="2900-7008">best Grow A Garden pets</a> available. Other, more recent cosmetic items also apply specific <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/" data-ref-id="1100-6534388">Grow A Garden mutations</a> to increase the value of your plants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598561-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-moving-items.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598561" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598561-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-moving-items.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598561"></a><figcaption>Clicking on a cosmetic item will bring up the UI to allow you to reposition it on your plot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598561-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-moving-items.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_move_Grow_A_Garden_Cosmetics">How to move Grow A Garden Cosmetics</h2><p>To access the Grow A Garden Cosmetics menu, open the game and click or tap the icon that resembles a hammer and spanner crossed together. If you have any unseen cosmetic items, they’ll have a number in red next to their icon. You can use the arrow at the top of the inventory screen that appears to expand the number presented at any time. You can find a specific cosmetic by using the search bar in the Cosmetics menu.</p><p>Click an item on this menu to place it in your garden in front of you. You can also click/tap on a cosmetic to bring up the controls. You can then shift their position by holding down one of the four main buttons and moving your mouse/finger across the screen. Here is what all the buttons do:</p><ul><li><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> - this moves an item’s placement in your garden.</li><li><strong>Anti-Clockwise Arrow</strong> - flips an item on the vertical axis.</li><li><strong>Clockwise Arrow</strong> - rotates an item horizontally.</li><li><strong>Inverted Anti-Clockwise Arrow</strong> - flips an item on the horizontal axis.</li><li><strong>Arrow with padlock</strong> - implied that it locks the item into place, but this doesn’t work.</li><li><strong>Box</strong> - returns the item to the cosmetic inventory.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598582-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-best.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598582" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598582-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-best.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598582"></a><figcaption>While many of the Grow A Garden Cosmetics don't do much, there are some that are usable by you or your pets.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598582-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-best.jpg"></figure><h2 id="The_best_Grow_A_Garden_Cosmetics">The best Grow A Garden Cosmetics</h2><p>While there are many event Cosmetics, far too many to list at this point, there are a handful that give a separate bonus if you place them in your garden. For example, the Fall Fountain gives the Fall mutation to any of your garden’s plants, something that would only otherwise happen during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/" data-ref-id="2900-7058">Grow A Garden weather event</a>. Others require the corresponding pet to interact with them, like the Hex Serpent using the Hex Circle to sacrifice single-harvest plants for rewards and mutations.</p><p>Sadly, many of these items were only available during special events and are unlikely to return for at least a year; some only appear with extremely low odds. If there is a seasonal market, you can attempt to buy them outside of their original events, such as the Fall Market. In addition, one or two of them also require you to either socialize with NPCs with food, as detailed in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-and-tips/1100-6535055/" data-ref-id="1100-6535055">Grow A Garden Beginner’s Guide</a>, or enter some limited-time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamespot-comarticlesgrow-a-garden-codes/1100-6534916/" data-ref-id="1100-6534916">Grow A Garden codes</a> that, as far as we know, still work.</p><p>Here are all the Grow A Garden Cosmetics that you can either interact with plants or fruit, or use as another facility of sorts:</p><ul><li><strong>Hot Spring</strong> - the Nihonzaru pet rests in this Cosmetic.</li><li><strong>Pancake Stack</strong> - every 15-30 seconds, it attracts pets to its location.</li><li><strong>Cooking Pot</strong> - the Gorilla Chef uses this Cosmetic.</li><li><strong>Cooking Kit</strong> - used to cook food.</li><li><strong>Fall Fountain</strong> - has a chance to give the Fall mutation to a fruit in your garden.</li><li><strong>Witch’s Cauldron</strong> - the Black Cat naps near this Cosmetic.</li><li><strong>Hex Circle</strong> - plant precisely five single-harvest plants inside of it to trigger the Hex Serpent.</li><li><strong>Sarcophagus</strong> - have alongside a Mummy in your garden to use this pet’s ability.</li><li><strong>Spell Book + two Halloween Candles</strong> - two components to unlocking the Lich Crystal item.</li><li><strong>Green Bean Chamber</strong> - interact to talk to the Green Bean spirit to get the outfit.</li><li><strong>Mutation Machine Booster</strong> - reduces the time of the mutation machine to 50 minutes instead of 60.</li><li><strong>Pet Incubator</strong> - deposit a pet inside to let it grant XP over time. You can feed the machine plants to power it.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598562-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598562" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598562-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598562"></a><figcaption>Isaac's Cosmetic shop and crafting station is the place to get a large number of objects to decorate your garden with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4598562-grow-a-garden-cosmetics-shop.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Grow_A_Garden_Cosmetic_Shop_inventory">Grow A Garden Cosmetic Shop inventory</h2><p>Aside from the current Grow A Garden event’s selection of themed cosmetics, you can also buy them at the Cosmetic Shop run by Isaac.

These range from boxes containing signs, decorative items, and fence designs. You’ll only see a selection of these at any given time as the shop restocks every four hours. With every restock, the selection alters up to nine cosmetics, as well as nine fences and signs in the separate fences menu.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-is-nexon%E2%80%99s-most-successful-global-launch-to-date.1349572/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, ARC Raiders developer Embark Studios thanked the game's community for <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-continues-strong-launch-hits-700k-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching a new concurrent player peak on Steam of over 700K this past weekend</a>. This morning, publisher Nexon (also the parent company of Embark) announced in a press release that the PvPvE third-person extraction shooter game has sold more than four million units across all platforms to date, making it their most successful global launch ever.</p>



<p>Lee Jeong-hun, CEO of NEXON, stated:</p>



<p><em>We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Embark Studios for achieving the most successful global launch in Nexon's history. We are deeply impressed by the enthusiasm shown by our player community and look forward to building on that excitement with our content plans, including new maps, ARC vehicles, weapons, and quests, which will be available starting this month.</em></p>



<p>As recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as a few days ago</a>, estimates from Alinea Analytics indicated that game sales reached 2.5 million units in the first week. Clearly, the game has maintained its powerful momentum in the second week on the market.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is the second game released by Embark Studios, which was created by some former Battlefield developers who exited DICE. Their first release, The Finals, is a competitive team-based, free-to-play first-person shooter that focuses on arena matches. After a decent launch, many players didn't stick around, and for a while, the studio was uncertain about whether to continue supporting the game. Now, though, it appears to have recovered, and Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-ceo-battlefield-6-looks-really-good-the-finals-will-be-supported/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently said</a> the uplift ensures The Finals will be supported 'for years to come'.</p>



<p>Of course, with the level of success it's showing, there's no doubt ARC Raiders will be the studio's focus going forward. A few days ago, Embark introduced new map conditions, including an electromagnetic storm in Blue Gate, Spaceport, and Dam Battlegrounds, as well as a night raid in Blue Gate. The full public roadmap is available <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>If you look in some of the dustier, less pleasant corners of the internet, you'll see a contingent of people that have been actively rooting for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>'s failure. Whether it's because of console-based tribalism, perceived political posturing, or something else entirely, a small but vocal portion of the gaming audience has been willing Sucker Punch's latest to fall short.</p>
<p>How upset that audience must be, then, to learn that Sony's latest financial results indicate that Ghost of Yōtei has sold-through 3.3m units as of November 2, 2025 (that's 32 days after release: basically one month of total sales). That's per <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_supplement.pdf">data released by Sony</a>, announcing its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2025.</p>

<p>Per a report yesterday, we already knew that Japanese players were loving the game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-players-are-gobbling-up-ghost-of-yotei-on-ps5-but-things-look-a-bit-different-in-the-west">it was top of the Japanese PlayStation Store titles for the month of October</a>, even seeing off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and EA Sports FC (though, let's be honest, those titles are never that popular in Japan). For comparison, this time last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> managed to sell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">about 1.5m  units </a>in the same time period. By my maths, that makes it about twice as popular - at least in the launch period. Poor Astro Bot.</p>
<p>Perhaps with this level of sell-through, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-is-waiting-to-hear-from-you-before-deciding-what-if-any-dlc-is-needed">we'll actually get some DLC out of Sucker Punch</a>, who has stated that the nature of development allows the developer to "actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story" to better cater and research what sort of story DLC and content will land best for the audience. We already know the game is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-its-own-co-op-legends-mode-as-free-post-launch-dlc">getting its own co-op-focused Legends mode as free post-launch DLC next year</a>.</p><p>"Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it's a great character. And just like with Jin, if there's room to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative's sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we'll certainly take a hard look at that for sure," Ghost of Yōtei co-director Jason Connell has stated.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar, Ghost of Yōtei is Sucker Punch's follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, set in northern Japan around 300 years after the first title. We awarded it 3/5 stars, writing in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-review">Eurogamer's Ghost of Yōtei review</a>: "Sucker Punch's sequel offers more great swordplay and heartfelt storytelling, but would be better served as a linear action game, freed of its poor sidequests and dated open world."</p>

<p>In addition to the date and time, Nintendo also shared an image alongside its Direct announcement, showing a group of Toads on boats looking towards the evening sky as stars fly overhead towards Peach's castle. It appears to be during some kind of celebration or special occasion. I am rather taken by the star shaped sails each boat has, though I am sure they would be far from practical in the real world.</p>
<p>One of the younger looking Toads, meanwhile, has on what appear to be Mario-adorned pyjamas. This fellow is also holding onto a Mario plush, so clearly Brooklyn's moustachioed plumber is considered a bit of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-review-an-entertaining-advert-for-everything-nintendo">hero in the Mushroom Kingdom following the events of the first film</a>. Another Toad is a chef, likely the chap from  the Universal theme park restaurant, though I am pleased to say they are refraining from cooking while onboard their small wooden vessel. You can see the full image further below.</p>

<p>Just as a quick heads up, Nintendo has stated there will be <em><strong>no </strong></em>game information shared during its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie presentation tomorrow, so don't go hoping for news on an Odyssey sequel or something along those lines (though I do still live in hope).</p>
<p>Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p6ePBMZWeCo">available to watch on YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">via the Nintendo Today app</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, we got a good look at Yoshi in the upcoming Mario movie sequel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doh-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-leaks-come-from-the-most-unlikely-place">thanks to some Pillsbury cookie packaging</a> (no, I am not kidding). This promotional box of cookies also featured the Mario series' Comet Observatory, which is the home of Rosalina and the Lumas, as well as a Bowser Jr. graffiti tag.</p>
<p>So, will we see Bowser's spawn crop up during the Nintendo Direct tomorrow? And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-apparently-a-very-good-mario-themed-reason-you-should-go-and-see-wicked-for-good-this-november">will Rosalina actually be voiced by Ariana Grande as some currently suspect</a>? Well, there is potentially not too much longer until we find out!</p>
<p>What else are you hoping to see in the Super Mario Galaxy Movie trailer tomorrow?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda’s Latest Update is Awful News for Fallout Fans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-fans-awful-news-bethesda-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda%E2%80%99s-latest-update-is-awful-news-for-fallout-fans.1349554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard revealed that The Elder Scrolls 6 is still ‘a long way off’, despite being revealed almost a decade ago. It’s dire news for fans of The Elder Scrolls, who haven’t received a new ‘numbered release’ since 2011’s Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</p>



<p>However, in a twist that might displease post-apocalyptic fans, the knock-on impact of this news is that Fallout 5 will be <strong>even further away </strong>than anticipated. The studio’s production line will see The Elder Scrolls 6 on the market before Fallout 5 even enters meaningful development, which is a big issue for fans of the decades-old series.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-5-could-be-ten-years-away">Fallout 5 Could Be Ten Years Away</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GQ around the tenth anniversary of Fallout 4, celebrated by the release of the Anniversary Edition, Todd Howard touched on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-is-still-a-long-way-off/">increasingly long development window</a> of The Elder Scrolls 6. He suggested that the open-world RPG is a long way off and that fans should be ‘patient’.</p>



<p>This presents a tricky issue for Fallout fans.</p>



<p>While Fallout 76 is here and still receiving massive updates, a numbered Fallout release (by that I mean Fallout 5) is likely several years away from being released, if it ever surfaces at all.</p>



<p>We know that the team is working on ‘more Fallout’, but that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">doesn’t necessarily mean Fallout 5</a>. It most likely means <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-begging-bethesda-fallout-3-remastered-game/">Fallout 3 Remastered</a> or a New Vegas project.</p>



<p>It has been known for several years that Bethesda Game Studios’ running order would take them from Starfield to The Elder Scrolls 6 to Fallout 5. Given that we don’t have a <strong>release year </strong>for The Elder Scrolls 6, it could be a while before it hits the market. That means that for as long as it takes to get out the door, Fallout 5 will take even longer to appear.</p>



<p>Presently, we know <strong>nothing </strong>about Fallout 5. There’s not a shred of information to share aside from knowing that Bethesda Game Studios has a core concept for the game.</p>



<p>Bad news, apocalypse fans – you’ve got a while longer to wait.</p>



<p>Are you eagerly awaiting the arrival of Fallout 5? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-and-64-of-them-are-on-steam.1349548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to impress, and the player count is not only holding firm as the game’s lifecycle pushes on – <strong>it’s growing</strong>. The game has gone from strength to strength, and with a roadmap of content sitting on the horizon alongside that positive community sentiment, the game shows no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Recently, Embark Studios revealed that the game hit a concurrent user count of 700,000 players over the weekend across all platforms. From the data we’ve collected, we know that a whopping 64% majority of those players were present on Steam.</p>







<p>The extraction shooter genre (however <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-extraction-shooter-dumb/">dumb the name may be</a>) has always been front and centre on PC. From Escape from Tarkov to Marauders, and from Gray Zone Warfare to Arena Breakout: Infinite, the PC platform loves an extraction title.</p>



<p>The latest addition to the lineup is ARC Raiders, released on October 30 and introducing an all-new concept to the genre, a ‘post-apocalyptic’ setting backed by an AI-powered robotic threat.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, but the latest figures revealed by Embark Studios paint a particular picture.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Raiders!<br>It's been a little over one week since we opened up the tunnels for you to head Topside, and this past weekend we reached over 700,000 concurrent Raiders on the surface! 🥳<br>We're so happy to have you all here!<br>The many different ways you play and participate in ARC… <a href="https://t.co/Do6bAhWf4o">pic.twitter.com/Do6bAhWf4o</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1987930324156678210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>More than 64% of players are on <strong>Steam</strong>, showing that adoption is perhaps lacking somewhat on PlayStation and Xbox. With a market share of just 36%, console players are showing a lack of investment in the exhilarating extraction shooter.</p>



<p>It’s a fair statement, as the ‘extraction shooter concept’ is new to console-exclusive gamers. Until now, almost <strong>nothing </strong>with this operating model has appeared on console, save for failed titles like Call of Duty’s DMZ.</p>



<p>If you’re reading this and wondering if you should try ARC Raiders on console but are sceptical about the genre, let me point out that this is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-highest-rated-multiplayer-shooter/">highest-rated multiplayer shooter</a> in almost a decade.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to sit high on the charts. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to invest in the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Diablo 4’s Chinese Version Has Been Censored in a Weird Way]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-china-version-censor-weird-way/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4%E2%80%99s-chinese-version-has-been-censored-in-a-weird-way.1349536/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Diablo 4 is all about high-octane combat, impressive visuals, and rivers of hot, red blood. It’s a game tied inexorably to the occult, the underworld, and the afterlife, known for grotesque monsters, visceral sequences, and intense battles that keep the blood and guts flowing.</p>



<p>That’s why it comes as a surprise to some to learn that Diablo 4’s ‘Chinese version’, which was approved for release a few months ago, has been heavily censored, stripping all traces of <strong>blood </strong>from the game and replacing some boss characters’ scarier skins with elements much more tame.</p>



<h2 id="h-diablo-4-toned-down-in-china">Diablo 4 Toned Down in China</h2>



<p>Last year, Microsoft and NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-games-are-officially-returning-to-china/">penned a deal</a> to distribute Blizzard’s games throughout China after leaving the region in 2023. In a drastic move that pushed Blizzard out of China, games like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo were rendered unplayable there.</p>



<p>In July, several games were ‘approved’ by China’s National Press and Publication Administration, and one of those games was Diablo 4, the critically acclaimed action RPG title released in 2023.</p>



<p>Now, reports have surfaced that Diablo 4’s Chinese version has been censored, with Blizzard having been forced (assumedly) to remove blood and too much gore from the game. In a post from WOWHead, screenshots were revealed showing a dust-like substance being present in a fight instead of red blood.</p>



<p>Additionally, elements like skulls and bones, common trappings of the underworld, have also been removed. Wandering Death, a boss character made of bones and passed souls, is now made of <strong>rocks</strong>.</p>



<p>No reason has been provided to explain the changes, but it’s assumed that it’s linked to rules against promoting superstition and the supernatural in China. It’s a cultural point, and the regulatory body wants to remove some of the more volatile depictions of death and decay.</p>



<p>Do you think China should slow down on the censorship, or is it not that deep? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-11-884/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-884-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-tuesday-november-11.1349524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Tuesday, and as usual, that means it’s time for another NYT Connections puzzle. Today’s task isn’t an impossible one, but the fastest way possible to solve the NYT Connections challenge for today is to scroll down and use the hints and solutions I’ve assembled for you.</p>



<p>If you’re stuck on today’s NYT Connections answers and need some back-up, I’m here to help you out. Simply scroll down, pick out the hints, and continue that streak.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-11">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 11)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #884:</p>



<ul>
<li>MUSIC NOTES</li>



<li>FOUNDATION</li>



<li>STAND</li>



<li>SCALE</li>



<li>BASE</li>



<li>REST</li>



<li>RANGE</li>



<li>COMPASS</li>



<li>HIGHLIGHTER</li>



<li>ENVELOPE</li>



<li>POWDER</li>



<li>SCOPE</li>



<li>SPEECH BUBBLE</li>



<li>BLUSH</li>



<li>EXTENT</li>



<li>HOLDER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>Get ready for your close-up… these belong in a beauty bag</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>How wide, how far, how much… these words measure scope</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>They hold things up, keep things steady, or give something a place to rest</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>Tap to open… these are visual symbols for apps</em></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 11.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-11-884">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 11 (#884)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLUSH, FOUNDATION, HIGHLIGHTER, POWDER</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – EXTENT, RANGE, SCALE, SCOPE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BASE, HOLDER, REST, STAND</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COMPASS, ENVELOPE, MUSIC NOTES, SPEECH BUBBLE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

The games were perhaps a tad "safe" at the time, but it hinted at big things coming – and within a year, the PlayStation had cemented itself in the Australian gaming landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up my PS1 from a Cash Converters in 1999, then immediately bought <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/22/metal-gear-solid-6">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/04/final-fantasy-vii-review">Final Fantasy VII</a>. From there, I delived into a catalogue of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/21/xenogears">JRPGs</a>, racing simulators (yeah, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/23/gran-turismo-3">that series</a>), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/01/r-type-delta">scrolling shooters</a> and impenetrable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokimeki_Memorial_(video_game)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dating games</a> as my N64 quietly looked on, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/03/superman-2">judging me</a> from the shelf. I'm fairly certain I did not see daylight for about two years – and I knew I wanted to do this stuff as a career. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By that point, it was also clear that Sony had a stranglehold over the entire industry – delivering a suite of the finest games month after month that neither Nintendo or SEGA could match for sheer volume. It brought gaming out of the niche basements of the stereotypical gamer and put it smack-bang on the covers of cool magazines. It changed everything.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/536276266-1321476293317591-6086579087571452701-n-1762817912289.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shots fired.

It looked sleek. It looked powerful. In a Kubrickian way, it whispered, <em>"I am a mysterious and untouchable creation that will change the world"</em>. In a very real sense, it did. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The PlayStation 2 Arrives</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With launch games like Ridge Racer V and Tekken Tag Tournament, it brought the PlayStation brand out of infancy and into the big leagues. Sony's much-vaunted "Emotion Engine" promised state-of-the-art graphical fidelity, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/03/ps2-demos-to-die-for">showcased in real-time tech demos</a> that exceeded prerendered cutscenes on the PS1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a breakthrough. Everyone wanted it – a DVD player! A gaming console! In one! And at the time, it was shockingly affordable for a device that could offer both. It propelled DVD sales, gave additional breathing room for developers moving towards larger games (and files). The controller even had analogue face buttons! Can you dig it, baby? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/04/ps2-launch-thousands-clamor-in-the-streets-for-playstation-2">The Japanese launch was an overwhelming success</a>, propelling international hype for the PS2 into the stratosphere.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/screenshot-2025-11-11-at-10-45-38-am-1762818359583.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Iconic and minimalist, the PlayStation 2's blue box proudly displayed on launch day in Akihabara.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN AU started up in 2006 – exactly 10 years after the debut of the PS1 (or PSX as everyone had taken to calling it). In those days, the PS3 had only just debuted in Japan to rapturouos response, thanks to the disruptive adoption of Blu-ray players (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/08/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd">going head-to-head against HD DVD, then cutting off HD DVD's head to become the dominant format of the 2010s)</a> and increasing uptake of 1080p displays. People wanted content to showcase their cool tech. Sony delivered the PS3: an all-in-one Blu-ray player, harddrive-equipped media device and, at the time, beastly gaming device.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS3: Running Up That Hill</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony, it must be said, made it a bit hard for itself around this time. The birth of the meme-era took on the PS3 press reveal, turning "Riiiiiiiidge Racer!", "Giant enemy crab" and "George Foreman grill" into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT920jOJUsY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet phenomenons</a>. That seemed to start a period of iffy consumer sentiment, in part aimed at the USD$499 and USD$599 launch pricing. The Australian launch was still off in the distance, over the horizon, but gamers were braced for a sting in the wallet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/15/au-ps3-first-impressions">first hands-on look at the PS3</a> as a fledgling Australian team of three fine folks: Bennett Ring, Cam Shea, and myself. Sony Australia rolled out a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/20/pause-australian-playstation-event">series of consumer and media events</a> in which to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/27/au-sony-experience-more-event-coverage">showcase its polished ovoid tower</a> and we walked away mostly impressed by the potential of the system. IGN's US team were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/22/ps3-2006-year-in-review">on hand to cover the year's launch titles</a> too. Resistance: Fall of Man was the media darling of the time and, to this day, remembered very fondly. However, it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/09/world-war-iii-ign-aus-next-gen-console-showdown">some teething pains and needed to grow into itself</a>.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/screenshot-2025-11-11-at-4-40-52-pm-1762839656871.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ex-IGN Big Boss Bennett Ring swerves into the Motorstorm turns, while Cam stands there, looking tall.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few years, and a few price cuts and redesigns, the PS3 finally found momentum and delivered on its ambitions. We have the PS3 to thank for Naughty Dog's Uncharted series – a game that, for many, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/13/uncharted-drakes-fortune-review">came out of the mists and made the console a must-buy</a>. By Uncharted 2, it was clear that Nathan Drake was a star for the ages, and Naughty Dog was just getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without doubt, the system's<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/05/the-last-of-us-review"> pinnacle achievement was The Last of Us</a>. It was a technical showcase for the ageing hardware and a cinematic and gameplay line in the sand for developers. At risk of turning this into a love letter to Naughty Dog, Sony truly understood that this studio propelled its hardware forward – and gamers responded to it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time, Sony also went on a Wii-inspired foray into motion-based gaming with the PlayStation Move controller and camera. It was successful enough to spawn a whole series of Move-enabled titles. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">PlayStation <em>Phwoar</em>!</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A whopping 12 whole years ago, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/20/playstation-4-revealed">the PlayStation 4 was revealed in fine fashion</a>. Cam and Luke waxed lyrical about it in the video above. It seemed then, as it does now, a return to form for Sony's PlayStation brand. It came out of the gates strong and player focussed. The "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkMdi3XBhw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For the Players</a>" campaign underscored a renewed focus on the core player experience. Wisely so, particularly with Nintendo's Switch just around the corner and an industry that was never bigger and more flush with great games and hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there were new experiences to be had – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/14/a-closer-look-at-the-playstation-4-controller-prototype">and a new controller design</a> (the first major rethink of the iconic PlayStation controller in the system's history) was coming. Naughty Dog released another breakthrough title, The Last of Us 2. The power of the PS4 also enabled Sony to experiment with another emerging field: VR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, the PSVR headset. For the time and not <em>un</em>substantial money, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review">PSVR offered impressive VR fidelity combined with great games</a> and IPs that other competing hardware could only look on enviously. When juiced up with the PS4 Pro (a new mid-generation hardware refresh), it improved performance even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While VR may have had its moment in the sun, and it now feels like the technology is mostly hibernating until the next big thing comes along, it pointed towards more TV-free gaming experiences that have become more and more normalised.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS5 and Beyond</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-5/PlayStation_5_Release_Date,_Pricing,_and_Launch_Games">Enter: The PS5</a>. PlayStation 5 – the current generation of Sony consoles, in standard and Pro models. By 2020, digital marketplaces were standard and the TV screen was just one way of interacting with your PlayStation. The PS5 ushered in PSVR 2, a souped up version of the PSVR we know and love. Plus, it brought to the table a Switch-like (but not quite) handheld solution: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">The PlayStation Portal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've noticed, we haven't discussed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-psp-games">Sony's PSP</a> (in gloriously piano black, a luxurious widescreen handheld in 2004) or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/13/sony-playstation-vita-review">PS Vita</a> – pseudo PS3 in your pocket. But all of those handheld experiences seem to have been teasing where Sony (and Nintendo, for that matter) are heading. Already rumours are swirling about the <em>PlayStation 6</em> and oh boy do I feel old now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So here's to you, Sony PlayStation. You are 30 years young in Australia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a very different world and games industry today than the one that I and many others remember from the turn of the millenium. However, the PlayStation has been an island of stability, joy, and adventure throughout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will we all be playing our PS10s in 2055? Jacked straight into our neural cortex like a back alley goon from Neuromancer? Will TVs still exist? What about game stores? One thing is true: PlayStation fans will always adore this brand – so in a sense, the future is up to you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/special/playstation-30th-birthday-giveaway-au?">Aussies: Win a PlayStation®5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Bundle!</a></h3></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-au-retrospective-playstation-turns-30-in-australia]]></content:encoded>
