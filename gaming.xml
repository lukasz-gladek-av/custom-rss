              <p>Avast is one of the true giants in cybersecurity today, trusted by over 435 million users worldwide. As a core part of Gen Digital (which also owns Norton, AVG and Ccleaner), the company has long been synonymous with free antivirus software. However, in the face of increasingly aggressive and sophisticated cyber threats, Avast has evolved: The days of relying on freeware antivirus are numbered; Avast is now leading the way with robust pay-for security solutions that are <strong>designed to guard all devices and every corner of a user’s online life</strong>.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity landscape in 2025 is overwhelming. Microsoft and Identity Theft Resource Center data show that more than 600 million cyberattacks took place globally per day throughout last year. Nearly two billion people had data exposed in breaches. The bad guys aren’t even just going after big business: the primary targets are regular folk, with cyber thieves going far beyond mere viruses to steal identities, bank account data, and more using sophisticated malware and fraud.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Identity</h2>
<p>With insight into the reality of rising threats, Avast has grown beyond mere status as the free antivirus pioneer to an all-out defender of PCs, Macs, Androids, and iOS devices through advanced protection that keeps up with the cybercrime tools of the modern age. Paid subscriptions include a smarter and more comprehensive solution, way beyond yesteryear malware scanning.</p>
<p>A premium choice is <strong>Avast Premium Security</strong>. At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">a massive 60% discount dropping the first year down to a mere $31 (previous price being $78)</a>, it’s an affordable option that secures one device with premium features. Members are provided with virus, ransomware and phishing protection. It scans Wi-Fi networks to detect vulnerabilities and ensures your digital life remains unscratched by bandits looking to exploit your system. Regardless if you’re a PC, Mac, Android, or Apple user, this offer gives you the essential and robust security.</p>

<p>Add more, and <strong>Avast Ultimate</strong> has it all from Premium Security with extras such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/avast-vpn-vs-nordvpn">the Avast SecureLine VPN</a>, which encrypts your internet connection to shield your surfing and keep it private. For $43 after a discount of 60% compared to $109, you get Cleanup Premium as well which maintains your devices in smoother operation by clearing out garbage and streamlining their performance. AntiTrack technology silently in the background prevents trackers and conceals your online identity from snoopers’ view, an essential privacy feature in today’s data-driven world.</p>
<p>In a world where hacks and scams get increasingly formidable by the minute and the consequences of compromised data pile up,<strong> Avast’s premium security subscriptions are basic insurance</strong>. They give you so much more than traditional antivirus solutions: <strong>they safeguard your entire digital existence</strong> and provide you with the comfort of mind not just for yourself but for your family and devices as well.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/776873/henry-halfhead-review-pc-ps5-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/henry-halfhead-is-full-of-heart.1303311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In <em>Henry Halfhead</em>, you play through the life of a person named Henry. But there are a couple twists. Henry is only half of a head — just eyes, ears, nose, and the top of their head — meaning they move around by sliding on the floor and jumping up and down. Also, Henry can possess everyday objects. It’s a strange concept, but the developers at Lululu Entertainment use the goofy ideas to tell a poignant story and have a <em>lot</em> of fun along the way.</p><p>The game starts with Henry as a baby in their nursery, bouncing around the room to wreak havoc. As you play, you’ll progress to different rooms and age up through different stages of Henry’s life, and the ability to possess basically every object you can see lets you get into all sorts of trouble at every age. I particularly liked a sequence where I had to attempt to set candles on a birthday cake to celebrate my own third birthday. As a school-aged kid, I helped Henry make a mess in the classroom.</p><p>The objects are all placed in such a way to invite you to tinker with them and treat everything like a big virtual playroom. Despite my tendency to break plates or scatter items around haphazardly, I never ran into any way to “lose,” which really encouraged me to experiment with things and not worry about anything “bad” happening.</p><p>The bright graphics, goofy sounds (especially Henry’s “yips” when hopping from place to place), and an omniscient British narrator all added to the charming and inviting environment. If the controlled whimsy all sounds a little bit like <em>Katamari Damacy</em>, it’s a clear inspiration; at one point, I found a radio on a shelf that looks just <em>Katamari</em>’s iconic green protagonist, and one section of <em>Henry Halfhead</em> had Henry rolling around as a laundry-collecting ball.</p><p>As you might have guessed about a game chronicling somebody’s entire life, <em>Henry Halfhead</em> can get a little real. Without getting into the details, a good chunk of the game takes place during Henry’s soul-crushing adult job, and the final chapter of the game stars an elderly Henry. You can probably guess what happens before the credits roll.</p><p>But the broader message of the whole game is all about being creative, trying new things, and celebrating joy where you can. At the end of my two-hour playthrough, I was a little emotional that my journey with Henry was over, but I’m inspired to channel Henry’s silliness into my own life.</p><p><sup>Henry Halfhead<em> is available now on PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</em></sup></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/776873/henry-halfhead-review-pc-ps5-switch#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/776873/henry-halfhead-review-pc-ps5-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-amazon-ipad-alternative-has-no-weak-points-and-sells-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-2000627453</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-amazon-ipad-alternative-has-no-weak-points-and-sells-for-pennies-on-the-dollar.1303308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not everybody can afford $500 or $1,000 for an iPad or iPad Pro, but if seeking a decent everyday use alternative, <strong>Amazon’s Fire HD tablets</strong> are certainly well worth a look. They cover all the bases for general use and currently, Amazon is discounting the price by nearly 40% so the <strong>Fire HD 10</strong> is pretty much impossible to ignore: At a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/">price that has dropped to $89 from $140</a>, it’s a chance to enjoy a quality tablet without the usual premium.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Tablet that Gets Big Features at a Budget Price</h2>
<p>The Fire HD 10 has <strong>prioritized speed and simplicity</strong> with 25% more performance than its previous generation through an octa-core processor and 3 GB of RAM. It means streaming, reading, browsing and gaming all happen without frustrating lags or delays. Its <strong>10.1-inch full HD screen is rich with clean 1080p images</strong> and brings colors and details in sharp brightness. Whether binge-watching your favorite <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/netflix">Netflix</a> shows or flying through work, the screen makes every frame count.</p>



<p>Battery life is a smart friend in this case as it <strong>lasts up to 13 hours of normal usage</strong>. Yes, extended trips or days without a plug will not leave you stranded. Storing-wise, <strong>there’s 32 GB as base</strong> (expandable with a microSD card up to 1 TB), a whole book collection of apps, videos, and books in your hands. The aluminosilicate reinforced glass toughens the screen and withstands drops better than most of the competition, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8.</p>
<p>The 5 MP front-facing camera is a welcome added feature for day-to-day video chats or social media content creation without needing to use special gear. And when inspiration strikes, the Fire HD 10 supports the Made for Amazon Stylus pen which recognizes over 4,000 levels of pressure for flowing, natural writing or drawing (bit it is sold separately).</p>
<p>If spending a big amount of money on an Apple tablet is not feasible but frequent use of a tablet is, this Fire HD 10 deal is difficult to pass up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors are a game changer when you need some extra screen space but can’t lug around a bulky setup. Picture this: a screen that’s just a bit wider and heavier than a regular notebook in your backpack, giving you plenty of room to work or unwind wherever you are. This <strong>Arzopa 16.1″ portable monitor fits right into that sweet spot</strong>. And the best part? Amazon is running an early Prime Day deal that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4204/">slashes the price to about $76 after a 30% coupon, down from around $110</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4204/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger Screen and Brighter Colors</h2>
<p>This Arzopa design has also bumped up the screen size from 15.6 inches (which is typical for so many portable monitors) to 16.1 inches. That extra inch of screen space makes more of a difference than you might think: i<strong>t gives you a more natural 16:9 ratio</strong> that is easier on the eyes and perfect for streaming your favorite shows.</p>
<p>Quality is not just a matter of size. The monitor uses an I<strong>PS panel with crisp 1080p full HD resolution</strong>. It also gains color accuracy with a comprehensive 100% sRGB gamut that renders images with rich, real-life colors. Thanks to a 1000:1 contrast ratio, dark areas are deep and detailed and the light areas glow, a wonderful option for anything from creative work to Netflix bingeing.</p>



<p><strong>At 1.7 pounds and 0.35 inches thin</strong>, this monitor is easily stashed away in bags. Its slivers of a bezel pack more screen into smaller space, and the <strong>fold-out kickstand</strong> so you don’t require any other hardware to prop it up.</p>
<p><strong>Both USB-C and mini HDMI connections</strong> let you plug it into laptops, phones, game systems, and more at a snap. There are a few display options like duplicate, extend, or as a second display, so you can configure your workflow or entertainment center without a single hassle. Plug and play is trouble-free as it plays right away out of the box.</p>
<p>If you’ve been craving a little more screen real estate, this early Prime Day deal is a perfect chance to grab one of the most premium portable monitor without a hefty price tag.</p>

            <p>Xbox consoles are about to become more expensive in the United States. Again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">The hike comes just months after Microsoft raised prices of its products in May</a>, when the Xbox Series S and X increased by between $80 and $130, depending on the spec. While May's cost hike was felt across the world, this time the increase is limited to the U.S., with Microsoft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">confirming</a>: "Pricing in countries outside the U.S. remains the same".</p>
<p>The prices for controllers, headsets, and products "in all other markets" also remain as they were.</p>

<p>Here's how the price changes impact the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/xboxconsoles?icid=XboxConsoles_Header_AllConsoles_CTA">Xbox console range in the U.S.</a> when they go live on 3rd October:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox Series S 512: $399.99 (up $20 from $379.99)</li>
<li>Xbox Series S 1TB: $449.99 (up $20 from $429.99)</li>
<li>Xbox Series X Digital: $599.99 (up $50 from $549.99)</li>
<li>Xbox Series X: $649.99 (up $50 from $599.99)</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition: $799.99 (up $70 from $729.99)</li>
</ul>
<p>"Beginning on 3rd October, we will update the recommended retailer pricing for Series S and Series X consoles in the United States due to changes in the macroeconomic environment," Microsoft explained.</p>
<p>"We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players."</p>
<p>Microsoft did not justify the price rise, but it's possible the current U.S. administration's import tariffs have had some bearing. That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off"> the company reported an 18 percent boost in profits at its last earnings call</a>, and a 13 percent increase across its Xbox business.</p><p>If recent reports are true, we likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">won't be seeing Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console until 2027</a> at the earliest. But that hasn't stopped the company from<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-its-working-on-next-gen-xbox-consoles-youll-play-in-your-living-room-and-in-your-hands"> teasing a couple of details</a> as it announced a partnership with AMD to co-engineer the hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable power stations are<strong> basically power banks amplified</strong> designed to charge all your devices and even serve as back-up power in case of a power outage. They’re really handy, surprisingly light and convenient to take with you wherever you go. Today, on the eve of Prime Day,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/"> Amazon has slashed the price on the Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2) to an all-time low of only $448, down from its normal $799</a> which is a fantastic deal for anyone looking for trustworthy portable power on the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Power Bank That Travels Everywhere</h2>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 is a portable powerhouse that can pack serious punch without weighing you down. Its 1,070Wh LiFePO4 battery life means you have enough juice to <strong>power multiple appliances like your AC unit, refrigerator, or electric stove</strong>, making it a camp lifesaver, road trip companion or emergency power outage rescuer. All that power and yet it <strong>only weighs 23.8 pounds</strong> and comes with a foldable handle so you can simply grab and leave whenever.</p>
<p>One of the things that is truly awesome is the <strong>1,500W continuous AC output and 3,000W surge power</strong> which makes it possible for it to start devices that need a pre-initial power boost and keep them running effectively. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver which allows you to charge the entire device from zero to full in as little as one hour when you’re using emergency charging through the Jackery App. Typically, <strong>the unit charges in approximately 1.7 hours</strong> to maintain battery health, trading speed for smart care with the advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology.</p>



<p>With <strong>two USB-C, one USB-A, a DC automobile port, and three true sine wave AC outlets</strong>, the Explorer 1000 can power an array of devices simultaneously (smartphones, laptops, cameras, and even small appliances). The 100W USB-C Power Delivery port assures rapid charging of compatible devices without requiring cumbersome power adapters, further enhancing the convenience in being able to go anywhere or respond to unforeseen power failures in your home.</p>
<p>If there was ever a time to take advantage of a portable power station that will never let you down, that time is now with this record-low price.</p>

<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158943/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>While not entirely dormant for the last 30 years, Yuzo Koshiro’s Ancient Corp — responsible for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/streets_of_rage_2">Streets of Rage II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/beyond_oasis">Story of Thor</a>, and the Master System’s superb <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> — is finally back in the public eye with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a>. What’s significant for the small studio is a return to the console that cemented it in the annals of gaming history.</p>
<p>Those who follow Koshiro on social media will know his love for the Mega Drive and its Motorola 68000 processor, and, as such, it is with great fanfare that Earthion has arrived to reignite Sega’s 16-bit powerhouse. Sort of. Intended for a physical release in the first instance, Ancient has instead decided to lead with modern formats to ensure the manufactured cartridge (ostensibly scheduled for 2026) is the best it can possibly be. This has already resulted in improved bullet visibility based on player feedback, and other tweaks via update.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158940/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For Nintendo Switch, then, Earthion works both beautifully in handheld (assuming you use anything other than the stock Joy-Con) and as a bigger, more arresting experience on the TV. Driven by precise emulation, Earthion is actually more the brainchild of Makoto Wada - a fact often drowned out by Koshiro’s celebrity status. Wada is the designer, programmer, planner, and overall director of the game, while Koshiro produces, adding in a blazing soundtrack and crunchy effects.</p>
<p>A clear labour of love, there are a lot of personal touches in Earthion, right down to the barrelled CRT and heavy shadow masking set as the startup screen filter. While pretty, this does make it a little tough for those new to the game to see everything that's going on. It's best, then, to go into the in-game menu and take advantage of one of the most granular and configurable scanline filters around, where you can change percentages by the digit for every aspect of the display.</p>
<p>What smacks you instantly is the game’s graphical bombast. Your craft, the YK-IIA (quite possibly representing someone’s initials), deployed by a mothership and blasting off on stage one, spins dynamically from the foreground to take its firing position amidst a booming space war of lasers and debris.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158937/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Koshiro's soundtrack ploughs you in, driving the action from one set-piece to the next in a game of near-constant variety. Giant mechs tear through space stations; lasers rip up through the floor of a technological, dinosaur-patrolled lost world; towering guardians rise from seething lava pits; and maddened alien monsters give chase through tight futuristic chicanes and sinewy, pulsating hives.</p>
<p>Bosses are profound — at one point stretching three-screens-tall — and come at you with smartly engineered attack patterns that only occasionally feel a touch haphazard. Moreover, the sheer number of regular enemy types is equally impressive, introducing small, medium, and large foes at breathless pace, ever-changing the game’s spots and continually keeping you on your toes. It’s hard to say if it can run so flicker and slowdown-free on real Mega Drive hardware, although beefed-up chipsets may do the job.</p>
<p>To help you deal with the barrage, the game employs multiple weapon options and a divisive regenerating shield system. Should you get pummelled too much when your shields are low and the warning is blaring, you’ll go up in flames; but, avoid damage for a brief period and that protective blue bar will work its way back to top-spec.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158936/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Earthion is engineered more around taking fire and surviving than absolute precision dodging — especially in its latter stages — and to some this may be irksome. But, with extended play, Earthion’s mechanics reveal themselves to work very well indeed, with the survival aspect nicely implemented around the increasingly dense flak. While at first it may seem complex, and you’re likely to go up in smoke early on, once you grasp the balancing it becomes both much easier and very encouraging to clear.</p>
<p>Wada’s ideas are unique and interesting. You start out with two shield bars, two weapon power bars, and two weapon slots. You can fill the swappable weapon slots with lasers, homing missiles, and twin-firing cannon pick-ups, amongst others, and, by grabbing green icons spilled from the destruction, you can keep those weapons chugging at their most powerful state.</p>
<p>Most important to the game’s strategy is the “Adaptation Pod” released at the tail-end of each stage. Grabbing this will occupy one weapon slot and has no in-play function, restricting you to a single actual weapon of choice to battle the boss. Should you manage to hold on to the Adaptation Pod (which is at risk of being destroyed should you take too much fire), it can then be spent at the mid-stage interval to upgrade your craft via a menu. Options here include adding additional shields, increasing max weapon power and slots, or even an extra life.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158944/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>How you choose to spend the Adaptation Pod is down to the player, although in reality there are better ways to apply them. From personal experience, whereby I managed to pin down two one-credit clears, the upgrades that seem most immediately beneficial (like extra lives) aren’t always best in the long-term.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Wada’s approach to Earthion is multi-functional. In a positive way, it feels markedly different from the genre norm, and lot of this is owed to how broad and unique the various weaponry is, and their distinct usefulness in certain sections. It's also designed to be friendlier to new audiences; not just through its several difficulty levels or mid-stage ship upgrades, but its password system - one that allows you to carry over boosted shields and weaponry to subsequent playthroughs. This is a nice, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/radiant_silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>-style augmentation that allows anyone the chance to complete the game through multiple attempts. For those who want to have at it traditionally, though, the password option can be comfortably ignored.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158939/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's worth noting, too, that the Switch version seems to have been toned down ever so slightly in its default difficulty. No doubt whatever changes have been made here have now also been patched through to the Steam version, resulting in a game that feels cleaner and easier to navigate than its initial release. It wasn't overly difficult to begin with, only sitting mid-range in terms of shoot-'em-up challenge, but some further fine-tuning has definitely occurred, removing certain popcorn enemies and refining some of the bullet spreads and speeds. Overall, it's now at its most enjoyable state.</p>
<p>Earthion is a game that may not click immediately. It looks and sounds fantastic, but its idiosyncrasies take a few runs to adjust to. To that end, it requires time to grow on you. Once it clicks, you'll find yourself engrossed in strategising a path to victory, and the wonderful risk-reward of the Adaptation Pod. It’s full of neat elements, including safe spots and techniques, where the more unlikely, less obvious weapons can prove advantageous in certain areas. There are multiple methods of approach for bosses, and there are several extra lives dotted about to keep you in play.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158945/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What it does brilliantly is in its constant inventiveness, requiring the learning of the smallest of enemies to the largest of bosses; and its final third is thoroughly climactic. It has a big-budget, arcade feel to it, and really nice introduction and ending sequences.</p>
<p>It is, however, imperfect overall, with Wada’s creative enterprising never quite hitting that absolute shoot-'em-up adrenaline high, that pocket of euphoria that comes from pure and perfect dodges, near misses, and glorious untouched victories. The bullets can still be difficult to spot in places, and will often tag you because of it, and the soundtrack — while top-notch by Mega Drive standards — doesn't excel beyond the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gleylancer">Gleylancer</a>, <strong>Thunder Force III</strong>, or the more recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/andro_dunos_2">Andro Dunos 2</a>.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Earthion is a terrific piece of work. It's more an accomplished production, arguably, than a shoot 'em up of incredible highs, but at the same time, that’s part of its charm. It has a different feel thanks to its shield system and mid-stage upgrade rungs, and this is a refreshing and welcome change from the norm. Much of the fun is in figuring out the order of bolstering your ship and the little tricks that various weaponry affords when faced with tricky junctures. It does some things other shoot 'em ups don’t do, and is all the more standout for it.</p>
<p>At the same time, it fails to achieve some things that other shoot 'em ups do so well. Nonetheless, Earthion is a treat of a game: a bold new Mega Drive work that sits in the upper echelons of the console's broad catalogue, and shouldn't be passed up by fans of the genre or wonderful 16-bit works.</p></section>

              <p>Having a Xbox but not enough controllers kind of kills the fun, especially when playing with friends and family. What makes the console truly cool is those multiplayer moments, and nothing beats sharing the game with extra controllers on hand. The catch? Controllers aren’t always the easiest or cheapest to grab. That’s why timing your buy is key, and right now there’s a Black Friday-level deal on Amazon that’s too good to miss: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">latest Xbox wireless gaming controller is available for $53, down from its original $64</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Contemporary Design Coupled with Comforting Play and Intelligent Features</h2>
<p>Its modernized design features sculpted surfaces and refined geometry that fit comfortably in your hands, and keeps you gaming longer without fatigue. The textured grip on the triggers, bumpers and back case is there to make sure your fingers stay steady and controlled. And the new hybrid D-pad adds precise directional control which is a big deal whether you’re navigating tricky menus or battling opponents.</p>
<p>The <strong>Share button is perhaps the best feature of them all since it lets you snap and share your gameplay</strong>—screenshots, video, whatever—without breaking stride. It’s a simple way to share with friends or easily record your best victories.</p>



<p>The controller supports Xbox Wireless and Bluetooth which makes it simple to connect to many devices. If you’re playing on your Xbox console, alternating to playing with your Windows computer, launching games on Android or iOS, or even attaching it with Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, or VR headsets, this controller lags behind none. With so much flexibility, you won’t need to keep multiple different controllers occupying valuable space.</p>
<p>And, to boot, players also have a lot of selection with sound: The <strong>3.5mm headset jack</strong> will work with any supported headset, so you can simply plug in and talk or be completely enveloped in the game’s sound. The <strong>USB-C port</strong> lets you plug directly into your Xbox or PC for plug-and-play installation which is perfect if you are enthusiastic about a wired connection or charging during gaming.</p>
<p>All things considered, snagging this controller at $53 is a smart move whether you’re replacing an older one or expanding your multiplayer setup.</p>

platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 will be available on the majority of current platforms: Xbox Series, PlayStation 4 and 5, Switch and Switch 2, and PC.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 story, setting, and characters</h2><p dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 is loosely based on the mobile game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent/">Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent.</a> It takes place on Orsterra, the same setting as CotC and the original Octopath Traveler. During the Day of Reverence ceremony in Wishvale, the city is attacked and razed to the ground, leaving your created character with the task of both rebuilding and seeking revenge on those responsible.</p><p dir="ltr">The reveal trailer introduces a few story characters: Stia, an Architect who is the player character's childhood friend; Phenn, a watchful Huntsman; and Laurana, a Cleric. Square Enix claims that there will be over 30 playable characters in total, and they will all have some unique abilities. Further character reveals include Celsus the thief, Alexia the Scholar, Ludo the Merchant, Viator the Warrior, and Macy the Apothecary. Antagonists that have been revealed so far include Herminia, the Covetous Witch; Tytos, the Hero; and Auguste, the Playwright.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0 gameplay</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 inherits much of the freeform exploration gameplay of previous titles. There's no set, linear route you'll be required to take from beginning to end, though certain areas may be easier than others depending on your party composition, skills, and equipment. You'll be able to interact with NPCs through various, character-specific Path Actions, such as Entreat (asking NPCs to give you items) and Inquire (pressing NPCs to give you more information). One of the new Path Actions we know is in the game is Invite, which allows you to attempt to bring an NPC to live in your town.</p><p dir="ltr">Enemy encounters occur randomly in certain areas, though there are some encounters that are visible on the map--including challenging elite-tier enemies that require some extra power and strategy to take down.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0 combat</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Like the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-review-divide-and-conquer/1900-6416941/">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-2-review-go-your-own-way/1900-6418036/">its sequel</a>, Octopath Traveler 0 features turn-based combat in which you aim to strategically target enemy weaknesses to break down their "shields." When their shields hit 0, they enter a weakened stun state, allowing you a prime opportunity for a big attack. You can also choose to use a Boost during a character's turn to enhance their skills' effectiveness. What makes OT0's combat different is that up to eight characters can join in, up from four in OT and OT2. The front-row characters are active in combat, while the back-row team provides various boosts. You can switch characters between rows in battle, as well, opening up new strategies. For more details on combat, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-looks-massive-even-by-octopath-standards/1100-6534403/">read our Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom preview. </a></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0's new features</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Some big new mechanics have been introduced in Octopath Traveler 0. One such new element is town-building, which you'll use to reconstruct Wishdale. In this mode, you'll use materials to place and build structures. As you play, you can recruit characters who will aid in rebuilding in various ways, such as staffing facilities. You can also upgrade these facilities through quests. For more details on town-building, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-looks-massive-even-by-octopath-standards/1100-6534403/">our Octopath Traveler 0 preview from Gamescom. </a></p><p dir="ltr">The other big feature is character creation and customization, which we detail below.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How character creation works in Octopath Traveler 0</strong></h2><p>Since all of its characters are drawn in 2D pixel art, character creation in Octopath Traveler 0 is a bit different from many of the 3D titles that offer the feature. You'll be able to select a base gender, small facial details (eye appearance and color), hairstyle and hair color, skin tone, victory/action poses, voice, and name. Going from the trailer, you'll also be able to choose a starting Learned Skill (likely similar to Hikari's mechanic in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-2-review-go-your-own-way/1900-6418036/">Octopath Traveler II</a>), starting job, a favorite food (which gives specific stat boosts), and starting gear.</p>

		<p>Dying Light: The Beast has to be the week’s biggest release, with zombie hunter Kyle Crane returning to parkour his way across an all-new open world, while bashing in the heads of the undead in a variety of grisly ways. While there have been a few reports of instabilities in the launch build, Techland have got right on it, and immediately dropped patch 1.2. Here’s what it fixes!</p>

</ul>
<p>The team at Techland also let us know that there are going to be even more improvements made to the game over this weekend, and as soon as we have the details for that, we’ll let you know.</p>
<p>Gamoc is currently working through our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/dying-light-the-beast-review/">Dying Light: The Beast Review</a>, but his early impressions have been very good. He says, “It’s a return to the classic tone and style of Dying Light. This feels more like the truer sequel to Dying Light I was expecting, one that’s focused on the zombies and being terrifying instead of everything being about how humans are bad – we get enough of that in the real world these days. Dying Light: The Beast is tough and brutal whilst the suns up, and after sunset it’s just tension and terror. I’m not finished yet, but The Beast is mostly the game I wanted it to be.”</p>

		<p>Microsoft is raising the price of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> consoles in the US, with increases of between $20 and $70 depending on the model coming into effect from 3rd October. With a $50 price increase for the main Xbox Series X, the console is set to be a staggering $150 more expensive than it was at launch in 2020.</p>
<p>The new prices are to be as follows:</p>


<ul>
<li>Xbox Series S 512GB – $399.99, up from $379.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series S 1TB – $449.99, up from $429.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X Digital – $599.99, up from $549.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X – $649.99, up from $599.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition –$799.99, up from $729.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing for headsets and controllers are remaining unchanged at this time, but all of these prices are being adjust upward from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/xbox-series-xs-console-prices-are-jumping-up-around-the-world-games-to-hit-80-this-winter/">price hikes made back in May</a>.</p>
<p>In t<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">he support page</a> detailing the changes, Microsoft blamed “changes in the macroeconomic environment.”</p>
<p>They continued, “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players.”</p>

<p>Thankfully the rest of the world is unaffected, and so it seems that the root cause of these particular price increases is the tariffs that have been implemented by the US administration. Given how wildly these have swung up and down at the whims of a capricious President – to put it mildly – and how exemptions have come in and out of effect, it’s taken around half a year for tariffs to have a directly felt effect.</p>
<p>The daft thing about all of this is that, while Microsoft relies on Chinese manufacturing and is passing the tariff prices onto its customers, it is an American company that is now at a serious price disadvantage when compared to both its main Japanese rival. Sony has had their own price increases in the last few years – also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">raising US console prices by $50 across the board in August</a> – but the standard PS5 with disc drive stands at $550, making it $100 cheaper than the Xbox Series X. Even more ridiculous is that the PS5 Pro is $749. That is $50 <em>less</em> than the 2TB Xbox Series X, but the PS5 Pro the better, more powerful console! I know the Xbox is a “special edition”, but come on.</p>

<figure><a title="Metroid Dread" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a9fba4d700ec/metroid-dread.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well hello there. Welcome. It's the weekend, and that means you're keen to see what we're going to be playing over the next couple of days while divulging your own plans. Before you do so, however, let's just recap the last handful of days.</p>
<p>First up, Nintendo announced that it would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-gba-library-with-two-more-titles">expanding its GBA app</a> with two new titles on NSO next week, so that's pretty cool. The company also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-showcases-every-switch-and-switch-2-direct-game-in-new-infographic">reiterated its recent Direct announcements</a> with the usual handy infographic. Lots of cool stuff coming out, y'all.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/it-was-a-bit-of-a-perplexing-experience-hideki-kamiya-on-the-fan-reaction-to-bayonetta-3">voiced his thoughts</a> around the reception to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>, ensuring to apply his learnings to the development of the <strong>Okami Sequel</strong>. Plus, we were treated to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2-gets-a-seven-minute-overview-trailer">pretty extensive overview trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on the Switch, and it's looking very tasty.</p>
<p>Finally, we provided our final thoughts on both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> DLC, so be sure to check those out if you're on the fence.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I am going to wrap myself up in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> on Switch 2 as much as I can. I'm on my own for the next few days, you see, so it's gonna be 24/7 rage-quitting online matches and looking up soccer rules in disbelief for me, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Oh, and I can't stop playing Silksong. But I don't imagine I'm particularly unique in that just now. Have a nice weekend, and should we cross paths on the FC 26 early access field of battle over the next 48hrs or thereabouts, well, honestly, I hope you get a proper stuffing, mate.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I could say "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> plus X and Y" as I have the past few weeks, but really it's just going to be Hollow Knight. I just found the double-jump and the downward-smash in quick succession, and I'm eager to crack on and make proper progress towards the endgame. <em>Newsflash!</em> It's good. It's not blowing my mind, but it feels great (man, I wish I had that Switch 2 Pro Controller, though!) and, more to the point, I'm still playing it after 20 hours. It's doing something right.</p>
<p>But yeah, I'm eager to finish. GOTY will be here before you know it.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm getting very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, folks. So I've gone back to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> one more time before Retro's latest drops in December. It's like comfort food for me, it's just too good.</p>
<p>I'd like to say I'm playing something else, but that's pretty much it! Truth be told, I'm eager to dive into <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> next week on PS5, so I'm holding off on playing anything too substantial in the meantime.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was a very lucky boy and got both <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> for my birthday this week, two short little games that I could probably breeze through in a weekend (hahaha… <strong><em>gulp</em></strong>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both have sat on the sideline since I pulled them from their brightly coloured wrapping paper because Silksong is eating up <em>all of my free time.</em></p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I’m in a post-Silksong slump. I’m actually fighting back the urge to do a second playthrough or a Steel Soul run right now. But no, I have to get ready for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>’s 1.0 launch, so naturally, it’s time to start afresh in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> and see how much recent muscle-memory will screw me over.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I still have a ton of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> games to check out, but I cannot put Magic Garden down. I’m so close to getting the cherry and all achievements on it, and it’s so fun and moreish. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>

<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This is a big weekend for me! After nearly a decade of saying “This is the year I’m going to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>” it’s finally happening. I’m currently hunting down the last few Chozo Artifacts (which have been a huge pain in the morphball to find) and thankfully <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/metroid-prime-remastered-all-artifact-locations">Ollie’s guide</a> here on Nintendo Life is keeping me sane!</p>
<p>I’ll probably wrap this up over the weekend, but there’s also the off chance that I play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> all weekend as you can now pilot the Power Rangers Megazord from now until October 3rd! I just unlocked the Green Ranger skin from the battle pass too! Young Zion is freaking out right now. I want to savour this moment for as long as I can, but honestly I wish these Fortnite events didn’t have an end date. Why can’t they run year round, as maybe a separate game mode?</p>

<p><em>Well, that's what we have planned for this most Mario of weekends, but what about you? Let us know your weekend picks in the following poll.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-film-original-story-leon-wont-be-there/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-film-will-be-an-original-story-and-leon-won%E2%80%99t-be-there-says-director.1303230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New details about the upcoming Resident Evil film are starting to pour in. Just a few days ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-bird-star-joins-zach-creggar-resident-evil-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that actor Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai, Black Bird, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, The Naked Gun) would join the cast. Now, movie director Zach Cregger (Barbarian, Weapons) <a href="https://ew.com/resident-evil-movie-entirely-original-story-set-game-world-zach-cregger-exclusive-11812968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has spoken with Entertainment Weekly</a> about the adaptation, revealing that it will be an entirely original story and, despite fan speculation, Leon Kennedy from the games won't be there.</p>



<p><em>It's an entirely original story. When you watch it, you'll be like, 'This is very Zach.' It's just it takes place in the Resident Evil world. I don't think fans of the games are gonna be bummed. I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous. But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna like tell a Resident Evil story in the Resident Evil canon that still leaves everything they love intact from the games, you know what I mean?</em></p>



<p><em>I think that when you see it, you'll understand how I can be obsessed with original ideas and still make a movie that is an IP-based thing. I know that doesn't make a lot of sense now, but I hope that it will later.</em></p>



<p>We only know the very basics of this original story based on the synopsis. Apparently, a 'hapless courier' is sent to deliver a package to a remote hospital and soon finds himself caught in the middle of an outbreak and must battle hordes of mutated creatures to survive. The courier is probably going to be played by Austin Abrams, who was the first actor to be confirmed for the Resident Evil movie. Abrams has been featured in This Is Us, Euphoria, Wolfs, and Weapons.</p>



<p>This will be the third film saga based on CAPCOM's survival horror IP. The first and most famous is the series of six movies directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, starring Milla Jovovich. In 2021, there was an attempted reboot with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city-director-says-the-most-challenging-part-was-living-up-to-zombie-movies-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</a>, which was more faithful than Anderson's movies to the games but still largely failed to captivate critics and fans. The following year, a way less faithful TV series adaptation was released on Netflix; it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-tv-series-canceled-by-netflix-after-one-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> after the first season.</p>



<p>Cregger's new Resident Evil film will debut in theaters on September 18, 2026. Meanwhile, a brand new game installment, Requiem, will be released on February 27, 2026. You can find our Gamescom 2025 hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6fe86fde20c08/sonic-racing-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is out next week on multiple platforms and the first lot of reviews have now gone live.</p>
<p>If you are curious to know how this new experience generally holds up, this round up should help. When we hear more about the Switch version, we'll let you know. The Switch 2 version is also scheduled to arrive at a later date and will be available as a paid upgrade for the existing Switch release.</p>
<p>So, here are the impressions of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/sonic-racingcrossworlds/">VGC - 4/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"CrossWorlds is a brilliant karting game with satisfying handling, a fun portal mechanic and useful customisation options. Its weapons aren't as punchy as we'd like and it's unclear how it's going to keep players' attention long-term but it's a genuine, more traditional alternative to Mario Kart now that Nintendo's pointed its series in new direction."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ywsovl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/">GamesRadar+ - 4/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a slick, ambitious racer with loads of tracks, primed and ready for future, licensed crossovers. At first too slow and then suddenly extremely fast, the racing lacks finesse, but it gets better as you play. A strong offering that's compulsively playable, but a bit grindy in single-player and not quite S-tier on the track."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">IGN - 9/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review-an-arcade-kart-racer-for-gearheads/1900-6418408/">GameSpot - 7/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Altogether, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a solid package. The single-player modes, meta-goals like collecting gear and vehicle parts, and wealth of customization options to experiment with different play styles, make it easy to recommend for players who like their kart racing with a little more mechanical complexity. Even with slightly underwhelming online offerings, it's easy to see how Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has plenty of road ahead of it."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/a-new-dimension-of-kart-racing">Game Informer - 8.5/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds offers some exciting twists on the tried-and-true kart-racing formula, making for a streamlined experience that wastes no time getting you into the action. Though there’s substantially less content and replayability than its primary contemporary, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is concise and effective in its mission, offering the most well-rounded kart racer of the year."</p>

<p>A free DLC is "coming soon"</p>

<figure><a title="Rune Factory Story of Seasons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59cdc253d16c1/rune-factory-story-of-seasons.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> got off to a solid start, with Marvelous revealing the RPG spin-off had already shipped more than 500,000 copies as of August.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, a special collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> has been announced. This will be a free DLC and is "coming soon", so expect "more details" soon.</p>

<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar was released on the Switch and Switch 2 in August, and we called it the farming series' best remake yet. Guardians of Azuma arrived on both of these platforms in June and we thought the experience was "near-perfect" on the new Nintendo system.</p>
<p>You can learn more about both of these titles in our reviews here on Nintendo Life:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ywsovl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

He’s dabbled in other popular multiplayer titles like Call of Duty and Marvel Rivals but is undeniably best known for his relationship with Epic Games’ battle royale hit, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. Ninja’s time with the building-centered shooter saw him become <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/03/ninja-becomes-first-twitch-streamer-to-reach-10-million-followers"><u>the first Twitch streamer to reach 10 million followers</u></a>, and he even appeared in-game as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-gets-a-ninja-skin-based-on-the-streamer"><u>a skin for fans to pick up and wear during matches</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/19/ninja-1758310446525.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ninja.

Of course, that isn’t stopping naysayers from finding their way into his chat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So that's something that the internet and trolls remind me of every day,” Ninja added. “The moderators are constantly banning and blocking.

dir="ltr">Death Rally (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Max Payne (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Quantum Break (Steam)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">While the full $27 bundle offers the best value since it's the only tier that includes Alan Wake 2, there are two lower-priced tiers, too. The cheapest tier is just $5 and includes the arcade racer <strong>Death Rally,</strong> the gritty noir third-person shooters <strong>Max Payne</strong> and <strong>Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</strong>, and <strong>Alan Wake: American Nightmare</strong>, which is a standalone expansion to the first Alan Wake game. This tier is great if you want to check out the studio's earliest works. Death Rally is an interesting one to look back on, since it differs so much from the action and survival horror games the studio is now known for. However, the real standout of this tier are Max Payne and Max Payne 2. Both helped define the third-person shooter genre of their time, and they offer a strange, surreal story that is absolutely worth a visit. The first will be quite clunky by modern standards, but Max Payne 2 holds up pretty well thanks to its more refined storytelling.</p><p dir="ltr">If you step up to the $12 tier, you'll also get <strong>Alan Wake Collector's Edition</strong>, <strong>Alan Wake Remastered</strong>, <strong>Quantum Break</strong>, and <strong>Control Ultimate Edition</strong>. At the time, the original Alan Wake was another fascinating genre departure, as Remedy blended influences like Stephen King and Twin Peaks into a unique survival horror thriller. And this tier comes with both the original game and the great remaster. That said, Control is probably the standout of this tier. It stands as one of the best action games of the last several years, combining the studio's penchant for supernatural sci-fi and third-person action-adventure with a giant metroidvania-style map to explore. It's also where Remedy really turned up the dial on its universe-building and weird fiction aesthetics. Quantum Break is also worth a look, as its mix of live-action storytelling and gameplay levels is an early example of ideas the studio would later iterate on with Control and Alan Wake 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4571464-remedy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571464" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4571464-remedy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571464"></a><figcaption>Humble Remedy 30th Anniversary Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4571464-remedy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even though it's more than double the price of the middle tier, the full $27 bundle offers the best value. You're effectively getting <strong>Alan Wake 2's Deluxe Edition for $15</strong>. It's worth emphasizing that Alan Wake 2 isn't available on Steam, so this is the only game in the bundle that activates via the Epic Games Store. The Deluxe Edition includes the base game, the Night Springs and Lake House story expansions, and a additional DLC like costumes for Alan and Saga. </p><p dir="ltr">Alan Wake 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-miracle-illuminated/1900-6418143/" data-ref-id="1900-6418143">one of the rare games we've awarded a 10/10</a>, with GameSpot reviewer Mark Delaney saying "The mere existence of an Alan Wake 2 would have, at different points over the years, felt like a minor miracle, but for it to be this one, that feels singular in its achievements, and coming from a studio that refuses to shy away from the paths less traveled, makes Alan Wake 2 a miracle."</p><p dir="ltr">Console players who don't yet own Alan Wake 2 can get the physical Deluxe Edition for PS5 or Xbox Series X for $50 (was $60) at Amazon. The console version includes all of the DLC plus a voucher to claim a digital copy of Alan Wake Remastered.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for even more Remedy goodness, you should check out the novelizations of both Alan Wake and Quantum Break, both available on Amazon. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alan-Wake-Rick-Burroughs/dp/0765328437" rel="nofollow ">book version of Alan Wake</a> draws the story together in a way that flows a little more clearly and concretely than the game--you can't miss picking up hidden manuscript pages when you're reading a book. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765391600" rel="nofollow ">Quantum Break: Zero State</a> is more adaptation than novelization, since it doesn't include that game's player-driven choices, and provides a different angle on the game's events and its smart approach to time travel. illuminated."</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-mario-kart-deals-available-at-amazon/1100-6534885/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle In Stock At Amazon With Same-Day Delivery</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-deals-amiibo-figures-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-street-fighter-6/1100-6534260/">Save On All Four Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Switch 2 Amiibo At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-batman-movie-and-tv-series-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-deals/1100-6533035/">Batman Movie And TV Box Sets Are Cheaper Than Prime Day Prices At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 And Samus Amiibo Preorders Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-games-amiibo-accessory-preorders-new-releases-2025-at-amazon/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Direct Switch 2 Preorders At Amazon - All New Games And Amiibo</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rosalinas-storybook-super-mario-galaxy-dark-horse-nintendo-book-amazon-preorder/1100-6534724/">Rosalina's Storybook From Super Mario Galaxy Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-legends-z-a-preorder/1100-6533331/">Nintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Console Bundle Is Finally Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-joyful-dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controller-2025-preorder-guide/1100-6534678/">Astro Bot Joyful DualSense Limited Edition Controller Preorders Are Live</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Just when you thought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> already had too many battle royale modes, Epic Games goes and drops another one. The new mode, dubbed Delulu, is completely unlike any of the other battle royale variations because it does two things the others don't: It has proximity voice chat, and encourages teaming mid-game with other players not in your group. But it's also a mode where only one person comes out as the winner. Katniss and Peeta's trick with the berries will <em>not</em> work here.</p><p dir="ltr">Delulu has been a blast so far, and matches feel vaguely like Epic mashed up its normal BR with its Party Royale mode--it's a battle royale about socializing. You can use an emote specific to Delulu to join and exit other players' parties on the fly. And since teaming is allowed in this mode, nothing prevents you from collaborating with even more players after you hit the max number for a party.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the social aspect is so crucial to the purpose of this mode, you're required to have a mic, and have the in-game voice chat on and set to Everybody before you can even queue up for it. You can join a round with your friends, but everyone drops in alone, and you'll eventually have to put them down if you want to win.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4571459-fortnitedelulu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571459" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4571459-fortnitedelulu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571459"></a><figcaption>Delulu is Fortnite's latest attempt to innovate with a new battle royale mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4571459-fortnitedelulu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Right now, Delulu is live on the weekend only, which means it will be available from Friday morning until Monday morning--and it's slated to return next Friday for the same span of time, too. And while it's delightful, there's a bit of a learning curve since there are some nuances to it that Fortnite itself will not explain to you, so we figured we'd take a moment to highlight three important things you should know as you drop into Fortnite Delulu.</p><h2 dir="ltr">There are no reboots in Delulu, but any play can resurrect any knocked player</h2><p dir="ltr">No matter how you play it, Delulu is a solo mode that ends each round with just one winner. So when you're dead, the round is over for you. There will be no rebooting you. <em>However</em>, Delulu players are always knocked before they die, and any other player can res you regardless of which team they're on or if they're even in a squad at all. It's possible your foes will have mercy. It's not unheard of.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The proximity chat effect applies to your squad, too</h2><p dir="ltr">Nothing about the voice chat changes when you join a squad--you'll still only be able to talk to each other when you're in range of the proximity chat, unlike the way squad comms work in normal BR modes. You'll want to keep that in mind when you find that your three teammates are all hanging out together out of your earshot--they might be planning to betray you.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Playing as a Delulu non-hostile actually works</h2><p dir="ltr">While there are people who play Delulu the same way they would any other battle royale mode, most folks seem pretty willing to engage with the social aspect and just hang out. I've had games already where we had more than a dozen players roaming the countryside until the endgame forced us to turn on each other.</p><p dir="ltr">And, yes, I've had more than a few rounds that ended very abruptly after a group of sociopathic teens pretended to be chill, only to shoot me in the face when I let them get close, but I've had very few early deaths despite taking a pacifistic approach whenever I could. The whole thing is a lot less anxiety-inducing than I expected.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Don't try to win in Delulu</h2><p dir="ltr">While I understand that being the last person standing <em>is</em> the stated purpose of Delulu, this particular BR mode is best experienced with a "let's see how this plays out" sort of view on things. It's a rare situation where you can truly say that it's more about the journey than the destination, and that's because rounds of Delulu often play out in weird and unpredictable ways. In this mode, the most fun usually occurs from doing things completely differently than you would in the other battle royale modes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Lily James stars in this thin but shiny look at dating app pioneer Whitney Wolfe Herd.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Swiped is now available to stream on Hulu in the United States.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an installment in her filmography, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/swiped">Swiped</a> represents a major leap forward for director Rachel Lee Goldenberg. Coming up from direct-to-video entries for The Asylum and made-for-TV Lifetime movies, Goldenberg launched two more prominent features in 2020 with Valley Girl and Unpregnant, only for their rollouts to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Five years later, she now has Disney money to spend (although under the 20th Century Studios name) with Swiped, certainly her most high profile project yet, garnering a Toronto Film Festival premiere before launching on Hulu and Disney+ worldwide. However, the end result is a decent film that could have been stronger if it were willing to take as many risks as its subject.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Swiped Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Swiped tells the story of Whitney Wolfe (she took the name Herd after marrying Michael Herd in 2017), famous for her integral role in Tinder’s rise and also for being the founder and CEO of Bumble. As a key player in the creation of two of the biggest dating apps in existence, it’s not unfair to say that Wolfe has had an astronomical impact on worldwide culture, especially with a younger generation who have had their entire dating life filtered through the presence of such apps. Yet you might not get the full sense of that impact by watching Swiped, which focuses more on the micro consequences in regards to Wolfe’s personal history with the companies, in particular her sexual harassment suit against her former colleagues at Tinder and her subsequent reemergence as the head of Bumble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dramatic arc of Wolfe’s rise, downfall and eventual return to prominence certainly makes for an easy enough three act structure, but it also makes Swiped into a movie too basic to do its subject justice. It’s an interesting story on its own merits, and certainly reflects the toxic and misogynistic tendencies of technology company culture. Yet if Wolfe is made undoubtedly sympathetic because of the way her cohorts treat her as she fights to make a name for herself in a male-dominated workspace, the movie never turns enough of a critical eye on Wolfe herself to make her three-dimensional. Swiped’s Whitney Wolfe is a relatable figure because of her struggles, but she never becomes a rounded figure because of her choices.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Swiped is a movie too basic to do its subject justice.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not for lack of trying on the acting front, though. Lily James, of Cinderella and Baby Driver fame, has been an underappreciated actor for years, and turns in a performance that’s better than the script deserves. James’ most compelling attribute, present both on screen and stage (shout-out to her excellent work as Eve Harrington in Ivo van Hove’s 2019 production of All About Eve), is her ability to stealthily take over a scene with small gestures that eventually coalesce into a bigger moment later on. That ability to disarm the audience to produce pathos is what makes her so charming to watch, yet the depth she tries to add to her take on Wolfe isn’t always backed up by the writing. We understand by watching her why she’s good at persuading people to try her products, but charm can only take a character so far when there are reasons to treat her with skepticism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This becomes a problem when the movie feels obligated to give Wolfe a “dark night of the soul” beat that isn't earned. Although one of Goldenberg’s best directorial touches is how she assembles a frantic montage of Wolfe’s life falling apart through her phone as she becomes the internet’s punching bag of the moment after the sexual harassment suit, this is followed up with Wolfe meeting with former work friend Tisha (Myha’la), who tells her that Wolfe didn’t do enough to help the other women in the office after she earned her co-founder status. James’ furious response to this (and the inherent racial dynamic of a white woman snapping at a Black woman who’s trying to hold her accountable for her actions) is one of the movie’s best moments because it feels emotionally honest about Wolfe’s failings while not taking away from the very real abuse that Wolfe suffered.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/19/lily-james-swiped-1758318606885.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lily James stars as Whitney Wolfe in Swiped.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But instead of unraveling this thread for more substance, Wolfe and Tisha reconcile in their next encounter after a hasty apology, and Wolfe is restored to her “forward-minded feminist tech leader” status with nary a further mention of any wrongdoing. That the movie then mostly skips over the actual development of Bumble, going from shoebox operation to 35 million-user app in basically one scene transition, only makes this issue worse. This was the era where Wolfe developed the foundation of her personal fortune, which would make her a billionaire by the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/02/11/bumble-founder-whitney-wolfe-herds-fortune-rockets-past-1-billion-as-dating-app-goes-public/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>age of 31</u></a>. Nobody amasses that kind of money without making serious compromises along the way, but the movie presents Wolfe’s ascension as an easy enough matter because, well, a woman did it this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The movie also never grapples with the fact that Wolfe’s impact on the world at large could arguably be considered a net negative. Sure, many couples have connected through dating apps, but said apps have also heavily commodified the very concept of meeting potential romantic partners, turning judging others based on a few seconds of visual impression into a gamified and monetized nightmare for many hapless users. Wolfe had a direct hand in creating this state of affairs, but Swiped never considers that worth examining. It’s a shame, because a better movie would have trusted its audience to make their own judgments of Wolfe based on a fuller account of her actions, instead of prescribing how it wants its viewers to feel.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Swiped is constructed well-enough for the movie it’s trying to be, but its lack of ambition and nuance keep it from being its best self. It can still be a worthwhile enough watch for Lily James’ admirable performance as Whitney Wolfe, but the movie never affords its subject the same level of depth as what James tries to imbue her with.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Swiped Review</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>Swiped is a decent biopic on a craft level, but it never reaches its full potential beyond a strong lead performance from Lily James.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/swiped-movie-review-lily-james-whitney-wolfe-herd]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As avid puzzlers know full well, the humble jigsaw puzzle is a thing of beauty in multiple ways. Not only are jigsaws an absorbing time sink, but multiple <a href="https://blogs.bcm.edu/2020/10/29/a-perfect-match-the-health-benefits-of-jigsaw-puzzles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies have demonstrated</a> they are good for you both mentally and physically. As you fit the pieces into place, they can be enjoyed alone or as a communal activity, and remain to be a fun hobby for all ages. Plus, when you’re finished, you’re often left with a delightful piece of art and sense of accomplishment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only downside to puzzles is they can take up a surprising amount of space, especially puzzles with 1000+ pieces. If you get into working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">bigger puzzles</a>, they can eat up your dining room table, coffee table or desk space for long stretches of time. This is why many jigsaw fans have a dedicated puzzle-solving table or board these days, often equipped with useful accessories. You have foldable and portable options, multi-purpose tables (for playing cards and the like), and ones with drawers to organize the pieces as you go. No matter what you're looking for or what your budget is, we've found some viable options for you below.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">TL;DR: These Are the Best Puzzle Tables and Boards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve got the puzzle bug or simply want an easier setup for regular puzzling, below are our top puzzle table and board picks right now to solve your space and storage problems, no matter your budget. Each of our picks represent a different category of table or board to fit different jigsaw puzzle needs. There are a lot of different options to choose from within these categories, so we've narrowed it down to one entry for each that we think fits the category best.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="bits-and-pieces">1. Bits and Pieces Fold and Go Table</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for portability</h3><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214828"><div id="214828" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bits and Pieces Fold-and-Go Wooden Jigsaw Puzzle Table</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a href="https://www.bitsandpieces.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorALjfg68C2gxeRGsics57Sap_amx4sJCjMnSZ1WATiMrbMDrth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bits and Pieces</a> puzzle table has it all in one convenient package that can be easily moved around. It stores completely flat but extends into a good-sized table with fold-out legs and a felt covering to make it easy to pick up and push in pieces. The side arms can be used to arrange pieces you have yet to fit into the main puzzle, giving you plenty of room to work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because it stores flat, it also functions as a puzzle protector, allowing you to fold the flaps inward to cover your work in progress. It can then be slid conveniently under furniture until you’re ready to dive in again. And if you like puzzling on the go, this table’s lightweight and has a carry handle. As a bonus, this table is multi-purpose for card games, reading, writing and the like. It's a great portable puzzle table that is built to handle up to 1500 piece jigsaw puzzles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="vociprooter">2. Vociprooter Puzzle Board</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for laps</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214829"><div id="214829" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vociprooter Jigsaw Puzzle Board</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some puzzlers prefer the comfort of working from their laps on a favorite chair or sofa, but that can be almost impossible with larger puzzles. To solve this problem, consider one of these handy puzzle folders which offer a hard surface you can spread out and balance on your knees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wings offer trays to put puzzle pieces on while you’re still working. When you want to finish a session, you can move the trays into the center and zip the wings closed to seal the puzzle. It can then be tucked away out of sight until you’re ready to carry on. This handy design comes in a variety of sizes to suit your puzzling preferences.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Jigitz Puzzle Spinner</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for collaborative puzzling</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214830"><div id="214830" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jigitz Jigsaw Puzzle Spinner</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Great for puzzles and board games.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a lazy susan for your jigsaw puzzle is such a great idea it’s surprising more companies haven’t put one on the market. If you’re puzzling with friends it’s much more convenient to reach the piece you’re working on. If you’re puzzling alone, it lets you easily access every side of the puzzle without having to leave your spot, as well as try different angles to see if a new perspective sparks a new idea for a match between possible pieces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular Jigitz spinning table topper comes with a felt backing for convenience, a hardwood rim, and can hold puzzles up to 34” x 34” (which should cover most 1000 piece puzzles). And if you’re into jigsaws of different shapes, there’s a <a href="https://zdcs.link/YBpGr?object_uuid=1d7bfb97-f8ca-443f-8546-51315d70dbc9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">circular option</a> from the same manufacturer, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to puzzle use, this spinning board is also excellent for playing board games like Scrabble where rotating the board is quite useful. Though a dedicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-table">board game table</a> is still worthwhile if you are looking to mostly use it for that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Jumbl 1000-Piece Puzzle Board Rack</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for storing pieces</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214831"><div id="214831" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jumbl 1000-Piece Puzzle Table</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Great for puzzle organization.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s another full puzzle table with fold-out legs for your consideration. From Jumbl, this table’s a little bulkier than some others on this list, but that’s because it comes with a hidden benefit: slide-out drawers to store your puzzle pieces. Anything you're currently clueless about can be hidden away until you’re ready, as can part-finished sections that aren’t quite ready to join the main puzzle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The table is thoughtfully designed in a number of other respects, from the attractive varnished finish to the two-sided rail that gives you clear access from different angles while keeping the puzzle in place. And if you don’t need it freestanding, it’s thin enough to sit conveniently on a tabletop or other surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular puzzle table is only meant to handle up to 1000-piece puzzles, but with the addition of the drawers, it should be able to scale up to 1500 pieces or more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="playvibe">5. Playvibe Puzzle Board</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best table topper</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214832"><div id="214832" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayVibe Puzzle Locker</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Works great for puzzles up to 1500 pieces.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our previous recommendation will sit atop a table, but it’s a little bulky should that be your primary mode of play. This one, from Playvibe, is a dedicated, slimline table-topper with felt feet to grip surfaces and six handy drawers to help store and organize your pieces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fully enclosed edging helps keep your puzzle secure, and the board comes with an acetate cover that fits between the rails to protect half-finished segments when not in use. It’s also made of lightweight wood, so it’s sturdy but still easy to move around from surface to surface as it suits you. </p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="all4jig">6. All4Jig Tilting Puzzle Table</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best dedicated tilting table</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214833"><div id="214833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All4Jig 1500 Piece Adjustable Puzzle Board</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>You can adjust the angle and height.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Regular puzzle players will be familiar with the postural problems that can arise from being bent over a surface for a long stretch. If that’s a problem for you, then the answer might be a tilting table like this one from <a href="https://all4jig.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALL4JIG</a> that leans toward you from different angles, allowing you to sit back and relax in a comfy seat while enjoying your puzzle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The board has a thick lower lip designed to keep a separate puzzling board in place, but you can play directly on the table’s surface if desired. It’s on wheels, so you can maneuver it into position around your seat, and it comes in a neat wood laminate finish.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="becko">7. Becko Angle Puzzle Board</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best table topper that tilts</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214834"><div id="214834" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Best Tilting Table Topper</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Becko Adjustable Puzzle Board</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes two adjustable amgles.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A table that tilts toward you as you play is obviously useful, but some players don’t want a whole table to do that, only a stand-alone board. This table from <a href="https://www.ibecko.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becko</a> offers that convenience in a particularly solid and useful package with a natural pine wood frame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been thoughtfully designed, with a flannelette (like flannel, but not quite) surface to grip and sort your pieces, while the supplied bracket gives you a choice of angles and can actually be used with other boards. So it’s super useful if you’ve got more than one puzzle on the go at once.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Puzzle Board FAQs</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Puzzle Mats vs Puzzle Boards: Which is better?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Puzzle boards and puzzle mats are both tools avid puzzlers can use to organize their workspace and keep track of pieces. If you're looking to buy either as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">gift for the puzzler in your life</a>, there are a few things to consider/</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boards are more expensive but offer more features, like pullout trays and other storage options, that help puzzlers organize their projects. The main benefit of a puzzle board is stability, as these boards are typically made from wood and offer a sturdy, flat surface. While they may take up more space, an in-progress or completed puzzle can still be safely moved between locations on a wooden puzzle board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puzzle mats are a cheaper and more lightweight alternative to puzzle boards. Mats, usually made with felt, can be rolled up and stowed away. Putting away a mat may be easier than finding a space for a full-blown board, but these mats are also flimsier. Pieces may not stay together as firmly on a softer surface, and there are no additional storage features to keep track of them. While mats help puzzlers establish a clear workspace, they require an existing flat surface for stability. </p></div><div catalogid="c533fd11-45af-41af-83ff-0a1bd409483c" id="214947"><div id="214947" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Becko Puzzle Mat</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">What is the best size for a puzzle board?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When researching puzzle boards, consider the amount of space available to you as well as the size of puzzles you like to put together. Many boards indicate what size puzzles they work best for, and some even have dimensions for different puzzles drawn out on their surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most puzzle boards range from about 27 to 35 inches in length. A 30" x 22" puzzle board can comfortably fit most 1000 piece puzzles, though daring puzzlers who tackle more than 1500 or 2000 pieces at a time may need a board closer to 35 inches long. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You may need to pick a specific space in your home to dedicate to a puzzle board. Alternatively, you may look into puzzle mats or foldable puzzle tables that can be stored when not in use. All in all, the ideal size for a puzzle board is what will support your favorite puzzles without dominating your space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For more, check out the </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults"><strong>10 best puzzles</strong></a><strong> for adults right now and the </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">b<strong>est jigsaw puzzle brands</strong></a><strong> for all ages!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sucker-punch-studio-head-comments-on-firing-dev-who-joked-about-charlie-kirk%E2%80%99s-death.1303083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last week, a war has been waging in the YouTube comments of each new <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> trailer as the PlayStation 5 exclusive nears its release date early next month. That’s because a developer at Sucker Punch Productions<a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"> joked about the assassination of Charlie Kirk</a> on social media. Sony confirmed it had parted ways with the employee following a right-wing pressure campaign, but declined to issue any further statement. Now studio head and co-founder Brian Fleming has commented on the firing directly in a new interview.</p> <p>Sucker Punch artist Drew Harrison, a nearly 10-year veteran of the studio, posted “I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back” on the day the assassination took place. Less than 24 hours later she confirmed she’d been fired. “Drew Harrison is no longer an employee of Sucker Punch Productions,” a spokesperson for Sony told <em>Kotaku</em> at the time.</p> <p>“The facts are accurate,” Fleming told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sucker-punch-brian-fleming-interview-playstation-ghost-of-yotei">Stephen Totilo’s <em>Game File</em></a> when asked about the situation. “Drew’s no longer an employee here. I think we’re aligned as a studio that celebrating or making light of someone’s murder is a deal-breaker for us, and we condemn that, kind of in no uncertain terms. That’s sort of our studio, and that’s kind of where we are.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627297"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627297">YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Despite Harrison’s swift firing, angry internet users, urged on by clout-chasing culture warriors like Mark “Grummz” Kern, have been demanding Sony take action against any staff members who may have liked or reposted Harrison’s comment, while also targeting <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">other companies and their employees</a> over potential anti-Kirk sentiment. That included Bethesda, which was accused of mocking the right-wing podcast’s supporters when it posted a clip from <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> of the famous Nazi puncher saying to a kitten, “You don’t care much about these fascists, do you?” <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/bethesda-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-charlie-kirk-tweet-deleted/">It was later deleted</a>.</p> <p>Microsoft Gaming employees were also targeted, including by Elon Musk. “We’re aware of the views expressed by a small subset of our employees regarding recent events,” the company <a href="https://x.com/Microsoft/status/1966626714148368766">announced</a> in response on September 12. “We take matters like this very seriously and we are currently reviewing each individual situation. Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values.” A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when asked if anyone had been fired from Microsoft following these investigations.</p> <p>“Sucker Punch is amazing &amp; one of the last few bright shining lights in the game industry,” Harrison posted this week. “I still support them and I cannot condone any animosity directed at them. It’s truly all the best people.”</p>

The way he put it was really interesting. He pointed out how nihilistic a lot of the internet is – and how that nihilism isn’t really reflected or addressed in either political party. This is something that is so pervasive and also so overlooked that a lot of people just feel left out of the discussion entirely.</p><p>I’m just thinking of the way Twitter was so quick to try to blame groypers for this – trying to find a way that these references could be proof that this was the far, far right. Whereas conservative mainstream media was blaming the left. In reality, if you look at the court documents released after the alleged shooter was arrested, his politics seem a bit incomprehensible – just like a shitpost. It’s disruptive and incoherent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Even Luigi Mangione’s politics were incoherent. If you’re gonna take a person’s life in a really high-profile way, chances are you’re both not mentally well and a median voter, and the median American voter has incoherent politics – particularly younger people. I feel like there is this sort of millennial, gen Z, gen alpha divide where politics, particularly post-2020, feels almost [hopeless]. I don’t know if younger people are gonna come around to politics in the way millennials did in the Bernie era. It does feel a little more like “Nothing really matters” nihilistic in younger groups.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The most telling piece of reporting I’ve seen on all of this is <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/exclusive-leaked-messages-from-charlie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ken Klippenstein’s article</a> about the Discord the alleged killer was in and the conversations that occurred between people in that Discord – and also the killer’s friends’ takes on what kind of person he was. They said he never really seemed all that political and mentioned that their Discord had a bunch of people of different political valences. They mostly just hung out and talked about video games. I think that’s very revealing: You don’t necessarily have to be a political radical to be driven insane by our current moment. This is bad for everyone. It leads to this prevalent nihilism where, if one thing pushes you too far or a few things do, that can lead to violence – especially when there’s not another pressure release valve on society in general.</p><p><strong>Morgan: </strong>It’s like what we said earlier with Luigi Mangione: People were joking that Luigi Mangione was the OG radical centrist, but I think it’s less that and more that he and Charlie Kirk’s alleged killer are just guys who have been subjected to a system that is very broken and decided to retaliate in a horrific and violent way that isn’t right, but at the same time, all of the discussions people are having are missing those core causes of the reason they are retaliating.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, that’s because I think – especially for mainstream media and the government – to talk about that element of things, they’d have to accept a degree of culpability, implicitly if not explicitly. And they sure as heck do not want to do that. So they’re going to point the finger at the typical scapegoats, like video games.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is a very big and mostly great game</a> that you’ll likely spend over 50 hours in if you try to do everything it has to offer. It also might be your first <em>Borderlands</em> in a long time, or possibly ever. This all might seem really intimidating. 10 billion guns! A giant open world! What should you do? Well, I’ve got your back. Here are 12 tips to help you get started and kick ass in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> And be not afraid, there are no spoilers below.</p> <h2>Don’t Get Distracted By Side Quests Until You Get Your Hover Bike</h2> <p>Look, I get it. Running around and doing every little side quest is fun, but I’d recommend focusing on the main story until you get your hoverbike. It won’t take more than two hours and it’s worth it. Well, unless you like walking everywhere in a big open-world game. And speaking of side quests and not doing them…</p> <h2>Maybe Don’t Do <em>Every</em> Side Quest Before Finishing The Main Story…</h2> <p>I’m a map cleaner in open-world games. I get it. I love to methodically clear out every piece of content in a big open world. But maybe don’t do that until you complete the main story. That’s because once you do that, regardless of your level, you unlock “Specializations,” which is a new set of passive bonuses and skills that act as an endgame grind. And you level this up with XP. So it might be better to mainline the story and then turn around and do all the side stuff later.</p>

 <h2>But…Focus On Getting SDU Credits To Make Your Backpack Bigger</h2> <p>While I advise not doing every side quest before the credits roll, I do suggest you look out for Propaganda Towers, Bunkers, and other open-world activities that reward you with SDU credits that can be used to upgrade how many items you can hold at once in your backpack. Trust me, you want to upgrade this ASAP. You are going to be grabbing so much random junk to sell and sort through, and running out of space sucks. So prioritize getting that backpack upgraded.</p> <h2>Use The Loot As Junk Button</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953">New to <em>Borderlands 4</em> is the ability to loot items as junk.</a> This means that you can instantly sell it and every single item you’ve marked as junk with the press of a button just by walking up to a vending machine. It saves a lot of time and is one of the best features in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. Use it. You’ll thank me later.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624984"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624984">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Keep An Eye Open For Elemental Weapons To Help You Kill Quickly</h2> <p>It’s very easy to focus exclusively on getting guns with bigger numbers. But hold up! It’s not all about DPS. You might want to keep that SMG or shotgun because of its elemental damage type. You see, enemies in<em> Borderlands 4</em> all have different weaknesses to different elements. Enemies with red health bars burn fast, baddies with blue health bars are weak to shock, and aliens or robots with yellow health bars get melted quickly with acid.</p> <p>So before you drop that slightly weaker SMG for a cool new one, stop and think. Does the weaker one do acid damage? Is it your only weapon that does acid damage? You might want to keep it, then, so you can fight robots with ease.</p>

 <h2>Don’t Have Four Of The Same Type Of Gun Equipped</h2> <p>I love a good assault rifle in<em> Borderlands 4.</em> I’m always on the lookout for a new Daedalus AR to add to my collection. But I never run around with more than one AR equipped. Why? Because if all your guns are the same type–like all shotguns or whatever–then you’ll burn through that ammo type much faster. Variety is the spice of life, and it also means you don’t use up all your shotgun shells in a matter of minutes.</p> <h2>Look Down Your Character’s Skill Tree Before Unlocking Anything</h2> <p>Simple one, but important: Before you start upgrading your character’s skills, take a moment to look at what you’ll be able to unlock later on. You might see a skill you just desperately want, or you might realize the particular skill tree you are examining features bonuses and abilities you’ll just never use. And sure, the game lets you respec everything, but why waste time earning skills you don’t like when you can take a moment to plan ahead and have a much better time.</p>

 <h2>When Playing Co-op, Use Your Buddies As Fast Travel Stations</h2> <p>Playing with your friends is always better, but in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">Borderlands 4</a>,</em> that’s especially true as you can fast-travel to them whenever you want. Tricky platforming section that you don’t want to do? Fast travel to your bud! Get lost and can’t find your way to the next part of the quest? Fast travel to your friend. Want to sell a bunch of stuff in the middle of a big fight? Fast travel to an area with vending machines, sell your junk, and then fast travel back to your friends. This feature is so useful and powerful that it almost feels like cheating.</p> <h2>Use The Newly Added Repkits!</h2> <p>It’s easy to forget about <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s newly added Rep Kits, which are small items that can heal you during fights. They are brand new to the franchise and the game never warns you to use one when your health gets low. But use your Rep Kits! They can make a challenging ambush much easier.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624986">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>If Lost, Just Use Echo 4, aka Hit Up On The D-Pad</h2> <p>Remember, you can always ask Echo 4, your new robot companion, to guide you to your next quest objective or your custom marker. This can be really handy when deep in a cave or building filled with multiple rooms and hallways. Just hit up on the D-pad, and Echo 4 will generate an easy-to-follow holographic line in the world pointing to your target location.</p> <h2>Grab Contracts Before Heading Out</h2> <p>Whenever you return to one of the many hub and town areas in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, take a moment to check the bounty board and grab some bounties. Many of these are very easy to complete and just want you to kill a few random enemies. You were going to do that anyway, so why not get some extra XP and rewards for doing so?</p>

 <h2>Hold Onto Gold Keys Until You Level Up</h2> <p>The moment you walk up to your first gold chest in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, you’ll be tempted to use any gold keys you currently have. Don’t do this. I know, it’s fun to open a big shiny box and get new guns, most of which will be pretty good. But if you’re below level 40, I’d avoid using your keys as the loot you get from them at that point will be made worthless in the not-too-distant future. That level 7 legendary sniper ain’t going to be worth using when, a few hours later, you’re level 12 and find a much better one. Save your gold keys for when you’re in the endgame portion of <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p> <p>And if you need help getting more (or any…) gold keys, don’t you worry,<a href="https://kotaku.com/how-shift-codes-gold-keys-work-borderlands-4-help-get-more-2000626107"> I’ve got a guide just for you</a> that walks you through the process and even includes some codes you can use to get some fancy rewards.</p>
