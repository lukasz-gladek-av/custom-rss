<p>IllFonic, the developers behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, have announced that its the latest studio to hold layoffs in 2024.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/IllFonic/status/1864369606988632330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, CEO and co-founder Charles Brungardt said that the layoffs are an acceptance of the “harsh reality” within the games industry.</p>



<p>“Today we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic,” he said. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we re-aligned to a refined strategy.”</p>







<p>In addition to developing its own games, Illfonic has provided support development for games like Crysis 3 and Star Citizen. Coincidentally enough, the latter’s developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games recently held</a> its own layoffs.</p>



<p>There was no specific mention of how many people have been let go. According to <a href="https://leadiq.com/c/illfonic/5a1da50f2300005a0097c01e#:~:text=As%20of%20October%202024%2C%20IllFonic,including%20North%20AmericaEuropeAsia." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeadIQ</a>, Illfonic employed 96 people as of October 2024.</p>



<p>To close his statement, Brungardt requested that those with openings reach out to him in order to help place those who have lost their jobs.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a>&nbsp;lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>

Pick up misplaced items like mugs and toys, then return them to the right spot to solve bamboozling puzzles that unlock special gifts. </p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>After a nearly 10-year gap between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> finally arrived at the end of October. While the previous game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, is now regarded as a classic in the genre, The Veilguard's reception has been considerably colder from some. That's something that the developers behind The Veilguard have already come to terms with.</p><p>"It's been a decade since the last Dragon Age game came out, and a lot of people have spent that decade imagining various versions of what this game was going to be," said Dragon Age creative director John Epler during an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "The reality was whatever we came out with, it was never going to match the Dragon Age 4 in people's minds and people's imaginations."</p><p>The long development of The Veilguard included a period where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">the sequel was re-envisioned as a live-service game</a> before it transitioned back to a single-player experience. Given everything that went into the game, director Corinne Busche shared her satisfaction with The Veilguard in its final form.</p><p>"We're very happy with the critical reception to the game," said Busche. "It's not common to have these challenging development cycles and have a team turn around and receive the critical reception that it did. In fact, in a lot of ways, that is the harder path to take. So yeah, we're quite proud of the critical reception. Unfortunately on the sales side, that's not something we can really discuss. but of course as we know with Inquisition, that was a long burn to get to those total sales numbers."</p><p>EA has already stated that The Veilguard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">won't be getting a DLC expansion</a> because BioWare is shifting gears to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">the next Mass Effect game</a>. However, Busche expressed confidence in the future of the Dragon Age franchise.</p><p>"There's so many stories left, so many mysteries left unsolved, so I'll leave that for what it is," related Busche. "I will remain of the point of view that [Dragon Age's ability to reinvent itself] remains our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity."</p>

future, but the team decided it was best to stick to the 2024 release date. The decision was influenced in part by the sheer level of exhaustion experienced by the game's developers, who endured multiple "marathon" crunch sessions to make sure the game was the best it could be, without resorting to another delay.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's very hard to explain your [mental] state when you're in a very intensive work process for many months until release, and you're working over, over, over what you usually can do, and [you're doing it] in the highest possible stress and overwhelming period," Grygorovych said of the race to finish the game while dealing with the constant strife of the ongoing war in Ukraine, where GSC was originally headquartered.</p><p dir="ltr">He added that he was surprised to see how much of Stalker 2's media coverage glossed over the fact that it was made in the midst of war, but instead focused more on standard details like patch notes, as if nothing were happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something so unimportant in the scale of the country, but they were talking about the game!" he said of the coverage.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2's development was heavily impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. GSC offices were damaged by a fire caused by Russian shelling, and the dev team ultimately had to make the difficult decision to leave their homes in Ukraine to finish work on the sequel to their most iconic title.</p><p dir="ltr">The war's impact can even be seen in the title of the game--while the original Stalker used the Russian spelling of the title (Shadow of Chernobyl), Stalker 2 has changed the spelling to reflect the Ukrainian pronunciation of Chornobyl. The devs even created a documentary about the struggle to develop a game set one's home country when that country is being ravaged by war.</p><p dir="ltr">Early in the invasion, Russian forces even occupied Pripyat--the city in which Stalker and Stalker 2 are set--and defaced the nuclear accident site along with the surrounding area. The city of Pripyat is now back under Ukrainian control, but the <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?si=RE4PKuM3PZwi8kjd" rel="nofollow ">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> documentary gives viewers a closer look at the difficulties, complications, and heartbreaks they dealt with during the game's development cycle. Gyrgorovych says half of the development team moved to Prague, while the other half remained in Kyiv. Employee safety was (and remains) a constant concern, and GSC devs yearn for the country they spent so long making games about.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409796" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409796"></a><figcaption>At one point Russian forces invaded the radioactive city in which the Stalker series is set.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's very important to remind people what's going on [in Ukraine], because when there is something evil and you stop calling it out and mentioning it... it won't help to stop it," Gyrgorovych said. "One layer is we are making the game, and we want to entertain people and make it as good a game as possible. And second, it's about what we can do for our homeland, because we are in a hard situation. I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</p><p dir="ltr">Although Grygorovych was a bit surprised by the media's failure to acknowledge the cultural context of the game's creation, his wife Mariia--who also works at the studio--was delighted by the response from players in their home country. Ukrainian players signed into the game en masse after its release, leading to nationwide internet outages in the hours after its release.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a bad thing because the internet is important, but at the same time it's like, 'Whoa!'" Marii said of the response from Ukrainian players. "It touched everyone in the country."</p><p dir="ltr">"For us and our team what's most important is, for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier [now] than they were before [the game's] release," she added. "We did something for our home country, something good for them.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems. But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems--you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p>

		<p>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls has been given a release date of March 21st, Bandai Namco has announced. It will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. The game was first announced in July, with confirmation that BLEACH Rebirth of Souls would contain a brand new story, instead of adapting an established plot instead. A new trailer has been released to mark the March 21st date, and it features Aizen and Yamamoto. These are two more playable characters of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls — Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/duPLssNW04I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In&nbsp;BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, the more dire the circumstances, the greater character’s power can grow. In the middle of each conflict, the momentum can shift as characters can unleash powerful attacks the closer they get to being defeated. This state reveals new shapes and swords to allow&nbsp; players to snatch triumph from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<p>Three versions of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls are now available to pre-order too. The standard edition is just the game, and will cost £54.99. The Digital Deluxe edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, and soul crystal set 2, which is used to upgrade player abilities. This edition will cost £79.99. The Digital Ultimate edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, soul crystal 2 and 3, Thousand-Year Blood War Costume Set and Rebirth of Souls Costume Set. This edition will cost £94.99. Those who pre-order also get the Toshiro and Yoruichi Thousand-Year Blood War costume sets.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Bleach game we appeared to have reviewed was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección</a>, way back in 2011. At the time, Dan said,<em>&nbsp;“The story also hasn’t been handled particularly well. Having just a wall of text at the start of a level is actually quite deflating, and rather than pumping up the player for a bit of carnage it has the opposite effect. If the story had been fleshed out then the score would have been a fair bit higher. Overall it’s a fun game, but also a real missed opportunity.”</em></p>

		<p>Gran Turismo has been a monolith of racing for PlayStation fans over the past three decades, and so to mark its importance, Sony and Polyphony Digital have put together a new free-to-play experience dubbed My First Gran Turismo.</p>
<p>My First Gran Turismo will be available for free across both PS5 and PS4 via the PlayStation Store on 6th December at midnight local time.</p>
<p><iframe title="My First Gran Turismo Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xXXU7LlrfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The aim with this game is to pay homage to the very first entry in the series, appreciating it through the modern game engine of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. Still, it’s designed to be “approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level,” series creator Kazunori Yamauchi explains.</p>
<p>The game will include three races, three time trials and three Music Rally stages, as well as a suite of License Tests to complete. 18 cars are included, and the trio of tracks are&nbsp;Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit.</p>

<p>In a nice bonus, My First Gran Turismo also has full <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> support via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a nice homage to the franchise history, though this looks like it’s effectively just a demo for Gran Turismo 7. That’s no bad thing, of course, and having even a small slice of GT7 racing available for anyone and everyone to check out on PS4 and PS5 is pretty great in our books.</p>

		<p>Warhorse Studios has one of those weird and slightly unsettling announcements for gamers to contemplate: they’ve brought the release of their next game… forward? That’s right, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is now releasing one week earlier on 4th February 2025. Surprise!</p>
<p>The announcement comes a day before the debut of a new story trailer at the PC Gamer Show tomorrow, 5th December, as the game is nominated as one of most anticipated games of next year. At the same time the PC</p>


<p>There’s further good news, though. The game has now gone Gold, which used to mean that a game was all done and dusted and ready for release – these days it means that it’s ready to get something put on discs for consoles, while the devs continue to hurriedly squash bugs for a day one patch. Still, it’s a great milestone and allows Warhorse to make some further announcements and reveals.</p>
<p>One of these things is a confirmation of the PC specs and requirements, which will come tomorrow, where they will also reveal the performance that they’re able to get out of consoles. One little tidbit is that the game will have a 60fps mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and it will also be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro Enhanced</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Hands on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 –&nbsp;Henry and Hans go to the big city</a></h2>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier this year, exploring the opening in the gorgeous countryside of Bohemia (with some not-so-gorgeous narrative twists for Henry and Sir Hans), before leaping ahead to the big city of Kutenberg.</p>

<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a real showcase for how much Warhorse Studios has grown, evolving their take on the historical setting and their approach to role playing games in general.”</p>

But why did developer BioWare choose to make you do something so difficult? In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-spoiler-deep-dive-directors-answer-all-our-questions-on-the-endings-the-gods-solas-and-more&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-spoiler-deep-dive-directors-answer-all-our-questions-on-the-endings-the-gods-solas-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, Game Director Corinne Busche and Creative Director John Epler explained that it was basically <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/do-it-for-the-plot&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/do-it-for-the-plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For The Plot</a></span>—specifically, the plots of the characters involved and how their individual arcs connect to the game’s overarching story.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the interview, Busche and Epler were asked why players are required to choose between having either Tevinter mage Neve or elven Veil Jumper Bellara perform a dangerous task in the endgame, which ultimately results in the chosen character being captured and enslaved at the hands of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s evil elven gods. This removes them from your party for the remainder of the game, as they are blighted and controlled during the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-suicide-mission-choice-1851712586&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-suicide-mission-choice-1851712586">final battle in the city of Minrathous</a></span>. Whoever is kidnapped does defy the elven gods in the end, and as painful as it might be to pick between two of your faves, BioWare says this was all in service of the two’s respective stories, whether that be as an elven historian or a Tevinter reformist. As Epler explained to <em>IGN</em>:</p><figure id="" data-id="8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-recommend-id="image://8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-recommend-id="image://8d52044ef62b04dedec1a7da9c1df919" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blighted Bellara talks to the team while leaning against a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So for Neve and Bellara, the two groups that have been the most directly affected by the gods up to this point are obviously the elves – it’s their gods that are back – and Tevinter, Minrathous. You know, the Venatori have either fully seized power or have made some pretty big inroads in Minrathous, depending on which city you save. And the gods have come back and brought their dragons and proclaimed them as the gods of the Tevinter people. So both Bellara and Neve have a direct investment. Not that everyone else doesn’t, but they have the most direct investment in stopping the gods at this point. We wanted to give you that choice between these two characters who, again, have a very personal score to settle with the gods and are both mages whereas Emmrich obviously wants to stop the end of the world, but doesn’t have quite that same connection to the events that are going on. So those two made the most sense as to who would disable them.</p><p>The other thing is something that shows up in the visuals. Minrathous, Tevinter in general has always been kind of...there’s echoes of ancient elven magic in everything to Tevinter and Minrathous does because it’s meant as almost a cargo cult imitation of what the ancient elves were capable of. The ancient elves worked lyrium into their buildings, Tevinter uses gold and jewels because they don’t have the capacity to work lyrium. So it made the most sense for them.”</p><p>But that’s not the only sacrifice you’re forced to make in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s final push. The more (potentially) permanent choice is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-team-decision-davrin-harding-save-1851694983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-team-decision-davrin-harding-save-1851694983">between the dwarven scout Harding or the elven warrior Davrin</a></span>. At the beginning of the final mission, the player must pick one of the two to lead a distraction team as the party begins an assault on the elven god’s base. At the end of this first act, whoever you chose will sacrifice themselves to give the rest of the team an opening and kill one of the gods. According to Epler, Harding was always one of the characters the team planned on putting at risk, while Davrin became the second choice as his story as a Grey Warden formed during development.</p><figure id="" data-id="466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-recommend-id="image://466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-recommend-id="image://466967c4f2aba03be5944c4b9e5d655e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook addresses the team on a beach." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“We knew Harding had to be one of them, and then we had to ask ourselves: we’ve got a fan favorite returning character from <em>Inquisition</em>,” Epler said. “Who could possibly equal that in terms of making this difficult choice? It’s like, well, Assan. Assan and Davrin. Davrin obviously has a direct link to this at this point because of Weisshaupt. He’s got a very personal stake in it, and it made sense for the two of them to be the ones to be the choice to lead the distraction team, because again, we want to find those personal connections between the characters and the events that are going on. And, you know, the case of Harding, she has so much investment in this story because she’s been living it since <em>Inquisition</em>. And then Davrin. Davrin’s entire order just fell at the end of the previous act. He’s going to have a real strong investment in stopping the guys too here.”</p><p>The choices are impactful in and of themselves, of course, but as Epler and Busche noted, they can also be complicated further by other things happening in your party when the time comes to make your last stand.</p><p>“One thing that’s so interesting about that choice too, the Harding and Davrin choice is it actually presented some interesting complexity and some emotional investment we could tie into, which always makes for a more satisfying, I will say harder choice to make,” Busche said. “I’ll say in one of my playthroughs, Taash and Harding were in a relationship together and I happened to be romancing Davrin. Impossible. Impossible decision in that moment.”</p><p>While either Bellara or Neve can definitively survive if they’re chosen, the ultimate consequences of the Davrin or Harding choice seem a little ambiguous right now. While neither appears for the rest of the game, fans are latching onto codex entries and dialogue that implies they might still be alive as they look for hope that whoever is lost in the fight may return in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496">the next <em>Dragon Age</em></a></span>.

                <p>BioWare is celebrating Dragon Age Day with a handful of surprises for fans centered around the recently released Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but also recognizes what's come before. A standalone version of Veilguard's character creator and a free armor set for the game inspired by Dragon Age II are both now available. Later today, the game will have a new update and you can see the full patch notes for Patch 4 below, which includes a new tool to take photos during the game's cutscenes, 20+ bug fixes, and new Qunari complexions. </p><p>Dragon Age Day was created by the game's fans to give Dragon Age its own version of N7 Day, the day that celebrates the community of BioWare's space epic series, Mass Effect. </p><p>The biggest gift to players is a standalone, free version of the game's character creator. For the folks who haven't taken the plunge into Dragon Age: The Veilguard, you can now create a Rook or Inquisitor, before buying the full game and transferring your character over. You just need to make sure you're on the same platform that you have the creator on.</p><p>There will also be the addition of Dragon Age II protagonist Hawke's armor, body paint, and nose blood smear as free cosmetics for your character. These cosmetics are a permanent addition to the game, and can be found in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing The Singing Blade mission.</p><p>Speaking of community, since Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been out for over a month, developers will start an AMA over at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Age subreddit</a> starting at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET today, December 4..

			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-sounds-of-seattle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the final developer diary for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 before the end of 2024. The developer diary is dedicated to sound design in the upcoming first-person action roleplaying game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Unconventional Sound Sources" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FuPAJugr58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, by far the most interesting tidbit is that when the developer diaries resume next year, they will include 'customization, weapon systems, release date, and content expansion plans.' The latter is news to us, as there had been no previous hint at any expansion plans for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. It may be a sign that both the developer and publisher are confident in the game's quality and are, therefore, already planning to also create downloadable content to release post-launch.</p>
<p>Should that turn out to be the case, fans might be sighing in relief. Bloodlines 2 has had a troublesome development phase, to say the least. The game was being made by Hardsuit Labs <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the help of Bloodlines designer Brian Mitsoda</a>, but Paradox decided not to go forward with that version of the project. It came awfully close to being canceled, too, but The Chinese Room (Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes the Deep</a>) delivered a pitch that convinced Paradox to let them make Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>There have been changes, of course. While Seattle remains the setting, the main character has <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-dev-explains-why-they-switched-protagonist-to-an-elder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> from being a newly converted Thinblood to a powerful Elder vampire called Phyre who has been forcefully laid dormant for a hundred years and suddenly awakens in an unfamiliar environment. At launch, players will be able to choose between the following clans: Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue. More will be added after the release, which is tentatively <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated</a> for the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>However, Paradox Interactive does not wish to repeat the painful experience of handling a project that is, in their own words, outside of their wheelhouse. As such, any further installments would be licensed out to a third-party studio.</p>

<p>PlayStation and Gran Turismo developer Polyphony Digital announced a new GT game out of nowhere for the holiday season. Find out everything we know about My First Gran Turismo—including its release date—and why it’s one of the most unique entries in the franchise.</p>



<p>A fun surprise never goes amiss, and I’d say My First Gran Turismo falls under this category.

The most recent installment offers the most realistic graphics today, an exhaustive selection of vehicles from world-class bangers to piddly starter cars, and enough racing content to keep you busy throughout an entire Le Mans 24-Hour race. </p>



<p>Now, we have My First Gran Turismo, and it is an odd title. I’ll let you in on a secret, there’s a reason Polyphony Digital went with this wording; so let’s lift the suspension and burn some rubber.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-in-depth-hands-on-it-has-the-potential-to-be-a-medieval-masterpiece<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">This Henry guy just can't seem to catch a break. When we last left the blacksmith's son-turned-knight at the end of the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance, things were finally starting to look up for him. But the sequel, in true video game sequel fashion, starts by knocking him down a peg or two and dumping him into a new, larger open world to regain his dignity, one side quest at a time. And to be honest, that's refreshing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II picks up almost immediately where the first one left off, but it's certainly not essential to have played it to follow what's going on, thanks to an extended intro that brings you up to speed on the broader strokes. The year is 1403. Henry is a village boy from Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic) who saw his home burned to the ground due to a civil war for the crown taking place between two half-brothers. He ended up in the service of the frustratingly good-looking nepo baby Sir Hans Capon to try and help out the supporters of the royal brother who isn't going around burning down villages, and that plan got… a little sidetracked.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not exactly a start back from square one, though. Henry began the first game as that kind of old-school RPG protagonist who is really just some random guy with no skills to speak of. He could barely hold a sword, and the unforgiving combat really made you feel that until you put in the time to master it. But Henry's a seasoned adventurer now. He knows how to read, which is practically a superpower in medieval Europe. And while you were out partying, he studied the blade.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Taste My Blade</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is reflected in the changes to combat in KCD2, which the developers described as lowering both the skill floor required to play competently and raising the skill ceiling for the most devoted warriors. There are only four attack directions now instead of five. Thrust attacks are no longer a separate attack button, and have instead been folded into the combo system for weapons that make sense with them only. Parries are a bit easier to pull off, and much to my delight, blocking can now defend you from multiple attackers – as long as they're all in front of you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, whether you mastered KCD1's combat or not, the lower skill requirement at the very beginning models the fact that Henry is simply a better fighter by now. But careful stamina management is still the core of every scrap, and button-mashing is one of the quickest ways to die. I came across plenty of challenging encounters even as someone with more than 100 hours across two playthroughs in KCD1, and it's not as easy to spam your way through them by getting a couple of powerful combo moves down to muscle memory.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hill and Dale</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The world of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is quite a bit larger as well, with two distinct maps about the size of the first game's that you can travel back and forth between once both are unlocked. The terrain feels fairly familiar, for the most part. We're still in the Central Bohemian woodlands, basically just over the hill from where KCD1 left off. But the level of detail on the terrain and vegetation is a noticeable step up. And better yet, it's way more optimized. My RTX 4070 Super still can't run KCD1 – a six-year-old game – on max settings. But what I played of KCD2 rarely had any performance problems.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The centerpiece of this new world is the city of Kuttenberg, which is quite a bit larger, denser, and more vibrant than anything we saw in KCD1. It's certainly no Paris or Prague, but navigating its crowded streets and markets, taking shortcuts through back gardens, and admiring its grand Gothic architecture is a complete change of pace from wandering around muddy woodland trails. It's big enough to get lost in, built on a realistic scale that makes towns in a lot of other RPGs feel like tiny dioramas.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tricks of the Trade</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The side quests I got to play were also very open-ended and complex. The most notable example of this was an arc involving two rival sword schools in Kuttenberg, with the older and more established one (who just happened to support the wrong king) trying to force out the newcomers (who were loyal to our boy, the rightful heir). It fell on my shoulders to steal a ceremonial sword from the established school and display it on the walls of the town hall, which would be seen as an open call for challengers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The quest doesn't much care how you get the sword. I took a sneaky approach, picking a lock to the guild's side entrance. But often you'll be able to choose violence, or even diplomacy to solve your problems. What it does care about is whether or not you get caught carrying out this little false flag operation, as it can affect how the tournament between the two schools plays out. I, of course, maintained plausible deniability and won the competition for my school. But there are a variety of other ways it could have progressed, some of which having long-term consequences. Another quest gave me the option of killing or talking my way past some "bandits," and I was told that if I didn't kill them, they might show up later and present me with new opportunities.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Almost everything in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has to offer feels like a careful refinement of its predecessor.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Skills and perks have also been expanded upon, and the perks themselves are generally more powerful. Some of the ones in the first game offered a boon and a penalty, which made them feel more like side-grades. Perks in KCD2 are more straightforward upgrades – which they should be, if I'm going to spend my scarce, hard-won progression points on them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Sharp and Shiny</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost everything else Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has to offer feels like a careful refinement of its predecessor. Warhorse isn't reinventing the wagon wheel here. Diplomacy still takes into account factors like what clothing you have on and how clean you are – with a new system of saved favorite outfits so you can quickly switch between combat gear and something more suited to a soiree. But this time, there's more emphasis on picking the right thing to say for the situation, instead of just the option you have the best stats for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alchemy is back, allowing you to craft various potions and concoctions, and it's been made less fiddly. There's a new blacksmithing minigame for forging your own gear and making a bit of coin, following in Henry's father's footsteps. The reading skill has been replaced by Scholarship, which is gained by reading books and can provide boons like opening up new dialogue options. Henry's still crap at reading Latin, though, and I'm not sure if that can be fixed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And in addition to new, more diverse move sets for all kinds of melee fighting, Henry can finally get his hands on some guns. This is the early 1400s, so we're talking about extremely primitive firearms. The kind that had the tendency to blow up in your hands. So don't expect to be medieval John Wick. But if you point them the right direction from close enough range, there's really no amount of armor that will save your foes from the blast. Then you probably want to grab a sword, because the remaining foes will not stand there and wait for the subjective eternity it takes you to reload.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">On the Road Again</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In just about every sense, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is shaping up as simply a smoother, prettier, more refined continuation of the things I liked about the original. The core mechanics are mostly the same, but sharper and with deeper progression. The world looks familiar, but broader and more grandiose. I had two whole days to play it and it felt like far too little. When I was first turned loose from the stocks to pick my own path to glory, I felt that tingly feeling you get the first time you play Skyrim or The Witcher 3, of a massive world full of diverse adventures that aren't just clearing icons off of a map. I look forward to spending dozens of hours exploring, gearing up with authentic medieval weapons and armor, and progressing through the improved perk system. Maybe Hans will stop being a huge bag of dicks, too! You know, anything is theoretically possible. I'm just glad I won't have to wait much longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, stay tuned all December long as our exclusive IGN First coverage of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhorse Studios and developer Deep Silver have made the decision to move up the Kingdom Come: Deliverance II release date from February 11, 2025, to February 4, 2025. If that is the case, it means that they must be confident in how the game is currently shaping up and feel that it's already in a highly polished state. It has been confirmed that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has gone gold already, meaning that the main chunk of development has finished, and they are just working on bug fixes and tiny polishes. For those interested in the game, it's set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PC via Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Apparently there is some more exciting news that is set to be released by Warhorse Studios and Deep Silver in the coming days, including a new story trailer, which will be premiering tomorrow. When the trailer goes live, the console and PC specifications will be released, which will include information about the PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, as well as how the Quality and Performance modes will affect the game on console.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance was an incredibly popular game, so it's no surprise that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a fantastic game with a lot of love poured into it. The team behind it has put a lot of effort into making it historically accurate, and Chris Wray previewed the game just three months ago, where he talks about his thoughts and feelings on playing the game, which you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/"> read here</a>.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, the team has been dropping details left and right about the game, including lengthy videos that showcase some of the gameplay that players can expect to experience for themselves when the game releases in February. This is a game that has been covered extensively on this site, from<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/"> Q&amp;As</a> to the preview to talking about how the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance has managed to sell eight million copies thus far.</p>
<p>Most recently, Warhorse Studios and Deep Silver released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shown-in-new-43-minute-long-gameplay-video/">43-minute gameplay video</a>, which was featured in December's IGN First. While the developers had the option to swap over to Unreal Engine, much like many developers in current-day game development, they decided to keep using Crytek's CryEngine, and the game is still shaping up to look stunning and immersive for those history buffs out there.</p>

<p>A new character for Marvel Rivals has leaked before the game’s official release on December 6. According to a known Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1864338925164093603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaker on Twitter</a>, Ultron will be added to the game in the future.</p>



<p>According to the leak, Ultron will be a support character with six abilities. Those abilities are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Encephalo-Ray</strong> (Primary) –  Unleash a burning energy beam.</li>



<li><strong>Dynamic Flight</strong>&nbsp;(Secondary) – Fly quickly in the direction of movement and then enter a free-flight mode.</li>



<li><strong>Algorithm Correction</strong> (Passive)&nbsp;– Hold Jump to fall slowly.</li>



<li><strong>Imperative: Firewall</strong>&nbsp;(E) – Summon drones to grant Bonus Health to allies within range, centered on himself and the ally marked by Imperative: Patch. </li>



<li><strong>Imperative: Patch&nbsp;</strong>(Left Shift) – Command a giant drone to follow an ally, constantly healing allies in its radius, with more healing for the designated ally. </li>



<li><strong>Rage of Ultron&nbsp;</strong>(Ultimate) – Summon Ultron Drones to fire Encephalo-Rays, damaging enemies or healing allies.</li>
</ul>



<p>NetEase has yet to confirm Ultron as a character. However, with all of this information out in the public from a data mine, it should be only a matter of time before he is officially announced.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ultron and his abilities seemingly coming to Marvel Rivals?&nbsp;Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

The video discusses the design choices and gives a better glimpse at the new Doppelghast enemy type.</p><p dir="ltr">Citadelle des Morts is a castle in France overrun with the undead. Treyarch says Zombies mode has plenty of maps "grounded in science fiction," and for this map, it wanted to lean more into magic. Citadelle des Morts also features elemental sword Wonder Weapons. This sounds similar to Black Ops 3's Der Eisendrache map, which was a snowy castle map with elemental bows. However, Treyarch says it has never featured a castle like Citadelle des Morts, as this new design lets players travel further into the claustrophobic bowels of the castle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtKXep999Gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WtKXep999Gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch also pulls back the curtain on the making of the Doppelghast, which is the map's unique special enemy. This creature has two heads and tentacle-like appendages instead of arms, and the developer says it wanted to design the enemy to be as unsettling as possible. The Doppelghast is also described as being "super fast and in your face," and the creature's hasty movement can be seen in the video above.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make it have a diverse attitude, where the two heads are constantly looking for something, but they have a separate mind," says Anthony Dicenzo, who is Treyarch's lead animator for Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">The video also shows off more of the map's unique traps that are designed around the castle theme. This includes hot oil traps that can be lit on fire and magical runes that help protect players.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says players will have secrets to uncover within the castle when the map goes live. This will include the main storyline Easter egg quest, but if Citadelle des Morts is anything like the previous two maps, there will likely be plenty of side quests to discover as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/" data-ref-id="1100-6528064">story trailer can be seen here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/over-the-top-wwi-invites-players-to-100-v-100-multiplayer-playtest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Flying Squirrel Entertainment, the team behind Battle Cry of Freedom and <a href="http://wccftech.com/mount-targeting-800-characters-at-60fps/">Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</a>, has announced that the playtest for their highly-anticipated upcoming title, Over The Top: WWI, has started and will run through to 4 AM EST / 10 AM CET on December 9. This title is shaping up to be chaotic carnage, as players will get to participate in third-person 100 v 100 multiplayer, as well as single-player combat set in the muddy fields and trenches of the First World War. Players are given the option to play as either the Central Powers or the Triple Entente.</p>
<p>For those interested in participating in the playtest, it is completely free to join, and those interested can join via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778610/Over_The_Top_WWI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game's Steam Page</a>. If you aren't sure whether this is something you want to play, Flying Squirrel Entertainment has released a trailer that shows off some of what you can expect from the playtest. It's just over a minute and a half long and shows off some of the chaos you can expect to get into.</p>
<p>"This latest will offer a host of features and updates, including destructible environments, the ability to call in airstrikes, and more. We are now entering the final stages of development as we build the game alongside our community and march towards release," says the team at Flying Squirrel Entertainment.</p>
<p><iframe title="Over The Top: WWI - December Playtest live now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGpzPFUjtS4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don't want to play with other people, you can play in a single-player mode in the Over The Top: WWI playtest and utilize bots instead in an entirely destructible and realistic environment based on the First World War. The single-player mode is easy to navigate, as it has an "instant battle" mode, with confrontations taking place in front of you with up to 200 bots. There are plenty of weapons to try out and experiment with, including Bolt-Action Rifles, Revolvers, Axes, Grenades, and Flamethrowers. There are over 50 unique weapons to choose from, with six different types of armored vehicles and ten different Artillery pieces to experiment with.</p>
<p>As stated above, the environments are completely destructible, adding to the mayhem and chaos of the game. You are able to destroy bridges, fell trees, enemy fortifications, and even punch holes in walls to test out your strength.&nbsp; Along with the destructible environments, there is dynamic terrain. This means that any artillery shells, hand grenades, and rifle grenades used will create realistic craters in the ground. Additionally, you can use shovels and pickaxes to manipulate the ground to your benefit and create trenches to help you defend against the enemy in Over The Top: WWI.</p>

The first widget it includes is a recreation of <em>Snake </em>which was the most memorable of the three games pre-installed on the Nokia 6110 when it launched 26 years ago.</p><p>Although the original game was played by pressing buttons as cellphones lacked touchscreens, the snake in Nothing’s version is steered using directional screen swipes, while a double tap pauses the action, <a href="https://retrododo.com/nothing-adds-retro-snake-game-to-their-smartphones-widgets/">according to <em>Retro Dodo</em></a>. But the gameplay is the same, with players scoring points by eating red dots while trying to avoid colliding with themselves as the snake grows longer and longer.</p><div><p>The inspiration for the new widget came from <a href="https://bento.me/rahuljanardhanan">Rahul Janardhanan</a>, an artist who earlier this year <a href="https://x.com/raonehere/status/1749069277960057048">designed and shared a collection of 10 concepts</a> for potential Nothing OS widgets. Janardhanan’s work <a href="https://nothing.community/d/20998-community-widgets-snake-game">caught the eye of the company</a> and Nothing’s software team worked with a community developer to create the widget.</p></div><p>The new <em>Snake</em> game widget, and Nothing’s new widgets app, follow a similar initiative by Nothing to work with its community of users. In October, the company announced its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282844/nothing-phone-2a-plus-community-edition-glowing">Nothing Phone 2A Plus Community Edition</a> featuring an updated glow-in-the-dark design, new wallpapers, and even packaging that was created by the company’s “most talented followers.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

EA will be releasing a free, standalone version of the character creator for all platforms the game is available on (PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC), and you’ll be able to bring the character you make in the free creator over to the full game if you decide to buy it.</p><p>If you have any interest at all in <em>The Veilguard</em>, I really recommend checking out the free character creator when it’s available and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">seeing all of the options</a>.

And if you end up making a character, transfer them to the game, and want to make some tweaks, you’ll be able to do so early on in your adventure, so don’t sweat your decisions too much.</p><p>EA is also releasing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-4-release-notes">a fourth patch for the game</a>, which adds a mission that will reward you with in-game items themed around the <em>Dragon Age II</em> protagonist, Hawke. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
