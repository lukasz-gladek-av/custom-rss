			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/">Tango Gameworks</a> being shut down after the huge success of Hi-Fi Rush came as a massive shock to a lot of people, and it was a shame to see such a powerful studio be erased. However, Tango Gameworks was then saved by Krafton, who acquired the studio from Microsoft in a "last-minute deal." By acquiring the Japanese studio, they also got the rights to the Hi-Fi Rush franchise. CEO Chang Han 'CH' Kim spoke about their choice to acquire the studio, saying it was creatively motivated rather than commercially.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-krafton-ceo-says-tango-gameworks-acquisition-is-about-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Game Developer</a>, Kim says Krafton wanted to acquire the studio and "as many people as possible from Tango to continue their legacy " after Microsoft shuttered it in May. Krafton is most well known for developing PUBG, but it also wanted to acquire Tango Gameworks due to its love for Hi-Fi Rush and wanted to be able to develop sequels.</p>
<p>"Because Hi-Fi Rush fans really want to see sequels, we negotiated with Tango Gameworks' parent company to acquire that IP as well." Krafton also pushed for the deal to go through as fast as possible, as Tango Gameworks employees were left feeling anxious as the studio was shut down so suddenly. Because the move felt time-sensitive to Krafton, they consciously decided to purchase the Hi-Fi Rush franchise exclusively instead of Tango's entire IP collection, which also included The Evil Within and Ghostwire Tokyo.</p>
<p>"If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much. Krafton is a pretty big company, but Microsoft is very complicated. We wanted to help the team continue developing their games, but especially Hi-Fi Rush."</p>
<p>Although Krafton has been trying to hurry the process, the acquisition is still being finalized, which means they cannot disclose how much they spent on acquiring Tango Gameworks. <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1823815934458650940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game File reports</a> that Krafton has brought over 50 employees from Tango Gameworks, representing roughly half of the development team at Microsoft. Kim states that they are aiming for a minimum of 100 people and want to scale the studio up and even expand in the future.</p>
<p>"We can't acquire Tango Gameworks based on their financials or their numbers, right? We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank. But it's part of our attempt. We have to keep trying in the spirit of challenge-taking."</p>
<p>Even though Krafton seems unsure whether Hi-Fi Rush will be a financial success, they want to continue to acquire more studios in need, much like Tango Gameworks. This is so they can increase their portfolio lineup and create innovative rather than derivative titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-to-let-pc-players-reduce-intrusive-puzzle-hints/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>God of War Ragnarok officially releases on PC today, two years after its release on console. While the game was well received by both critics and the general population, one of the biggest gripes was how invasive the puzzle hints were. This is something that was also similar in the first game but wasn't as bad as it is in God of War Ragnarok. With the release of the title on PC, players will be able to reduce the frequency of puzzle hints from companions in the gameplay settings.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Ragnarök - Launch Trailer | PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBwxyqq1ON4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it's nice that there is an option to receive hints in the game, it was commented on frequently as a form of criticism once the game was released. You'd walk into a room and see a puzzle and would already be given hints before you had a chance to really investigate what was going on. There was the "Puzzle Timing" setting in the accessibility options, which gave players more time for timed puzzles, but there was nothing in the settings to reduce the hints.</p>
<p>At the time, the only solution was to turn the volume down and make sure the subtitles were off so that the puzzles weren't immediately spoiled and given away. With the release of God of War Ragnarok on PC, Sony Santa Monica has released a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/18/god-of-war-ragnarok-brings-a-host-of-new-features-to-pc-available-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed blog post</a> about the new features that were arriving in the game on PC and would also be implemented into the console version of the game in the future.</p>
<p>New accessibility features will also be coming to both PC and console, including Cinematic Audio Description. This provides contextual information during cutscenes alongside the dialogue for those who may need a refresher. As a 'thank-you' to the players who have supported them, they've also added some free animated Twitch alerts that streamers can use to showcase the games or their love for the franchise during their streams.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is now available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. To install and play the game, players must have at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">190 GB free on their PC</a>. Additionally, it has launched with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-to-boost-performance-in-god-of-war-ragnarok-final-fantasy-xvi-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-and-enotria-the-last-song/">DLSS 3 support from NVIDIA</a>, allowing players to get a smoother experience if they have an RTX graphics card.</p>
<p>At the moment, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla is not on PC, but it's likely that it will be implemented in the future for players to purchase and play.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-ceo-says-hi-fi-rush-2-wont-make-money-and-thats-fine.985503/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton CEO Changhan Kim says that he doesn't think&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em>will be profitable for the company, but in a refreshing and surprising change of tone from regular corporate CEOs, he says that's not a problem.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-krafton-ceo-says-tango-gameworks-acquisition-is-about-legacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Game Developer</a>, Kim says that&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em>potentially not being profitable is "part of our attempt", and that Krafton has to keep trying to make games "in the spirit of challenge-taking".</p>
<p>He describes <em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks as "creative", saying that the studio wants "to try something new" and that Krafton wants "to do more of that". Kim says developing games is about taking risks, but that having more project lineups "mitigate[s] risk, because one of them might work out".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-combat-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=OP_H7S0G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-combat-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=UaIDp-nU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em>likely won't be profitable, Krafton says, but that's A-OK.</figcaption></figure><p>Kim goes on to say that while he doesn't know how much&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>made for Microsoft (even though Aaron Greenberg <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-was-break-out-hit-for-microsoft-according-to-aaron-greenberg">described it as a "break out hit"</a>), "the IP itself was very fresh", featuring "new types of gameplay".</p>
<p>For Kim, it sounds like that's the more important element here; that&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>was "not a game a lot of studios were making". He says Krafton shouldn't be aiming to deliver what Game Developer refers to as an "infinite procession of chart-topping hits".</p>
<p>Instead, remarkably, Kim says Krafton should be looking to "break even" and "recoup the production costs". He says he doesn't "trust people" who say a game is going to be a hit; rather, he wants "someone who can try something new".</p>
<p>I can only speak for myself, but Kim's comments fill me with a mixture of elation and suspicion. It's incredibly refreshing to hear an exec talk like this in the modern era, which, in turn, makes me wonder what the catch might be. Hopefully, there isn't one!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-phoom-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=UXPIHC5W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-phoom-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=NtQyTYnn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton appears to believe that&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em>'s profitability is less important than its creativity. Can it be?</figcaption></figure><p>If you need reminding,&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">ostensibly shut down</a> by former parent company Microsoft earlier this year, along with&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>studio Arkane Austin. Incidentally, Xbox followed this by saying publicly that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">needed "smaller games" on its slate</a>. Good optics!</p>
<p>All seemed lost for Tango and&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, but in August,&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion">swept in and purchased Tango Gameworks</a>, along with the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP, declaring plans to have Tango create more&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>works in the future.</p>
<p>Given Krafton's comments about&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em>, it seems a sequel to the smash hit rhythm-action game is an inevitability.

            <p>Rather sheepishly, I must admit that my own experience with Armenian art begins and ends with System Of A Down. Cheers then, The Bird Of A Thousand Voices, for showing up in my inbox and giving me a second reference point next to <a href="https://youtu.be/Oa4MT9LPcaU">Sugar</a>. This one’s a simple though very striking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a>, inspired by folk legends and scored by composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigran_Hamasyan">Tigran Hamasyan</a>. It’s part of a multimedia project based Armenian folk tale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebird_(Slavic_folklore)">Hazaran Blbul</a> (Firebird).

<p>According to the creators, the game lets you “play as Prince Areg through mystical realms to awaken a celestial bird and restore harmony, blending ancient myth with enchanting music by Tigran Hamasyan, stunning visuals by illustrator Khoren Matevosyan and director Ruben Van Leer.”</p>
<p>"It was a huge task to create a style that would work across vinyl, books, and computer games,” says artist Koren Matevosyan of the project. “The style we chose represents a time period where you can't tell if it's the future or the past. If you look closely, you can find electronic elements, suggesting a time when the future becomes the past.”</p>
<p>"The game reimagines an ancient Armenian legend seeking to preserve and share Armenia’s rich cultural heritage, which is at risk of being forgotten, with younger generations," said the nice email that arrived in our inbox.</p>

<p>The game director for Kingdom Hearts 4, Nomura Tetsuya, has stated that this instalment has been made “with the intention” of heading to the conclusion of the series.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://youngjump.jp/yj45_interview/02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Young Jump</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1836427263614816332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">aitaikimochi</a> on X), Nomura Tetsuya discussed how he envisions Kingdom Hearts 4 and Missing Link as fresh titles rather than sequels. Tetsuya stated that he “wanted to kind of reset the story” after Kingdom Hearts 3, which is why the team brought on new writers and revamped the logo, making it easier for newcomers to join the series.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>When asked about Kingdom Hearts 4, Tetsuya Nomura mentioned that he plans to retire in a few years. Fans are curious whether his retirement will come before the conclusion of the Kingdom Hearts series. However, he clarified that Kingdom Hearts 4 is a game intended to eventually move toward that conclusion.</p>



<p>Talking about <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1836430742106313034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">resetting the story</a> for Kingdom Hearts 4, Tetsuya stated, “For those who know how KH3 ends, the reason why Sora ends up like that in the ending is because we wanted to reset the story in a way” This decision has made it easier for newcomers to join the stories directly from KH4. Testuya concluded by stating that fans who have been playing the KH series will feel “Oh, it’s like this” when starting the new game, but this will allow the new players to enjoy the experience, too.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket.985491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With the influx of digital card games gaining popularity over the years, it’s unsurprising to see a new one pop up here and there. With that said, seeing Pokemon releasing a new digital card game with Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket has had some fans confused – including myself. With the existence of Pokemon Trading Card Game Live, the crossover is quite apparent, but the team at The Pokemon Company and Creatures have a different goal in mind for this new game. From what I’ve seen so far, Pocket is less about the competitive meta of the physical Pokemon trading card game and more about the collecting aspect of the beautiful cards fans know and love – and that’s not such a bad thing. </p><p>After a brief presentation, I was given a phone with Pocket installed and played with it for about two hours. Much of the early parts are similar to many mobile games. This includes completing tutorials to better understand the menus, in-game currency, and the gameplay loop for both opening packs and battles. It can be daunting learning all these new menus and currencies, but it’s not too out of the norm regarding mobile or Gacha games. As you level up through various tasks, other parts of Pocket become available and you accrue more free goodies to get your card collection rolling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>First and foremost, the focus of PTCGP is indeed the card-collecting aspect. Keita Hirobe, who is the Executive Corporate Officer at The Pokemon Company, mentioned to me in a video call that one of the goals of this new digital card game is to have players “focus on the fun of opening packs and collecting cards” and eventually get to know the card game. A lot of the commitment to playing any physical card game is the cost of getting cards and the experience of playing matches often, which are large barriers of entry. So being able to just land on Pocket’s home page and see a big button to open up a free pack is an easy way to get into the Pokemon TCG world. From picking a booster to sliding your finger across the  top to slice it open, all the feelings of opening a pack and seeing what you get are all there. If you come upon a very rare card in your pack, the music changes and the card does a little twirl showing off the digital card effects. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of the coolest experiences of the event was seeing someone pull an immersive card and everyone crowding around to see the full card effect.</p></div><p>Currently, the first set consists of over 200 cards, and this particular set has three booster pack versions representing Pikachu, Mewtwo, and Charizard. The versions matter because certain cards will be unique to a specific booster pack version. For instance, if I choose to only open up the Pikachu booster pack, I have a chance at pulling the Pikachu immersive card, which brings the player into the card in a cool little cinematic tour of the card’s art. One of the coolest experiences of the event was seeing someone pull an immersive card and everyone crowding around to see the full card effect. It was very reminiscent of being a kid and everyone showing off their foil Pokemon cards to each other or when someone pulls a rare full art card in draft with friends. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket Cards</h3></div></output><p>That’s not the rarest card in the game though, as I quickly learned through Pocket’s pity system, Pack Points. For those that don’t know, a gacha game’s pity system allows players to guarantee a particular character or item if they have failed to pull it through normal means. If you gain enough Pack Points through opening packs in Pokemon TCG Pocket, you can use those points to create any card you want for your collection or maybe your deck. I found out that the highest rarity so far are crown rarity cards, which are gold full-art cards. These crown cards cost a whopping 2500 pack points, so players have to commit to saving if they want to guarantee one of those cards. Another interesting option for getting cards is the Wonder Pick. Players can get one card at random from a booster pack that was opened by another player. These players’ packs also rotate, so it’s yet another incentive to check into Pocket daily. After pulling any sweet-looking cards, Pocket has options to show them off in a binder or display board as part of your profile. The personalization options are very similar to Pokemon TCG Live like swapping out your coins, sleeves, and playmats, but there is a new option to add custom animation to the cards, similar to what Marvel Snap does. These custom animations, or flairs, can be made using Shinedust, a currency accrued by converting duplicate cards. Otherwise, getting new cards to fill out your card dex seems to be a wait-and-see approach.</p><p>When it comes to getting booster packs, you have various opportunities to do so, but the main free-to-play option is checking in for your free booster every 12 hours. Players can accumulate two free packs this way at most, so you have to open them up as often as you can. With that said, there is an in-game currency called Pack Hourglass that helps reduce the refresh time of your next booster pack, which can be attained through normal play. If you run out of these for any reason, Poke Gold or the real money currency covers the rest. In my demo, I could fake purchase Poke Gold, which I then used to rip open packs to see what I could get. Five hundred gold at $99.99 was the highest available option in the store so I spammed that a few times for the sake of seeing if I could pull a rare immersive card unique to Pocket. In addition to opening one pack at a time, you have the option to open ten in one go if you choose to hoard your pack hourglasses or use 60 Poke gold. For me, I ripped open about 50-80 packs before I ran into my first immersive card. It felt like I opened up fewer packs before I eventually got my second immersive card. Pocket does show the pull rates of cards, with some of the rarest having a 5% chance of being pulled. In the end, it’s a lot of luck, which is not a fun factor to base your primary gameplay loop on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On the other hand, one feature that I finally got a chance to see more in-depth is the battle system for Pokemon TCG Pocket. Unlike the physical Pokemon TCG, Pocket has simplified the TCG rules to keep gameplay swift. It focuses on teaching you the basics of the Pokemon TCG without the complexity of some meta cards or routes of play. For instance, instead of six prize cards, the player who gets 3 points or defeats 3 points worth of Pokemon first wins. Another departure is that a deck is only 20 cards vs the normal 60-card deck, so decking out is not a losing condition here. There are also no energy cards to bloat the deck. Instead, energy is automatically generated giving players the chance to always add one energy to any of their Pokemon once a turn. If you plan to use multiple types of energy, the max is three types and energy is randomly generated in battle. Among those changes, the cards themselves have also been altered for this format. It’s not easy to one-shot Pokemon and even Poke Abilities and Trainer cards have reduced effects. For instance, a trainer can draw you two cards, but in the core physical game, you usually discard your hand and draw seven. All these changes can effectively shorten a normal game, but there’s still room for matches to go a little longer, with each player given 20 minutes to make moves in PvP. I honestly don’t see matches ever going to time, but I thought it was interesting that there was room for such lengthy games. </p><p>Being a fan of competitive card games both digitally and physically, I was excited to check this out. At a certain point, I do see folks who ultimately want to lean into the Pokemon TCG switch over to the Live digital game or play the physical card game. But that just leaves Pokemon TCG Pocket to mainly be a card-collecting destination, and maybe that’s all it needs to be. Pokemon Go already sees a similar collecting behavior with their players, so this is just a card version of that. So as someone who has recently revisited the Pokemon TCG meta, especially with the recent Worlds Championship, I’m looking forward to checking out more of Pocket later in the year. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tetsuya-nomura-might-retire-before-kingdom-hearts-is-finished.985464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetsuya-nomura-kingdom-hearts-retirement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>creator Tetsuya Nomura has declared that he's yet to decide whether he'll finish the long-running series prior to his retirement, so it's entirely possible future&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>games could be released without Nomura's involvement.</p>
<p>In an interview with YoungJump (for which we're using machine translation), Nomura says he "only [has] a few years left until [he retires]", and so he has to "decide whether to retire first or finish the series first".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-announced">announced all the way back in April 2022</a>, will be "a story that will be completed". It's not entirely clear whether Nomura means that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 4&nbsp;</em>won't end on a cliffhanger or that it will conclude the series as a whole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-tetsuya-nomura.jpg?itok=7mqm--gI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-tetsuya-nomura.jpg?itok=tS9yi4hW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts 4&nbsp;</em>is being made with the intention of being a "complete" story, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, Nomura says that he intends the upcoming game, as well as smartphone title&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>, to be a "reset".</p>
<p>Nomura says he wanted a reset after&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em>, so he "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-adds-akiko-ishibashi-probably-coming-to-ue5">appointed new writers</a> and even made a new logo" so that new players who weren't familiar with the series would find it easier to play&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>.</p>
<p>He also gives some insight into his creative process with regards to the series as a whole, saying that although he's "had the idea of going in this direction" (i.e. the overall series direction) since&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, but that if "something doesn't fit, I'll improvise on the spot".</p>
<p>According to Nomura, he also has documents pertaining to elements of the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series that haven't been explored or explained, and he "keeps that a secret". That would honestly explain a lot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-3-baymax-tetsuya-nomura.jpg?itok=aCeSygpd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-3-baymax-tetsuya-nomura.jpg?itok=PSccGkvI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We may see Tetsuya Nomura retire before&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>is a finished series.</figcaption></figure><p>It's well worth reading the <a href="https://youngjump.jp/yj45_interview/02/index3.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full YoungJump interview</a> if you're a Tetsuya Nomura fan, as it goes into detail not only about&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, but also about some of Nomura's other projects, including the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7&nbsp;</em>remake trilogy.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Hearts 4&nbsp;</em>still doesn't have a release date yet, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more info on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts</em>-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223570/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hits-ios-and-android-october-30th"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em></a><em> </em>was first teased a few months back, it looked like yet another mobile app meant to capitalize on the physical card game’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hunting-for-pokemon-cards-has-become-a-different-kind-o-1846622862">recent wave of unexpected popularity</a>. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/3/23709584/pokemon-trading-card-game-live-release-june"><em>Pokémon TCG Live</em></a><em> </em>already on the market, it was hard to suss out how The Pokémon Company envisioned <em>Pocket </em>fitting into the larger franchise. And while titles like <em>Marvel Snap </em>and <em>Hearthstone </em>have proven to be big hits, it wasn’t clear that <em>Pocket </em>would be able to appeal to newcomers and hardcore <em>Pokémon</em> fans alike.</p><p>We’re still a few weeks out from <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s general release. But during the hands-on time I recently spent testing the game out, it felt like a promising — if slightly daunting — attempt at reinventing the classic card collecting experience for a new generation of budding pokemaniacs. The battles are quicker, flashier, and clearly designed to be picked up with relative ease as you fill up digital binders with immaterial cards that look like the real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>At times, the game’s emphasis on making its virtual cards look and feel real makes it seem like The Pokémon Company’s foray into the NFT space. The big difference here, though, is that you can actually <em>do </em>stuff with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s collectibles besides staring at them on your phone.</p><p>At its core, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is a game focused on giving people a new way of collecting cards, showing them off, and using them to battle other players in fast-paced matches. For free, players can log on every day to receive two booster packs containing five cards apiece and then show them off in customizable digital binders or specialized display boards. Like the physical card game, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s cards differ in rarity (indicated by a new diamond and star rarity system) and feature a range of increasingly elaborate illustrations from a variety of artists.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than relying on different physical textures or holographic foil to convey a card’s value, though, <em>Pokémon TCG </em>introduces a number of new 3D effects to make rare pulls pop. <em>Genetic Apex </em>— the first expansion players will be able to access at launch&nbsp;— features over 200 cards, many of which reuse art from previously released physical sets. But the pulls most players will likely be keen on hunting for are the new immersive cards, which allow you to essentially dive into their art in order to see details that wouldn’t normally be visible.</p><p>Because collecting (rather than battling) is what initially draws a lot of people to the physical card game, Creatures Inc. and game developer DeNa wanted that to be the game’s main selling point, particularly for folks who haven’t been tapped into the franchise for a while.</p><p>“There’s a kind of a wide audience out there of people who, in general, maybe aren’t interacting with Pokemon cards right now,” Creatures creative director Ryo Tsujikawa explained during a Q&amp;A session. “That’s what we were thinking about with [<em>Pocket</em>] being in a game / app form — that we would be able to reach a wider audience including people who might have played when they were younger.”</p><p>Though <em>Pocket </em>shares a number of similarities with <em>Pokémon TCG Live </em>— another mobile game where users can redeem codes from physical packs to receive digital copies — the idea for an app focused entirely on digital cards began coming into focus right around the time <em>Pokémon Go </em>was first released. Executive corporate officer Keita Hirobe said that making the game more approachable and keeping its barrier to entry low were two of The Pokémon Company’s biggest priorities during development. And for those simply looking for a casual way to dip a toe into the <em>Pokémon </em>waters, it can be as simple as opening the app and seeing what the RNG has in store.</p><p>Ripping into a pack by sliding your finger across its top edge is actually a pretty satisfying experience, accompanied by a soft rumble intended to replicate the feel of tearing into a packet of foil stuffed with shiny bits of cardboard. The packs themselves (which aren’t guaranteed to contain rare cards like their physical counterparts) can be flipped over before you open them, giving you the choice of revealing the last (rarest) card first. And while you can reveal the cards one by one to build suspense, the game also allows you to tilt them while they’re still stacked in order to sneak a peek at their borders, which are one of the indicators of a card’s rarity.</p><p>Even though <em>Pocket </em>will give players two packs a day (one every 12 hours) for free, folks coming from the physical card game where booster packs contain 10 randomized cards may balk at the mobile pack’s five — a number that may change in the future. But for those looking to fill out their card-dexes more quickly, the game will also offer players the option to purchase Poké Gold — an in-game currency that can be used to buy more packs or reduce the countdown timer between receiving your free packs for the day. Bundles of Poké Gold start at 99 cents. Additionally, there will be an optional monthly Premium Pass $9.99 subscription that grants players a free third daily pack and access to promotional cards.</p><p>Though Poké Gold and subscription sales sound like key components to The Pokémon Company’s plan for <em>Pocket</em>’s profitability, from what I’ve seen, there’s still quite a bit available to players who don’t spend. You can start learning the basics of the game’s new streamlined battle system using premade Rental Decks and fighting against computer opponents. And once you have enough cards of your own, you can start building customized decks to use against other players in the game’s online mode.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas the traditional <em>Pokémon TCG </em>involves two people facing off with decks consisting of 60 cards each, <em>Pocket </em>streamlines things by making decks much smaller and simplifying battle mechanics in order to keep things moving at a brisk pace. Damage is now automatically calculated by the game’s computer, and the first player to earn three points by knocking out their opponent’s pokémon (regular pokémon count for one point while EX monsters count for two) wins.</p><p>Though Tsujikawa stressed that <em>Pocket</em>’s development team is mainly focusing on the game’s collection aspect at launch, they understand that more competitive play is something users may be interested in as new expansions are introduced. There are no concrete plans just yet for <em>Pocket </em>to become a new fixture at the Pokémon World Championships, but it’s not hard to imagine the app fitting in right alongside <em>Pokémon Go </em>and the physical card game.</p><p>That could be necessary for giving the game some longevity once the initial lure of pure collecting wears off. And when <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> launches on October 30th, that might be enough to make the app a hit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-flying-emote-glitch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-players-are-flying-across-the-map-thanks-to-a-new-emote-glitch.985449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-flying-emote-glitch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Helldivers 2’s latest patch has brought along an emote glitch that allows players to fly across the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/Helldivers subreddit, a user has posted about the Helldivers 2 emote glitch. The player walks off a bridge to perform this glitch while spamming the emote key. If you time it well, your character can fly across the entire map while performing awkward squats mid-air. However, it doesn’t seem too easy to replicate, as one of the teammates in the video died instantly while trying.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The players in the comment section are not disappointed with this glitch, with some calling it a new Stratagem. Interestingly, the game director of Helldivers 2, Johan Pilestedt, has also replied to this post, with the Homer Simpson disappearing in bushes GIF. Many have responded to the game director’s comment, asking him to add the glitch as a new mechanic or game mode.</p>



<p>The glitch seems to have arrived with Helldivers 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/7147864422081646859?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch 1.001.100</a>, which featured a major overhaul of Anti-Tank, Armor Penetration, Health and Armor Values, weapon and stratagem balancing, and much more. Since then, the developers have also issued a <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1836403196903801169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hotfix</a> to address crashes and the shield generator bug. However, the flying emote glitch hasn’t been fixed yet.&nbsp;</p>

The studio has been working closely with Lucasfilm Games, leveraging a partnership that gave it access to an archive of unseen Indiana Jones material and drew upon the knowledge of experts.</p><p>"We’ve been in weekly meetings with Lucasfilm," creative director Axel Torvenius said to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/sep/17/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-video-game-film-machinegames" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>. "From audio [to] design, narrative, art, they've been an invaluable resource. They are the experts on Indiana Jones and everything that goes with it. We even gained access to their archive, really old and rare material, early concept art from Raiders, rare photos from sets."</p>

      </div>
<p>Set a year after the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Great Circle is aiming to look and feel like a globetrotting adventure. There'll be puzzles to solve, far-off locations to visit, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-continues-machinegames-proud-tradition-of-pummeling-nazis/1100-6526067/" data-ref-id="1100-6526067">Nazis to clock in the face</a>.

However, none of that prepared us for the central mechanic of filming, nor were there many external references for filming as a mechanic (shoutouts to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Michigan: Report from Hell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">)</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The reason for that, it turns out, is because it's a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>very </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">complicated mechanic to pull off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Photography as a mechanic has evolved a lot over the years; we wanted to credit in particular games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Umurangi Generation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Rising</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for informing our thought process. However, the thing about photography mechanics, as opposed to filming mechanics, is that you only ever have to analyze and grade a single frame at a time. Filming requires you to analyze and grade dozens of those frames every second, and then to display all that information to the player in a way that is at the very least parsable, and ideally actually fun. Again, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>complicated.</span></span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Season 0">Season 0</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early in production, the concept was for the player to both record and then</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">edit footage. And while conceptually very cool, it was also a technical nightmare. This was primarily because recording footage, with decent framerate and at a reasonable quality, required a lot of memory, and disk space overhead from the video card. Then it came to actually trying to analyze and catalog what was filmed. One system we tried was to buffer the last few seconds of film, determine if anything "interesting" happened during that time, and discard it if not. But how we could tell if something was interesting, or what "interesting" even was, was extremely difficult to determine.</span></p><p>Image via Devolver Digital.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, from a pure player perspective, we realized it was nearly impossible to provide feedback to the player during both the filming and editing phases, as they were only graded on their final edit. Once the show had aired, you'd just throw a mountain of feedback at the player and hope they could parse it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Solving this meant cutting the editing phase entirely, which in turn reframed the entire show as a livestream. This provided great relief at the technical level and a diegetic way to provide real-time feedback via viewer numbers and comments. But this process also pointed to perhaps our biggest design issue.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="One man's trash TV">One man's trash TV</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We at no point wanted to define what "good" or "bad" TV was, as especially in reality TV, that definition can be so variable. However, we also knew the fail state of the game was having the show canceled, and that meant rating the player's footage. These two ideas felt</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">both contradictory </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> necessary for a long time, until we focused fully on the idea of the audience themselves. Or, more specifically, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>multiple </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">audiences.</span></p><p>Image via Devolver Digital.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having multiple audiences, each having their own satisfaction criteria and identities, suddenly absolved us as developers of having </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>objective </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">opinions about what constituted "good" reality TV. In fact, this system enabled us to allow for nearly any type of reality TV viewer's opinion to be represented (if in a heightened form). More importantly, it was fun! We coined the terms "Thirsts" that needed to be "quenched" to simplify the language (leading to the senior programmer in charge of implementing this system, Ben Obikoya, to utter the infamous phrase "Thirst-Person Shooter"). And further, giving audiences emojis and comments not only provided hints for their thirsts, but further defined and differentiated them.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Ways of seeing">Ways of seeing</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the design was honed in, we also needed to tackle the technical problem of determining what the player was actually filming. Where this started was Viewership Tags, or VTags, that represented any information we'd want to detect when on camera. On the simple end these were things like "Butt", "CastMember" and "Lighthouse" which were emitted by Filmables, initially just simple sphere colliders parented to the relevant object.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But given that this system couldn't account for objects being hidden behind other objects, alongside the fact that our cast and house are not wholly composed of spheres, we knew we needed a more accurate representation of the camera's view that we could analyze. Lead programmer Neil Goodman took inspiration from an old mouse-picking algorithm that renders each object in the scene a different color and then checks the color of the pixel underneath the mouse to identify the object.</span></p><p>Image via Devolver Digital.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, at a low frame rate (5fps), the game was rendered to a small (320x180) off-screen texture using a special shader. The shader used a solid red color for objects of no interest, and the green and blue channels were used to encode the unique ID of a Filmable object. For transparent objects, we would apply small levels of red to objects behind them, as it wouldn't adjust the underlying blue/green values. Thus, by reading the texture back from the GPU and iterating over every pixel, we could not only determine which filmables were the screen but even other metrics, like how many windows they were behind or how much screen space they took up.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Regarding the brains of others">Regarding the brains of others</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet as we answered these major technical and design questions, finer points lingered, like how we should stop players from just filming the same content over and over again or how we should stop some audiences from being inherently easier to satisfy than others (there aren't always fistfights, but there are always butts). Our greatest problem was c</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ommunication</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A sea of iteration bridged us between our pre-prod version and our latest, yet what had never received specific focus was how the player would understand any of these systems. We realized that in all our attempts to "solve" this mode of gameplay, we had forgotten to fully consider the player's expectations and understanding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thus, UI designer Emma Morin and game/level designer Finn Carney took on landing the final iteration. To start, the decision was made not just to strip back as much of the iconic "camcorder" UI as possible, but essentially nix the idea that anything needed to be "diegetic". This was a strange and new system, and we needed space for comments, cast tasks, icons and subtitles. Anything gained by trying to give it a grounded aesthetic would be lost when none of it was legible.</span></p><p>Image via Devolver Digital.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And on the opposite side, any thirsts currently being satisfied now had a big, juicy, pulsating icon of the relevant audience put on top of them, along with the player now given points for every second they filmed it (prior to this, the player had only been given points after fully quenching a thirst). This does encourage players to squeeze as much into every frame as possible, and in turn, can cause a decent amount of screen clutter. But if players expect to be rewarded for something, we decided they simply should be. Who were we to tell them they were filming too much?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Extra systems were added as a means of smoothing out the balance. A quenched thirst would be "drained" for a short period of time, encouraging players to find other shots to film. "Overflow" had points players continued to gain for an already satisfied audience go to currently unsatisfied audiences instead. The "Swap Out" mechanic meant audiences with no points would be replaced by a random new audience with a lower point threshold. Finally, the "On Fire" mechanic gave the player extra points for satisfying multiple audiences at once, providing not just the material encouragement but the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>juice</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to encourage players to adopt the kind of maximalist filming style the game best rewarded.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Through the lens">Through the lens</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we dialed in these final changes, our focus shifted, ironically, to what the entire system centered on: the camera itself. We had specifically been avoiding focusing on it til the game loop was settled enough to ensure its functions were relevant to our final design. Some mechanics were easy to decide on (is there any camera game without a zoom?). Others, less so. For example, Depth of Field.</span></p><p>Image via Devolver Digital.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some photography games have manual depth-of-field sliders, and some members of our team </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>really </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">wanted one for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, especially as many early thirsts centered on focus. But given the rapid pace of the game, players were prone to, at best, ignoring it entirely or, at worst, accidentally getting stuck with a blurry screen for the rest of the game. Thus, we shipped with only our auto-focus feature, with thirsts changed to ignore focus level so that the player wasn't punished for something out of their direct control.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A major element that was only prioritized near the end was how objects were framed. We decided that position in frame was not necessarily a "fun" gameplay mechanic (see: every complaint about Pokémon Snap requiring you to center your subject in frame). &nbsp;Instead, we used the proportion of screen pixels that filmables contribute to assign a framing size. This not only meant that we could have a threshold for minimum framing size, and thus only generate VTags for objects that the camera could meaningfully see, but it also opened the space for thirsts that required things being especially large in frame, like close-ups on faces, art, or butts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our Target Lock feature, which allows players to essentially "lock on" to the cast, stemmed from accessibility concerns. We knew the game would attract players who might not usually play first-person games, and allowing them to essentially "orbit" around cast members let them focus on movement and framing without needing to be adept at camera control. As an extra fun fact, leaning as a part of Target Lock was nearly cut multiple times. It was only because our first press demo resulted in multiple journalists specifically mentioning our Film Students "Dutch Angle" thirst that we kept it in, despite that being the only thirst to utilize that feature.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Rear Window">Rear Window</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were a lot of dead-ends and U-turns as we honed in our approach to filming in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but if our learnings could be summarized, it'd be this:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On one hand, especially when exploring new modes of gameplay, the easiest option is often the best one. Whether it was making actually recording and editing footage fun and technically feasible or finding an objective score for art, if a problem feels too big, it probably is. Every step we took to cut down these big issues not only saved us from the dev hell of never being able to solve them, but opened up massive new opportunities in our filming gameplay to explore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Equally, always think through the lens of the player. An intricate and perfectly thought-through system, or a deep level of control over every aspect of a system, doesn't matter unless the player can understand it and have fun with it. Figure out how your player is meant to interface with your game first, then design complexity within what they can meaningfully engage with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">None of us are under any illusion that we </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>solved</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> filming as a gameplay mechanic. In fact, we all have plenty of critiques about how the final design landed. But all of us are proud for having meaningfully explored the possibility space of this genuinely challenging to design but also just really fun mechanic, and in turn we are all deeply looking forward to whoever tackles it next.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it is suing&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair for "patent infringement", seeking an injunction against said infringement alongside "compensation for damages".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notice for the lawsuit on its official website</a>, Nintendo says that&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>"infringes multiple patent rights" it holds, although the Japanese gaming giant naturally doesn't go into any more detail regarding what those patents might be.</p>
<p>The notice is characteristically brief; Nintendo concludes by simply saying that it "will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights, including the Nintendo brand itself". That <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-garrys-mod-takedowns">sounds like</a> Nintendo, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-sues-creators-of-switch-emulator-yuzu">alright</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=SFylnIaY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=xR2pOE33 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo has turned its ever-present legal gaze on&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair.</figcaption></figure><p>Responding to the lawsuit <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1836692701355688146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Pocketpair says it is currently "unaware of the specific patents" it's being accused of infringing, and Nintendo has not "notified" the studio of these details.</p>
<p>Pocketpair goes on to say that it is "truly unfortunate" for the studio to have to "allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development" as a result of the lawsuit, but that the developer is determined to make sure fellow studios "are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas".</p>
<p>This may well be the culmination of a promise issued by The Pokemon Company back in January, whereupon the media giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-company-issues-statement-about-palworld-as-game-passes-8-million-copies-sold">said it would investigate</a> any potential infringement on its intellectual property rights pertaining to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>wasn't named in that declaration, but context strongly suggested it was the game to which The Pokemon Company was referring. The announcement of the lawsuit arguably adds further fuel to that particular fire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-exploration.jpg?itok=YKRLRyHD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-exploration.jpg?itok=uC-KL9KW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was released earlier this year.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is, it's an open-world survival action-RPG developed by Japanese indie studio Pocketpair. Released earlier this year, the game sees players befriending (or potentially enslaving)&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-esque creatures called Pals.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>allows you either to pit your Pals against other wild Pals or trainers, and you can also recruit them to help you build your base. You can, as Pocketpair says on the game's Steam page, "even sell them or eat them" if you wish.</p>
<p>Although comparisons were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-show-more-pokemon-like-mayhem-how-you-cook-them">immediately drawn to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>arguably bears more of a resemblance to games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>, although Nintendo clearly doesn't think so.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9nkv34xdw014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

"Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim says Krafton wanted to "acquire as many people as possible from Tango to continue their legacy," with the studio having been </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-closes-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-alpha-dog-studios">shuttered by Microsoft in May</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The South Korean company, best known for developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was also rather smitten with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and sought to acquire the IP to develop sequels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fans really want to see sequels, we negotiated with Tango Gameworks' parent company [Microsoft] to acquire that IP as well," he continues. According to Kim, the sudden shutdown of Tango Gameworks left employees "anxious," which is pushing Krafton to complete the deal as soon as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted to make sure the deal happen fast to minimize that gap in their career," he adds. Kim says the scale and complexity of a conglomerate like Microsoft meant it was difficult to move quickly, but noted the Xbox maker was "open" to the sale of both the studio and its IP.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given Krafton felt the move was time sensitive, the company focused on purchasing the Hi-Fi Rush franchise as opposed to Tango's entire IP slate–which also includes The Evil Within and Ghostwire Tokyo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much. Krafton is a pretty big company, but Microsoft is very complicated," he says. "We wanted to help the team continue developing their games, but especially </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. When I think about our fans, I think what they really care about is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sequels."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The acquisition is still being finalized, preventing Kim from disclosing how much Krafton has spent on the Japanese studio. He did, however, describe the purchase as "not too expensive, or too cheap either."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We cannot really translate the volume into money. It's more about the significance," he adds. "The dollar amount was not really important to Microsoft."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1823815934458650940">It was previously reported by Game File</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that Krafton has brought over 50 employees from Tango Gameworks, representing around half of the development team as it existed under Microsoft. The aim now is to help the studio rescale and perhaps even expand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think a minimum of 100 people [is what we're aiming for]. We have to scale it to around that size. That's a minimum requirement to continue developing the franchise. Or perhaps they'll need a bigger team. We haven't decided on that, but we don't plan to reduce the size of the team at all," says Kim.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They have to work on new projects as well, so there is a great possibility the team will scale up even further."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Krafton boss hoping to acquire more studios like Tango Gameworks">Krafton boss hoping to acquire more studios like Tango Gameworks</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for what expectations Krafton has for the studio, Kim hopes to champion creativity without fear of failure. He claims Krafton will strive to take risks to produce titles that feel innovative rather than derivative. "We're trying to increase our portfolio lineup and Tango Gameworks comes into play [there]," he says, noting that many of Tango's previous games "may not even have broken even."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can't acquire Tango Gameworks based on their financials or their numbers, right? We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank," he continues. "But it's part of our attempt. We have to keep trying [to develop games] in the spirit of challenge-taking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Tango Gameworks are creative. They want to try something new, and we want to do more of that. [Making] video games is really a hit or miss industry, and that is risk taking. But having more project lineups is actually a way to mitigate risk, because one of them might work out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When pressed on whether </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a commercial success for Microsoft, Kim says he doesn't know exactly how much the game earned, but when considering production costs he feels it might not have delivered a substantial return.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Did it add a lot of money to Microsoft? That might not be the case," he says. "I'm not saying I know how much they made–this is just my guess. But the IP itself was very fresh [and featured] new types of gameplay. I know it's not a game a lot of studios were making, and we have to keep trying [that approach]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kim suggests corporations like Krafton shouldn't aspire to deliver an infinite procession of chart-topping hits, largely because that's a wildly unrealistic aim. Instead, he feels the goal should be to "break even" while nurturing creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Just recoup the production costs, please, is what I say. But that in itself is a pretty big challenge. If you try doing that, you might actually land a big hit. I don't trust people who say 'oh, this is going to be a hit.' I want someone who can try something new," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The big hit shouldn't be your goal. If you think about it that way, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hi-Fi Rush</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might have brought in a little bit of a minus in terms of the financials, but it's a team that should be encouraged to create something new and continue their journey.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/reforj-is-a-sandbox-survival-game-from-former-minecraft-console-devs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Former Minecraft console developers 4J Studios has announced Reforj, a fresh spin on the blocky sandbox survival game, with exploration, crafting and discovery at its core.</p>
<p>Reforj is being built on the studio’s new in-house Elements Engine, which has been designed from the ground up to enable voxel-based graphics and a sandbox that you can bend to your will, as well as online multiplayer. The studio had announced the Elements Engine a few months ago, though has now confirmed that it’s Reforj that they’re building within it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing... the Elements Engine" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wa7rTm56bw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is currently in a pre-alpha stage, but 4J are keen to start building a community around their project and will build it alongside their feedback.</p>
<p>4J Studios spent the better part of the 2010s bringing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/minecraft">Minecraft</a> to consoles, with a hand in the original 360 release, then PS3, Xbox One, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U and the initial Nintendo Switch edition of the game. However, their time working on the game came to an end as Mojang decided to move on from the console editions that they had produced, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/09/minecraft-bedrock-edition-ps4-release-date-free-updae-1-14/">aiming to unite the player base on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition instead</a> – something not universally pleasing to fans, it should be said.</p>


<p>Of course, there’s pretty much no way that Reforj can really contend with the vast player base and mindshare that Minecraft has built up, as one of the best-selling video games of all time, but 4J Studios could absolutely carve a little niche out from that and still be very successful. The key will be striking a balance between familiarity to Minecraft’s core formula, making adjustments and improvements to that, and introducing new idea of their own.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-price-test-consequences/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-price-is-a-test-to-see-customer%E2%80%99s-tolerance-a-bad-press-cycle-may-not-have-many-lasting-consequences.985377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-price-test-consequences/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's high price is likely a test of customers' tolerance for highly-priced gaming hardware, and the related bad press cycle could be part of Sony's bigger strategy for the future.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Massive Damage Studios art director Bryan Meemskerk made some interesting observations about the upcoming system. According to the developer, Sony made a lot of good hardware decisions for its current generation mid-generation refresh, with one exception: the lack of a disc drive. While this sounds like a tone-deaf decision, considering the system is aimed at a hardcore audience, the same audience that mostly buys physical games, the lack of a disc drive is as much of a test as the high price is. As the attachable disc drive is essentially sold out almost everywhere, now Sony knows that there's demand for this type of accessory and may release a discless PlayStation 6 compatible with the PS5's attachable disc drive.</p>
<p>The most important test, however, remains the PlayStation 5 Pro's high price. Bryan Meemskerk noted how Sony likely saw what NVIDIA and Apple did in recent times and attempted to follow suit. In the case of NVIDIA, the company did not suffer any major consequences from a cycle of bad press caused by the high price of some of its top-of-the-line products. On the contrary, Meemskerk pointed out that consumers tend to forgive when the price of next-generation hardware is slightly lower than that of the previous generation, making the negative press cycle over an expensive halo product ultimately inconsequential and possibly worthwhile. Also, the high cost of the PlayStation 5 Pro could make the base console more appealing due to its lower price.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Developer Analysis, AMD Zen 5 Fine Wine, RDNA 4, UDNA | Bryan Heemskerk | Broken Silicon 275" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5v-U_Dk5oRA?start=653&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro's price is undoubtedly high for a gaming console, the system offers plenty of improvements over the base system that will allow for smooth 60 FPS at 4K resolution. As highlighted by an early analysis shared online <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">yesterday</a>, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be among the existing PS5 games that will benefit the most from the system's better specs.</p>

            <p>The mad lads at Square Enix have released a demo for their remake of 90s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven</a>, in which you play a whole dynasty of customisable protagonists fighting vengeful ancient heroes. It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complimentary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday. </p><!--more-->

<p>The demo gives you the beginning of the tale, ending with a battle against Kzinssie, one of the aforesaid malingering heroes. New to SaGa and worrying that you’ll need to play the first one before sampling the remake? Be of good cheer, my child: according to producer Shinichi Tatsuke, Revenge Of The Seven “has no connection to the rest of the SaGa franchise in terms of worldview or storyline” and “is designed to be easy to pick up even for beginners” thanks to some apparently ample tutorials and a choice of difficulty modes.</p>
<p>We ran through some of the remake’s new features in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-are-remaking-a-classic-90s-rpg-about-defending-an-empire-from-a-bunch-of-spiteful-ancient-heroes">our announcement post</a>, but I cannot expect you, a weary denizen of websites, to swim back through the sluggish tides of the internet and peruse something we published a whole <em>three months ago</em>. As Revenge Of The Seven’s story demonstrates, time marches forever onward, grinding away at the cartilage in the very finger joints we might use to click on links to the past. So here’s Tatsuke’s just-circulated breakdown instead. I hope your finger joints are still functioning well enough to scroll the page:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a lot of new features in this remake! There are new episodes from the Seven Heroes’ pasts, the battle system has been updated with increased strategic elements through United Attacks and the timeline, we’ve added new areas for character growth with abilities, plus new classes, new formations, new techniques, and new spells. There’s also upgraded facility development and equipment crafting in the game, in addition to new mini-games, such as the University Exams and Mr. S Finder. I’m also happy to share we’ve added three difficulty modes to choose from, fully voiced event scenes with English and Japanese voice acting, the soundtrack has been completely redone, and we’ve included the option to toggle between the rearranged version and the original retro music… There’s quite a lot, and even more for players to discover in the full game!</p></blockquote>
<p>Tatsuke also has some advice for battle – strike at enemy weaknesses to fill up an Overdrive gauge and perform a big-ass United Attack, basically – and some comments on the Lineage system, which is the aspect of Revenge Of The Seven I find most intriguing, inasmuch as it pongs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings</a>.</p>
<p>“There is a limit to the techniques, spells and such powers that a single emperor can learn,” he notes. “However, these powers can be passed down through generations to emperors of various classes, which will ultimately help birth emperors with overwhelming powers. You’ll need to accumulate several generations worth of power and experience in order to defeat all of the Seven Heroes.”</p>
<p>OK, so it doesn't quite sound like there are the raw materials for another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-a-crusader-kings-3-ruler-with-every-setting-on-maximum">Gigaknight Excelsior</a> here, but I live in hope of some kind of surprise in-breeding mechanic and a touch of filial backstabbing. Failing that, the combat system looks fairly jolly and there are a lot of classes and abilities to pick from.</p>
<p>The Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven remake will launch on 24th October 2024. The team behind it also worked on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gather-your-party-and-venture-forth-in-trials-of-manas-free-demo%E2%80%9D">Trials Of Mana remake</a>, which appears to be popularly regarded as a “good game”. If you own one of those "Switch" things and have access to Nintendo's eShop, I hear the demo is also available there too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm in the cat shelter and the woman you play as, Olive, is coughing and the screen is going blurry. The elderly woman in the cat shelter is ill and the music is sad and it is so shameless that I cannot stop howling. At least I got to pick which epic skin I wanted for my cat.</p>

<p>As someone who recently adopted a cat, this is what happened: I filled in a normal, boring form, had a phone call, someone popped round to make sure I didn’t have any pythons, and I got a cat. Note how the shelter's letterhead just says 'cat shelter', and also note how the contents of the form read like they were written at the point of a gun, held by a cat. </p>
<p>I’m the cat now. Olive lets me out in her house and feeds me a bowl of food that looks like soggy Wotsits. The telephone rings, and the game breaks into a sort of Far Cry 3 drug sequence where I have to run away scared from the ringing. I hide under some cabinets. The phone call was Olive’s daughter saying how worried she was about Olive’s illness. Olive asked for a hug afterward and the game gave me two options, both of which involved refusing to offer comfort to this dying elderly woman. Olive sadly bumbles out of the room, then tells me she’s leaving the house to go to the pharmacy. She’s ill, remember.</p>
<p>When she’s gone, I steal her chicken. This is an objective, by the way. I don’t get a say in the matter.</p>

<p>I knock some of Olive's precious possessions asunder and then find a brochure for a retirement home in the bin. Also, there's another voice message from her daughter trying to convince her to go into care. No! Don’t send Olive to environmental storytelling meadows! She’ll pull through!</p>
<p>Screw it. Off to find more food.</p>

<p>Yep. Classic bathroom sausage. Here's a Steam description:</p>
<blockquote>We follow the tale of Dawn, a sceptical shelter cat who would much rather be in the wild than be readopted again. Dawn actually believes she is a wild cat. And plans on escaping as soon as she gets the chance.
Wander alleyways, fences and rooftops as you learn about the true meaning of home. The reflective pacing of the game allows you the opportunity to indulge in the emotions of love, loneliness and letting go as you progress throughout the story.</blockquote>
<p>Me? I’m broken. The game has broke me. There’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622350/Copycat/">demo on Steam</a>, if you're emotionally prepared for it.</p><figure>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-takes-tears-of-the-kingdom%E2%80%99s-creativity-to-a-new-dimension.985356/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-takes-tears-of-the-kingdoms-creativity-to-a-new-dimension<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For many fans, a Zelda game where you <em>actually</em> play as Zelda is enough reason to be excited for the latest instalment, but The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom truly shines by showing what we can expect from the series in a post-Tears of the Kingdom world. </p><p>Solving puzzles has always been at the heart of this iconic Nintendo franchise since it began in 1986, but as the series evolved, so too did the puzzles Link was tasked with finding solutions to. We first saw this major change in Breath of the Wild with tests and shrines dotted across the map for pit stop–speed challenges. Its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, evolved this into new building mechanics like Ultrahand and Fuse, transforming Hyrule into a sandbox, with a world intuitively designed in its verticality and obstacles to require all kinds of creative contraptions. This synergy between a versatile range of abilities and a cohesive open world design carries on into the future of traditional top down Zelda with Echoes of Wisdom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/switch-lozeow-mediapreviews-broll-002-scrn-1725980140402.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>No rest for the wise...</figcaption></figure></output><p>Set in the familiar land of Hyrule, our expected hero, Link, has been lost and it is up to Zelda to traverse the world, defeat monsters, and overcome challenging dungeons using the “echoes” she learns on her adventures. This new summoning power is granted by Tri, the helpful companion of our journey, and the staff bestowed to our heroine called the Tri Rod. Echoes range from inanimate objects you may find by snooping in the homes of villagers, such as beds and pots and tables, to the many fearsome foes you face on your travels, like Keese and Moblins. Every echo has a cost, which depending on Tri's power level, means you're limited by how many echoes you can have active at once. Beds can be slept in to recover health, pots can be hidden in for stealth missions, and rocks can be hurled at foes in a pinch. When defeated for the first time,  foes can be learned as echoes, and when summoned, are loyal to you, but they will retain their animalistic instincts and desires so may not always act as you wish. For example, devouring the meat you laid down to distract a marauding Moblin – you can eat your fill after the giant, spear chucking pig is vanquished, thank you. Each new echo we acquired during our time with the game left us wondering what new one would surprise us further down the line, especially given the vast variety already at our disposal. </p><p>These quirks and behaviours unique to each echo keep them interesting and bring the world to life as you discover new methods and combinations for achieving your goals. Just as in Tears of the Kingdom you could scale a mountain by building a great structure out of trees, or a rocket fuelled launch pad, Echoes of Wisdom lets you create stairs out of assorted furniture, trampolines on top of trampolines, or a helpful Strandtula to shoot you a rope of web. Combat is less about overwhelming the enemy with brute force and instead deciphering the best natural predator of the target in front of you. Snake-like Ropes can slither between airborne assaults whereas the sharp spines of a Sea Urchin can pierce a Darknut’s armour. Or just brute force it and pelt them with rocks. The possibilities feel endless, and with echoes constantly replenishing their uses you can experiment with all kinds of bizarre setups. I’m sure we’ll be seeing a new wave of nefarious set ups on social media, as Zelda is seen setting her kingdom of furnishings ablaze and gliding to safety on the wings of a Keese.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/switch-lozeow-mediapreviews-broll-020-scrn-1725980180853.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Friendly Ropes can help you overcome any fear of snakes</figcaption></figure></output><p>Whilst echoes are the bread and butter of the game, much like Ultrahand and Fusing were for Tears of the Kingdom, Zelda has a few more abilities in her already expanded arsenal. Bind grants control over the objects you cannot echo, like giant boulders, moving platforms, or unique features of a puzzle. When an object is bound to Zelda, it moves with her, meaning clever positioning when the ability is activated is essential to success. So far we’ve seen it used to remove obstacles, place objects on switches, and to create barriers from unwanted attacks. Given that these objects do not expire like echoes do, combining the powers may help you build higher than before and achieve more creative setups. You can also bind echoes, which is helpful for moving things you don’t want to touch, like flaming shrubs, around. Reverse Bond is, as the name suggests, the opposite of Bind in that it allows objects to move Zelda. Things with their own momentum, such as a moving platform or even a crawling critter, can be reverse bonded to and will travel Zelda with it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/switch-lozeow-mediapreviews-broll-016-scrn-1725980216790.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Reverse Bond is handy for covering great chasms</figcaption></figure></output><p>For those already missing our fabled swordsman, do not fret, as Zelda can also tap into the power of Link’s blade when she needs to by transforming into Swordfighter Form. After fighting an imposter to reclaim Link’s sword, Zelda can enter a glowing blue state and use new powers for a limited time, laying waste to enemies with slashes and spin attacks. This is not a core ability like echoes or bind, and from what we’ve seen is not necessary for solving puzzles or besting bosses, but a nice addition when you need a power boost against a ferocious horde or just want a dramatic climax to a battle. The energy required to enter Swordfighter Form can be found in the still world or by defeating rift enemies but charging the metre is still a slow task, so you’ll want to use it wisely. Similar to how Tears of the Kingdom allowed you to use powerful weapons and devices to creatively circumvent challenges, if you took the time to locate them, Echoes of Wisdom has a few extras and power ups that let you rain destruction should that be your approach. Drinkable smoothies and deployable automatons shown off in trailers are going to grant Zelda healing and buffs or can be unleashed in battle for dramatic effects, respectively. Automatons, robotic replicas of foes with a few added upgrades, can be broken in combat and then need to be repaired, similar to how the durability of weapons and battery-life on builds in Tears of the Kingdom require a little resource management.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/switch-lozeow-mediapreviews-broll-015-scrn-1725980242565.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Who wore it better?</figcaption></figure></output><p>With all of these abilities, a vast catalogue of echoes, and an army of creatures at her command, adventuring and overcoming threats in the world of Hyrule feels fresh and exciting. Traditional locales you’d expect, such as the Gerudo Desert and Eldin Volcano, return but have been made with Zelda’s new powers in mind. There are more vertical elements, terrain hazards, and weather conditions than previous top down titles, instead resembling recent games. The overworld feels more like that Tears of the Kingdom hybrid between a giant puzzle and a sandbox, allowing player creativity and experimentation to shine. Dungeons retain that more focused puzzle solving objective, alongside the new Still World–a dimension that bends the laws of physics with floating islands and areas shifted onto their side. These sections allow for creative platforming which both challenges players and teaches them new tricks to take back into Hyrule.</p><p>Given the leaps in creativity and mechanics the series has made in recent titles, it’s exciting to see the return to the top down style of Zelda embrace this as well as having a playable princess. Echoes of Wisdom takes elements of Tears of the Kingdom and develops them into something fresh which stands on its own two feet. If Tears of the Kingdom is a physics test utilising forces and the laws of gravity and aerodynamics, Echoes of Wisdom is a chemical experiment pushing players to toy with different combinations in a more contained environment. It marries the classic puzzle solving that long time fans of the series adore with the outside-the-box thinking and unexpected chaos of recent games. The result is uniquely Zelda and has us eager to  discover all of the echoes and challenges the game has to offer. Whether you opt for the pillow fort you dreamed of as a child, a genius domino effect of destruction, or the humble fish attack, there’s an adventure waiting just for you.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.</blockquote><blockquote>It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.</blockquote><blockquote>We apologize to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.</blockquote><blockquote>As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair.</blockquote><p>Players are now left wondering whether Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit will force Pocketpair to remove Palworld from sale or even shut the game down. As you’d expect, the official Palworld Discord is packed with posts from players debating the likelihood of Nintendo’s success with its lawsuit, and its potential effect on the game.</p><p>After Palworld’s record-breaking launch in January and the subsequent comparisons to Pokémon, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-palworld-blows-up-could-nintendo-successfully-sue-the-controversial-pokemon-with-guns-game">IGN asked experts whether Nintendo could potentially successfully sue Pocketpair</a>. At the time, Peter Lewin, video game lawyer at Wiggin, told IGN much would depend on in which country Nintendo pursued legal action, given the differences in IP law across the globe. The U.S., for example, has a “notoriously permissive” fair use defense, which might have influenced where Nintendo sued Pocketpair. Nintendo’s lawsuit was filed in the Tokyo District Court.</p><p>Sam Castree, a copyright lawyer and avid Pokémon player, told IGN there was the potential for a court order that would block Pocketpair from selling Palworld, but cast doubt on the likelihood of a lawsuit. That analysis, however, was in the context of a lawsuit based upon copyright infringement. Nintendo’s lawsuit alleges <em>patent</em> infringement, although the company has yet to detail which patents.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pocketpair is continuing to update Palworld regardless. Just a few hours after Nintendo announced the lawsuit, Pocketpair released a hotfix for the Xbox version to fix a fatal bug where wild Pals and base Pals would sometimes stop moving and working. The developer said the same issue is happening in the Steam version, and it’s on the case.</p><p>“Thank you for your continued support of Palworld,” Pocketpair <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1836625740445683780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p><p>Replies to this tweet were quick to note the timing of the hotfix. “Please don’t ever shut down the game, ya'll killing it,” said one fan. “Y’all getting sued and posting hotfixes,” said another. “Not even phased,” added one user. “Does bro know they’re getting sued?” joked another.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle">couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip">signing a deal with Sony</a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p>This is not a publishing deal for Palworld the video game, or an acquisition by Sony, rather an attempt to make the most of the game’s huge popularity with non-video game products, such as merchandise and music. The newly formed business, headed up by Mizobe, is responsible for global licensing and merchandising activities associated with Palworld.</p><p>Speaking of Sony, Palworld is heavily rumored to be set for a PlayStation launch announcement at this month’s Tokyo Game Show, after the game popped up on a schedule. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-palworld-is-coming-to-playstation">Pocketpair teased a PlayStation release back in June</a>, so this would come as little surprise. TGS runs from September 26 to 29.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-addresses-dead-game-debate-who-cares-if-theres-only-five-people-playing">While player numbers have declined somewhat since Palworld’s explosive launch</a>, it remains one of the most-played games on Steam (Microsoft does not make Windows PC and Xbox player numbers public), sitting comfortably in the top 100 on Valve's platform.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
