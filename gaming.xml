            <p>
Following a seemingly solid launch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, there's probably a fair few series newcomers considering delving into the original trilogy. But anyone hoping for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-shares-detailed-breakdown-of-mass-effect-legendary-editions-extensive-changes">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition style remaster</a> shouldn't hold their breath; Dragon Age: The Veilguard creative director John Epler says the project "wouldn't be easy" because hardly anyone left at BioWare knows how the studio's old engine works.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> was well-received when it launched back in 2021, introducing the likes of improved performance and visuals, enhanced models, new lighting, gameplay tweaks, and more. It was a welcome finessing of a classic trilogy, and the kind of treatment most would probably agree BioWare's other beloved series deserves.
</p>
<p>
However, in a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">recent interview with Rolling Stone</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-boss-says-a-legendary-edition-style-remaster-of-the-old-games-in-the-series-is-unlikely-because-theres-maybe-20-people-left-at-bioware-who-know-how-their-engine-works/">PC Gamer</a>), Dragon Age: The Veilgaurd creative director John Epler - who's been with BioWare since the original Dragon Age's release back in 2009 - noted that while he'd love to see the trilogy get the remaster treatment, it would be a challenge due to the games' proprietary engines.

<p>
Unlike the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> trilogy, which was developed in Unreal Engine 3, Dragon Age Inquisition was created using EA's Frostbite engine, while Dragon Age 1 &amp; 2, more problematically, were built using BioWare's own Eclipse Engine. "I think I'm one of about maybe 20 people left at BioWare who’s actually used Eclipse," Epler explained. "[Remastering Dragon Age is] something that's not going to be as easy Mass Effect, but we do love the original games."
</p>
<p>
But there's perhaps some small hope for Dragon Age fans, given Epler didn't entirely shut down the idea. "Never say never," he added, "I guess that's what it comes down to."
</p>
<p>
Of course, EA's interest in giving Dragon Age the Legendary Edition treatment - and indeed its continuing interest in the series as a whole - will likely hinge on the success of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-off-to-solid-start-on-steam">appeared to get off to a solid start</a> when it launched last week. The publisher hasn't yet trumpeted any official figures, but The Veilguard did manage an all-time peak of 89,418 concurrent players on Steam, setting a new record for a single-player EA game.
</p><p>
What that means for The Veilguard's future is unclear, but speaking ahead of launch, Epler said BioWare's "full attention... has shifted entirely to the next Mass Effect", meaning it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dlc-plans-unknown-as-bioware-shifts-full-attention-to-next-mass-effect-game">no DLC plans</a>, beyond "quality-of-life improvements and a handful of smaller content updates".
</p>
<p>
Regardless of what happens next, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a bit of a treat. "What BioWare has managed to accomplish here, in the face of all the pressure it's faced since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> came out 10 years ago, is extraordinary," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">five star review</a>. "The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling. It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general. This is among the very best of them."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-alliances-review-work-together-for-even-harder-challenge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Setting out on an adventure across the world of Talisman, in a quest for the Crown of Command, has always been a perilous and lonely one. With the release of <em>Talisman Alliances</em>&nbsp;Avalon Hill flipped the formula on its head turning <em>Talisman </em>into a cooperative experience where you'll party up with all other players to take on the game itself.</p>

<h2>What is in the <em>Talisman Alliances</em> box?</h2>

<p>Opening up the <em>Talisman Alliances</em> game box you'll immediately be greeted with a warning. This warning is to indicate to you that while there's a lot present in the box, you need to be following the instructions to not only ensure how to set up the game, but what you aren't allowed to look at.</p>

<p>The box comes with instructions, Doom tracker and token, Villain Strength and Craft tokens, as well as Adventure, Spell, and Villain cards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect of this box to inquisitive players will be the Trial 1 card, the sealed envelopes, and the small boxes that state "Don't Open Until You've Completed Trial X"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-alliances-instructions.jpg?itok=jtMG1PrG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-alliances-instructions.jpg?itok=SCWyMfz7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In order to be a good cooperative game the team at Avalon Hill haven't just created a way for a party of players to have a focus for their adventure, but they have built a narrative into the game. Each Trial has an introductory story, a relevant loose plot, and a conclusion that tees up the next adventure.</p>

<p>Each subsequent trial also has an increased difficulty and allows you to not only progress the story, but also unlock new characters for the base game. I won't go too far into the spoilers but after completing Trial 1 you unlock the ghostly Will Of The Wisp character adding new mechanics and an expanded way to play not just in the cooperative expansion, but as a way to further enhance the base game.</p>

<p>In this way, <em>Talisman Alliances</em> reminded me of what I've seen for examples of game progression in titles like Frosthaven.</p>

<h2>Changes To Setup</h2>

<p>The instruction booklet shows you exactly how you're mean to set up <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd34cf48-e3d7-4dbb-ab3c-d2e1a4c191be" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-5e-review-fast-paced-high-fantasy-adventures"><em>Talisman 5e</em></a> to function as a cooperative adventure.</p>

<p>This process isn't entirely simple, requiring you to filter out a number of Adventure and Magic cards, sub in different cards from the expansion, and then add the Villain Cards in a very specific manner to the Adventure deck to allow for a better pace and balance.</p>

<p>While it might not be simple it does show how much planning went into how to take a game that has historically been very competitive and turn it into an entirely cooperative experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-alliances-active-play.jpg?itok=ZxjhcMQP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-alliances-active-play.jpg?itok=Ev1a3S3U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p>For<em> Talisman Alliances</em> the goal of the game is to complete each of the prescribed Trials. Each Trial has a sealed and an unsealed state. For example the first Trial has the players obtaining two Talismans, either from the Adventure deck or by completing the regular other Talisman-obtaining tasks, and burying those Talismans in two of the four corners of the map.</p>

<p>Completing this then unseals the Trial, flipping over the card you're now given additional instructions as well as the true villain of the Trial. While this does end up leading you to the center of the map in Trial 1 the rest of the trials take you to different objectives around the board.</p>

<p>Unsealing the Trial will also reveal the winning objective. This is a powerful creature that will have appeared somewhere on the board. Once you've built your strength up enough one, or multiple, members of the party can join up in battle to try to thwart this foe.</p>



<p>These boss fights are hard, progressing through the trials you'll see cases where these monsters aren't just stronger (with stats going into the mid to high teens) but they will also start to have additional mechanics or multiple lives. Cooperation doesn't just become a side effect of the game, but a necessity, as you start filling into certain RPG roles where you can.</p>

<p>If you were the type of competitive <em>Talisman </em>player before then interacting with the game in this way will force you to have just as competitive friends as some of these fights are a real uphill struggle.</p>

<h2>The Villains Who Try To Stop You</h2>

<p>The primary antagonists aren't the only thing getting in your way as you'll also have to deal with a number of Villains that will be roaming the board.</p>



<p>Villains act as a natural hazard around the game board, some are placed at the start of the game while others are revealed naturally as the Adventure deck is drawn from. Each of these Villains when pulled trigger a turn for the game's AI. Here Villains will progress around the board with simplistic movements until they reach a player and fight them.</p>

<p>It's in the best interest for the stronger players to try to seek out these encounters, while the squishier classes move out of the line of danger.</p>

<p>I played the Troll, a character that starts out very strong, but in a regular game of <em>Talisman </em>his low Craft and Fate would be a massive detriment. In <em>Talisman Alliances</em> where I didn't need to worry about other players preying on my weaknesses, but working to support them, it was a lot of fun coordinating attacks and grouping up to take on some of these terrifying Villain characters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-alliances-troll.jpg?itok=4mXJqnrE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-alliances-troll.jpg?itok=SFjfccLs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Talisman Alliances</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I was very interested to try playing <em>Talisman Alliances</em> after my experiences, I wondered how a game build based on competitive competition would achieve this shift and they absolutely nailed it.</p>

<p>Sure there's extra legwork to assemble/disassemble it into it's competitive game mode but the goals to complete and the way you approach even character selection is so wildly different it almost feels like playing an entirely different game.</p>

<p>I do feel like the difficulty scale probably could have started a bit easier, but after a first loss it left my table rearing for another try now that we really understood how each of us had to fit our role.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that the buy-in to this experience is not only <em>Talisman Alliances</em> but also the base <em>Talisman </em>game I'd definitely recommend trying the original first, but if the idea of playing that as a party against powerful enemies is up your alley then you'll have a blast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/john-harper-announces-blades-in-dark-deep-cuts-ttrpgs-first-official-supplement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The creator of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/blades-in-dark-review-next-level-roleplaying" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a> has announced its first official expansion. The expansion, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em>, contains new worldbuilding details for the game's setting and new alternative gameplay mechanics.</p>

<h2>The <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the game's itch page, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> is a 118-page supplement. The book is broken up into two parts. One part introduces new lore into the game's electropunk city of Duskvol. The second part contains new modular rules systems for players to use in their games.</p>

Players can choose from 100 new heritage and backgrounds to better flesh out their characters.</p>

<p>In addition, the book includes 13 new technological innovations to reflect the setting's ongoing industrial age advances. Those advancements include new rare and nefarious tech that Scoundrels can use in their next job.</p>

<p>For those wanting more dynamic elements, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> introduces a new concept: Catalysts. A Catalyst is a world-shaking event that expands and alters the setting, providing new avenues for intrigue and new opportunities for every crew type.</p>

<p>As for the modular rules, the book includes six new ones. They include flexible Harm &amp; Trauma rules, and a modified Advancement system designed to customize character progress.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the book includes a revised Load and Action system. The former is more closely tied to the game's fiction while remaining simple. The latter streamlines the base game's action resolution mechanics. It is designed to empower players further and speed up the process of play.</p>

<p><em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> is available right now in PDF form for $10.00. It is also sold in a bundle with the original <em>Blades in the Dark</em> for $27. There are currently no plans for a physical release.</p>

It’s the most recent game from the video game auteur Hideo Kojima, known for games like the genre-defining stealth series, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and it’s on sale on Steam at the moment! <strong>You’ve got till November 11 to pick up </strong><em><strong>Death Stranding Director’s Cut </strong></em><strong>for $20 on Steam, and I think it’s the perfect game for the moment.</strong></p><p>In <em>Death Stranding, </em>you play as Sam Porter Bridges, a sort of post-apocalyptic delivery man who’s tasked with trekking across the ruins of the United States of America, reconnecting the various cities and settlements you find via the erection of new infrastructure, and healing a fragmented nation. I don’t know exactly why, but something about that just feels so resonant and timely.</p><p>In <em>Death Stranding</em>, you literally walk across the country. It’s kind of abridged, because <em>that </em>version of this game would take even longer than <em>Death Stranding </em>currently is, but that is the literal goal here. There are alternative ways of traveling, including zipines that you can establish, as well as vehicles that you can eventually unlock, but the main thing you will do in <em>Death Stranding </em>is walk across plains, hike up mountains, and stumble into creeks and rivers. If you’ve ever wanted to touch grass from the safety of your bed or couch, this is the game for you.<br></p><p>When <em>Death Stranding </em>was first released in 2019, it wasn’t the most popular thing in the world. Many balked at the thought of Kojima making a game that’s essentially one big “walking simulator,” a term that’s been thrown around derogatorily for years. Though Kojima’s narratives and characters are often larger than life, <em>Death Stranding</em> appeared to steer more into the esoteric than fans of his were willing to entertain, with hokily named folks like Die-Hardman taking up significant space. Despite the fact that <em>Death Stranding </em>did feature stealth, combat, celebrities from film and TV, as well as some major set pieces, it didn’t land with the impact of a typical Kojima game, and was even viewed as a bit of a rogue move from the esteemed developer.</p><p>As always though, Kojima was simply a bit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-games-innovative-gta3-skyrim-1850976541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-innovative-gta3-skyrim-1850976541">ahead of his time</a></span>. This is after all the guy responsible for countless prescient <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>titles, specifically <em>Sons of Liberty </em>and <em>Guns of the Patriots</em>. The year after <em>Death Stranding</em>—a game about the isolation bred from the increasingly polarized political attitudes in the world, as well as a pandemic-like cataclysm—COVID-19 upended the lives of everyone around the world, initiating a global shutdown and plummeting society into a deeply isolating and dark period in our history. As people began to note the parallels between our own nightmare of a reality and the world of <em>Death Stranding</em>, the game outgrew its oddball status, took on cult acclaim, and now there’s even a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760">weird-ass sequel</a></span> on the way.</p><p>Now it’s timely all over again for, y’know, <em>other </em>reasons. Reasons for which it was also timely this time four years ago. Maybe we all ought to sit down with <em>Death Stranding </em>and learn a thing or two from Sam Bridges so that we can sidestep the cataclysms in our own lives.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’re just deep<em> Harry Potter </em>fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them.”</p><p> Those experiences include <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, which, while not officially announced yet, is a “one of the biggest priorities” for the publisher, and an HBO series that will give the original books the <em>Game of Thrones </em>treatment. Here’s an excerpt from the<em> Variety</em> piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Haddad says the games team has been coordinating some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the “Hogwarts Legacy” sequel with the storylines that will play out in the “Harry Potter” HBO series coming from Warner Bros. Television. He notes that the success of “Hogwarts Legacy” helped stoke confidence that the time was right to make a major Potter push: “The rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with ‘Hogwarts Legacy’ last year.”</p></blockquote><p>Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zazlav <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed earlier this year</a></span> that the plan was for the <em>Harry Potter </em>TV show to hit in 2026, with casting for main characters like Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley already underway. <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, meanwhile, seems unlikely to arrive until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest as big-budget games continue development timelines of 4-6 years and beyond. </p><p>The original game takes place in the 1890s, and while it’s not clear when a sequel would be set, it would likely be laying the groundwork for the particular flavor of <em>Hogwarts</em>’ history to be referenced in the TV remake, no doubt with Marvel-style easter eggs to pull fans from one to the other. </p><p>As for J.K. Rowling’s ongoing involvement in <em>Harry Potter</em>, Haddad said that while she is not directly involved in any planning related to the universe outside of the books, the controversy-courting YA author is still kept in the loop. “If we’re going to ever go beyond a canon conversation, we make sure that we’re all comfortable with what we’re doing,” Robert Oberschelp, Warner Bros.

<p>Activision has revealed that as the game passes its fifth anniversary, Call of Duty Mobile has surpassed <strong>one billion downloads</strong>, since 2019. This staggering figure makes Call of Duty Mobile the best-selling COD game ever, and it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll never be topped as long as we all live.</p>



<p>On November 6, the game’s tenth season went live, and hundreds of millions of players set about exploring another battle pass, new weapons, maps, modes, and more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-selling-call-of-duty-game-ever-made">The Best-Selling Call of Duty Game Ever Made</h2>



<p>COD Mobile is the most accessible and universally appreciated Call of Duty game ever. It has a huge esports market and competitive ecosystem, and in some areas of the world, it’s the number-one Call of Duty game, even with the traditional premium releases coming around once a year.</p>



<p>In 2019, COD Mobile was released, and today, the developers are still adding more maps, modes, and operators, allowing players to earn COD points and unlock more to flesh out their free profile. While we’re on the topic, you can check out our guide to unlock <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-cod-mobile-points/">free COD Points</a> in COD Mobile.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-mobile-season-10-fifth-anniversary-celebration-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a>, the Activision team made a small announcement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Happy 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>&nbsp;players! Thanks to you,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>&nbsp;has now reached over *ONE BILLION downloads worldwide since its launch in 2019*.</p>



<p>Join the celebration when Season 10 — 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary launches November 6 at 5 PM PT.</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Planet Coaster 2 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/planet-coaster-2-review.1028319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When we already have a theme park simulator as good as Planet Coaster, it can be tricky to imagine what a sequel might add. And Planet Coaster 2, most of the time, does feel pretty similar to the first one. That isn't necessarily a bad thing since I really liked the original. Adding water rides is exciting and refreshing, and even deeper visual customization is downright impressive, while equally daunting in how the options are presented. But this is still much more of a park decorating sim than a park management one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the recent Frontier games (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/planet-coaster-review">Planet Coaster</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/13/planet-zoo-review">Planet Zoo</a>) have really excelled is in the nearly ridiculous amount of visual customization options available. Hundreds of modular pieces that can be recolored, resized, rotated, and overlapped allow you to create just about anything you can imagine. The terrain editor is more powerful than ever here, and the tools for carving my dreams into the landscape are pretty intuitive. It does feel a bit like being thrown into the deep end, though. I get decision paralysis from the sheer amount of choice, and risk getting bogged down in making each little decoration perfect.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Planet Coaster 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't find that level of fiddliness to be as enjoyable as designing rides or running a park, but the pre-made decor doesn't quite fill the gap to where I feel like I can skip that step and still get the theming I want. Plopping down an unadorned ride feels boring, and the pre-decorated ones don't have quite enough variety. What I really found myself longing for was something in-between the extremes of fussing over every handrail and accepting unthemed or pre-themed attractions. But thanks to Steam Workshop integration – always a great addition – I'm sure the community will have me covered after the true detail masters have more time to tinker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where I do really like that fine control is when I'm building rides, and the coaster editor is more powerful and easier to use than ever. Creating banks, corkscrews, spirals, loops, and bends of all sizes feels intuitive and almost effortless thanks to the great UI. The option to automatically finish a track with one click when you're getting close to the end works really well this time around, too, and allowed me to skip the hassle of fishing for the right angle to bring everyone safely into the station.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sandbox mode presents a beautiful canvas for almost anything I can dream up.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite how much I enjoy the act of building my ideal park, the original Planet Coaster was neither challenging nor interesting as a management tycoon game, and that has unfortunately not changed. Even after messing with the difficulty settings, of which there are several, I found it almost mindlessly simple to generate infinite money with a small number of flat rides and a high entry fee. You can now sell what are basically Disney's Fast Passes as another income stream, in addition to charging extra for a pool pass on water rides. There are deeper systems for guest preferences and even things like sunburn in sunny climates, which is all neat in theory. But when I'm making so much money that I can basically ignore all of it, why would I care? Power management is also new, but why am I building generators in a theme park game? What theme park supplies its own electricity?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Staff management is still mostly hands-off, with some nice new quality-of-life features like being able to select from three different preset pay levels instead of typing in the numbers yourself. The annoying thing this time is that, unless I was entirely missing some core feature, the ride maintenance system seems to be broken currently. No matter how many mechanics I hired – at one point I had one per ride, plus a couple extra to cover breaks – I was constantly getting notifications about rides being in poor condition or breaking down. Once they <em>had </em>broken down, my staff was pretty quick to address the issue. But I'm not sure what they were doing the rest of the time. Am I supposed to manually dispatch them every time a ride drops below a certain repair level? Because they don't seem to pay attention to that until it's too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I couldn't really get my head around the scheduling screen, and the in-game tutorials are not much help. In fact, they seem to start from a point of assuming you already know how to play Planet Coaster, skipping over a lot of the basics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the sandbox mode is still the star of the show for me, presenting a beautiful canvas on which to realize almost anything I can dream up. The underwhelming management layer doesn't detract from the joy of laying out everything with ease and total freedom, building whole attractions from scratch, and getting to ride my custom coasters in glorious first-person. All of the reasons I already loved the first Planet Coaster are not only alive and well here, they have all been improved in some way. So if I sound a bit down on this sequel, it's only because I don't feel the need to go back over every single thing that was already great about this series, but you can check out my review of the first Planet Coaster for a refresher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Customizable pools, flumes, splash rides, and even water coasters open up the opportunity to create totally new kinds of parks, which kept me from feeling like I was playing the same game again but a little bit prettier. I do wish the pool editor would simply let me paint a shape rather than fiddling with polygons and a somewhat iffy rounding tool. But getting the shapes I wanted was really just a matter of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a career mode that features a handful of increasingly complex scenarios and challenges to master. It does an okay job of introducing some new concepts, like those water rides, but I still think it's missing some major steps to onboard someone who might be new to the series. Also the dialogue is just… ugh. I think I would rather listen to cats dancing on stainless steel sheeting than these painful little skits that wouldn't pass muster in most modern childrens' cartoons.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Water rides kept it from feeling like I was playing the same game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What I did like about these scenarios, similar to those in the first game, was that they show off the kinds of things you can do with the tools available to you, serving as a source of inspiration for my own parks. I was never going to stick with them once I'd earned enough stars to move on (it's just not as fun to finish something someone else already started than it is to build from the ground up), but I definitely stole a lot of cool ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance is also very respectable. Even at 4K, I was getting 60+ fps on my RTX 4070 Super most of the time, though a bit below that in the absolute most elaborate parks. I was able to do really silly stuff like recreating the Erdtree from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Elden Ring</a> using what must have been hundreds and hundreds of golden pyrotechnics, and the level-of-detail swapping refused to let my shenanigans, however ridiculous, banish my park to slideshow territory.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Creatures does share the odds of getting each card, with "rare packs" coming in at one in every 200 picks, and the rarer cards come in at just a small percentage of these.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures therefore doesn't intend for specific packs to have secret increased odds, but it's not impossible that some sort of bug connects these twisted packs with a rare card.

                <p>An upcoming indie game inspired by action films like The Raid looks to deliver on the brutal hand-to-hand combat the film is known for. It may even invoke some comparisons 2012's underappreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sleeping-dogs/" data-ref-id="5000-61973">Sleeping Dogs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/acts-of-blood/" data-ref-id="5000-631942">Acts of Blood</a>, and though it doesn't yet have a release date, it did recently receive a free demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031890/Acts_of_Blood/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> that lets players fight their way through a portion of its main story. Players step into the shoes of an Indonesian college student named Hendra, who is seeking revenge after his father is murdered by a business rival. When the government's corrupt legal system protects the killers, Hendra takes justice into his own hands and looks to make them pay for their crimes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBC1PT6UrJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gBC1PT6UrJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">A look at Acts of Blood's gameplay shows off its quick and bloody melee combat, with Hendra able to swiftly swap from punches and kicks to wielding melee weapons like bats, knives, hammers, and machetes. There are firearms as well, though the emphasis looks to be on the brutally efficient hand-to-hand combat. The environment plays a big role in combat too, with Kendra able to use parkour to run, slide, and climb through levels, as well as ustilize destructible objects in the environment as weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Eksil Team, the developer behind the game, isn't shying away from the brutality of it all. In the game's mature content description on Steam, Eksil Team states the game includes blood, gore, and dismemberment, and that the violence is "frequent and integral to the gameplay experience, with detailed and realistic portrayals of combat injuries."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/VoyagersRevenge/status/1853604780247265500" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This new Beat ‘em up game inspired by The Raid films combines 3rd person action with fast-paced martial arts, and brutal hand-to-hand combat.

If that wasn't clear from the blood-soaked fights, The Raid and its sequel, as well as Acts of Blood, all take place in Indonesia. But its focus on melee combat also brings to mind Square-Enix's Sleeping Dogs, another hand-to-hand combat-heavy action title known for its over-the-top environmental kills that was in turn inspired by Hong Kong action films. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sifu/" data-ref-id="5000-527647">Sifu</a>, a more recent beat-'em-up title, is another game Acts of Blood looks to be inspired by, though the 2022 game (despite its Mature rating) is far less blood-soaked than Acts of Blood.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to playing through some of its story, the Acts of Blood demo includes an arena mode so players can fine-tune their combat skills, as well as outfit customization that lets players tailor Hendra's look.

Not content with throwing load of <em>documented</em> new features into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> on mobile with this week's long-awaited 1.6 update, it turns out developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone also chucked in a pretty major unannounced one too; a secret experimental multiplayer mode is now available to mobile players, if they're feeling sufficiently brave.
</p>
<p>
Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853844270807175428">confirmed</a> the existence of Stardew Valley mobile's (now no longer) secret multiplayer mode in a message shared on social media, accompanying the reveal with a <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/mobile-multiplayer-guide/">detailed guide</a> on how to get it up and running. That process starts with the installation of this week's 1.6 update, available to download now, after which players will need to summon their powers of recollection and bash out the legendary Konami code - or most of it at least.
</p>
<p>
Eagled-eyed players should notice four leaves festooning Stardew Valley's title screen logo once update 1.6 is installed: the one top-right points up, the one bottom-left points down, top-left points left, and botton-right points right. With that in mind, players then need to enter the following code by tapping the corresponding leaves: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right. After that, it's simply a matter of poking the question mark at the bottom of the screen to reveal the main menu's hidden co-op session button.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Let's Play Stardew Valley Multiplayer - BEERS FOR DAYS, MATES. BEERS FOR DAYS!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytFkHZpAqh0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Let's Play Stardew Valley Multiplayer - BEERS FOR DAYS, MATES. BEERS FOR DAYS!</span>

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytFkHZpAqh0?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ytFkHZpAqh0?autoplay=1">

<p>
From there, players can choose to either join or host a new multiplayer game, but hosts will first need to set up a farm, while those joining will require the host's IP address, as detailed in Barone's instructions. Additionally, all participants must be on the same network or connecting to a player who is port-forwarding their game. It's not, then, the most straightforward of solutions, but it does have the benefit that mobile players can also join a PC-hosted game via IP.
</p><p>
Barone readily acknowledges the less-than-perfect nature of Stardew Valley multiplayer on mobile right now, noting connectivity issues "could make a multiplayer session frustrating, under certain scenarios". As such, he suggests the ideal way to play would be for mobile users to connect to a PC host using "high-end" devices on the same local network, rather than to, say, a mobile host attempting to play while on-the-go. He also warns the mode "might still have some bugs or issues", with a <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/mobile-multiplayer-guide/">few additional notes shared in his guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley's massive 1.6 update finally hit mobile and consoles earlier this week after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">launching for PC back in March</a>. It adds, among other things, the ability to guzzle mayonnaise, a new farm type, new festivals, new crafting items, new dialogue, and, perhaps most importantly, hats for cats and dogs. It also includes everything featured in Barone's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">recent 1.6.9 patch for PC</a>. All of which is to say, it's not too surprising to hear Barone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">hasn't done any additional work</a> on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, "in a long time".

			<p>Despite the Harry Potter franchise being incredibly dated at this point, it still has a considerable fanbase. As a result, more and more content within the IP continues to be released, with Hogwarts Legacy being one of the latest endeavors of Warner Bros. Not only have there been books, games, and movies, they are now branching out into a TV show, which is due to debut on HBO in 2026. However, it turns out that Warner Bros. has made Hogwarts Legacy a 'huge priority.' It's no surprise that Hogwarts Legacy ended up being the top-selling game of 2023 and has sold over 30 million units as of last month. With the success of Hogwarts Legacy, they've also released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions and a remaster of the Lego Harry Potter games.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery's Chief Financial Officer has said that a direct sequel to Hogwarts Legacy is a goal for the development team moving forward. "Obviously, a successor to Hogwarts Legacy is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road," says WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-game-warner-bros-1236130719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> at the Bank of America's 2024 Media, Communications &amp; Entertainment Conference. Although Hogwarts Legacy was quite successful, that doesn't mean that every game recently released by Warner Bros. has been. The most recent big release for the studio was Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and that did not sell very well at all. It's been considered a "miss" by the company, and it seems that they are pivoting heavily into more Harry Potter content.</p>
<p>While they have released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, it's worth noting that this game is in no way a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy, and is treated as it's own standalone title. However, it's been confirmed by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Haddad</a>, the President of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, that they are looking for ways to produce content within the Wizarding World.</p>
<p>"We have known for some time that fans are looking for more things in this world, and so we're spending a lot of time thinking about that. Our insights tell us that there are not huge distinctions between a younger version of a fan and an older version of a fan. They're just deep Harry Potter fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this IP belongs to J.K. Rowling, it's been confirmed that she is not involved with the management of the franchise but is instead receiving updates via her literary agent. It's been stated that the game development team behind Hogwarts Legacy has been working on some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the sequel, with the storylines set to play out in the Harry Potter HBO TV series. Whether this means they are directly linked and are considered a canon event seems a little bit up in the air right now.</p>
<p>Harry Potter doesn't seem to be dying any time soon, with experiences being opened in the Universal Theme Park, new games consistently being in development or released, and many new ways to create content. Hogwarts Legacy is set to get a<a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/"> remastered version</a> in the future, adding extra content for players to explore.</p>

It might not be the easiest game to get through at times due to its tough themes, but it’s remarkable nonetheless and stands out as one of this year’s best games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196055" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Despite what <em>Mouthwashing</em>’s first sequence may suggest, this isn’t really a horror game that thrives on adrenaline pumping jump scares. After running through the twisting halls of a spaceship, chased by a horse mascot, the game turns into something much more surreal and narratively dense. You will be introduced to the five person crew of the freighter ship <em>Tulpar, </em>which has been stranded in space with no hope of rescue after the captain (Curly) nearly destroyed the ship in the midst of a mental breakdown. That leaves him and the four other crew members of the <em>Tulpar</em> left to deal with their own existential crises over the likelihood of their impending deaths. </p><p>This is, to say the least, a pretty big bummer of a plot. It’s also a set up for what becomes a surrealist trip through each crew member’s lives, hopes, and struggles. While the game loosely guides you through its walking simulator-esque structure, the writing sharply dissects each character and puts their insides on display for you. You’ll come to empathize with the nervous nurse Anya, the young intern Daisuke, and even the grouchy elder Swansea.</p><figure id="" data-id="ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-recommend-id="image://ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Critical Reflex</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-recommend-id="image://ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two remaining crew members, Curly and Jimmy, will take up a majority of the game’s focus. Curly survives what appears to be a suicide attempt in the form of crashing the ship, but is now bedridden. Unable to speak or move, you interact with him only by giving him medicine. You do this in the shoes of JImmy, the co-pilot and current captain following the crash. Jimmy, at times, appears to be the only person on the <em>Tulpar</em> who still has some sanity. While the rest of the crew is coping with their imminent deaths in unique ways, Jimmy tries to hold the crew together. But <em>Mouthwashing </em>digs into Jimmy even further.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While not traditional horror, <em>Mouthwashing </em>still has hallmarks of psychological horror in its claustrophobic atmosphere and dark themes. In that way it evokes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a></span>. That comparison becomes even more apt when the truth about Jimmy becomes clear. Like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>’s James, Jimmy is not the hero he is made out to be. Rather, he is the root of the issues on board the <em>Tulpar</em>. By flashing between scenes prior to, during, and after the crash, <em>Mouthwashing </em>slowly reveals that Jimmy, not Curly, caused the crash in an attempt to kill the entire crew. This was in response to discovering Anya had become pregnant after he sexually assaulted her.</p><p>While Silent Hill 2 eventually forgives James for his crimes, and encourages the player to see him as a flawed but redeemable character, <em>Mouthwashing </em>takes no such approach with Jimmy. Despite living in his mind for the majority of the game, Jimmy is shown to be a disease amongst the crew who, even in his final moments, cannot take responsibility for his actions. As the game progresses, the slowly decaying state of the <em>Tulpar </em>and its crew members act as a reflection of Jimmy’s decaying mental state, which is further illustrated by the story’s structure becoming fractured and twisted as you progress. By <em>Mouthwashing</em>’s end, there is nothing that seems to be based in reality about Jimmy’s existence on the <em>Tulpar</em>. He cannot live with the reality of his actions.</p><hr><p>In a year of great games, many of them lengthy AAA RPGs that will take you dozens of hours to beat, <em>Mouthwashing </em>is a short but highly impactful title that you shouldn’t miss.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/old-cod-veteran-keeps-up-with-new-talent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been playing Call of Duty since 2004 – <em>Finest Hour </em>was where it began for me. In 2009, I started playing Call of Duty multiplayer, falling head over heels in love with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and swearing up and down that I was the next best COD player in the world. Since then, I’ve at least dabbled in every Call of Duty game ever made.</p>



<p>It’s a different landscape now. There is no space for the casual gamer in Call of Duty, and Black Ops 6 can be <strong>punishing </strong>at times for someone with creaky thumbs and reflexes akin to that of a geriatric sloth.</p>



<p>With that being said, this is how I, a ‘Call of Duty veteran’, try desperately to keep up with the new blood flooding what was once my favourite shooter franchise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-set-it-up-right">Set It Up Right</h2>



<p>For starters, I play on a PC that gives me the best visual advantage possible, and my frame rate is often unparalleled. It’s like a comfort blanket – if I have the FPS soaring, I feel like I’m microseconds ahead of the competition, and in a reflex shooter like Call of Duty, that could mean the difference between a win and a loss.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>I use a bog-standard Dualshock 4 controller, equipped with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-kontrol-freeks-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a set of Kontrol Freeks</a> for added accuracy (I swear it works), but I have spent years honing a <em>twist </em>to my controller layout. I use Bumper Jumper Tactical, which means I can try my best to use the age-old tactics of ‘jumpshotting’ and ‘dropshotting’ without needing one of those newfangled Scuf controllers that all the kids have.</p>



<p>It’s a game-changer, and I think I must have been using Bumper Jumper Tactical for at least five years straight in Call of Duty.</p>



<p>I’ve got the option to use my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powera-ops-v3-pro-review-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerA OPS V3</a> with all the bells and whistles, but I’m just so used to the Dualshock 4.</p>



<p>If I ever try to use a keyboard and mouse (which isn’t often), I try to rely on some of the best esports equipment I can lay my hands on, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g915-x-lightspeed-tkl-review-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logitech G915 TKL</a>.</p>



<p>From there, having a solid headset is also one of the most important plays in Call of Duty. If your setup is lacking a headset, you’re not going to be good at Call of Duty, whether you’re a grizzled veteran or a complete newcomer. To that end, I make use of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro A50 Gen 5</a> which helps my aging ears pinpoint the pounding footsteps of an approaching enemy with relative ease.</p>



<p>Internet, too. If you’re relying on old-school copper wire broadband, you’re at a disadvantage. Old folks like us might not need super-fast internet for much else, but for gaining an edge in Call of Duty, it’s a <strong>must</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-tips-for-getting-good-at-black-ops-6">Top Tips For Getting Good at Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Not everyone can be good at Call of Duty, that’s just the bare truth of it. For every cracked player, there are nine bang average gamers, and I fall into that latter camp. Fortunately, there are a few things that you can do to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-black-ops-6-controller-settings-aiming-combat-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost your Black Ops 6 skillset</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Learn the Maps</strong></p>



<p>Practice makes perfect, and only looping the same maps over and again will result in you knowing routes, grenade spots, and rotations for objectives.</p>



<p><strong>Find Your Mode</strong></p>



<p>If you don’t like Search and Destroy, <strong>don’t play Search and Destroy</strong>. It might be one of the best game modes in Black Ops 6 for XP, but it’ll grind you down to a nub. I tend to rely on Kill Confirmed with the Strategist specialist to maximise XP gains.</p>



<p><strong>Get the Gear</strong></p>



<p>Watch videos online and study pro players on social media to pick up the best weapon builds. Everyone claims to have the best build, but they’re mostly the same with one or two tweaks here and there.</p>



<p><strong>Optimise Your Settings</strong></p>



<p>From the Bumper Jumper Tactical tip to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-audio-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ‘Enhanced Audio’ sound profile</a>, there are many things you can do to secure the best settings in Black Ops 6. Take a little time to trawl through the menu and find what works best for you. </p>



<p>Here’s a tip for Black Ops 6: <strong>Turn off Omnimovement</strong>. If you’re on a controller, you can switch off diving, and it honestly makes such a refreshing change not needing to worry about leaping all over the map accidentally.</p>



<p><strong>Accept Imperfection</strong></p>



<p>Like I said, not everyone can get good at Call of Duty. You’ll be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-reveal-sbmm-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devastated by SBMM</a> and wannabe pro players before long, so it pays to sometimes accept that a) you’re almost past it, and b) everyone is just <strong>better </strong>at Call of Duty these days. And spoiler alert: almost everyone good at the game is 10 – 20 years younger than you.</p>



<p>Through sheer tenacity, settings that I’ve gotten used to over many years, and a desire to keep up with what’s trending, I stay somewhat ahead in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. I float around a 1.45 KD ratio, which isn’t bad for someone with my casual skillset, but I do painfully miss the old days.</p>



<p>I’ve gone from topping the charts to occupying a familiar spot at the bottom of the table. That’s what time does to you, folks.</p>

The festivities are doubled for this year's anniversary, as Call of Duty Mobile is also celebrating a major milestone with over a billion downloads. The new content includes celebratory events, a new battle royale map, a new submachine gun to unlock, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty Mobile Season 10 starts on November 6 at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET. This new season includes the brand-new Anniversary battle pass with both free and premium items, including new operator skins, weapon blueprints, CoD Points, and various cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Highlights of the free battle-pass tiers include Season 10's new USS 9 submachine gun, and the new battle-royale class called Teleport, which lets the user place a beacon on the ground that they can then teleport to from any point on the map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394733-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394733-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394733"></a><figcaption>USS 9 submachine gun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394733-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-010.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Premium battle pass tiers include additional cosmetics, such as operator skins for Synaptic, Girasol, Polina, and Francis. It also has a couple of weapon blueprints, including "The Lovers" blueprint for the new USS 9 submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest update for Season 10 is the new battle royale map. Krai is described as a mid-sized map with five main points of interest. Matches on Krai will give each operator one respawn, and after that, eliminated players will drop a scannable dog tag. If their squad can reach it and scan it, the player can return to the match.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394736-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394736" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394736-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394736"></a><figcaption>Krai battle royale map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394736-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The map will also include a mode for a narrative-style mission. Activision says players can "embark on a special mission" as Urban Tracker and Kumo-chan to explore Krai's Sanatorium for insight into the map's secret history. They'll follow clues and engage in combat alongside a robot companion. This includes engaging in minigames during the mission, and players can find similar minigames in regular matches on Krai, which can provide "unique and powerful" in-match weapons or rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to unique events tied to the new map, there are also a variety of minigames, Anniversary events, login events, and other ways to earn free gear in the Challenge HQ. One of the events is called Mail Call, which tasks players with collecting letters from the developers to earn rewards. These events can grant weapon XP, operator skins, weapon blueprints, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">As always with seasonal updates, players can expect additional content and quality-of-life improvements with Season 10, as well as new seasonal challenges, store bundles, Keep updates, and more.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is gearing up for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/">Season 1 on November 14</a>, which brings more multiplayer maps, new Zombies content, and Warzone integration.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-politics-sensitive-social-issues-rules-hasan-piker<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last week, Twitch <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Update-on-CCL-for-Politics-and-Sensitive-Social-Issues?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped the precise kind of announcement</a> a company tends to save for the tail end of a week: Going forward, it would require streamers to apply a “politics and sensitive social issues” label to broadcasts that include “discussions about elections, civic integrity, war or military conflict, and civil rights,” as well as conversations about “legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration.” The latter stipulation proved especially unpopular. Twitch has since clarified a portion of the rules, though streamers continue to feel like they set worrisome precedents.</p><p>In the days following Twitch’s announcement on Friday, numerous streamers spoke out against this use of Twitch’s labeling system, which allows viewers to hide content with specific labels – thereby making it less discoverable – and lets brands exclude labeled broadcasts from their ad campaigns. Nearly 40,000 Twitch streamers and viewers upvoted <a href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/933812-safety/suggestions/49038707-remove-sensitive-social-issues-bullet-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post on Twitch’s official feedback page</a> urging the company to remove the “sensitive social issue” bullet point from <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rules</a>.</p><p>“LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, and reproductive rights are <em>not </em>‘sensitive social issues,’ they are common sense issues, where one side simply wants their liberties intact,” read the post from a Twitch user. “The controversy is entirely on the other side of the argument [that] involves taking those liberties away. Especially as it pertains to LGBTQ+ individuals, the notion that the discussion of their very existence is political is absolute nonsense.”</p><p>Monday evening, Twitch locked the feedback page post and clarified its rules.</p><p>“We want to make clear that you don’t need to label your stream if you’re talking about your lived experience,” Twitch <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1853584024721137755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “We’ve also clarified that a label is only required if discussion of the listed topics is the focus of the stream. Our goal here, as with any [content classification label], is to give viewers and brands more info about what’s happening on a particular stream, so that they can make an informed decision about what to watch and where to engage.”</p><p>Twitch also published <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a revised version of the rules</a> with the aforementioned clarifications, as well as a notable removal of the word “immigration.” The new bullet points include slightly more specific language like “streams <em>focused</em> on discussing topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion <em>in a polarizing or inflammatory manner</em>” (emphasis ours).</p><p>So, reading between the lines, Twitch’s goal here is to make it easier for brands to avoid politics-focused streamers, just as it once did when it <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-says-being-seen-as-sexy-isnt-against-the-rules-1846943250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">created an entire category for pools, hot tubs, and beaches</a> after advertisers made a fuss about Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa and other hot tub streamers in 2021. Twitch has been unprofitable for quite some time and has made many unpopular changes in pursuit of a stream it arguably considers more important than that of the live variety: revenue. These <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">include</a> a substantial focus on ads, shuttering operations in Korea, and multiple rounds of mass layoffs.</p><p>The specific context here is more labyrinthine: In October, Twitch began to face criticism from Israeli media and Israel-friendly content creators as a result of a sign-up snafu in which the company accidentally blocked email verification in Israel and Palestine for a whole year, as well as a TwitchCon panel in which several streamers of Arab descent ranked other creators based on who is allowed to say “habibi,” an Arabic term of endearment – the top tier of which was “Arab” and the bottom tier of which was “Loves Sabra,” an objectively bad brand of hummus <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/depaul-students-vote-boycott-sabra-hummus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a company with Israeli military ties</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Big names like YouTuber Ethan “H3H3” Klein contended that this constituted open antisemitism, while streamers who participated in the panel – including the tier list’s creator, Raffoulticket, who is Jewish – vehemently denied those accusations. Nonetheless, the Anti-Defamation League, <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/adl-trump-rally-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a notorious Israel supporter</a>, got involved, <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompting Twitch to suspend Frogan</a>, considered the ringleader of the panel, and the other streamers who participated for 30 days. This after it <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handed out a two-week suspension to Asmongold</a> following a much more unquestionably-racist rant against Palestinians.</p><p>There are some notable ties here: Klein used to regularly podcast with Twitch’s biggest political creator, Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, until the two came to repeated verbal blows over Israel’s genocide in Palestine. Piker has been an outspoken opponent of Israel and – as he has repeatedly stressed during broadcasts – <em>not </em>the Jewish people for years, as a result of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/19/world-court-finds-israel-responsible-apartheid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what the World Court found to be an apartheid state</a> in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. He’s been instrumental in younger generations coming to the conclusion that Israel is responsible for human rights abuses despite years of propaganda linking anti-Israel sentiment to antisemitism – the latter of which is obviously a problem, but not one intrinsically tied to Israel.&nbsp;</p><p>Piker, whose streams and videos reach millions of viewers, competing in terms of sheer numbers with traditional news networks, is also partially responsible for politicians like Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez taking a shine to Twitch, beginning with <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an <em>Among Us</em> stream in 2020</a> that peaked at nearly 500,000 concurrent viewers. This, as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influencer-centric tactics from the Republican party</a>, has clearly informed the Harris campaign’s approach. In recent months, Harris has <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched a Twitch channel</a>, Bernie Sanders has <a href="https://aftermath.site/bernie-sanders-sykkuno-pokimane-valkyrae-austinshow-vtuber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned what a vtuber is</a>, and AOC and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz have <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-walz-crazy-taxi-aoc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streamed <em>Crazy Taxi</em> to an enthusiastically-receptive audience</a> (which, at various points, spammed Piker emotes in chat). As a result of anti-hate speech rules that are generally better enforced than on other platforms (with some <a href="https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admittedly glaring exceptions</a>), and a more left-leaning audience, Twitch is home to few conservative political influencers of note.</p><p>Frogan is Piker’s former moderator and a member of his community, as well as somebody Klein has come after on multiple prior occasions. In the time sense Frogan and her collaborators were suspended following Klein’s period of sustained outrage, Democratic representative Ritchie Torres has taken up the cause, <a href="https://ritchietorres.house.gov/congressman-ritchie-torres-writes-to-executives-at-twitch-and-amazon-hasan-piker-is-dangerous" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing a letter</a> last week expressing “alarm about the amplification of antisemitism on Twitch at the hands of Hasan Piker” and ominously concluding that “no company in America – not even Twitch – is above Congressional oversight.” </p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/why-online-organizers-are-pressuring-advertisers-to-reconsider-twitchs-brand-safety-over-antisemitism-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digiday published a piece</a> about a creator-led campaign that reached out to over 100 advertisers with evidence of supposed antisemitism on Twitch, including a clip in which Piker claimed that reports of mass rapes committed by members of Hamas on October 7 were never confirmed (Piker was referencing <a href="https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/report/mission-report-official-visit-of-the-office-of-the-srsg-svc-to-israel-and-the-occupied-west-bank-29-january-14-february-2024/20240304-Israel-oWB-CRSV-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a March 2024 UN report</a> that admitted a lack of forensic evidence of sexual violence; the offending clip is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4AoQHR0-Yc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a stream during which</a> Piker nonetheless argued with a viewer that sexual violence likely occurred – the opposite of what the campaign, as well as <a href="https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1849611612161819110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others like Torres</a>, have claimed – but also that none of it justifies genocide of Palestinians.)</p><p>Not long after Torres spoke up, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published his own letter</a> saying that "there is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia." Now here we are, with Twitch suddenly lurching in a direction akin to other platforms like Instagram, which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/16/instagram-limits-political-content-shadowban-election-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suppresses content it deems political</a> by default.</p><p>Some streamers are concerned that Twitch is caving to external pressure rather than seeking to address real problems.</p><p>“I just think [Monday’s update to the politics rules] creates a lot more problems for them than it solves,” <a href="https://x.com/brethamilton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bret "Cinemarxism" Hamilton</a>, a documentarian and streamer who <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitchcon-2024-protest-chevron-palestine-hilton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent time with pro-Palestinian protesters outside of TwitchCon</a> who gathered in response to TwitchCon’s Chevron sponsorship deal, told Aftermath. “Making more rules around it and ‘clarifying’ will always require them to make choices and take stances on what does and doesn’t qualify, and subsequent people outraged by the enforcement or lack of enforcement. I think the previous [terms of service] was really great actually and well enforced. ... They’re capitulating to bad faith actors who aren’t genuinely interested in justice or antiracism; they just don’t like Hasan and want him banned.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the implementation of a separate category for politics in order to combat antisemitism is a faulty premise. Existence as a minority person, especially in a predominantly white male space, is a political act,” <a href="https://x.com/gremloe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin "Gremloe" MacNamara</a>, a leftist politics streamer, told Aftermath. "If Twitch were serious about combating hate speech on the platform, the five banned Arab content creators are a perfect set of people to speak to about it, given that all of them have been begging Twitch to add [Middle East and North Africa] to their Twitch census data to no avail. It's cynical at best and cowardly at worst."</p><p>Piker himself is also skeptical of the motivations undergirding the events of the past week, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/twitch-faces-criticism-israel-gaza-war-content-rcna178663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying to NBC</a> that clips cited by Torres and others as evidence of antisemitism were taken out of context. Piker isn’t entirely sure what to make of Torres’ actions, except that it fits a pattern for the politician, who recently <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/ritchie-torres-dox-college-teacher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doxxed a college teacher</a> for mentioning “Israeli genocide against Palestinians” during class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I think it's a really weird thing for Ritchie Torres, specifically, to try and issue a takedown notice five or six days out from a massively consequential election against a progressive content creator who is the largest progressive voice not just on Twitch but in general, in North America,” Piker said during <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2293660211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Monday broadcast</a>. “Very odd way to operate."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288836/elon-musk-top-20-diablo-4-players-the-pit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elon Musk is a busy man right now. He’s supposedly running X, SpaceX, Tesla, and Neuralink, all while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271770/elon-musk-trump-pennsylvania-talks">actively campaigning for Trump</a>. But despite those myriad concerns, Musk still finds the time to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23747068/diablo-iv-review-blizzard-class-customization"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>. He’s even said he’s pretty good at it, claiming in a recent interview with Joe Rogan that he’s in the top 20 of <em>Diablo 4</em> players <em>— </em>a feat that apparently only two Americans can claim. If this sounds like the unearned boasting from the same guy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23979850/tesla-cybertruck-delivery-design-production-problems-delay">who claimed his Cybertrucks are bulletproof</a>... it is.</p><p>The Pit is a timed dungeon in <em>Diablo 4</em>. Players are given 15 minutes to clear out monsters and the final boss, with each death shaving an increasing amount of time off the overall timer. Players who can complete The Pit earn endgame materials used to improve their gear, and since this is an endgame dungeon, the fights are pretty difficult. Clearing the dungeon as fast as possible is, therefore, a decent indication that you can <em>Diablo </em>pretty good. </p><p>In fact, there’s a leaderboard ranking players by their Pit completion times which is the basis for Musk’s claim. If you check out the <a href="https://helltides.com/pit">Pit leaderboard</a> at <a href="http://helltides.com/">helltides.com</a>, sure enough, at the time of publication, Elon Musk is sitting smack dab at number 20.</p><p>But here’s the catch. </p><p>There are no official leaderboards for The Pit. <a href="http://helltides.com/">Helltides.com</a> is not affiliated with Activision Blizzard. These rankings are based on screen-recorded runs submitted by the players themselves. And the number of submissions used to create this list? 881. </p><p>To be fair to Musk, clearing The Pit in 2 minutes and 45 seconds is no mean feat. It shows that he knows what he’s doing (or that he at least knows how to look up optimal builds for his class on sites like <a href="http://icyveins.com/">IcyVeins.com</a>.) But it strains the hell out of credulity to claim he’s in the top 20<em> Diablo 4</em> players <em>in the world</em> based on a list made up of only 881 people. Steam’s concurrent player count alone shows the game sitting at 11,000 players.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Fayz, co-owner of <a href="http://helltides.com/">helltides.com</a>, agrees with Musk calling himself a “top 20” <em>Diablo 4 </em>player. “It’s the best global list we have,” Fayz said over Discord. “Elon’s claim is valid.” But Fayz recognizes the leaderboard’s limitations. </p><p>“It’s as comprehensive as it gets in terms of recorded Pit runs with video proof, since our community always alerts us when new top runs are recorded and posted on social media,” Fayz wrote. “But, there’s no way for us to know about Pit runs that aren’t recorded and shared.”</p><p>Musk is one of many billionaires who’ve made lofty but unverifiable claims about their gaming prowess. In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pubity/video/7422388239169785120">TikTok video for Pubity</a>, Mark Zuckerberg recently boasted that he’s “close to grandmaster status” in <em>Civilization</em> and that it’d surprise him if anyone in the world could beat him. In 2017, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html?_r=0"><em>New York Times</em> reported</a> that Travis Kalanick, the former CEO of Uber, “once held the world’s second-highest score for the Nintendo <em>Wii Tennis</em> video game.” (This led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/was-ubers-ceo-really-the-second-best-wii-sports-tennis-player/">an interesting deep-dive from <em>Ars Technica</em></a>, which concluded Kalanick was wrong.) Musk could have legitimately claimed exceptional ability in <em>Diablo 4</em> and left it at that. But, as is usually the case with billionaires, his ego got in the way, leading him to make statements that just aren’t supported in fact. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are plenty of criticisms to levy at the fourth entry to BioWare’s fantasy RPG series, such as its lack of choice continuity from previous games and Whedon-esque quips sprinkled through its dialogue. And if you’re a CRPG diehard, you’re probably not too thrilled by it pivoting hard into an action RPG. But most of the time, these criticisms are buried under (or wielded by) people who are being pretty blatant that their real issue is that <em>The Veilguard </em>features queer characters who are actively presenting as such. To which, I have to ask, have you played a <em>Dragon Age</em> game? If you think this is a sudden pivot, I’m doubtful we played the same games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

But some of the most readily available user review platforms on the internet are being bombarded with reviews from people who don’t even mention any other problems they might have with a game.

Even the attempts to intellectualize such criticism via claims that its “ahistorical” to include modern-day terminology like “non-binary” in a fantasy setting falls apart: <em>Dragon Age</em> is an entirely fictional universe with flying lizards and people with horns. Is there perhaps a discussion to be had about how the story of Taash, the non-binary Qunari party member who is figuring out their identity, was handled? Sure, but I think it’s probably queer people that are trying to have that conversation, rather than the ones who are calling it “woke” and dogpiling on queer people who so much as mention <em>The Veilguard </em>on social media.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-recommend-id="image://ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-recommend-id="image://ec6f81203b3f011d40a3c4220cd6eaa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Davrin talk on a couch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But what I do want to address is the revisionist history that <em>Dragon Age </em>wasn’t always writing stories that not only included queer characters but actively engaged with their storylines in a way that built out the world of Thedas. The first game, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, included two same-sex romance options in Leliana and Zevran, with both acting as conduits through which we learned about the intersections of sex, religion, and gender as early as 2009. <em>Dragon Age II</em> is one of the most prolific examples of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">“playersexual” romance</a></span> that makes all its romance options bisexual. <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> has an entire questline about a gay man nearly being subjected to a magical form of conversion therapy, while also including the series’ first exclusively gay companions and a prominent trans side character. Each of these games has progressively included queer characters and, perhaps even more notably, queer struggle within its world. Having a trans party member and the ability to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">confirm your protagonist is trans</a></span> is the natural progression of a series that has only gotten more queer as the real world has.</p><p>That progression of visibly queer characters and storylines has been in the face of years of pushback from prejudiced criticism. A lot of this came from people who claimed to be fans often believing that queer people getting roleplaying options were somehow taking away from straight people. This perspective ignores the fact that BioWare’s franchise has aspired to create an equal playing field for its queer players for years. BioWare even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-ii-writer-eloquently-defends-the-games-sexua-5785306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-ii-writer-eloquently-defends-the-games-sexua-5785306">responded to that line of thinking</a></span>, saying <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s free-for-all romances “are not for ‘the straight male gamer’. They’re for everyone.” <em>Dragon Age </em>is no stranger to queerness, but it’s no stranger to controversy surrounding it, either. Many of us who have been around BioWare’s orbit for decades have seen the way bigots have expressed faux concern as a thinly-veiled effort to strip <em>Dragon Age</em> of its queer legacy.</p><p>It’s funny to watch scenes like the above, in which Iron Bull has a frank discussion with Krem, a trans man, about how trans people are viewed in Qunari culture in the world of <em>Dragon Age</em>, knowing that <em>The Veilguard </em>would be having a trans Qunari wrestling with those questions themself. It doesn’t attempt to muddy the reality of what it’s talking about and even gives you a good slap on the wrist if you try to misgender Krem through your dialogue choices. It’s no less overt than what <em>The Veilguard</em> does. So what’s different now, 10 years later? The answer is not <em>Dragon Age</em>. In a way, it’s not angry bigots online, either. It’s the way the internet has allowed entire businesses to thrive on faux outrage by painting a video game as a boogeyman worth mobilizing against.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>hasn’t even been out a week and it’s become such a minefield to talk about. As people who weren’t even going to play the game in the first place make it a battleground, it’s got fans of the series so resistant to criticism for fear that it will become ammunition for hateful people to use against it.</p><figure id="" data-id="65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-recommend-id="image://65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-recommend-id="image://65301cdb411d3698ae17568a839af85c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook sits with Taash and their mother at a dinner table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The internet is broken</a></span>, and when it feels like we have no power to fight about anything else, people resort to fighting about a video game like it’s activism. Those problems extend far beyond BioWare’s latest, but let’s not pretend the criticisms that <em>Dragon Age</em> “wasn’t like this before” are anything other than what they are. If you think <em>The Veilguard</em>’s portrayal of a non-binary character finding who they are, a protagonist capable of being explicitly trans, and a party of queer characters who are smooching between missions is in any way “new” for the franchise, you haven’t been paying attention.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-explains-the-inner-workings-of-esports-broadcasts-for-a-modern-audience.1028259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-broadcast-esports-network/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the recent League of Legends World Championship event in London, Riot Games sat down in an interview to talk about all things broadcasting. During this interview, Riot’s Sam Kordower Chaimson, the executive broadcast producer for Worlds, explained what the gaming titan is doing to push content to a modern and increasingly demanding audience.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-worthwhile-to-support-all-those-fans">‘It’s Worthwhile to Support All Those Fans’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.svgeurope.org/blog/headlines/fan-eye-view-riot-games-on-creating-a-superior-viewer-experience-and-taking-fans-forwards-in-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with SVG Europe</a>, Kordower Chaimson explained that Riot Games is constantly adjusting its operating model to account for an ever-changing audience. Most recently, the broadcast team started producing a 9:16 stream – a vertical format – to accommodate those watching on platforms like TikTok.</p>



<p>It’s all about bringing as many viewers to the action as possible, and that’s only made a reality by fully diversifying how content can be consumed.</p>



<p>Kordower Chaimson drew key comparisons to ‘traditional’ sports and referenced a bold waking up to the versatility and accessibility of esports broadcasts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think traditional sports and traditional media are starting to clue into the fact that fans have different ways of engaging and at Riot we think it’s worthwhile to support all those fans, wherever they are. </p>



<p>Whether they’re watching a more traditional sport editorial broadcast like some of our main language feeds using our traditional broadcast apparatuses, or they’re watching one of our co-streamers, or they’re watching in another language using a broadcaster that may have a little bit more irreverent content, fans are choosing to engage with our sport in the way they engage with everything else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Kordower Chaimson puts it, Riot is busy trying to ‘serve a core fan experience’, and to do that, the company must ‘tailor its content to resonate with them and to reward them’.</p>



<p>Riot Games boasts one of the most tried, tested, and reliable broadcast infrastructures in the esports world. In 2022, the company opened two new remote broadcast centres as part of ‘Project Stryker’, one in Dublin, Ireland, and the other in Seattle. These facilities rival the tech-focused buildings backed by some of the world’s most powerful television broadcast companies.</p>



<p>Kordower Chaimson dipped into the emotional scenes that can unfold on a grand stage like the League of Legends World Championship:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s about marrying that hyper empathetic, hyper real personal experience with the spectacle of a top tier sporting event. I don’t think we lean too much into adhering to traditional editorial practises intentionally, but it’s about marrying the two. You obviously have natural advantages. </p>



<p>A big venue is pretty and beautiful and exciting, but it’s also a unique time to showcase our amazing community and our fans. It’s about celebrating the people around you that play the game. It’s about celebrating that comradery and those shared experiences we have, and that’s really special.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think traditional sports broadcasts and esports events are becoming closer aligned, or are they still unique? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Following the huge success of Hogwarts Legacy--it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#6" data-ref-id="2900-4951">2023's best-selling game in the US and sold more than 30 million copies globally</a>--Warner Bros.

New details about the game and WBIE's plans overall for gaming have now emerged.</p><p>WB Games president David Haddad told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that Hogwarts Legacy 2, or whatever the game is called, could connect to the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-tv-show-max-release-date-cast-story/2900-5266/" data-ref-id="2900-5266">Harry Potter TV series</a> in some way. It remains to be seen how this would come to be, however. Hogwarts Legacy was set in the 1890s whereas the TV series is understood to be a re-telling of the Harry Potter books, which take place in the 1990s.</p><p>Whatever the case, Haddad said, "We have known for some time that fans are looking for more things in this world, and so we're spending a lot of time thinking about that." He added: "Our insights tell us that there are not huge distinctions between a younger version of a fan and an older version of a fan. They're just deep Harry Potter fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them."</p><p>The executive went on to say that the huge success of Hogwarts Legacy gave the wider company confidence that continuing to invest in the Harry Potter series was a good decision.</p><p>"The rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with Hogwarts Legacy last year," he said.</p><p>Hogwarts Legacy was such a big success that it even outsold Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III in the US during 2023.</p><p>Also in the interview, Warner Bros. Discovery boss Robert Oberschelp clarified author J.K. Rowling's involvement in the Harry Potter series going forward. He said she is not directly involved, but that executives keep her in the loop by way of her agent if WBD's teams want to go "beyond a canon conversation." Rowling's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">comments about the trans community</a> continue to hang over the magical series.</p><p>In addition to Hogwarts Legacy 2, Warner Bros. is reportedly producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-is-reportedly-in-the-works/1100-6527135/" data-ref-id="1100-6527135">Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition</a> featuring additional story content. Hogwarts Legacy released without the ability to take part in Quidditch matches, but a dedicated Quidditch game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions/" data-ref-id="5000-631815">Quidditch Champions</a>, released this September.</p><p>The Harry Potter movie series was massively popular in the early 2000s, and attempts were made to create a spin-off series called Fantastic Beasts. After three films, however, the series was put on hiatus. Star Jude Law, who plays a young Albus Dumbledore in the series, recently said <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/fantastic-beasts-franchise-dead-jude-law-eddie-redmayne-1236193808/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the franchise may be over.</a></p><p>The TV series, meanwhile, is in the works for Max and is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-show-launches-open-casting-call-for-harry-hermione-and-ron/1100-6526370/" data-ref-id="1100-6526370">casting its three leads: Harry, Ron, and Hermione. </a></p><p>fantastic</p>
