                <p>Few games pack the technical punch of Cyberpunk 2077, making it an interesting proposition for Nintendo's shiny new handheld. While the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade to the original, Cyberpunk 2077 is considered one of the most hardware-intensive games in recent years. Despite this, CD Projekt Red's ambitious Switch 2 port is a commendable one that makes the most of the console's power, but with some noticeable drawbacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 for the Switch 2 offers a performance mode and quality mode for both docked and handheld play, with the key difference between the two play styles being resolution. While docked, Cyberpunk 2077's resolution ranges between 540p and 1080p. In quality mode, it shouldn't fall below 720p. Handheld play, depending on the graphics mode, scales between 360p and 810p. This sounds rough, but given the screen size and DLSS, Cyberpunk 2077 looks pretty palatable on the Nintendo Switch 2. Post-processing effects help offset this low resolution and the Switch 2 screen boasts a clean image, especially at a standstill. The quality can vary depending on what's happening on screen, though. If you're speeding through Night City or in the heat of combat, the resolution may plummet, but most players probably won't be able to tell.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520143" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520143"></a><figcaption>Johnny Silverhand looking at V with Night City in the background captured on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quality mode targets 30 frames per second and performance mode targets 40. The caveat is that performance mode while docked only works with 120Hz TVs and monitors, meaning that not every display can utilize the frame rate boost. However, in my testing, the frame rate boost seemed pretty negligible when compared to quality mode. This is largely due to the fact that the Nintendo Switch 2 does not support variable refresh rate while docked, meaning the frame rate dips are noticeable. Fortunately, the quality setting appears to be more consistent. The frame rate can fluctuate depending on where you are in the world and what's happening. Thanks to the Switch 2's built-in VRR screen, performance mode feels pretty solid while playing handheld. That said, Dog Town--the new district added in the Phantom Liberty DLC--appears to be particularly taxing on the Switch 2. It's far from unplayable, but it does run slightly worse than other parts of the city. This shouldn't come as a surprise considering Phantom Liberty never made it to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One due to technical limitations. That makes its inclusion on the Switch 2 all the more noteworthy.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to get Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Switch 2, the visuals have noticeably been pared back. While it doesn't feel as extreme of a downgrade as The Witcher 3's 2019 Switch port, those who played Cyberpunk 2077 on a high-end PC, Xbox Series X, or PS5 will definitely see the difference. Draw distances are reined in, textures aren't as detailed, and the lighting isn't as crisp. That said, it does appear to outpace last-gen consoles--perhaps not in every way, but I'd much rather play Cyberpunk 2077 on my Switch 2 than my creaky old Xbox One. For me, the most notable differences are the smaller crowd sizes and emptier roads. At times, especially in the downtown areas, Night City feels a bit empty. Concessions had to be made, and I understand why this was chief among them, but wandering around a quiet city center can take me out of the experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520144" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520144"></a><figcaption>The hacking menu on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just a straightforward port to the Nintendo Switch 2. CD Projekt Red has leveraged the console's hardware to add in some new ways to play. The most interesting of the bunch are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/">mouse controls</a>. This lets you use a Joy-Con as a mouse in order to aim, and it works well. Once I tweaked the sensitivity, I had no trouble lining up headshots and gunning down enemies from afar. It's a little awkward maneuvering with mouse controls outside of combat, and the default button layout took some getting used to, but it feels like more than just a gimmick. I could see myself playing for dozens of hours with mouse controls turned on. However, the gyro controls <em>do</em> feel like a gimmick. Using a Pro Controller or Joy-Con, you can aim using motion; it's not quite as imprecise as it sounds, but it's certainly not the ideal way to play Cyberpunk 2077. The more approachable, middle ground is to use the gyro controls for subtle adjustments while aiming. You can control your camera with the right stick, but when you need to make a slight adjustment you can use the motion controls.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, CD Projekt Red has added touch controls to the experience. This primarily lets you navigate menus with your finger. As someone who has put in over 250 hours into Cyberpunk, navigating the menu with analog sticks is muscle memory at this point, so I've largely ignored this feature (I also don't like getting fingerprints on my screens). However, the touch screen controls are intuitive and could alleviate some of the inventory management issues that newer players might experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520145" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520145"></a><figcaption>V holding a pistol outside of Night City captured on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quite possibly the coolest feature in the Switch 2 version is cross-progression, letting you transfer your saves between PC and console. This isn't new for Cyberpunk or CD Projekt Red, but it makes this package considerably more inviting. After I completed Phantom Liberty for the first time in 2023, I've been slowly chipping away at a 100% playthrough, and cross-progression makes that even more attainable. The Witcher 3 for Switch eventually got cross-play, but for that functionality to work on day one with Cyberpunk 2077 is commendable.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've never played Cyberpunk 2077 and the Switch 2 is your only means to do so, then it's an easy recommendation. The base game is excellent and the Phantom Liberty expansion is phenomenal. However, if you've already played Cyberpunk 2077 and don't feel an itch to return to Night City, then this may not be worth your time. The Switch 2-specific features are a nice touch--and it's great to see CD Projekt Red embracing the hardware--but they don't elevate Cyberpunk 2077 beyond its already impressive pedestal.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-3-gets-first-trailer-and-autumn-release-date">unveiling</a> earlier this month drew some mixed responses; there was, for instance, ample excitement over the fact baby dinosaurs will finally be wandering all over the place come its arrival later this year, but less enthusiasm for Frontier Developments' decision to whip the theme park sim's scientist avatar art into existence using generative AI. But now, the studio has confirmed it's reversing course on the latter after "some initial feedback".
</p>
<p>
Word Frontier would be relying on generative AI to create its boffins first emerged via Jurassic World Evolution 3's Steam page, which, alongside the game's modest system requirements, included the AI disclosure statement - as mandated by Valve - that "Scientists' avatars" would be created using the controversial technology. This, seemingly, referred to the face portraits accompanying employable staff - rather than key characters - throughout the game.
</p>
<p>
Some fans have dismissed concerns around the use of generative AI by pointing out that scientist avatars are a fairly minor element of Jurassic World Evolution 3, and there've also been suggestions the game's 2021 predecessor made similar use of the technology - albeit before Steam's mandatory disclosure rule came into play. But the pushback among the community has been significant enough that Frontier has taken note and ditched its AI usage.

It shared the news on the game's Steam forum, but a longer statement was provided to <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-using-generative-ai-for-scientist-portraits-following-initial-feedback">Game Watcher</a>. "We have removed the use of generative AI for scientists portraits in Jurassic World Evolution 3 following some initial feedback," Frontier wrote. "The team are continuing their diligent work on the game and are very much looking forward to launching on 21st October."
</p>
<p>
Frontier, of course, is far from the only developer to have dabbled with generative AI, and far from the only one to face criticism for doing so. Activision was accused of creating "AI slop" by Call of Duty fans after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">AI-generated art was used in promotional material for the billion dollar franchise</a>, including a Santa zombie crafted with so little artistic regard, apparently nobody at Activision noticed it had six fingers. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-muse-microsofts-gen-ai-game-tool-everyone-hates-whats-really-going-on-and-why-is-it-being-marketed-at-xbox-fans">recently drew criticism</a> after releasing an AI generated playable (in the loosest sense of the word) demo "inspired" by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
For all the controversy, though, it's clear AI is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">changing game development forever</a>, and numerous companies, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-generative-ai-is-just-another-new-technology-to-be-tested">Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Take-Two</a>, have discussed exploring generative AI "tools". Nintendo's Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-discusses-ai-use-says-games-will-always-have-a-human-touch">recently addressed the technology</a> too, acknowledging its potential to "enhance productivity", while adding, "There's always, <em>always</em> going to be a human touch, and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/691570/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-sees-death-stranding-2-as-a-cautionary-tale.1227255/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>For once, the unflappable Hideo Kojima was overwhelmed. Even close to four decades of game-making experience didn’t prepare him for his biggest tribulation so far: developing <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em> during the covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>“I thought I can’t pull this off. [I can’t] meet people or scan people, or shoot with people. I almost gave up. And also the staff were all remote, and I became sick as well. I thought it was just the end of the world,” he says through an interpreter as part of a group interview in Sydney. “I’ve been creating games throughout my career, but <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was the most difficult challenge.”</p><p>Even his initial scouting of Australia, where<em> Death Stranding 2</em> is predominantly set, had to be carried out remotely via Zoom, with Kojima painstakingly directing a local contact to document the landscape on his behalf. “Looking at it from a camera and to be there is totally different, so that’s disappointing.”</p><p>For Kojima, those experiences led to a different approach for the sequel. His own sense of isolation that arose from having to develop <em>Death Stranding 2</em> with a remote team saw him reconsidering its tale — yet it’s also this isolation that led to Kojima realizing the perils of digital connectivity.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kojima Productions</cite></p></div><p>Kojima’s curiosity around Australia was eventually sated. As part of a promotional world tour for <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, he has made his way to Australia to chat about the game with film director and his personal hero, George Miller, at the Sydney Film Festival. So drawn is Kojima to the local sights that the noted cinephile says he hasn’t caught any movies at the festival. Instead, he spent the day at the zoo.</p><p>Kojima’s legacy as a game designer is anything but typical, from his earliest days as the creative force behind the much-acclaimed<em> Metal Gear</em> series to his less-than-amicable departure from Konami. And like <em>Metal Gear</em>’s anti-war narrative, tumultuous world events have shaped the <em>Death Stranding </em>series, the first game being conceptualized in the midst of a politically charged climate back in 2016. He points to key events such as Brexit and the first Donald Trump administration, with thoughts of creating a game that focused on bringing people together.</p><p>“[Back then] there was no theme in games about connections,” he explains. And a few months after <em>Death Stranding</em> was launched, the outbreak of covid soon upended everyday life, including Kojima’s. The isolation he felt almost mirrored the sense of solitude that’s so prevalent in the first <em>Death Stranding</em>. But at the same time, he seemed wary about the digital overload that came with having to stay online — to connect with one another — during the pandemic. </p><div><p>“I’ve been creating games throughout my career, but <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was the most difficult challenge.”</p></div><p>“We had internet when we had this pandemic. It wasn’t like during the Spanish flu,” he says. “We could order things online, we could work online, we could connect via Zoom, or you could go to concerts; they do live concerts on the internet. So the society kind of changed to being very digital.” This digital dependence struck him as “not always very healthy,” which is compounded by the prevalence of surveillance technology, such as facial recognition, during the pandemic. The sum of these experiences inspired him to rewrite <em>Death Stranding 2</em> as a cautionary tale.</p><p>The contrast between the two titles’ messages lies in their logos. Kojima remarks that there’s a marked difference between the original <em>Death Stranding</em>’s logo and the sequel’s. Unlike in the original, the tendrils — or the “strands,” as he refers to these lines — are no longer emerging from the title, but are instead holding the name up in the sequel’s logo. “You see the strands coming to the logo. It’s almost like [<em>The</em>] <em>Godfather</em>,” he says, referring to the seminal 1972 crime film.</p><div><p><figcaption>The different logos for <em>Death Stranding</em> and its sequel.</figcaption></p></div><p>Seated at the front of a small conference room in the PlayStation office in Sydney, the 61-year-old Kojima appears more reticent since the previous <em>Death Stranding</em> world tour — perhaps a sign of weariness and prudence in the pandemic’s aftermath. When I attended the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-on-tour">Singapore leg of the tour</a> in 2020, Kojima shook hands with journalists and conducted individual interviews, while fans who attended the event were invited to take pictures with him. “It was an indirect connection to the game,” he said <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/12/16/21019773/a-day-in-the-life-of-the-death-stranding-world-tour-machine-hideo-kojima">in an interview</a>. The promotional event was, in a way, an extension of <em>Death Stranding</em>’s themes of connectivity. </p><p>But for the second world tour, at least in Sydney, journalists were invited to a group interview, and there was no fan interaction beyond his appearance at the Sydney Film Festival when he waved to eager fans who were hoping to catch a glimpse of the game designer before the event. I was informed by the PlayStation PR team that Kojima didn’t want to risk getting ill again for the rest of the <em>Death Stranding 2</em> world tour. This feels understandable; Sydney is, after all, only the second stop, and perhaps his bout of illness during the pandemic was alarming enough that he prefers putting some physical distance between himself and the public.</p><p>Nonetheless, he is still in good spirits during the group interview, at one point even exclaiming that he is probably talking too much. “This is another reason why I’m doing this world tour. I couldn’t go out, travel, and meet people the past five years, so I thought it’s about time.” </p><p>Yet, at the heart of Kojima’s introspection is still a desire to connect with people, particularly his fans. Part of the reason he’s working on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057536/physint-is-the-working-title-of-hideo-kojimas-new-not-a-metal-gear-game">Physint</a></em> is due to their desire to see another action-espionage game in the vein of <em>Metal Gear</em>. <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, meanwhile, has a greater focus on combat than the first, a feature that Kojima also partly attributed to <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2025/05/08/death-stranding-2-has-more-combat-thanks-to-metal-gear-fans/"><em>Metal Gear</em>’s popularity</a>. With more players familiar with <em>Death Stranding</em>’s idiosyncrasies as a “delivery game,” he’s ready to make the sequel a tad more approachable. In a way, it’s his way of bringing more people together through the <em>Death Stranding</em> series, which he refers to as “a game of connections.”</p><p>“I think we’re a little stronger,” Kojima says of the world after pandemic lockdowns. “If you could use that experience [of connecting with one another] from the game, I want you to maybe use that experience in real life. Not just in your <em>Death Stranding</em> world, but after you go outside, you feel something in your real world every day, and I want you to link what you felt playing the game as well.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/691570/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2]]></content:encoded>

So let’s go over how to use her deck to defeat Kefka (and your friends) once and for all. </p><h2 id="h420315"><a id="2"></a> Revival Trance deck basics</h2><p>The commander for this <em>FFVI </em>themed deck is “Terra, Herald of Hope.” She is a Red-, White- and Black-cost card with a Power and Life of three each. Her two abilities are “Trance” which lets you send the top two cards from your deck to the graveyard (called milling) and in return, Terra gains “Flying”, making her much more difficult to block. Her other ability allows her to pay two mana cost whenever she deals damage to an opponent to bring a creature with Power of three or less from the Graveyard onto the Battlefield. Thanks to the ease with which she can gain Flying, she should be able to slowly bring back her decimated team.</p><figure id="" data-id="5d1e20495e5a4a5186c098c4deccb0e3" data-recommend-id="image://5d1e20495e5a4a5186c098c4deccb0e3" data-format="png" data-width="679" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional image for the Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy commander deck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A promotional image for the Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy commander deck." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5d1e20495e5a4a5186c098c4deccb0e3" data-recommend-id="image://5d1e20495e5a4a5186c098c4deccb0e3" data-format="png" data-width="679" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional image for the Magic: the Gathering x Final Fantasy commander deck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, Terra was not the one who went searching for her friends in <em>FF6</em>, that was Celes, so of course she’s here too! “Celes, Rune Knight” allows you to discard any number of cards in your hand, and in return allows you to draw that many plus an additional card. This ability gives Terra ample fodder to scavenge the Graveyard to bring some powerful creatures onto the Battlefield which is even better given Celes’ secondary ability. Whenever a creature is brought from the Graveyard to the Battlefield, every creature you control gets a +1 counter to both Power and Life. Even better, this stacks so every turn not only do you increase the size of your army with Terra, but you then increase their strength with Celes.</p><h2 id="h420316"><a id=""></a> Expedite the Revival process using these cards </h2><p>Terra and Celes weren’t alone in their fight against Kefka, so there are plenty of other cards that can help restore the world from ruin.

Alternatively, since he has a Power of three, he is a candidate for Terra’s Revival. Once he is on the field, he will be incredibly lethal given he gets +1 to Power and Life for every creature that leaves the Graveyard—which we already established, you will do a lot of.</p><p><strong>“Rejoin the Fight” is another powerful tool to fill your side of the Battlefield. </strong>This card has you mill three cards, then forces all of your opponents (since this is the Commander format, there is usually more than one) to choose one creature from your Graveyard. Those creatures then come back to your side of the Battlefield.</p><p>While you’ll be bringing back plenty of cards from Graveyard with this deck, “Anger” is perhaps the only card that should stay there. “Anger” is a pretty weak card, but it has a cool ability that only triggers if it is in your Graveyard. As long as you have a Mountain (which you should), all creatures you control have Haste, letting you quickly put out damage from creatures played from your hand.</p><figure id="" data-id="d6099638f34025228788b87473763424" data-recommend-id="image://d6099638f34025228788b87473763424" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Final Fantasy antagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Final Fantasy antagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6099638f34025228788b87473763424" data-recommend-id="image://d6099638f34025228788b87473763424" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Final Fantasy antagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, if things start going really bad, just pull a Kefka and destroy the world using “Ruinous Ultimatum.” This card is incredibly high-cost but allows you to destroy all non-land permanents all your opponents control.

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed that its wheel chair basketball game Drag x Drive will release on August 14th for the Switch 2. The game will be a digital exclusive through the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop, ruling out a physical release for the game. It can be pre-ordered for £16.99 right now by following this link; <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Drag-x-Drive-2785803.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=DragxDrive%7CNULL%7CReleaseDateAN%7Cm_id_7ab52249f6%7C2785803">Drag x Drive | Nintendo Switch 2 games</a>.</p>

<p>Drag x Drive is a 3v3 multiplayer wheelchair basketball game, with players needing to use the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons’ mouse mode optical sensors along with gyroscopes and accelerometers to track the physical motions needed to propel your character around the court, and shoot the ball for a score. to really get the full experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/can-drag-x-drive-be-the-arms-of-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Can Drag x Drive be the ARMS of the Nintendo Switch 2?</a></p>

<p>In our Drag x Drive preview, Stefan said, <em>“The two issues that I feel Drag x Drive will face are that initial accessibility for new players. Motion controls are all well and good, but it’s just not as intuitive or gratifyingly snappy as Rocket League, and the skill level between a good and a not-so-good player in simply getting around the court will likely be easy to see. Secondly, it’s all just a bit drab…With a bit more flair to the visuals, multiple modes, and just more built around this core concept, this could –&nbsp;could – be a niche hit, just like ARMS was.”</em></p>

		<p>Bloomberg is reporting that Microsoft is planning to layoff a significant number of people in the Xbox division next week, with the company restructuring the organisation. This seems to be separate from the announcement of last month when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-of-all-employees-affecting-thousands-of-jobs/">Microsoft announced it was laying off 3% of all employees affecting thousands of jobs</a>.</p>
<p>This new round of layoffs is not supposed to be public knowledge according to Bloomberg, so the scale of these layoffs is not yet known. We do not know if it will lead to studios being shuttered or if it will be other roles in the division that will be affected. Microsoft has not shied away from making cuts with this being the fourth round of such cuts within 18 months. The last time the gaming side was hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks were closed by Microsoft.</a></p>


<p>Microsoft’s market value is currently at $3.646 trillion.</p>

<p>And it's cheaper than most</p>

<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/299d8a1b1cd6e/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier today, Nintendo dropped a surprise on everyone by revealing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>'s release date <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">on the Nintendo Today! app</a>. And now, a few hours later, pre-orders are open — and that means the price has been revealed, too.</p>
<p>You can snap up the digital-only wheelchair basketball game for just <strong>$19.99 USD / GBP £16.99</strong>, which is a pretty bargain price all things considered. Many didn't expect the game to retail at a high price given its premise, but it's good to have confirmation.</p>
<p>You can snap up those pre-orders on the eShop right now; here are links to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/drag-x-drive-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Drag-x-Drive-2785803.html">the UK one</a>.</p>

<p>Described as "the next generation of 3-on-3 sports" by the Big N, Drag x Drive takes full advantage of the Joy-Con 2's Mouse controls. It's playable <em>only</em> with them, meaning you'll need to have the best coordination to become a master. At least, from our experience trying it out.</p>
<p>On 14th August, you'll be able to find out for yourself whether you're the king of the courts.</p>
<p><em>Let us know whether you'll be picking up Drag x Drive in the comments</em>.</p>

			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo's</a> latest report on the top games globally by revenue and monthly active users (MAU) for May 2025 shows just how strong of a start <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> had, while Bethesda's return to Cyrodiil with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> firmly remaining in the top-20 games for both revenue and MAU.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launched right at the end of May on the 30th, and even though it arrived just before the month was done, it still managed to hit the number four spot on the top-20 games by revenue for May 2025. The only games ahead of it were the live service regulars, with Fortnite in the top spot, EA Sports FC 25 in second and Call of Duty in third.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered remains in the top-20 two months in a row, for both MAU and revenue, while the other major release from an Xbox-owned studio, id Software's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, makes the top-10 revenue list in the number nine spot.</p>
<p>Other notable titles on the revenue list are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which beat DOOM at number eight, and on the MAU list, the hype around <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a> continues to go strong as it came in at number 15 for May 2025. Also, funnily enough, beating DOOM: The Dark Ages, which came in at number 16.</p>
<p>Here's Newzoo's full report overview for the top games on PC and consoles for May 2025:</p>
<h2>Engagement Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</strong>(#4, +1) saw a jump in engagement following the release of GTA VI’s second trailer on May 6 – the trailer amassed a record-breaking 475 million views across all platforms in the first 24 hours.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Apex Legends&nbsp;</strong>(#12, +3) gained 3 positions as it saw the introduction of a new Legend, Sparrow, and return of a legacy 3 vs 3 game mode – Arena, in a content update released on May 6.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>HELLDIVERS 2&nbsp;</strong>(#14, +18) saw a major content update on May 13 that introduced weapon customization, new enemies and balance adjustments. Moreover, on May 20 the “Heart of Democracy” update introduced urban environments to the game as players are now able to fight on Super Earth itself. The event not only diversifies gameplay but also builds the game’s tradition of turning events into meaningful community moments, driving strong player engagement.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Star Wars Battlefront II (2017)&nbsp;</strong>(#15, +90) experienced a significant surge in player engagement in May, through an organic community rally — highlighting strong and growing demand for a third installment in the series. This uptick followed Star Wars Day (May 4), which was marked by major discounts across all platforms that drew in new players. Despite the influx, 86% of May’s engagement came from returning players, underscoring the dedication and loyalty of the Battlefront II community.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong>&nbsp;(16, new) launched to very positive reviews (86% on Steam and 86% Top Critic Average on Open Critic) and attracted massive amounts of players thanks to its day one availability on the Game Pass. Xbox users accounted for 72% of MAU, highlighting the platform’s dominant role in its success.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Revenue Movers and Breakthroughs</h2>
<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>*We are currently experiencing a temporary outage which affects ROBLOX PC Revenues</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</strong>&nbsp;(#4, new) launched to mixed Steam reviews but has since managed to claw its way to ‘Very Positive’ at 80%. Our 6-market estimate sits at 3.5 million copies in May. The quick turnaround highlights the resilience of the ELDEN RING IP.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</strong>(#8, +5) moves up in the ranking after the release month, which is unusual for a premium title. It’s a showcase of the strength of a high-quality game and continued word-of-mouth marketing.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong>&nbsp;(#9, new) lands quite low on the list due to a big portion of revenues being tied to The Xbox Game Pass. In contrast to what we observed in the engagement highlights, over 95% of full game sales of the title come from PlayStation and PC (Steam).</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Destiny 2</strong>&nbsp;(#11, +30) announced a new paid ($39.99) expansion which became available for pre-order on May 6. Players enjoy regular events and new game modes as the game ramps up for the release of the expansion on July 15.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (</strong>#15, -13) makes it to the top 20 for the second month in a row, showcasing the hunger for a Bethesda fantasy RPG in the gaming community.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</strong>(#20, new) launched to ‘Very Positive’ reviews (91% on Steam) and has already surpassed a million units sold across all platforms according to official communication from the developers. The blend of coziness and RPG elements has landed well with its target audience.</em></li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update due today for the action/adventure fantasy game Eternal Strands is set to add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. The game has offered support for DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLAA, and NVIDIA Reflex since its launch in January 2025, and it's also possible to switch to the latest transformer AI model via the NVIDIA app, improving image quality. Now, though, the addition of NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will boost the frame rates of GeForce RTX 50 Series owners even further.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands admittedly already ran pretty well on release, as noted by Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eternal-strands-the-world-is-your-playground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review for Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>The developer also managed to keep the known UE5 stuttering issues to a minimum, as the game runs rather well most of the time. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at 4K resolution, epic settings with NVIDIA DLSS at the Ultra Quality setting, and Frame Generation at an average of 118 FPS in a benchmark session held in the Upper Dynevron map, one of the maps featuring the highest enemy density. With NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation off, the game ran at an average of 89 FPS on the same map, which was extremely playable. The recorded 1% lows, 25 and 35, however, highlight how there's still some stuttering here and there, but it's honestly not that noticeable. Considering the state of the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5 games and all the taxing simulation the game is doing at almost all times, I was expecting much worse, but there hasn't been a single time in my 35+ hours playthrough where framerates dipped so low that the game was unplayable.</em></p>
<p>Tomorrow, a seasonal update to the F2P anime third-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282270/Strinova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strinova </a>will introduce NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Similarly, later this week, another patch will add DLSS Super Resolution to Monster Energy Supercross 25 - The Official Video Game.</p>
<p>Lastly, on July 1, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV Season 9: Sins of the Horadrim</a> will introduce native NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support to Blizzard's game; the feature was previously only available through the NVIDIA app. The new season adds hidden Horadric Strongrooms deep within Nightmare Dungeons that conceal Blood Relics corrupted by Astaroth’s influence. Players can harness ancient Horadric magic to craft custom Horadric spells, forge powerful jewels, and face a reimagined Astaroth encounter.</p>

            <p>
How does one come up with, and subsequently make, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>? Well, it sounds like you just kind of have to do it in weird ways. If you've missed it, Peak isn't just slang you've heard your teen use to denote something being really good, it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">co-op</a> video game about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">climbing mountains with your friends</a> and having a very good/ bad time while doing so. The bulk of work was also done in a single month as part of a collaborative game jam between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> developer Aggro Crab and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> developer Landfall. And in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/">PC Gamer</a>, a couple of the devs that worked on Peak have shared a little insight into how it got made.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to Aggro Crab head Nick Kaman, Peak was made "mostly from jealousy." To be clear this sounds like mostly a joke, but for Kaman and the rest of Aggro Crab, this feeling came about when they learned that Content Warning was also made as part of a one-month long game jam, and sold ridiculously well. "It turned everything we know about game development upside-down," Kaman said.
</p>
<p>
"At the time we were on the precipice of launching our biggest game ever, Another Crab’s Treasure—an intense 3+ year-long project that burnt a lot of us out. While it was a success, Content Warning was a much bigger one made in MUCH less time." So, Kaman and two other devs at Aggro Crab asked if they could join Landfall for their next jam, conducted in Korea, the latter said yes and off they went.
</p>
<p>
"We brought our computers to an Airbnb in Hongdae and locked tf in for a month. As soon as we landed, we beelined straight for the nearest IKEA and spent the day assembling office chairs and desks (that were donated to the local indie scene at the end of the month)."
</p>
<p>
Peak itself had actually been pitched the year prior… in a hot tub in Sweden, of all places, said Aggro Crab creative director Caelan Rashby-Pollock. "The concept was a lot more vague then and much closer to an open-world survival thingy, but we all quickly got excited about being a group of lost scouts on an island, and the macabre slapstick that can come from that."
</p>
<p>
After that, all their time in Korea was spent either working on the game, or "getting food while talking more about Peak," Kaman said. "While it was pretty intense, it was also the most fun I’ve ever had working on a game."
</p>
<p>
While sales are absolutely not an indicator of quality by any means, <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1936733984635179247">Peak has since gone on to sell a boatload too</a>. I mention only to point out that this doesn't mean the key to success is starting with a good idea and then only taking a month to make it. Both Aggro Crab and Landfall are experienced developers, so I beg of you, don't point to this as an example of a quick route to success.

<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fe7b5293e580/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some poor sod over at Nintendo recently made a pretty hefty mistake in creating a huge poster for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> with the words "Out Now" printed very clearly for all to see.</p>
<p>Nintendo has already stated that the printing was a mistake, but now the company has now ensured that no further confusion occurs by swapping the poster out for one that merely says "2025". This was highlighted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GlitchNDaSystem/">GlitchNDaSystem</a> over on Reddit and covered by our friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-no-longer-out-now-as-london-underground-advertisement-is-updated">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>We still wonder just how such a drastic blunder slipped through Nintendo's iron clad fortress and made its way onto the walls of the London Underground, but at least it's all fixed now.</p>
<p>There's still no date for the long-awaited sequel, but by process of elimination, we would probably place it quite neatly in the month of either September or November. We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in July, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag X Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in August, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> in October.</p>
<p>A launch in December wouldn't be completely out of the question, but it feels a little too close to the Holidays for our liking. Plus, we need to put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> somewhere, too!</p>
<p>So much to play, so little time...</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> developer The Chinese Room has been hit with layoffs, confirmed the game's publisher, Paradox Interactive. It's unclear how many developers have been impacted, though Paradox claims that development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 "<em>is unaffected</em>" by the cuts.</p>
<p>The first reports of the layoffs came from now-former developers at The Chinese Room, who took to LinkedIn to announce that they had lost their jobs. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Game Developer</a>, one employee wrote, "<em>We are none of us safe from the headsman's axe when redundancy time comes around</em>." At least nine former employees have confirmed they were laid off, though the total number of cuts remains unknown.</p>
<p>Following the LinkedIn posts and Game Developer's report, Paradox Interactive confirmed the layoffs to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/">PC Gamer</a>, with a statement that reads "<em>Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release. We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors</em>."</p>
<p>It's no secret that development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been through the wringer, so to speak, as we've been waiting on this game since it was first announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">2019</a>. It was also at risk of being canceled at least once before, when it was being developed by Hardsuit Labs.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room took over development in 2021, and has been picking up where Hardsuit Labs left off while also developing its own titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes The Deep</a>. These layoffs are the latest event in the long development journey that Bloodlines 2 has gone through.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/">Earlier this year,</a> Paradox Interactive confirmed that Bloodlines 2 is due for an October release date, though a specific release date has yet to be provided. According to Paradox, the game is "<em>done</em>," and the studio is working on polishing it and squashing every bug it can up to its October date. After all this time, seeing what arrives when Bloodlines 2 is out and on shelves will be interesting. Hopefully, it's a triumphant return for the series and the game that fans have been waiting for.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-wants-to-better-reward-creators-for-bringing-players-back.1227120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is introducing two new systems that are designed to further encourage creators to bring players onto the social games platform on a regular basis. The systems, part of what Roblox is calling Creator Rewards, will roll out beginning July 24th.</p><p>One is the Daily Engagement Reward program, which gives Roblox creators 5 Robux for an “active spender” on the platform who spends at least 10 minutes in their experience in one day. 5 Robux isn’t a lot on its own — depending on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311337/roblox-robux-app-store-fees-worth-more-party">where you buy Robux</a>, that can translate to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux">about five cents</a> — but if an experience brings back thousands <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview">or millions</a> of people every day, that could add up quickly. Roblox may also change the payout in the future, it says <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/introducing-creator-rewards-earn-more-by-growing-the-community/3777628">in a blog post</a>.</p><p>To be eligible for the reward, a creator’s experience must also be one of the first three experiences an active spender (which the platform defines as a user who has spent at least $9.99 in the last 60 days) launches each day.</p><p>The choice to offer these payouts after the first three experiences isn’t an exact science, Roblox CPO Manuel Bronstein tells <em>The Verge</em>. It’s more that those first three experiences are why you may come to the platform in a given day, he says, while you might visit experiences after those first three because you found something new through recommendations or because of a friend’s suggestion.</p><p>Bronstein doesn’t think creators will change their experiences to optimize just for that 10-minute threshold. “Continue to build a great product, continue to build a great game, continue to build a great experience, and you will benefit from this reward,” he says.</p><p>He also points out that these engagement-based rewards aren’t the sole mechanism for Roblox creators to make money. The “vast” majority of transactions for Roblox developers come from transactions that they generate on the platform, according to Bronstein, and creators can also monetize with things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/9/23343459/roblox-age-guidelines-metaverse-ads-developer-conference-announcements">ads</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23962567/you-can-now-buy-subscriptions-in-roblox-experiences-that-offer-them">subscriptions</a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667470/roblox-creators-physical-merch-in-game-shopify-amp">selling physical goods</a>.</p><p>This new reward system will replace the current <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/engagement-based-payouts">engagement-based payouts program</a>, which pays out Robux based on playtime from people who are subscribers to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership">Roblox Premium</a>. Bronstein says that program didn’t reward user acquisition or user reactivation, and wasn’t as transparent as Roblox wanted it to be. (He also says this new program isn’t a response to Epic Games’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659492/fortnite-creator-economy-2-0-epic-games-catch">engagement-based payouts system for <em>Fortnite</em></a>.)</p><p>The second program Roblox is adding is the Audience Expansion Reward, which pays creators a revenue share of purchases from Roblox users who join or return to the platform because of them. Roblox will apply the credit if a player joins the platform through a creator’s link or if a player searches for a creator’s experience on Roblox by name and plays for at least 10 minutes. This new system will eventually take over for Roblox’s <a href="https://create.roblox.com/affiliate">current Creator Affiliate program</a>. This program will offer a 35 percent revenue share to creators on up to the first $100 those new or returning users spend in their first two months on Roblox.</p><p>Roblox says it’s on track to pay out $1 billion to creators this year. Last year, it paid out more than $922 million, which far exceeds the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349588/epic-paid-fortnite-creators-a-total-of-352m-in-2024">$352 million Epic paid to <em>Fortnite</em> creators</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691308/roblox-daily-engagement-audience-expansion-reward-program-payouts-creator-rewards]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's no way I'm learning this for the first time after ten or so years of people exploring every nook and cranny of this game. That's the thought that went through my head when I spotted a tweet from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> quest designer Philipp Weber earlier this month, revealing that one of the Blood and Wine DLC's quests had a secret cut epilogue.</p>
<p>I've played quite frankly far too much of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> over the years, and I'd never heard of it. Of course, I'm just one bloke, and hardly an endless encyclopedia containing every single bit of trivia about a decade old game. That's when I raked through the internet, and couldn't find any mentions of the cut epilogue. Surely Weber hadn't kept this under his hat for about a decade, not even mentioning it when folks found what he'd called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZZ9p1HbeHs">"last secret"</a> by investigating the exact same quest. Er, yes, he had.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, I'll give you the context. The tweet from Weber that started off my wild goose chase came in response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1l7uk19/fun_fact_vivienne_from_blood_and_wine_has_a_mom/">a Redditor</a> discovering cut models for Vivienne De Tabris' parents while digging around in TW3's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-redkit-mod-tools-launch-may-21st-enabling-a-new-era-of-ambitious-overhauls">REDkit modding tools</a>. For a refresher, De Tabris is the cursed lady-in-waiting from the quest 'The Warble of a Smitten Knight'. It's the one where Gerry takes part in the knightly tournament and you're about to read some spoilers for it.</p>
<p>Cue Weber posting that "originally the Warble of a Smitten Knight used to have a flashback scene where we would see Vivienne's parents at the pond, being watched by a nymph who was envious of their love. She was the one who cursed their unborn baby, setting the whole story into motion.</p>
<p>"We used to have a secret quest epilogue in which you could find this nymph, but had to cut it due to scope," he continued, "However, we were able to reuse the nymph's model for the Lady of the Lake and add her to the quest for Aerondight. Originally, she was not even supposed to be seen."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This post shows a nice example of how cut content can sometimes also be a good thing. We lost Vivienne's parents, but gained a Lady of the Lake. <br>Blood and Wine for the Witcher 3 was a huge expansion, but to make it we still had to cut some scope.<br>(1/3)<a href="https://t.co/XJz4bIFOr9">https://t.co/XJz4bIFOr9</a> <a href="https://t.co/28vfghTDpy">pic.twitter.com/28vfghTDpy</a></p>— Philipp Weber (@PhiWeber) <a href="https://twitter.com/PhiWeber/status/1932419237714526465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Very cool, but not just that. An answer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdKNtepEt0o">the debates</a> some Witcher fans have been having for years about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1ekqcv0/witcher_3_the_identity_of_the_creature_who_cursed/">the identity of the nymph</a> that cursed Vivienne, with some having speculated that Hearts of Stone baddie Gaunter O'Dimm or one of Velen's crones could be behind it.</p>
<p>And not something that, as far as Weber knows, was public knowledge prior to him tweeting about it on a Tuesday more than nine years on from Blood and Wine's release in May 2016.
