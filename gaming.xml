            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. has confirmed what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> fans feared after the recent launch of the Definitive Edition: no new DLC characters or story chapters will be released for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 has sold 5 million copies, with the franchise now up to 100 million. Mortal Kombat 11 became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide soon after launch. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> on the official Mortal Kombat social media account, Warner Bros. acknowledged the disappointment the news will cause players, "but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. failed to say what this new project is, but current speculation points to Injustice 3, a continuation of NetherRealm’s DC fighting game series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>We are hearing players’ requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1, and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character, which came a year-and-a-half after the release of Mortal Kombat 1 itself, now goes down as the game’s final major content drop. For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. Today’s announcement comes one year and eight months after the release of Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are already bringing up prior comments from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon, who had promised fans years of support. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from Boon</u></a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: “NetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now"><u>Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</u></a>, the pink ninja developer Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What now for Mortal Kombat? Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated that it still believes the gory fighting game franchise has a future. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which was Mortal Kombat</u></a>. Movie adaptation Mortal Kombat 2 is due out later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>We're only a few weeks into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Star Wars season, but since the season is only five weeks long, that means we're already getting close to the end. Once Star Wars season wraps up, things will be back to normal in Battle Royale and Zero Build--or maybe there's nothing normal at all about what's coming up next season.</p><p>Right now we've got a lot more questions (about 7,000) than we do answers (about 0) regarding what's in store for the Fortnite island once all these Star Wars people leave, but let's go through the rumors and guesswork we've got so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</a></li><li><a href="#Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</a></li><li><a href="#New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't have a confirmed answer for this question right now, but since the Star Wars season is designated in the game's metadata as Chapter 6 MS1 (mini-season 1), it stands to reason that next season will be called Season 3. It also implies, but <em>does not confirm,</em> plans for an additional mini-seasons in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite: Galactic Battle is currently scheduled to come to a close on June 7, with the new season slated to begin on the morning of June 8. But this season won't end in the middle of the night, as most Fortnite seasons do.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</h2><p dir="ltr">As promised by Epic when the season began, the Star Wars Galactic Battle season will conclude with a live event in which players will storm the Death Star and confront Emperor Palpatine in order to end the Empire's invasion of the island. This will be a true live event, like the ones that come at the end of each chapter, and it'll take place on Saturday, June 7 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</h2><p dir="ltr">It's rumored that the upcoming season of Battle Royale <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be superhero themed</a>, but in the more traditional capes-and-tights sort of way--with Midas running a school for superheroes, apparently. Word is that the new season will have a DC Comics bent, which makes sense with a new Superman film landing in July. And since Fortnite's only existing Superman skin is permanently locked behind the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass from 2021, the rumors about <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1918704607083282696" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new item shop Superman</a> make perfect sense.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</h2><p dir="ltr">It's expected that the new season will have a normal battle pass that includes several Fortnite-original characters and one or two collab skins. It's very likely that a new corrupted version of Daigo will be on the pass, since the cinematic at the end of Season 2 showed Daigo entering the magic portal in the northeasern part of the island and transforming into a very different body. Beyond that, the only rumored collab skin for the battle pass <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is Robin</a>--yes, we're talking about Batman's pal here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</h2><p dir="ltr">All the rumors and leaks about the upcoming season being superhero-themed also mention that <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1921999441885577714" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">superpowers will be a</a> key part <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920524099136467202" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of your arsenal</a> in the new season. Not gadgets like we had in last year's Marvel season, but rather actual super-powered abilities--stuff like the mythic Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball items, or Avatar's elemental abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 of Fortnite OG will also begin on June 8, and that may be because the original Season 4 also had a superhero theme. While Fortnite OG will certainly stick with the loot pool and map that the original Season 4 had, we can't help but wonder if there will be story connections between OG and standard Battle Royale given the simultaneous start dates.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Epic has seemingly been teasing the return of The Visitor, whose arrival with the meteor in the original Season 4 kicked off Fortnite's plot, with <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1920631430188568835" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this remix of an old Seven-related music track</a> that appears to have a modified version of The Visitor's head and shoulders on the cover art. The Visitor would have been a prime candidate for a remix even without that tease, so no one would be surprised if he appeared on the new OG Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</h2><p dir="ltr">The new Lego Pass will <em>also</em> begin on June 8, and we have no rumors or anything about what's in store. But given the date, we have every reason to expect it will tie in with this hypothetical superhero theme. Given DC's close relationship with Lego, it wouldn't be surprising at all for one of that brand's heroes to pop up here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-studio-announces-free-dlc-as-the-slow-life-rpg-sequel-gets-off-to-a-flying-start<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has had an unexpectedly strong start for a sequel to a fairly obscure 13-year Nintendo DS game. And developer Level 5 has now thanked fans for their enthusiasm, pledging to release free DLC in response to its "global success".
</p>
<p>
The Girl Who Steals Time, for context, is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".
</p>
<p>
But in this post-Stardew Valley world - where you can't watch an indie showcase without seeing a dozen new village sims jostling for attention - the newly released Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals seems to resonated with audiences. It's garnered a positive early critical reception and even surpassed 45K concurrents on its first day on Steam (that's more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> managed) - and Level 5 is now celebrating its launch with news of more to come.

<p>
"Due to the game's global success and the warm support from players around the world," it <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">wrote in a message on its website</a>, "we have decided to release a free DLC that includes new recipes as well as expanded content under the title 'Update the World!'."
</p>
<p>
Level 5 hasn't shared much in the way of specifics, but it promises "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources", as well as "even more opportunities [for players] to showcase their gear". The studio says it's working to release the DLC "as soon as possible", and will provide further details at a later date. It sounds like there's even more on the way too; "We will continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i," it adds, "so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time." 
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-workshop-reports-strong-profits-hands-out-%C2%A320-million-to-staff.1197843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-reports-strong-profits-hands-out-ps20-million-to-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Employees at Games Workshop are getting a pay bonus. Despite the tabletop industry being highly volatile due to reckless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> disrupting trade and imports, the UK-based studio has reported growth. Growth that will be given to its staff.</p>

<h2>The Games Workshop Windfall</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/warhammer-games-workshop-staff-payout-b2756495.html" rel="nofollow">The Independent</a>, Games Workshop will be distributing bonus payments to its staff drawn from profits. These bonus payments will be distributed on an equal basis to each member of the staff. The studio, most well-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: 40,000 </em></a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em></a>, stated the payout was in recognition of its employees' contributions to financial performance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=QoeV3s9Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SlKjeshh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That performance has led to a £20 million windfall for the company, demonstrating strong sales and growth. This is a notable increase from last year, which saw £18 million shared among the staff for stellar performance. Considering other tabletop studios have either shut down or have filed lawsuits in response to current events, this report of growth is unexpected.</p>

<p>As for how much that&nbsp;£20 million will break down among the Games Workshop staff, that is harder to parse. GW doesn't disclose how many employees they have, but it is believed they have 1,500 employees in their home base in Nottingham. Assuming that number is correct, that would mean each employee may be getting about £13k in pay bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the staff number cited doesn't take into account global employees, either in offices outside the UK or working online.</p>

<p>A major factor in Games Workshop's growth are its licensed video games. These include ongoing support for Owlcat Games' RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</em></a> and Saber Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a>. This is in addition to strong sales and ongoing support for the company's many tabletop miniatures games.</p>

<p>The growth of Games Workshop may not be slowing down anytime soon. The company has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/amazon-warhammer-40000-film-contract-signed-production-can-now-begin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">partnered with Amazon</a> and Vertigo Entertainment to produce official movies and TV shows set within the grimdark sci-fi world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Better still, the production has the star power of Henry Cavill on board.</p>

If you just want a fun, colorful throwback to pass the time, my suggestion is <em>Penny’s Big Breakaway</em>, one of last year’s great unsung Dreamcast 3D platformer homages. </p><p>There are two other Switch games that are only slightly on sale but might be of interest. The <em>Chrono Trigger</em>-like <em>Sea of Stars</em> is currently $22.75 (around 30 percent off), but just got a big free <em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em> DLC that adds a new eight-hour quest, additional character, and more classes. <em>Labyrinth of the Demon King, </em>meanwhile, is a lo-fi horror dungeon crawler that just came out last week and is already turning heads. It’s $16 this week (20 percent off). If you’re interested in what might end up on the list of 2025's most overlooked games, I’d give this one a shot. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-2nd-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When the original Parks released in 2019, it quickly became a modern classic, thanks in large part to its gorgeous artwork celebrating the U.S. National Parks. See our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-board-game-review">review</a> for details on that first edition. But Keymaster Games didn’t just slap a fresh coat of paint on the 2nd Edition and call it a day. Instead, it thoughtfully combined the base game with its expansions, streamlining the gameplay, updating the visuals, and introducing new features, all while preserving that cozy game feel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is something that feels like both a sequel and a revision. Either way, the 2nd Edition of Parks is a great excuse to hit the trails, snap some photos, and fill your canteen all over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="04f06aa9-6449-4d2e-9c89-8b6612131675" id="220791"><div id="220791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Parks (2nd Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the original version, the second edition of Parks comes in a beautifully designed box packed with components that live up to its iconic design. Right on top, you'll find a textured, high-quality rulebook that's easy to follow and includes a QR code that links to a helpful video if you prefer to learn by watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Parks is relatively straightforward to play, it includes a wide variety of components. Two log-shaped containers hold the game's colorful wooden tokens, representing the resources you'll collect while hiking the trail. Beneath those is a tri-fold game board with clearly marked spaces to guide you easily through setup. The game board has been completely redesigned and expanded, with an all-new permanent trail area, canteen tile drafting section, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real standout is the built-in storage tray at the bottom of the box, which is the best I’ve seen across the 60-plus board games I own. Everything has its place, from tokens and tiles to dice and cards, all packed efficiently to keep the game’s footprint compact, while making cleanup a breeze. The tray holds decks for the Parks, Gear, Passion, Ranger Teddy, and Volunteer Projects cards, along with solo reference cards, Season and Campsite tiles, Photo and Hiker tokens, Trail Site tiles, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player gets a board featuring an empty backpack and water bottle, with clearly marked sections around the edges for organizing visited and reserved parks, purchased gear, and more. The Backpack holds up to 12 resources, while the water bottle has six spaces for Canteen tiles you can fill as you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest updates in the 2nd Edition is the expanded card set, which now includes <em>all</em> 63 U.S. National Parks, up from 48 in the original. The cards feature all-new artwork and clean iconography that better matches the game's updated, more colorful design. While some fans may miss the original illustrations from the <a href="https://59parks.net/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fifty-Nine Parks print series</a>, the new art feels more cohesive and fits well with the rest of the game’s style. Each card includes the park’s name, founding date, and a short blurb about what makes it unique.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in the second edition of Parks is a streamlined take on the original, incorporating elements from both expansions. The goal is simple: score the most points by hiking the trail, visiting parks, snapping photos, and completing optional objectives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set up, each player takes a pair of hikers and the matching player board. They also receive a random Canteen token, placed on their board, and a Campfire token flipped to its lit side if playing with more than three players. Each player is then dealt two Passion cards and chooses one to keep, discarding the other. Lastly, the First Hiker token is given to the designated starting player.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gameplay in the second edition of Parks is a streamlined take on the original, incorporating elements from both expansions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Passion cards provide small thematic goals to chase during the game, such as visiting parks with specific icons, using Wildlife tokens to take photos, or buying Gear from the item shop. Once completed, you can flip the card to choose one of two rewards: an ongoing effect that lasts the rest of the game, or an endgame bonus that adds extra points to your final score. Some Passions are easier to complete than others, and I usually leaned toward the endgame bonuses as those extra points were often the difference between winning and losing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each round in Parks takes place during one of three seasons: spring, summer, or fall. All three seasons are drawn randomly at the start of the game and each offers a unique bonus, such as rewarding players for collecting the most of a specific resource or visiting parks with certain icons. While spring and summer don’t grant any extra points, the fall season awards three bonus points to the winner, making it especially appealing. Players can choose to ignore these objectives, but they offer useful incentives if they align with your goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On their turn, players move one of their two hikers forward along the trail, collecting resources or performing the action on the Trail Site tile above the space they land on. Since you can only move forward toward Trail’s End, careful planning is key. Trail Site tiles can offer specific resources like sun, water, forest, and mountain; let you buy Gear from the item shop; allow you either to take a photo by exchanging any resource or add a token to your Canteen; roll the Trail Die for a random bonus; or trade any resource for a Wildlife token (which, fittingly, acts as a wild resource token). Every tile is shuffled each season to keep things fresh and unpredictable, except the Parks space, which is permanently located in the middle of the trail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Landing on the Parks space lets you either reserve a park or visit one by paying its resource cost. If you have enough resources, you can even visit multiple parks on the same turn, making this space crucial for scoring points. Because of that, it’s often the most hotly-contested spot on the board. Thankfully, there’s no limit to how many parks you can reserve, and no penalty for not visiting them before the game ends. However, since you can’t reserve and visit in the same action, each choice on this space carries real weight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parks is ultimately a game about opportunity cost. Every move asks the question: <em>What am I giving up by going here?</em> Many Trail Sites offer one-time bonus resources, so players are racing to grab what they can before others beat them to it. Since each Trail Site is unique each season, and you can't share a space with another player (including yourself) unless you use a lit campfire, every decision matters. You might skip ahead to grab a key resource or reach a specific site, but doing so means sacrificing everything you passed along the way, with no chance to go back until the following season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-worker-placement-board-games">worker placement games</a>, the real strategy in Parks comes from using both of your hikers in tandem to block opponents from collecting key resources or taking valuable actions. In higher player count games, the trail can get crowded fast, so refreshing your campfire to share spaces becomes essential. In lower player count games, there’s more room to breathe, allowing you to slow down and hit more spots along the trail. When a player reaches the Trail’s End, they choose one of three actions: take the Parks action, pay any resource to take a photo, or buy Gear. The first hiker to arrive at each space also gets a one-time bonus, adding an incentive to rush the trail. This constant push and pull between slowing down to gather resources and racing ahead for rewards is the real special sauce that makes Parks shine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Parks is ultimately a game about opportunity cost. Every move asks the question: <em>What am I giving up by going here?</em></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Because your Backpack can only hold 12 resources, you need to manage your inventory carefully by spending resources when possible, or you risk having to discard valuable ones at the end of your turn. The Canteen, by contrast, offers flexible bonuses whenever you collect water. Instead of placing the water in your Backpack, you can slot it into a Canteen to gain a resource or perform an action, depending on what you’ve collected. Some tiles even grant powerful effects, like taking the important Parks action. Once used, Canteen bonuses remain unavailable until the next season, so timing matters. Overall, they’re a clever way to give players alternative paths to key actions and resources without relying solely on open trail spaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another way to earn points on the trail is by taking photos. This is most commonly done by visiting a Trail Site or the Trail’s End space with a photo icon, where you can exchange any single resource to take a photo worth one point. The player with the most photos at the end of the game also earns bonus points, giving you a good reason to snap a few along the way. If you land on a space with the Shutterbug badge, you’ll claim the Shutterbug token, which lets you take a second photo each time you use the photo action, as long as you can pay for it. However, the token can be taken by other players, so make the most of it while it’s yours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During your expedition, you’ll have chances to visit the Gear shop and purchase items to help you along the trail. Gear costs between one and three sun resources, depending on the effect. While Gear doesn’t directly earn you points, it offers light <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building</a> opportunities like gaining bonus resources at specific Trail Sites, filling your Canteen after certain actions, or refreshing your Campfire more often. That said, I found the Gear shop to be hit or miss, unless it directly benefits your overall gameplan. You’re usually better off saving your resources for visiting parks, since that’s where the real points are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Parks supports solo play and up to five players, I found it shines best with two or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three players</a>. However, the strategy feels much more cutthroat at two players (a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>, this is not). Regardless of player count, when only one player has hikers left on the trail, they must move both hikers to Trail’s End on their next turn. This rule keeps players from being too greedy with trying to hit every space along the way, as they risk being rushed and missing out on more valuable opportunities. In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player game</a>, this is even more noticeable, since one player can jump to the end early and force the other to skip potential turns needed to catch up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you have a few hikes under your belt, you can add optional modules to Parks to increase variety or raise the difficulty. The Camping mode introduces three tents to the trail, allowing you to choose from a pool of powerful bonuses. However, using a tent means you cannot collect resources or use the action at that Trail Site. Volunteer Projects add more challenge by introducing restrictions that players must follow, such as spending extra resources when visiting parks, limiting the number of Wildlife tokens you can hold, or only being allowed to visit parks you’ve already reserved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parks includes a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo mode</a> that pits you against Ranger Teddy, an automa made up of two sets of hikers that take actions by flipping cards to determine their movement. Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible, which adds plenty of replayability. While Ranger Teddy’s hikers don’t collect resources, purchase Gear, or visit parks directly, they discard those elements when landing on the corresponding spaces, effectively simulating the pressure of competing players. Because their movement is often unpredictable, you’ll need to stay on your toes in order to succeed. You can also add Ranger Teddy to multiplayer games to simulate more players on the trail and add some variety.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Parks (2nd Edition)</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a03b63?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgJqo?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3eGN?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Keymaster Games</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbZV1?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Family-Friendly Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 23, 2025 6:50 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Parks (2nd Edition) is a cozy strategy game that pairs beautiful visuals with deceptively simple worker placement. It builds on everything that made the original great, refining the experience with streamlined rules that are easy to learn but still reward smart play. Its interconnected systems create fresh challenges each time you hit the trail, encouraging careful planning and efficient turns. While visiting parks remains central to the experience, new scoring opportunities provide ample ways to outmaneuver your opponents. Optional modules add variety and difficulty for seasoned players, while the revamped solo mode and Ranger Teddy automa provide plenty of reasons to come back for one more hike.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Licensing revenue was £50 million, up from £31 million. Core profit is £210 million, up from £174.8 million, and licensing profit is £45 million, up from £27 million. That amounts to profit before tax of £255 million, up from £203 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Off the back of those huge profits, and “in recognition of our staff’s contribution to these results,” Games Workshop is giving employees £20 million, up from the £18 million it handed out last year. The money will be paid on an equal basis to each member of staff. Games Workshop is estimated to have around 1,500 staff. If that’s accurate, it means each employee is set for a £13,333 (approx $18,000) bonus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000.

The company pointed out that licensing revenue in the period is at a record level and it does not expect this to be repeated in 2025/26, although it remains a core focus. Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer generally is bigger than it’s ever been, and based on these results, it’s not slowing down any time soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop recently held its annual Warhammer Skulls showcase, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-returns-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-and-more-all-the-announcements-and-trailers-from-warhammer-skulls-2025">we’ve got all the announcements and trailers right here</a>.

Ryu used the mouse around the 10:53 mark in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstlgmcDgy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CstlgmcDgy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean that all Switch 2 games will be compatible with a standard mouse. It's also unclear if wireless mice are also usable on Switch 2. XCOM creator Julian Gollop recently suggested that Switch 2's mouse options <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-xcom-creator-thinks-switch-2-mouse-controls-have-big-strategy-game-potential/1100-6531445/" data-ref-id="1100-6531445">may lead to more strategy games on the system</a>.</p><p>Nintendo's upcoming 3v3 sports title, Drag x Drive, will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-drag-x-drive-a-switch-2-game-that-relies-on-mouse-controls/1100-6530555/" data-ref-id="1100-6530555">extensively feature the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a>.

That may make aiming a lot easier in the upcoming sequel.

                <p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has further discussed the company's upcoming new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalatic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, saying it offers the "deepest" gameplay for any game the studio has made so far.

It's not exactly clear what he means by that, but we should find out in time. "I can't wait to show it off," Druckmann said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918" data-ratio="0.55225311601151" data-width="1043" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918"></a><figcaption>A scene from Intergalactic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>The reveal trailer for Intergalactic showed main character Jordan A. Mun in a spaceship before she descended down onto a planet to fight a giant robot enemy with a red sword. The trailer cut out <em>just </em>as the action was set to begin, so we can only guess as to what happens next.</p><p>Also in the interview, Druckmann reacted to some of the controversy surrounding Intergalactic, and specifically the misogynistic and racist comments directed at Tati Gabrielle, who plays Mun.</p><p>"I don't know if there's much I could add to that conversation, to be honest," Druckmann said. "There's stuff happening with media right now that you just have to ignore for the most part, just stick to your guns, and do what you believe in.

			<p>FromSoftware's Elden Ring Nightreign launches next week. Ahead of the much-hyped debut, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Game Director Junya Ishizaki to dive deeper into the multiplayer spin-off game.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms levied at Elden Ring Nightreign so far is that, according to FromSoftware, it is tailored either for playing solo or with a party of three players. Ishizaki-san admitted that duo groups have been overlooked during the development phase, but added that it is being looked and proper support may be added after launch.</p>
<p><em>The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start. And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.</em></p>
<p>There's also no PvP whatsoever in Elden Ring Nightreign, unlike Elden Ring itself. Ishizaki said that it was never even considered:</p>
<p><em>From the start, PVP was not something that we very actively considered for Nightreign. We wanted it to be a co-op multiplayer experience at its core and we found that as we developed these character actions and these unique abilities for each character, balancing them and tweaking them around PVP as well proved to be very… Not only very difficult, but took away from those ideas and that scope that we'd established for each of these characters. So we really wanted the focus to be on PVE and on co-op, and so we knew where our priorities were. So no, we didn't consider PVP in Nightreign.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is launching on May 30 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Check out our latest preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

Like many other adventure games of its era, <em>Onimusha 2</em> doesn’t take that long to beat, but its branching story paths make it worth revisiting over and over again. </p><h2 id="h2802486"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em>?</h2><p><strong>A standard playthrough of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> can take about 10 to 15 hours to beat if you’re just focusing on the story and if it’s your first time</strong>. It’s quite similar to Capcom’s most notable franchise, <em>Resident Evil</em>, where repeated playthroughs will increase your familiarity, allowing you to beat it quicker on subsequent runs. Speedrunners have completed this game in under than five hours. In fact, the remaster has an achievement for finishing the game within that time.</p><p>If you want to earn all the Achievements and/or Trophies, you’ll also have to beat the game on Ultimate mode, as well as finish a complete playthrough without enhancing any of your weapons or using any jewels.<strong> All of these additional playthroughs can add up to 20 more hours of playtime to the total count</strong>. You’ll also need to collect all files and maps for their respective completion achievements/trophies, which can take multiple playthroughs if you somehow miss any of them.</p><figure id="" data-id="027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-recommend-id="image://027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-recommend-id="image://027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also multiple endings depending on your friendship with various characters like Ekei, Kotaro, and Magoichi.

About 10 minutes into the gameplay demo, the game’s producer Michi Ryu pulled out a USB mouse, plugged it into the console, and started playing the game with it. </p><p>“Once you connect the USB mouse, a message will appear in the top left indicating that the mouse is connected,” said Ryu via English subtitles. “When the USB mouse is connected, it takes priority over the Joy-Con 2.”</p><p>During the demo, the producer also demonstrated that you can switch between the Joy-Con and the mouse instantly as often as you want, letting you use them both at the same time. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has pinged Nintendo for more details about the Switch 2 supporting USB mice. I also asked them if the console will support USB keyboards. If so, that would make the Switch 2, which launches on June 5, even more of a direct competitor to the Steam Deck. Either way, I’m excited that the console will support more control options, as that allows more people to play in whatever way works best for them. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Is it weird to have nostalgia for an operating system? I don't mean missing a particular feature that's been removed from modern versions or a specific productivity setting that's no longer supported. I mean a sense of longing for the vibes of the computer interface you grew up with, an ache for the aesthetics of user interfaces past.</p>
<p>I would have thought I was immune to this particular brand of nostalgia. Then I happened upon <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em>, a new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>-style "bullet heaven" autoshooter that leans hard into the aesthetics of the late '90s Windows machines I grew up with. And while that low-res, 256-color presentation is what drew me in, it was the intriguing mouse-controlled gameplay underneath that has kept me coming back for more retro-styled action all week.</p>
<h2>Start me up</h2>
<p>When it comes to capturing the feel of the '90s computer environment, <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em> gets everything just right. This is in large part due to rampant theft of familiar old-school icons; items like My Computer, Calculator, <em>Minesweeper</em>, Search, and more look like they were taken directly from a classic Microsoft tile set. The game's low-res desktop backgrounds and Windows also look like they came out of a years-old Microsoft style book.</p>
<p>But much of the nostalgic appeal of <em>Desktop Survivors</em> is in the little nods to how computers used to work.&nbsp;<span>It's in the faux Start menu in the corner to access various menus and the Settings window that uses&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old Visual Basic-style sliders and buttons</a>.</span>&nbsp;It's in the way the item shop looks like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/04/geocities-to-close-after-15-years-of-aesthetic-awesomeness/">a teenager's first Geocities page</a>&nbsp;and the "boss mode" icon that can hide the game in an instant. It's even in how the game jumps into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=queN9r3Leis">the old Mystify screensaver</a> if you leave it idle for too long. This is a game that was obviously made with a lot of love for the old-school versions of Windows that inspired it.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

            <p>

      </figure>

<p>If that kind of nostalgia were all there was to <em>Desktop Survivors 98,</em> it would probably not be worth much more than a 15-minute demo. But the underlying game actually takes the developing Survivors-like genre in some interesting directions.</p>
<p>As usual for the genre, the gameplay here centers around navigating through throngs of encroaching enemies (and their projectiles), all while herding those enemies together so your auto-firing weapons can take them out. Defeated enemies drop gems that are crucial to gaining new weapons and powers that also lean heavily on nostalgic computing gags—I particularly liked one weapon based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnT54Dcy86w">the "flower box" screensaver</a>&nbsp;and another based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbQ5OveB6TY">the "bouncing cards" at the end of a successful <em>Solitaire</em> game</a>.</p>
<p>Theming aside, the main element that sets <em>Desktop Survivors</em> apart from its predecessors in the genre is the mouse-based controls. Your old-school mouse pointer is your character here, meaning you get to precisely dodge and dart around the screen with all the speed and accuracy you'd expect from such a flexible input device.</p>

<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Once you move through these dungeons with a mouse, you won't want to go back to a joystick.

      </figure>

<p>While there is a serviceable Steam Deck mode designed for analog stick-based movements, it's a hard control paradigm to return to after experiencing the freedom and speed of mouse movements. Decades of mouse use have likely been preparing you for just this moment, training you to weave your pointer through the tight, quickly closing spaces between enemies without really having to think about it.</p>
<h2>More of the same?</h2>
<p><em>Desktop Survivors</em> also sets itself apart by taking place on a series of single-screen battlefields rather than smoothly scrolling maps. These rooms don't feature any significant obstacles or walls to block your movements, either, making each enemy room play kind of similarly to the ones you've seen before it. This also makes it a little easier to avoid many enemies simply by scrubbing your mouse pointer in a wide circle, causing the enemy horde to bunch up in comical blobs.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>This complaint falls away when you stumble on optional boss rooms. There, talkative and inventive retro references (appearing in all their low-color-depth, pre-rendered "3D" glory) bounce around the screen while firing all kinds of difficult projectile patterns that require careful and quick movement to avoid. It's a nerve-rattling test of precise mouse movement that really stresses the "survivors" part of the game's name.</p>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Just one of the many zany, pre-rendered bosses you'll discover in <em>Desktop Survivors 98.</em>

      </figure>

<p>Unfortunately, it can be hard to work your way up to the weapon and item levels needed to effectively take on these bosses. That's because each room effectively kicks you out after the expiration of a tight timer, setting a strict limit on how much you can farm enemies for those all-important gems you need to increase your levels.</p>
<p>This makes it crucially important to kill a lot of enemies quickly in early rooms so you can snowball into more powerful weapons that will kill enemies more efficiently, for even more power-ups to come. Some weapons are much better suited to this efficient killing than others, which makes it tough to recommend some otherwise interesting attack options.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XVHLj12Pik?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>None of these balance and variety nitpicks are enough to outweigh the simple fun of <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em>, though. Wiggling your mouse around rooms full of pixelated enemies and watching the screen explode into a cacophony of low-res explosions scratches a twitch-gaming itch that's about a lot more than nostalgia. And the sheer depth of unlockable weapons and powerful pointers will keep completionists coming back for quite a while.</p>
<p>Just be sure to click that boss button before you get caught goofing off.</p>

Don’t expect any complicated mechanics like ones found in modern games like <em>Sekiro </em>or anything like that. However, there’s still plenty of fun to have with Jubei as he sets out to defeat Nobunaga. Let’s go over a few tips </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196646,196215" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h704667"><a id="1"></a>Impale your enemies</h2><figure id="" data-id="88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-recommend-id="image://88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-recommend-id="image://88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Whenever Jubei downs his enemies, you have the opportunity to walk over to their bodies and impale them with a downward stab simply by pressing the attack button while standing on top. This move is an automatic OHKO (one-hit-knock-out) and prevents enemies from getting back up. Enemies don’t have any health bars so it’s impossible to know how much more health they have until they disappear. But with the downward stab, you’ll know they’re gone for good.</p><p>Just be careful, though, as <strong>you can still be hit by other enemies in the middle of the animation</strong>. Sometimes you won’t get the chance to impale them. But either way, if you have the opportunity to do so, definitely take it as it’s one less enemy to deal with.</p><h2 id="h704668"><a id="2"></a>Absorb every soul</h2><p>Early on in the game, Jubei will get the ability to absorb souls from enemies that he’s defeated. Red souls can be spent upgrading Jubei’s weapons and capabilities, while the yellow and blue ones replenish Jubei’s health and magic, respectively. Jubei can also transform into a powerful and invincible demon for a short time if he collects five purple souls.</p><p><strong>In this remaster, players can now control when Jubei enters this powerful mode</strong> whereas in the original, it automatically activated once the fifth soul was collected. So definitely take advantage of it to unleash hell at opportune times.</p><p>Also, souls disappear after a while if they aren’t absorbed, so make sure to not leave them hanging or you’ll regret it.</p><h2 id="h704669"><a id="3"></a>Regularly switch up your weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-recommend-id="image://be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-recommend-id="image://be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Onimusha 2</em>, there are plenty of weapons to collect, each with their own unique effects. The Buraitou is a lightning sword that’s both fast and powerful, making it a fantastic all-rounder. The Hyojin-Yari is an ice lance and it has the longest reach out of all the weapons. Use it if you want to keep a safe distance.</p><p>The general idea is to <strong>switch between weapons so that you can maintain an advantage over your enemies</strong>. The wind sword, Senpumaru, might be the weakest in the game, but is incredibly useful for hitting flying enemies while the slow but powerful earth hammer, Dokoutsui can smash through enemies defences like they’re made out of paper.</p><h2 id="h704670"><a id="4"></a>Keep an eye on the ground for helpful items</h2><figure id="" data-id="3410ba8a49dc990e92657664cb502d18" data-recommend-id="image://3410ba8a49dc990e92657664cb502d18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Onimusha 2 shows a town." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Onimusha 2 shows a town." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3410ba8a49dc990e92657664cb502d18" data-recommend-id="image://3410ba8a49dc990e92657664cb502d18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Onimusha 2 shows a town." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’re killing enemies and (hopefully) impaling them, they’ll drop valuable gold, which is needed to buy things such as healing items, weapons for companion characters, and collectibles like artwork. This will help you prepare for the challenges ahead.</p><p>Additionally, scour rooms for treasure chests. They can provide valuable items like green herbs for Jubei to heal himself. Due to the fixed camera angle, treasure chests can be hard to see sometiomes, but take the time to look at your surroundings and you won’t be disappointed.</p><h2 id="h704671"><a id="5"></a>Save slots are handy</h2><figure id="" data-id="33c8378ebda7cd0ed247f087a548cba8" data-recommend-id="image://33c8378ebda7cd0ed247f087a548cba8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A playable character in Onimusha 2 slashes through an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A playable character in Onimusha 2 slashes through an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33c8378ebda7cd0ed247f087a548cba8" data-recommend-id="image://33c8378ebda7cd0ed247f087a548cba8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A playable character in Onimusha 2 slashes through an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Modern technology means that the remaster of <em>Onimusha 2</em> doesn’t need memory cards like the original did on the PlayStation 2. But there are still multiple save slots.</p><p>The game has autosave, so you don’t have to worry about potentially losing hours of progress if something happens like your power going out or the game crashes (which didn’t happen to me, to be clear). But saving often and using the slots gives you the ability to go back in case you want to replay a certain segment or if you missed something.</p><hr><p>Follow these tips, and you’ll be breezing through <em>Onimusha 2</em> in no time. They’ll be helpful no matter what difficulty you play on and how many playthroughs you do. </p><p><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> is now available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
