            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-announced-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lego and The Pokemon Company have announced that a Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>collaboration is coming in 2026, although details about the collaboration are fairly scant right now.</p>

<p>The collaboration was <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon/about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on the official Lego website today, accompanied by a single teaser image that shows both the Lego and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>logos, as well as what appears to be a Pikachu's tail rendered in Lego form.</p>

<p>As such, we can probably expect to see Pikachu making an appearance in the Lego sets, but considering that the little electric mouse is easily the most popular Pokemon in the world, that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-pokemon-set-pikachu-anime.jpg?itok=7fvNQQJH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-pokemon-set-pikachu-anime.jpg?itok=4Zc4HSKc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We can reasonably expect to see Pikachu appear as part of the recently-revealed Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>collaboration.</figcaption></figure><p>Lego describes the collaboration as "a brand-new collaboration that brings your love for bricks and your love for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>together", asking "Pokemon Trainers" to come together next year to "build and catch some of their favorite Pokemon".</p>

<p>The company goes on to describe its&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>crossover as "a real Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>adventure", so it sounds like it'll be more than just some sets you can build with bricks; we can, perhaps, expect some interactive elements along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/build-real-life-mario-courses-with-lego-super-mario" rel="nofollow">the Lego&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>sets</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to keep up to date with the Lego <i>Pokemon&nbsp;</i>collaboration, you can do so by signing up to the Lego Insiders <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/insiders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsletter program</a>, which will keep you informed about everything to do with the crossover going forward.</p>

<p>Of course, this won't be the first collaboration between Nintendo and Lego; the two have crossed over on the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>Lego sets, as well as sets for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-ever-lego-mario-kart-sets" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-animal-crossing" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>.</p>

<p>The presentation also revealed a new battling game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, as well as several updates to existing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>titles. It's all go for the world's biggest media franchise.</p>

                <p>Microsoft will soon expand the roster of titles in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/" data-ref-id="1100-6524825">Game Pass Core</a> library, something it rarely does. The cheapest Game Pass tier ($10/month) will add three more games on March 26.</p><p>These include three celebrated games: Batman: Arkham Knight, Monster Sanctuary, and Tunic.</p><p>An evolution of Xbox Live Gold, Game Pass Core grants subscribers access to dozens of games on console, as well as online multiplayer access and member-exclusive discounts. As mentioned, Game Pass Core's game library doesn't get updated very often, making this a notable event.</p><p>Microsoft describes the Core catalog as being "curated," and indeed the three upcoming releases are all pretty highly regarded. There are currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#coreall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47 games in the Core catalog</a>, so the upcoming three will push the Core library to 50 titles in all. Game Pass Core is available only on console.</p><p>Some of the other games in the Core catalog include Vampire Survivors, Halo 5, Stardew Valley, Limbo, Hellblade, Fallout 76, Grounded, Firewatch, Dishonored 2, Celeste, and Among Us.</p><p>By comparison, Game Pass Standard ($15/month) includes "hundreds" of games, while Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) includes all of that plus day-one new releases for all first-party games, cloud gaming access, and an EA Play membership.</p><p>As for Game Pass Ultimate, the library grows this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-all-these-games-very-soon-in-march-2025/2900-6328/" data-ref-id="2900-6328">a bunch more games</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-10-games-are-leaving-game-pass-soon/2900-6327/" data-ref-id="2900-6327">10 games are getting axed soon</a>.</p>

<p>Split Fiction has only been out for a little under two weeks—as of writing—and the game has seen incredible success in a short period of time. But that doesn’t mean developer Hazelight is resting on its laurels. In fact, Hazelight is already working on its next game.</p>



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-_n3vqsAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Hazelight head Josef Fares confirmed that the studio began working on its next title about a month ago. </p>



<p>“Split Fiction is the best-received game we have done, everybody is super happy, but I’m so fully focused and excited on the next thing, that we’ve already started,” Fares said. </p>



<p>Fares added that the next game is still “way too early” in its development, but they have about 130 pages so far of current ideas for the game’s story.</p>



<p>“[It’s] mostly in the story, what’s going to happen but a little bit in gameplay as well,” he said. “It’s kind of like, ‘this is where we start, this is where we’re going.”</p>



<p>With Split Fiction having done so well at release, Fares says that the studio has a belief that it can do anything it puts effort towards. He said that the overall mood of the company is as good as its ever been, and there is a confidence of topping its past releases.</p>



<p>“We just feel like, when we talk in the lunchroom or we talk to each other, we’re like, ‘Oh shit, we feel we can do better than this.’,” he said. “That’s how confident we feel, and people are very happy and excited. It’s a very happy place, Hazelight.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review.1137780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In an era where open-world games are a dime a dozen, Xenoblade Chronicles X soars above the pack. There’s an unparalleled feeling of freedom and exploration as you fly your mech suit across the massive planet of Mira, the size of which dwarfs other RPGs like it. While its story about humanity finding another home can be forgettable at times, an already engaging battle system is bolstered by the dramatic quality-of-life improvements this Definitive Edition makes, resulting in an RPG unlike any other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xenoblade Chronicles X starts off with the human race boarding spaceships in an attempt to escape Earth after it gets caught in the crossfire of an alien war. Your ship, the White Whale, eventually crash-lands on Mira, and it falls on you to find its scattered remnants from the freshly settled city of New Los Angeles. It’s a passable story in a vacuum, but it’s also the weakest of the Xenoblade games overall. That’s partially due to its customizable silent protagonist, who is completely devoid of any personality. That blank slate means the story lacks the same emotional impact as the other games in the series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the side quests really help pick up the slack, with fascinating worldbuilding and compelling character development for the rest of your party and even many NPCs. For example, as all of humanity was forced to band together in order to survive, one basic quest explores the topic of discrimination against other alien races – it offers important insight into how humans interact with those races on Mira and how friendships can be forged across racial boundaries outside of Earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing any mission increases the Affinity levels of whoever is in your party at the time, which can then unlock Heart-to-Heart events for them. These are special scenes that provide essential bits of extra backstory, similar to how Persona and The Legend of Heroes handle their bonding events. For instance, Colonel Elma’s cold personality starts to melt away as you learn more about her interest in cars and pizza, fleshing out her character and showing us a different side that the main story doesn’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once a character has a high enough Affinity level, you’ll also unlock their personalized Affinity Missions, and the rewards for completing these are some of the most substantial available. The main draw is that your protagonist will learn exclusive combat skills, called Arts, that otherwise can’t be obtained by leveling up. It’s an excellent incentive to learn more about the supporting cast while also getting stronger.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your main character may be bland, but the world is certainly not.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One standout is the engineer, Lin. Her Affinity Mission details how integral her engineering skills and passion were to the White Whale. While she would much rather sit on the sidelines, she understands that she must also fight when needed, which is why she wields a giant shield and gatling gun in battle. Personal moments with your crew like this really help balance out the fact that your bland silent hero doesn’t have any of their own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Definitive Edition even includes brand new recruitable characters, as well as new story content that is well worth seeing. Without going into spoilers, this content is dolled out at an even pace throughout the 50-60 hour campaign, making its inclusion feel natural while adding even more longevity to an already massive game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While your main character may be bland, one thing that’s certainly not is the open world of Xenoblade Chronicles X. It’s divided into five regions, each with its own type of terrain. For example, the beginning area of Primordia is a lush grassland, while a later area called Cauldros feels overpowering with its lava fields. There are so many gorgeous landmarks scattered throughout Mira that keep exploration exciting, from the giant natural overpass called Arendt Bridge in Primordia to the mysterious and mechanical Leaning Ring sticking halfway out of the sand in the desert region of Oblivia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the only hub area for human activity is New LA, everywhere else is still absolutely filled to the brim with life. Both small and giant monsters are crawling in every direction, but what makes them stand out is that some are docile while others are hostile. The low level bee monster might attack you on sight, but that level 40 gigantic dinosaur-like creature could just walk right past you, minding its own business. Each species has its own habits and behaviors, which means you have to stay alert as you explore instead of just mindlessly meandering around like in many other open-world games. Some monsters will only show up at certain times of day, too, which you can now conveniently adjust from the menu rather than having to find and use special pods scattered throughout Mira.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What also helps is the speed at which you run. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth may be great overall, but I was constantly frustrated by how slow Cloud ran, realistic or not. In Xenoblade Chronicles X, your character runs incredibly fast in contrast. Mira’s gravity also feels like the moon’s, letting you cover long distances and even reach higher elevations with a single jump. Decisions like these make exploring Mira much smoother and less intimidating.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s impressive how well the world scales up with its mechs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also impressive how well the world scales up with its mechs, called Skells, which unlock once you get far enough into the story. When in your Skell, you can move even faster than running on foot, but those giant monsters that were peaceful before may now be hostile to you. That means sometimes it’s better to run to a destination instead of driving your Skell there depending on what is standing in your path. This constantly changes the dynamic between you and Mira’s environment, keeping exploration fresh. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Towards the end of the story, your Skell even gets the ability to fly, letting you reach higher altitudes and providing access to mountains you couldn’t explore at the beginning. This brings exploration to new heights, making Mira really feel like humanity’s new home as you gain the ability to go pretty much anywhere unrestricted.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Everybody was MMO fighting</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat in the Xenoblade Chronicles series is in real-time, but it is distinct from other battle systems as it feels much more like an MMO. Both enemies and allies fight with basic auto-attacks, and you have a row of more powerful Arts to choose from at the bottom of the screen. The order you use them in is similarly important – for example, some offensive Arts can inflict Topple onto enemies, which is a status condition that causes them to fall to the ground temporarily, while others then do more damage to Toppled enemies. There’s a lot of synergy to play around with that adds quite a bit of strategy to the action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another unique feature is the Soul Voice. RPG characters love to call out the names of their attacks and spout quippy one-liners as they fight, and Xenoblade Chronicles actually turns that trope into a game mechanic! You and your allies will occasionally shout out specific phrases that suggest certain actions, like using an Art that inflicts a status effect (which is color coded purple) – following that suggestion will then activate a purple Soul Voice, giving you extra bonuses like making the enemy more susceptible to status effects. It’s immersive while simultaneously leaning into the genre’s more absurd elements.</p><div id="rank-every-xenoblade-chronicles-game" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank Every Xenoblade Chronicles Game</h3><h3>Rank Every Xenoblade Chronicles Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While that’s all just as fun as it was in the 2015 original on Wii U, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition also adds a bevy of quality-of-life improvements. One substantial addition is the Quick Cooldown bar, which fills up over the course of battle as you use auto-attacks. By spending a portion of the bar, you can completely bypass the cooldown period of any Art and use it right away. Need extra healing and can’t wait? Use your healing Art then Quick Cooldown to save your allies from getting knocked out. The Quick Cooldown bar builds fairly slowly, so it’s important to pick the right time to use it, but it can instantly turn the tide of battle when you do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest adjustment is that you can now conveniently change out your party members at any time, anywhere, from a separate menu. While this is a basic feature of many RPGs, the original version instead asked you to memorize where every single character was within New LA and go talk to them in order to swap them in. Sure, maybe that process was more tied to the world around you, but it was also painstaking and incredibly annoying – especially if you were out exploring, since you’d have to return to New LA to change your lineup. This single change is monumental, and quite frankly, is enough to make the Wii U version feel completely obsolete on its own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Definitive Edition cuts down on unnecessary grinding.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, characters not in your active party will still gain EXP now, reducing the tedium of swapping people around even further. In the Wii U version, benched members had to be brought in and leveled separately, making for some very uneven party compositions. The Definitive Edition enormously cuts down on unnecessary grinding, which is certainly appreciated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for customization, each party member has a specific class that can’t be changed, like Lin as a Shield Trooper, but your custom character can switch their class at will. By going down different class trees, you can level up their ranks to learn new Arts and passive abilities. That makes the protagonist feel like they belong in Fire Emblem, where characters can mix and match different skills, and it’s fun to play around and find the perfect setup that fits your playstyle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also fight in your Skell, and Xenoblade Chronicles X scales its battles to them just as well as its exploration. Their overinflated stats and power make mincemeat out of smaller enemies, but they are perfect for facing off against Mira’s giants and other bosses that would otherwise crush you. Battles in your Skell play out similarly to ones on foot, except the Skell weapons you equip determine what kind of Arts you have. It’s another added layer of depth and tinkering that pleased the min-maxing part of my brain.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">George's favorite Japanese RPGs</h3><p>George's list of his 10 favorite Japanese RPGs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the quality-of-life changes listed above, the Definitive Edition boasts some nice visual improvements, too. The UI is much cleaner and the character models are sharper (as you’d hope they would be a decade later), which makes for a smoother look finally worthy of one of the best sci-fi gaming series around. With the Wii U gamepad gone, fast travel and map info have also been smartly reworked into a separate menu on a single screen, transitioning that information perfectly over to Switch. Now I no longer have to experience the neck pain issues caused by having to constantly <em>switch</em> between looking down at my gamepad and back up at the TV screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also some returning multiplayer functionality in Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, though I wasn’t able to test these features as the servers were not on during this review period. In the Wii U version, you could recruit the avatars of other players to tackle Squad Missions such as defeating a specific group of enemies, and online Nemesis Missions offered a satisfying way to test your endgame skills. While minor parts of an otherwise single-player heavy game, these multiplayer elements contributed to the more MMO-centric identity that makes Xenoblade Chronicles X unique, so here’s hoping they’ll have been done justice in the final version of the Definitive Edition.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ahead of today's public debut of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-demo-announced-for-march-18-as-rtx-remix-is-officially-released-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a>, NVIDIA provided us with access to the first taste of this highly anticipated remaster. Let's first recap what we know about it, though.</p>
<p>Modders have long toyed with the idea of remastering Valve's 2004 first-person shooter masterpiece using NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform. Even before RTX Remix was officially available in any capacity, modders grabbed Portal RTX (the first example of an RTX Remix-powered remaster) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-rtx-dropped-into-other-games-half-life-2-max-payne-swat-4-makes-them-drop-dead-gorgeous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">injected it into Half-Life 2</a> with promising results as early as December 2022.</p>
<p>A few months later, when NVIDIA released the RTX Remix Runtime as open source software, modder Igor Zdrowowicz further <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-path-tracing-mod-nvidia-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> the potential of the game when coupled with path tracing. However, at Gamescom 2023, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-is-in-development-by-a-group-of-modders-will-support-ray-tracing-dlss-3-rtx-io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that a group of modders had formed Orbifold Studios specifically to create Half-Life 2 RTX with the blessing of NVIDIA (and Valve) with RTX Remix. It wouldn't be just a quick and dirty project, either - the team wanted to remaster every single asset in the game, as well as use all of NVIDIA's technologies to the fullest extent. Right away, it was announced that the game would use RTX IO, DLSS 3, and ray tracing. Over time, though, as NVIDIA updated and expanded the RTX suite, the project benefited as well.</p>
<p>The Half-Life 2 RTX demo includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA's most advanced path tracer, featuring up to four times more bounce lights than in <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-rtx-beta-primer-info-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft RTX</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-direct-illumination-shows-games-will-soon-feature-up-to-millions-of-dynamic-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Direct Illumination</a>, which enables millions of dynamic lights in a game environment without major performance or resource constraints. With RTXDI, all geometry emits light, casts shadows, and moves freely and dynamically</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Neural Radiance Cache</a>, the first implementation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neural shading</a> in a game yet. With NRC, a grid of AI neural networks is trained on a player's real-time game data to calculate indirect lighting for the scene, improving the lighting quality and also performance at the same time. NVIDIA says NRC provides up to 15% improved performance in Half-Life 2 RTX.</li>
<li>The newly unveiled RTX Volumetrics and RTX Skin effects. The former uses a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-researchers-demonstrate-new-raytracing-algorithm-that-can-render-direct-lighting-from-millions-of-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR</a>-based algorithm to calculate volumes and accurately track how light scatters through the air, fog, smoke, and atmosphere, ensuring physically accurate volumetric shadows, light diffusion, and atmospheric depth. The latter is an enhanced form of subsurface scattering that accurately simulates how light interacts with skin.</li>
<li>Remastered assets with PBR properties</li>
<li>Remade particles</li>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RTX-Neural-Radiance-Cache-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Needless to say, I enabled all of these effects in this test powered by AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition. I manually set NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to Quality (it was set to Auto, which likely scales to Performance mode when using 4K resolution) and cranked up Multi Frame Generation to 4x (by default, it's set at 3x). The results were excellent, to say the least.</p>
<p><iframe title="Half-Life 2 RTX Demo Ravenholm 4K@60 Gameplay - RTX 5090, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBP8eEJ0Iww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The computer averaged 190 frames per second in our Ravenholm benchmark. Moreover, stuttering was nearly nonexistent, with just 3,59% of the frame time in the red area, according to the Frame Latency Analytics Tool.</p>
<figure>

<p>The average frame rate was even higher (193 FPS) in the Nova Prospekt level, the second and last available in the Half-Life 2 RTX demo. However, this level registered a far lower minimum frame rate (down to 60 FPS); as such, due to the far larger delta between the maximum and minimum frame rate, the stuttering was significantly higher, according to the data.</p>
<p><iframe title="Half-Life 2 RTX Nova Prospekt 4K@60 Gameplay - RTX 5090, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6Ml_3SyoLc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This level features a lot more fighting, which could help explain the difference. There might be some more optimization left to do, too. Even so, subjectively, that didn't bother me at all while playing it.</p>
<figure>

<p>I was so engrossed with the incredible level of visuals that I would have been hard-pressed to notice some micro-stutters, despite usually being quite sensitive to them. Half-Life 2 RTX boasts amazingly remade assets that show outstanding fidelity even when zoomed upon. In this regard, the team at Orbifold has done incredible work so far. And then, of course, there's the path tracing, boosted by RTXDI and Neural Radiance Cache. The game is completely transformed with them, almost entirely for the better, with bounce lights and indirect lighting illuminating everything they should and bringing the environments to life.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only caveat is of an artistic nature here. If you compare the remaster with the original, in some cases, it could be said that there is a bit too much illumination coming from certain light bulbs, slightly deviating from the somber atmosphere of Half-Life 2. It's a piece of feedback that Orbifold will hopefully take to heart as they fine-tune the game's look before the full release.</p>

<p>Of course, the RTX Remix platform does allow users extensive amounts of tweaking. However, most players will likely just want to enjoy the remastered game without having to fiddle too much with the developer settings. As such, it may be beneficial to provide a preset that sticks closer to the original game. Beyond that, while the animations were said to have been improved, they're by far the clunkiest part of the demo, standing out negatively in comparison to the great visual strides. Again, hopefully, the full game can deliver improvements in this area.</p>

<p>Overall, though, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo is an incredibly impressive showcase of the remastering capabilities of the newly released RTX Remix tool (not to mention of NVIDIA's latest technologies, of course). Granted, it's unlikely that many other classics will receive the same level of treatment; in this case, a talented team has grouped and received the help of NVIDIA to develop a professional-grade remaster. Moreover, Valve's game lends itself well to such a remastering job due to its linearity. A game like The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, despite originally being among NVIDIA's RTX Remix early showcases, would be much more complicated. Still, several older PC games could be brought to modern standards with the tool, which would be great for everyone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has revealed the&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, and while no new map is on the way this year, you can expect lots of major world updates, as well as destructible terrain being introduced to more maps, new gameplay features, and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a news post on the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, the 2025 roadmap revolves around three pillars: "exciting new content", "enhancing the live service", and "long-term sustainability".</p>

<p>With regards to new content for&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, "major world updates" will be introduced at the end of the year. Krafton says no new map will be introduced, but that the "old beloved maps" will be transformed with "completely new ways to experience them".</p>

<p>Additionally, Krafton is promising that 2025 will bring further improvements to&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s "player actions, vehicles, and items", and the team is also "working on diversifying and polishing player actions".</p>

<p>The developer also promises more collaborations and "co-development with external studios", announcing that the planned&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">co-developed with Starbreeze Studios</a>, is scheduled for "the first half of next year".</p>

<p>As for this year,&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>is getting collaborations with two "top-tier automotive brands", as well as new artist collabs and more "player-driven collaborative content". There's tons on the way for&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>this year, and you can check out the full 30-minute roadmap video right here.</p>




<p>There's also tons of information in the aforementioned post about how Krafton intends to improve&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s live service elements, the game's transition to current-gen consoles later this year, and more.

Its new PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip features 75 color-changing LEDs that can be attached to the back of your display to cast a colored glow on a wall that will then mirror or react to what’s happening onscreen. And instead of requiring additional hardware like a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725979/govee-tv-backlight-bars-review-specs-price">control box or a camera</a>, the lightstrip plugs directly into a PC’s USB port.</p><div><p>The PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fessentials%2Flightstrips%2Fpc-screen-mirror-lightstrip%2F" rel="sponsored">available for preorder now through Nanoleaf’s online store</a> for $49.99 and is expected to ship at the end of March 2025.</p></div><p>It’s designed for use with monitors up to 32 inches in size and features a flexible adhesive zigzag design, making it easier to attach to the back of your display without the lightstrip getting twisted during installation. If you’re using a smaller monitor, excess length can be trimmed off without damaging the lightstrip.</p><p>In lieu of a control box, Nanoleaf’s new lightstrip pairs with the company’s desktop app, which lets you choose one of 16 million different colors or create custom lighting animations. It can also mirror and match the broad colors and tones of a game you’re playing, making the action feel like it’s extending into your room. Or you can use the lightstrip as an audio visualizer, with light effects that match the beats of music you’re playing on your PC.</p><p>If you have a Nanoleaf Premium subscription ($1.99 per month or $19.99 per year), the lightstrip can be used with the company’s more advanced Orchestrator mode that detects and analyzes songs “to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-CA%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-release%2Fces-2025%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored">create dynamic colour palettes</a> and animations tailored to each track.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The LEGO website has been updated to confirm their upcoming partnership with Pokémon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hours ago, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-partnership-reveal-appears-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser video</a> about the partnership between LEGO and Pokémon surfaced online before being abruptly removed. Now, the LEGO website’s <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">themes section</a> has been officially updated to feature the brand-new partnership with Pokémon. Not many details have been revealed about the collaboration other than the fact that it will arrive in 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/The-LEGO-Group-and-The-Pokemon-Company-International-team-up-to-bring-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, the LEGO Group and The Pokémon Company have signed a multi-year partnership to bring the world of Pokémon to life through LEGO bricks. Until now, Pokémon had a licensing agreement with Mattel, which allowed the latter to sell buildable characters, play sets, building blocks, and sets for the franchise through its Mega Bloks brand. However, the new partnership should end Pokémon’s deal with Mattel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julia Goldin, Chief Product &amp; Marketing Officer of the LEGO Group, has stated that “this partnership will create a range of new possibilities for Trainers and builders alike.” Gaku Susai, Chief Product and Experience Officer at The Pokémon Company International, added, “The LEGO Group and Pokémon have strong shared values of imagination, creativity and fun, making this the perfect partnership to deliver unique, meaningful and engaging ways for Trainers to experience the Pokémon brand.”</p>



<p>In other news, Pokémon TCG Pocket is getting a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-a-surprise-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new rival in Digimon</a>. Also, Scopely acquired the Pokémon GO developer for&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3.5 billion</a>.

                <p>If you fondly remember the old days of Counter-Strike before newfangled inventions like the Source engine, we've got good news for you. The mod team behind CSPromod has announced CS: Legacy, a standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6 built entirely in Valve's Source SDK.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PspuiHlF5dM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PspuiHlF5dM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As you can see from the above announcement trailer, the project features classic maps like de_nuke, all gussied up with 4K textures. It even has the static falling-over death animation that Counter-Strike 1.6 players remember well. According to the trailer, the project is coming to Steam Early Access in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Posts on the project's Discord suggest that the initial release will include the classic maps Dust2, Nuke, Train, Poolday, and Aim_map. The small team behind CS: Legacy previously worked together on CSPromod back in the 2000s, which was an attempt to bring CS 1.6-style gameplay to the Source engine. The original Counter-Strike released in 2000, and was replaced with Counter-Strike: Source in 2004, a change that was considered controversial in the community at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Counter-Strike news, in a documentary released for the 20th anniversary of Half-Life 2's release, Valve discussed a Counter-Strike-based <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reflects-on-lawsuit-that-could-have-killed-the-company/1100-6527883/" data-ref-id="1100-6527883">lawsuit with Vivendi</a> that nearly destroyed the company. Essentially, Valve accused Vivendi of distributing Counter-Strike to South Korean cyber cafes without permission; the suit was later settled.</p>

Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">The Nintendo Switch 2 is nigh</a>. Nigh-ish, anyway. When it does launch later this year, it might start another revolution in portable gaming, as millions of people are able to play from their couch, their bed, the train, and anywhere else. That was also true of the first Switch, though, and as big a hit as it was it didn’t spark an industry-wide shift to handhelds the way some people expected. So what gives?</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, we dig in on the state of the handheld console wars. <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean Hollister</a> joins the show to tell us about what we’ve learned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">about the Steam Deck’s success</a>, and whether the sales numbers we’re seeing reflect an exciting new market or a surprisingly static one. We also talk about why Sony and Microsoft have (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">so far</a>) avoided building Steam Deck-like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">gadgets of their own</a>, and why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">the Windows handheld universe</a> remains a bit disappointing. We all think handheld, convertible consoles could be the future, but it might take a little longer than we thought.</p><p>After that, David reports on a trip he took to Florida to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/sport/629858/tgl-golf-tech-espn-sports-future">behind the scenes at TGL</a>, a golf league featuring some of the highest-tech sporting gear you’ve ever seen anywhere. Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, and some of the other biggest names in golf are betting big that this combination of video games, augmented reality, and live action can be a hit both on TV and in your social feeds. But it also raises some questions, like: how do you know when you can trust the computer? And how big is a 53-foot-tall screen, really?</p><p>Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about why you might upgrade from a normal iPad <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025">to an iPad Air</a>. We’ve heard from a lot of students and note-takers the last few weeks who say the extra stylus support, and a few power-hungry apps, make the extra expense worth it.</p><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Meanwhile, Game Pass Core subscribers, the tier that replaced Xbox Live Gold, are getting their library expanded to include <em>Monkey Sanctuary</em>, <em>Tunic</em>, and <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em> starting March 26. </p><p>The bad news is that this month remains a relative bloodbath for older parts of the Game Pass Ultimate, PC, and Standard libraries.<em> Lies of P</em>, <em>No More Heroes 3</em>, <em>Solar Ash</em>, <em>Evil West</em>, and <em>Yakuza 5</em> and <em>6</em> both left last week. A whole bunch more games are leaving on March 31 as well, including<em> Yakuza Kiwami 1</em> &amp; <em>2</em>, <em>Yakuza 0</em>, <em>Yakuza Like a Dragon</em>, and <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>. The good news is that you still have 13 days left to dip into these games, including the 1930s Nazi shooting tactics game <em>The Lamplighter’s League</em>. It was Harebrained Schemes last strategy release before breaking with publisher Paradox Interactive and going independent again. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-preload-guide-file-sizes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Our preload and file size guide for The First Berserker Khazan can get you armed and ready. Before you step into the shoes of the soon-to-be-influenced general Khazan, you first need to preload the game if you’ve pre-ordered it, and you definitely need to know how much space you need.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of expectation on the shoulders of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>. It’s one of 2025’s biggest action-adventure and Soulslike titles, and it has a lot of fans already. We know the basics of the story, we’ve seen the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy List</a>, and we also know if it’s on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-first-berserker-khazan-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass</a>.</p>



<p>But for details on the preload process and how much space Khazan requires, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-the-first-berserker-khazan">How to Preload The First Berserker Khazan</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to process. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can preload The First Berserker Khazan approximately 24 hours before release if you have a confirmed pre-order digital purchase of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Preloading is another recent popular gaming trend. It allows you to have an upcoming game already installed on your device allowing you to play it as soon as its worldwide launch rolls out.</p>



<p>Here’s a basic step-by-step guide if you’ve never done this before:</p>



<ol>
<li>Decide if you’re playing The First Berserker Khazan on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC.</li>



<li>Head to your chosen digital storefront.</li>



<li>Find the search function and look for <strong><strong>The First Berserker Khazan</strong></strong>.</li>



<li>Choose any Khazan edition.</li>



<li>Confirm and complete your purchase.</li>



<li>Wait for the preload option to go live—we think it’s in the <strong>24 hours leading up to Early Access</strong>.</li>



<li>Click the download option once it’s available.</li>



<li>Once it’s installed, The First Berserker Khazan should be in your games library raring and ready to go.</li>
</ol>



<p>Using the Steam page as evidence, it says: “Pre-Purchase this edition and play the game starting three days ahead of full release. Starts in approximately six days.” This means you can expect the preload option to go live in the 24 hours building up to the start of Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-file-size-on-playstation-xbox-amp-pc">The First Berserker Khazan File Size on PlayStation, Xbox &amp; PC</h2>



<p><strong>The PlayStation File Size for The First Berserker Khazan is 25.820 GB, and you need at least 70 GB on Xbox and PC.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a notable discrepancy between PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, but I wouldn’t worry if you’re playing Khazan on the latter formats. <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1900166091801862261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>—a reputable source of file sizes—confirmed the PS5 file size, whereas the PC and Xbox sizes come from the official <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-first-berserker-khazan/9pkjwmbbgk38?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan Xbox</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2680010/The_First_Berserker_Khazan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam pages</a>.</p>



<p>Xbox and PC say you need a least 70 GB—but this doesn’t mean you need 70 GB or anything close come release. To be on the safe side, make sure you have 70 GB free, and if it does end up being far less, that’s a bonus!</p>

This is a World War I tank that has been given a Shelby makeover and it references the global conflict that three of the Shelby brothers took part in prior to the start of Peaky Blinders. There'll also be new Peaky Blinders-themed decals, inscriptions, and a specially composed soundtrack inspired by the show.</p><p>While Peaky Blinders sounds like an odd fit for World of Tanks, it's not unusual for the free-to-play game. Previous collaborations have involved rock band <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-offspring-will-play-a-show-inside-a-very-popul/1100-6469929/">The Offspring</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-adds-wwethemed-vehicles-and-crosspl/1100-6479988/">WWE</a>, and even Hollywood legend <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-enlists-arnold-schwarzenegger-for-latest-holiday-ops-event/1100-6498466/">Arnold Schwarzenegger has been enlisted</a> in the past to promote limited-time Holiday Ops events. In case you never saw it, Peaky Blinders is a British crime-drama series that ran six seasons from 2013 through to 2022.</p><p>Starring Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby, the show charted the rise of the Peaky Blinders street gang in Birmingham and their evolution into a well-oiled criminal syndicate. A film is also currently in the works.</p>

                <p>33 Immortals launches in early access today, March 18, and developer Thunder Lotus has provided <a href="https://thunderlotus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/29838745552404-33-Immortals-FAQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some details about game</a>, including cross-play functionality.</p><p>33 Immortals is a roguelike action multiplayer game that supports up to 33 players in its raid missions. The game has cross-play between PC and Xbox players. Right now, the developer said that it is focusing on creating a finished product, so no other platforms or storefronts have been announced like PlayStation, Switch, or Steam.</p><p>33 Immortals is not a free-to-play game, but it will be available for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-all-these-games-very-soon-in-march-2025/2900-6328/" data-ref-id="2900-6328">Game Pass</a> subscribers. There will also be optional cosmetics in the game. Those who participated in the game's alpha and beta tests will receive a unique halo item during the early-access period.</p><p>The developer laid out a <a href="https://thunderlotusgames.com/blog/33-immortals-roadmap-release-time-and-more/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">roadmap for the game for the rest of 2025</a>. In Spring 2025, the focus will be on fixing bugs and stability issues, as well as balancing UI/UX, VFX, and overall game feel. Accessibility options, control rebinding, and graphics settings will be added too.</p><p>Summer 2025 will focus on new features, including private sessions, Dark Woods decorations, and more trainings. Players will also get the ability to descend after ascending and check out a new ordeal system.</p><p>Fall 2025 will have the game's first major update, which includes a new world called Paradiso, filled with new monsters, a new boss, and even more new features.</p><p>33 Immortals is a departure for Thunder Lotus games. The studio has dabbled in co-op with Sundered and Spiritfarer, but 33 Immortals is its first fully multiplayer game. It has one dedicated single-player game, Jotun, while Sundered and Spiritfarer can be played as single-player adventures.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Apparently it's possible to be guilty of a "hate crime to parkour." Unfortunately for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> protagonist Yasuke, he is culpable in this department, according to a couple of experts in navigating urban obstacles.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed-parkour-experts-video/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> rounded up two parkour athletes, Benj and Toby from Storror Parkour Pro, to discuss what is actually realistic in Assassin's Creed Shadows and what's nigh impossible. The pair took issue with Yasuke using his knee to ascend a ledge, laughing while addressing the problem. "You'll be canceled out of any parkour community around the world," said Benj. Toby added salt to the wound by saying, "That's a hate crime to parkour that climb up there. Yeah, that's brutal." Yasuke is one of two playable characters in the game, with Naoe serving as the more agile option.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQIPl5ss9cU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BQIPl5ss9cU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Basically, the duo explained that parkour should never include utilizing your knees to climb up somewhere. The same is true for your elbows, since those actions are terrible for your joints. Intriguingly, the franchise's iconic leap of faith is actually realistic--from certain distances. They argue jumping off from shorter distances, say no more than seven stories, could be possible with a good amount of hay. But when Assassin's Creed heroes dive off from 30-plus stories, that's a no-go.</p><p dir="ltr">Just days away from release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-stream-assassins-creed-shadows-if-they-buy-the-game/1100-6530144/">Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to stream Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> if they buy the game. Meanwhile, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-support-steam-deck-at-release-ubisoft-confirms/1100-6530082/">confirmed the action-adventure title will work on Steam Deck</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-on-ps5-pro-will-have-an-extra-fancy-ray-tracing-mode/1100-6529947/">PS5 Pro owners will get an extra-fancy ray tracing mode</a>.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/">Assassin's Creed Shadows preview</a>. The game will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-how-long-to-beat-game-director-reveals-a-runtime/1100-6529911/">apparently take about 30-40 hours to complete the main campaign</a>, but that playtime can easily double when including side quests and other activities. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows comes out March 20</a> on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

            <p>
In an announcement set to send shockwaves through wallets everywhere, Lego has announced it will launch a Pokémon-themed range in 2026.
</p>
<p>
Lego's reveal today offers little other than two logos sat next to each other on a website, but already the company's accountants will rubbing their paws. Oh, and there's a Pikachu tail made of Lego too. That's nice.
</p>
<p>"Electrify your imagination in 2026 and get ready to build something we've never built with Lego bricks before!" the company has teased.</p>
<p>
Pokémon has - for a long time - partnered with Mega Bloks to release various buildable sets. No longer, it appears! While Pokémon is not owned by Nintendo per se, the two companies are closely linked, and this announcement follows several <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">successful Lego ranges based around Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing</a>.
</p>
<p>
At a guess, I'd say we're likely to see buildable models of Pokémon that you can pop on your desk or in your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/ikea">Ikea</a> kallax, rather than Lego playsets featuring Pallet Town. But I'd love an Ash Ketchum minifigure, Lego, so please do consider it.
</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a press release accompanying the announcement from The Lego Group states that it and Pokémon "both have a long history of pushing the boundaries of social play, which is at the core of this partnership". 
</p>
<p>"For the first time, the Lego Group will be bringing the most loved Pokémon to life in a brand-new way, with play experiences that will delight new and existing fans alike," the press release states. Is this hinting at some new kind of NFC toy integration, perhaps to see Pokémon battle other players' sets?</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be working with a brand that has such a deep and passionate fanbase as Pokémon, partnering to give our joint audiences what they have been asking us for," Lego chief product and marketing officer Julia Goldin  said in a statement today. "We strongly believe that through the endless possibilities of Lego play and the exciting adventures the world of Pokémon brings, this partnership will create a range of new possibilities for Trainers and builders alike."</p><p>

"The Lego Group and Pokémon have strong shared values of imagination, creativity and fun, making this the perfect partnership to deliver unique, meaningful and engaging ways for Trainers to experience the Pokémon brand," added The Pokémon Company chief product and experience officer Gaku Susai. "Working with the best-in-class team at the Lego Group and seeing their dedication and passion for the project has culminated in an innovative and groundbreaking collaboration that will surprise and delight fans. We cannot wait to see both Lego fans and the Pokémon community's reactions in 2026."

<p>Elsewhere in Lego-related news, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/18-lego-mario-kart-set-leaks-online">Nintendo announced The Lego Super Mario: Mario Kart - Mario &amp; Standard Kart set</a>. This particular set features a buildable Mario complete with a posable head and arms. The Nintendo mascot is sitting behind the wheel of Mario Kart's Standard Kart, described as "the most iconic Mario Kart vehicle of all".</p>
<p>Back in the world of video games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">Pokémon Legends: Z-A will launch for Nintendo Switch</a> (and presumably there will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version) late this year. It's a bit of a longer wait than we were expecting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
