<p>Cosmic conundrums</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Keplar Interactive and Japanese indie dev Shapefarm have announced that their brand new intergalactic puzzle adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a>, is coming exclusively to Switch 2 <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Revealed during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">The Game Awards</a>, which we shouldn't hold against it, Orbitals sees two players take on asymmetrical co-op tasks to stop cosmic storms from ruining their space station. Sounds quite tense. Set in a brand-new retro anime galaxy, the game is a debut effort from Shapefarm, and it's been built "from the ground up" for cooperative play, so we're looking forward to being treated to some smart puzzles, thanks.</p>
<p>You and your partner will set about utilising unique space tools, piloting a ship through meteor fields, or even just hanging out to revel in a retro anime vibe that's based off 1970s manga. So that's why the trailer, which you can see up top, looks so very cool.</p>
<p>Indeed, the devs have gone to the trouble of partnering up with Studio Massket, a storied Japanese animation house, to create a fully original anime world complete with hand-crafted cutscenes. Oh, and it's got full English and Japanese dubs (and you can check out the Japanese version of the trailer at the bottom of the page).</p>
<p>It's nice, too, to see a game that's aiming to utilise all the new tech capabilities we've got on Switch 2, with GameShare, GameChat, and all that caper used to further enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Here's some more info and some official screens to further whet your appetite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orbitals captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm.</p>
<p>Developed in Unreal Engine 5, Orbitals takes full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware to deliver an unforgettable co-operative experience regardless of your preferred way of connecting together.</p>
<p>Either by teaming up with two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single Nintendo Switch 2 device for split-screen local co-op, using the system’s GameShare feature to share Orbitals with another local player on a compatible Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch device, or by matchmaking online with their friends and taking advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat for crystal-clear communications, players around the world can team up and save the day together as one inseparable team.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>All right, I've definitely got a weakness for Star Wars games which shift the camera away from all the glowy sword fights and space politics, instead zooming in on galactic ne'er-do-wells getting up to mischief. I blame my dad's influence. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> stuck that chord for me, and Star Wars: Galactic Racer looks like it'll combine similar appeal with the trump card of chaotic off-road racing.</p>

<p>Announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced-for-pc">last night's Geoffs</a>, Galactic Racer's a speeder speedfest from Fuse Games - a new studio led by ex-Criterion devs with Burnout and Need For Speedy flavour to their CVs. Though, watching its trailer and reading through <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-trailer?image_id=star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-01_d7c67bb8">an interview</a> Fuse co-founder Matt Webster and Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly have given to the official Star Wars website, my brain's been taken to a different racing place.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off packs of landspeeders and speederbikes swooping and slamming as they hover through trails that wind through the likes of a ship graveyard on desert world Jakku and the snowy wilds of Ando Prime. It's obviously leaning into the podracing vibes we've seen videogamed in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-episode-1-racer">Star Wars Episode I: Racer</a>, even starring Phantom Menace speedster Sebulba, but in practice, the action sounds like Evolution Studios' old PlayStation mud-fests.</p><p>"We’ve drawn real inspiration from runs-based games so the player will have meaningful, consequential decisions to be making on how they chose their path to become an elite racing pilot — from the vehicle they choose to start with, the upgrade choices they make to create a build that really suits their playstyle and what events they select in determining their path to become champion of the League," Webster said in the interview. "Along the way you’ll compete with rivals, journey to new planets, and master different classes of repulsor craft — or speeders — each with their own distinct capabilities.</p>
<p>"We have a range of racing repulsorcraft for players to discover in the game, each of which have unique handling characteristics to master. Speederbikes, for example, are fast and ferocious, you’ll be braking heavily into corners, really leaning in and then massive drops of acceleration as you power your way through the exit. Also notice that in many of our events, our different speeder classes race at the same time, with exciting physical interactions as those differing racing lines come together."</p>
<p>Given the off-roady courses, that last bit about routes aimed at the different strengths of different craft  diverging and coming back together is the aspect that's put my mind back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>. Obviously, it's not like Galactic Racer's floaty rides will be getting stuck in the mud or splattering through it with chunky tyres, but cutting through narrow chasms in your nimble skim speeder to avoid being side-swiped by a bulkier landspeeder on a more open track definitely is.</p>
<p>All in all, the prospect of battling through the underground racing scene as Shade - "a lone racer with a dream of glory and revenge" - has definitely got my engine running at this point.</p>
<p>If the same applies to you, Star Wars: Galactic Racer's wishlistable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4078430/STAR_WARS_Galactic_Racer/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Film adaptations of video games are pretty hot at the moment, with the likes of The Minecraft Movie and The Super Mario Bros. Movie making big money. Next year we're getting a new take on Street Fighter, and now we've got the first look at it in action.</p>

<p>The trailer, which clocks in at under one minute, shows off many of the movie's (and game's) main characters, including Guile (wrestler Cody Rhodes), M. Bison (David Dastmalchian), and Akuma (wrestler Roman Reigns). If you know what you're looking for you can see Guile's flash kick and the classic car smashing bonus stage from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>

<p>Neat, right? What's even neater is the car carrying the same IC29 licence plate from the game.</p>
<p>Street Fighter is releasing in cinemas on 16th October, 2026. The latest game in the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, released back in June 2023 on PS4, PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S, and was followed by a release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> for the console's launch in June this year.</p>
<p>What do you make of the trailer, and did you spot any more moves from the games? Surely it's got to be better than the Jean-Claude Van Damme-starring adapation from 1994.</p>

<p>Launching 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> might want to pay attention, because another co-op adventure is heading to the Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/out-of-words">Out Of Words</a> launches in <strong>2026</strong> and is a stop motion co-op adventure from developers Kong Orange, Wired Fly, and Morten Søndergaard, with publishing duties from Epic Games. You'll explore the "wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis" as Kurt and Karla, two mouthless individuals who must work together to overcome the odds.</p>
<p>The game got its public debut at Summer Game Fest in 2025 and received plenty of critical acclaim from those who went hands-on with the demo. It's lovely, then, that it's now been confirmed for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Find your lost voices in a co-op platformer adventure. Together with a friend, via online cross-platform or couch co-op, explore the wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis as Kurt and Karla in a story about the first time they held hands — where everything you see is crafted by hand."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Game Awards also confirmed the existence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a> for the Switch 2 (with the latter also heading for the original Switch ).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Highguard is a new PvP raid shooter from the creators of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=apex+legends"> Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Titanfall">Titanfall</a> which mixes guns with magic, plus some light horseback riding.&nbsp; You play as a Warden who must fight for the Shieldbreaker, which in turn lets you smash into the enemy base.</p>
<p><iframe title="Highguard - Official Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh6Pi6h_css?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The rest of the game is being kept under wraps but we can see from the trailer it looks good, and while the hero character designs are impressive they do seem to fall in to the usual stereotypes. Maybe one day we will get a hulking, growly, muscle brute who’s actually a wizard with long-range attacks rather than a rage-filled, close combat animal.</p>
<p>The trailer also shows some of the abilities the heroes have and they are suitably splashy and spectacular and remind me of the Supers found in Destiny 2. In fact some of them seem very similar, the animations are very close, but I guess there’s only a finite number of ways you can wave your hands around to cast a spell.</p>
<p>There’s some horseback riding, but you can also ride a bear (don’t get any ideas), or a panther. Also in the mix is what appears to be medieval take on the Thundertank from Thundercats. The only thing that made me wince whilst watching the Highguard trailer was the blonde character shouting “Bring the heat”,&nbsp; that phrase has been used so many times in video games it is cheesy as hell.</p>

<p>The game is free-to-play which should give a decent start but the world of F2P shooters is already packed with the likes of RedSec, Fortnite, Overwatch 2, and COD Warzone and we have seen many games try and break in to that market and fail</p>
<p>Highguard will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on January 26th, 2026, will you be singing up to play?</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco Aces has announced ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during The Game Awards 2025</a>. About a year and a half ago, an actor's resume <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-ace-combat-8-squadron-42-and-gearboxs-next-game-all-target-2025-launch-according-to-actors-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'leaked' its existence</a>, suggesting a 2025 launch, but the game will instead be released next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. Still, we don't suppose many fans of this franchise will complain. This is the first mainline installment in seven years, after all.</p>



<p>As you'd expect, the press release claims it will take the IP to new heights. Harnessing the power of Unreal Engine 5 in addition to proprietary technology, the studio promised players a visually stunning, ultra-realistic aerial thrill ride. It will feature an immersive campaign mode that places players in the role of an ace pilot, embroiled in an emotional tale of identity and duty as they fight for the survival of their homeland. ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE will also feature multiplayer modes that thrust players into high-speed aerial dogfights against friends and foes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The press release notes that the new game continues the legacy of the ACE COMBAT franchise, which has consistently pushed the boundaries of game visuals and action-packed, arcade-inspired gameplay in the flight shooting genre. Players will fly various real-world fighter jets from around the globe in a game characterised by stunning visual detail and effects. They will navigate realistic expanses of clouds, finely rendered terrain and landscapes, and inclement weather. Bandai Namco Aces also teased thrilling cinematics and the option to view them from a first-person perspective, which could potentially enhance the immersion of the story.</p>



<p>The announcement trailer provides a first glimpse of the game's in-depth Campaign Mode, in which players take on the role of an ace pilot in Strangereal, a fictitious war-torn world. The weight of decisions, the pressure of command, and the bonds forged in battle will feel very real. With their nation, the Federation of Central Usea (FCU), occupied and its navy destroyed, players take on the role of the 'Wings of Theve' – a legendary ace whose name is synonymous with Theve, the capital of the FCU, and who is a symbol of hope for every citizen in their homeland. Joined by three new fighter pilots, they embark on a mission to reclaim their homeland and eliminate the threat to their people, carrying the hope of every FCU citizen and taking on the name of their capital city.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, publisher KOEI TECMO and developer Team NINJA announced that a new demo of their upcoming dark samurai action RPG, Nioh 3, will be released on January 29, 2026 on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam). The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-visual-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous demo</a>, as you might recall, was only available for PS5. Players will be able to sharpen their blades in the new demo in solo mode or in online multiplayer mode with up to three other players. Cross-play is not supported for online multiplayer, according to the press release, and this limitation applies not only to the demo but also to the full game. After completing the demo, fans will be able to carry over their save data to the final game.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are now open. The Standard Edition is priced at $79.99, while the Digital Deluxe Edition costs $119.99. This version includes the Season Pass (also available for separate purchase), as well as the following items: </p>



<ul>
<li>Nioh 3 season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>



<p>The season pass is a set including add-on DLCs. The DLCs include new stories, enemies, yokai, boss characters, and equipment. The aforementioned season pass bonus items will be released on the same date as the base game. Add-on DLC 1 is set to become available by the end of September 2026, and add-on DLC 2 is set to become available by the end of February 2027.</p>



<p>A SteelBook edition is also available to pre-order and includes the base game and two exclusive DLC bonuses. Players can also pre-order a special PlayStation 5 physical edition exclusively through the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/nioh-3-treasure-box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NIS America Store</a>. The Nioh 3 TREASURE BOX includes the base game, a Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm Keychain, a Nioh 3 Original Desk Pad, the Official Artbook, and a Nioh 3 Selection Soundtrack CD.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Additionally, new exclusive bonuses for players who purchase the game early have been revealed. These players will receive bonus armour sets inspired by protagonists from previous titles: the “Youngblood Armour (Samurai)”, worn by William in Nioh, and the “Lone Wolf’s Armour (Ninja)”, worn by Hide in Nioh 2. These items can be obtained by redeeming the “Hellfrost Armour Set” early purchase bonus in the game. Lastly, a special discount is available on the Steam version of Nioh: Complete Edition, which offers players a 90% discount on the first title in the franchise.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 launches on February 6, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and PC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a>, who recently played the game at a preview event, it feels like the culmination of every previous Team NINJA title. The developers also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured fans that the game won't feature sudden difficulty spikes</a>.</p>

            <p>
The future is here! Or, I guess it's around 40,000 years away, but that's still more or less here for the Total War series, which'll be tackling a futuristic setting for the first time in last night's reveal of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-is-real-and-features-orks-space-marines-the-aeldari-and-for-some-reason-david-harbour">Warhammer 40,000 spin-off reveal</a>. It's got most of what you'd expect, like those mean ole Space Marines, and big, dramatic, explosive battles with so much going on on screen you'll get a hernia. But there were a few details shared in a post-reveal blog post that go into some small bits that weren't a part of the big reveal.
</p>
<p>
Right at the bottom of said <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/total-war-warhammer-40000">blog post</a> is an FAQ, with the first notable question there being "where are the Chaos Space Marines?" As it stands, the only revealed factions so far are the regular Space Marines, Orks, Aeldari, and Astra Militarum. In response to that question, Creative Assembly explained that the Chaos Space Marines won't be there at launch, but they'll "absolutely" be a part of their plans "at some point, along with all the other iconic factions from the setting."
</p>
<p>
Then there's the question of modding. From right off the bat, the team wants to support modding on the Steam Workshop from launch, but it's the official modding tools you'll have to wait a while longer for. This is down to Creative Assembly's new Warcore engine, and they note that they'll have more details to share on that "close to launch." Oh, and don't worry, there won't be any blood DLC because the "41st Millennium is a setting of eternal war, so blood and dismemberment is key to creating an authentic experience."
</p>
<p>
The blog post also makes mention of a "small roundtable with members of the development team" coming next week on December 16th. Important to note that you shouldn't expect a big look at gameplay, it sounds like more of a light chat about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game. A full look at its story and gameplay will apparently come in spring, so hang tight for now.

		<p>I know I really like Ace Combat, but in the world of gaming storylines, I couldn’t tell you one little detail about the somewhat crazy geo-political shenanigans that the series is known for. Still, we can all hope that the story becomes a touch more affecting with the announcement of the latest entry, Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve, with its Top Gun-inspired aerial combat due for release at some point in 2026 and coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKIE3ClcDyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Project Aces and Bandai Namco, Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve is a direct sequel to Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown which released all the way back in 2019. This time out, you’re a fighter pilot, adrift at sea in a rescue boat until the outdated aircraft carrier, Endurance, pulls you aboard. The ageing vessel, its decks crowded with refugees, has already retreated far from the front lines.</p>
<p>On this ship, you’re given a new name: “Wings of Theve”. A legendary ace, a symbol of hope, a name tied to Theve, the FCU capital. But, as it turns out, that legend was a lie; it was just a story made to keep morale alive. Now, you must carry that name and take to the skies with three new comrades at your side, fighting to reclaim your lost homeland.</p>
<p>Ace Combat 7 earned a hefty <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-review/">9/10</a> when it launched, where I said, “In Ace Combat 7, dogfighting games have a new Top Gun. The VR sadly turned my stomach, but the series’ trademark action is bigger and better than ever, with the spectacular weather effects introducing a level of realism and drama that will win over any wannabe Mavericks.”</p>

<p>I definitely can’t wait to check out some more aerial combat, and I’ll certainly try to remember more of the story this time out, with the new first-person cutscenes looking like they’ll put you right at the centre of the action.</p>
<p><em>You can already wishlist Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288340/ACE_COMBAT_8_WINGS_OF_THEVE/">Steam</a>.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[NO LAW, from the Makers of The Ascent, Is a 1st Person Open World Shooter RPG Very Reminiscent of Cyberpunk 2077]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-law-from-makers-of-the-ascent-is-a-first-person-open-world-shooter-rpg-remiscent-cyberpunk-2077/</link>
            <guid>1381510</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://x.com/NeonGiantGames/status/1995417593407050185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> in the past few days, Swedish developer Neon Giant, known for 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ascent-qa-neon-giant-shares-info-on-game-length-crossplay-and-the-games-living-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ascent</a>, has revealed a new game called NO LAW during <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. While The Ascent was an isometric twin-stick shooter, though, this upcoming game is a first-person open world shooter roleplaying game that, at least on the surface, is highly reminiscent of CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, players take on the role of Grey Harker, a former soldier who has left his war-torn past behind in favour of a quiet life tending to his plants, until trouble finds him again. When his peace is shattered by violence, Harker must rely on his black-ops instincts and customised equipment to reclaim what was stolen and confront the city that wronged him.</p>



<p>Set against the backdrop of the sprawling port city of Port Desire, carved into the cliffs above a restless sea, the game invites players to explore a neon-sleazy world where regulation is absent. This vibrant metropolis is a hub of import and excess, teeming with colourful characters whose motives are as murky as the smog-filled skyline. Every inch of Port Desire, from the rooftop gardens to the alleys below, is alive and reactive, waiting to be shaped by the player's choices.</p>



<p>Every decision carries weight, according to Neon Giant. Should you help a friend in need or silence an enemy permanently? Should you take the tactical route through the shadows or unleash chaos in open combat? Even in a city without laws, actions have consequences. Each playthrough promises new possibilities, allies and outcomes, making NO LAW an immersive shooter that is as much defined by its story and morality as by its firepower.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NO LAW | The Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uD6kFXZlX00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, NO LAW blends visceral first-person combat with deep player agency. Whether the player favours precision, stealth or destruction, their approach will define the in-game experience. Players can master advanced military upgrades, experiment with sci-fi tools and vertical movement, and transform every mission into their own tale of revenge, consequence and survival.</p>



<p>Claës af Burén, Managing Director at Neon Giant, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>NO LAW represents the next step for us as a studio. With The Ascent, we built a strong foundation for how we approach worldbuilding, systems, and storytelling. This new project takes everything we’ve learned and applies it to a completely different kind of experience — one that’s bigger, more reactive, and more personal than anything we’ve done before.</em></p>



<p>The game, which will be published by Krafton (the Korean studio acquired Neon Giant in 2022), is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. It can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161710/NO_LAW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, where we found the recommended system requirements. The minimum requirements are currently unavailable.</p>

                <p>It was almost a foregone conclusion, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 absolutely crushed it at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a> this year, taking home little polygonal statues for <a data-target="true" href="https://www.gamespot.com/">a record-setting number of categories</a> it was nominated for. When the game's director, Guillaume Broche took the stage, he thanked <a data-target="true" href="https://www.gamespot.com/">a number of individuals</a>, but he ended his speech by giving a very special thank you to us, the players, not with a speech, but with a rather sizable update for the game that dropped the second he walked on stage to accept the award.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WPmS4eSknc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6WPmS4eSknc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dubbed "The Thank You Update", this is no mere costume/weapon set, though there's over a dozen each of those to go find too.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/terminator-2d-no-fate</link>
            <guid>1381489</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161075/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Are you old enough to remember being a kid and seeing a NES, Super Nintendo, or Mega Drive game of a licensed movie, and having your imagination run wild as to all the playable scenarios potentially contained within? If the answer is 'yes', then you’re equally likely to remember the actual experience typically being rushed, poorly coded junk that barely resembled the material upon which it was based.</p>
<p>But, in an alternate timeline, UK developers Mike Tucker and Matthew Cope would grow up to form a future resistance in 2016 under the moniker Bitmap Bureau (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xeno_crisis">Xeno Crisis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_vendetta">Final Vendetta</a>). Their mission: return to the early '90s to create the 16-bit movie licensed game kids always dreamed of, before travelling back to 2025 to correct the past and save the world. Confused? Wait until you find out who the dad is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> <em>is</em> that game: prophesied to say "hasta la vista" to the memory of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Aljn">LJN</a> and its Skynet-like destruction of movie licenses. It recreates Cameron's action spectacular right down to the tiniest of details, forging it into the 2D gaming adventure it was destined to be.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161076/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What I value about Bitmap Bureau is that it always aims squarely for the Super Nintendo and Mega Drive game that never was. Terminator 2D’s entire design feels born out of an alternate timeline, like a genuine 16-bit companion to the movie’s 1991 release.</p>
<p>There are two starting modes and several locked bonuses, including a Boss Rush and an Infinite Mode. Story Mode is stuffed with cutscenes taken from the movie's sequences, with text outlining the narrative. It’s also a longer game, in that it’s bookended with stages that occur before and after the events of the movie, having Sarah Connor first retrieve a kidnapped John from a Mexican cartel, before breaking into Cyberdyne Research. This actually alludes to what John Connor tells his friend early in the film: that his mother was arrested trying to recover something she believes to be hidden within Cyberdyne's lab.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161074/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From there, you leap to the future war, playing adult John as he faces off against the machines, and the epilogue ensures there’s a climactic finale beyond Arnie's 'thumbs-up' farewell. As Bitmap Bureau isn’t restricted to following the movie’s blueprint in these original stages, they're actually some of the best: freer in design, more creatively bold, and teeming with colossal machine bosses.</p>
<p>In Story Mode you only have one life and four continues, but can greatly increase their stock by finding special icons throughout the campaign. With a generous life bar and liberally distributed health icons, it’s surprisingly easy on defaults — especially so when compared to Bitmap Bureau's infamously brutal Xeno Crisis. Seasoned gamers will likely finish it in just a few attempts, but tweaking the difficulty up from "No Problemo" to "Hasta La Vista" adds in additional enemies, rearranges some objects, and makes the time limit more pressing.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161077/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finishing Story Mode once opens up new paths with new stages and characters to play, triggered at choice-based junctures. Will you off Miles Dyson in front of his family? Or will you install Arnie’s skull chip and finally get your hands on that Minigun? It’s an idea that greatly improves replay value, especially since the alternate routes are altogether awesome, and it takes the total number of stages to at least 16, as far as we can gather.</p>
<p>Arcade Mode, while equally soft enough to beat, requires you do so on one life and no continues. It’s also shorter, cutting out the precursor stages and cutscenes to focus only on the movie-related parts, making for a brisk, exciting experience. And, if you’re struggling to nail a particular stage, there’s a Practice Mode to help out.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is superb, blending those classic Terminator musical motifs into all-new mixes, and graphically it’s very impressive. The capturing of the movie’s characteristics is applause-worthy: fans will be grinning ear to ear and end to end as it works through every set-piece and minute detail in grand 2D style. The recreation of even the smallest of particulars is superb, from that burning tyre that rolls out of the post-aqueduct explosion, to the T-1000 getting Hasta La Vista’d into liquid nitrogen chunks. It’s all so thoughtfully reproduced, there must be an award in here somewhere for movie-license accuracy.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161073/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The sprite work, though, is a touch stilted in places. Most enemies look fine, collapsing to the ground fluidly when shot, but the human-sized guard dogs are just strange. Sarah Connor can’t bend her knees much and her gait appears stiff. And, while the giant, towering future war Hunter Killer machines and gunships look fantastic, we would have liked the emblematic T-800 endoskeletons to have had a little more presence and threat. It’s a mixed bag that mostly ranges from sufficient to great, and it’s a minor criticism in a game where tight controls gloss over any aesthetic dips. It’s just surprising that, with an art team capable of feats like animating the T-1000’s entire lava-death transformation, some of the sprites appear, well, slightly robotic.</p>
<p>Stages are piece by piece constructed from the movie’s sequences, and it’s all action all the way. There’s no faffing about collecting coloured keycards here: it’s all gunning, lobbing grenades, barging, punching and driving. Much of the game plays like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/contra">Contra</a>, with 8-way directional fire and a useful slide attack, but different characters have different moves depending on the scenario.</p>
<p>When Sarah is breaking out of prison (one of the more difficult stages in the game), she only has bare feet, a nightstick, and a lock-picking mechanic; but when she goes militaristic, planting bombs in Cyberdyne’s HQ, she can wield certain enemies as human shields and slide kick falling debris into encroaching assailants. In the famous “Your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle” sequence, you play naked Arnie in a simplistic beat-'em-up-inspired stage, roughing up bikers to the film’s actual background music (make sure you destroy that Jukebox!). Elsewhere, you race down the aqueduct as John, before switching to a shotgun-strapped Schwarzenegger to shoot out chain-link fences.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161079/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So much from the movie is present, in fact, I only lamented not getting to evade the T-1000 through a giant '90s arcade centre. Well, that and the fact Schwarzenegger's likeness couldn't be acquired for the game (but there are some clever workarounds).</p>
<p>In an odd way, Terminator 2D is so thorough in tracing the movie’s sequences that it almost doesn’t feel like a game in the traditional sense. Every stage is different, piecemeal, with clever gameplay implementations that make each feel unique — but it’s extraordinarily linear on the whole. Most stages take less than three minutes to beat, and go by in a flash once you know the layout. There is the odd hidden item to find just off the beaten path, and whether taking cover behind walls to avoid a laser barrage or triggering traps to catch the T-1000 in machine assemblies, it’s plenty of fun to learn.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161078/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, it’s more a series of endearing movie vignettes than a full-blown game in the traditional sense. By sticking to the source material so exactingly, it limits itself in scale, more akin to a compilation of arcade-like bonus games than a series of fully-articulated stages.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Interestingly, half of what makes Terminator 2D fun is its painstaking reproduction of the movie on which it’s based. Were it to have no relationship to a beloved IP, it would likely be criticised for its brevity, linearity, and general simplicity. Once fully beaten, you won’t likely return to it for anything except a nostalgia hit, but T2 fans and 16-bit diehards will feel well-served by its detailed reminiscence.</p>
<p>A great deal of the game's charm is derived from its novelty factor, and it's that novelty, in conjunction with some clever ideas and impressive authenticity, that should inform your purchasing decision.</p></section>

		<p>We’ve had a lot of Star Wars games over the years, across a heap of different genres, but racing games have been few and far between. Star Wars Episode I: Racer – which appeared on a bunch of great consoles like the Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 – was centred on the hyper-fast pod racing scene that George Lucas made a highlight of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, and, somewhat unbelievably, remains the highest-selling sci-fi racing game of all time. Ahead of Wipeout and F-Zero! It makes sense then that we would eventually see a new game set in a galaxy far, far away, and it’s called Star Wars: Galactic Racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Galactic Racer™ - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiavNl4qxWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set after the fall of the Empire, the trailer shows a variety of different Star Wars vehicles racing across places like Rey’s home of Jakku and what looks like the ice planet Hoth, with vehicles including speeders and speeder bikes. There are things that look like Luke’s X34 Landspeeder and the iconic Endor Speeder Bike, but I’m sure the red-and-black vehicle is a Sparrow from Destiny. That would make sense after the recent Renegades expansion took Star Wars into the Destiny universe, and Sparrows were ultimately based on Star Wars’ own vehicles in the first place. </p>
<p>At the end of the trailer there’s a reveal for anyone who knows Star Wars, with the Dug, Sebulba, appearing while stroking his beard fronds, and the iconic sound of a pod racer engine rumbling in the background, so you have to assume that pod racing is included, or at least some of the vehicles. Sebulba was famously Anakin’s key rival in The Phantom Menace’s race scenes, where the arrogant alien sabotaged Anakin’s pod racer, before proceeding to ram all the other racers off the track. Here’s hoping you’ll be able to return the favour in Star Wars: Galactic Racer!</p>
<p>Star Wars: Galactic Racer is due for release in 2026. </p>

			<p>“The guiding principle of Terminator 2D: No Fate’s development was always to make it feel like the kind of arcade game that could’ve come out in the 90’s alongside the release of Terminator 2: Judgement Day,” say the developers, Bitmap Bureau, and it’s fair to say that is exactly what they have made. I am old enough to have been gaming in the 90s and Terminator 2D: No Fate reminds me of the excellent RoboCop 2 game that was released on the Commodore Amiga.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE – Official Launch Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPzOPAJpYDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story follows the plot of Terminator 2 fairly closely, with a few extra missions set in the future. All the key scenes from the film are brought to life in chunky pixel graphics with even chunkier pixel text explaining the plot before you set off on your rampage of violence.</p>


<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is a side scrolling shoot ’em up in which you play one of the famous characters from the game and run around shooting bad guys until you reach the boss and finish the level. You can only fire in eight directions, starting with your basic pistol or automatic rifle, with bonus weapons such as spread fire lasers hidden throughout the levels. These pick-up weapons only last for a limited amount of time rather than a number of bullets – in true action movie style, those are infinite. Shotgun, pistol, or laser cannon; it doesn’t matter what you use, the weapon never needs reloading.</p>


<p>To mix things up a little, there are two driving sections, both based on the chase sequence from the film where the T-1000 has a truck, and Arnie is on his bike. You also get to play as a completely naked Arnold – his nether regions naturally being pixellated to hide anything saucy – in a beat ’em up sequence set in the Biker bar.</p>
<p>There are four difficulty levels and the harder you make the game the more enemies you get, the less health you have, and other additional factors are added such as time limits and limited continues. The developers suggest playing the game on Hard and that does give you a true arcade experience. By that, I mean you will be cursing a lot, and gradually working your way through each level over many, many attempts, as you learn the positioning and patterns of the enemies and commit them to muscle memory; 90s games were as much a test of your memory as of your joystick skills.</p>

<p>While the game does use the 90s aesthetic there are a few modern improvements. Most notable is just how slick the animation is, which has many more frames than you would have got back in the day when one megabyte was considered a lot of memory. The music is also rather epic with a couple of licensed songs that play out under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The big question is, does this retro gameplay work in the modern day? For me it absolutely did, I found myself playing just like I did in 90s, learning the enemy patterns and firing in their direction before they even appear. Terminator 2D: No Fate is a challenge on the harder levels, but deaths rarely feel cheap and it does have that much needed “one more go factor” that will have you playing in to the small hours. That said there is one level where you are chased through entire level by the T-1000 and if you miss-time opening a door or take a misstep then you will get speared through the eye with a metal spike. It verges on being frustrating but does feel like an achievement when you finally make it through.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Warhammer 40,000, leaping from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/total-war-warhammer-3-review/">Warhammer Fantasy</a> setting to the grimdark future and galactic warfare.</p>
<p>A release date has not been given, but the game is in development for PC as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/total-war-medieval-iii-announced-at-series-25th-anniversary-total-war-engine-gets-ready-for-console-gaming/">as was teased at the 25th anniversary stream</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER 40,000 - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVgCDqLTaJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the brief snippets of gameplay hint at, Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will actually look to adapt the war for the galaxy and planets as opposed to settlements and cities – a more thematic, but no less significant change for the feel of the game.</p>
<p>You’ll still have the same empire expansion gameplay here, capturing planets, upgrading your fleet and having a war economy to feed further growth. Sieges become orbital bombardments, assaulting the walls of the castle becomes sending in the drop pods and landing and army. And if you need to, there’s always planet-killing weapons.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Four factions will be playable to start with – Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and the Astra Militarum (AKA the Imperial Guard) – and you’ll have the ability to customise your troops, choosing colours, emblazening uniforms and armour with particular iconography and also affecting their gameplay style. Change a combat philogophy, arm them with tactical abilities, signature traits and arcane wargear.</span></p>
<p>Game director Attila Mohacsi said</p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">“Hi everyone!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">I can’t tell you how incredible it feels to finally share this with you: Total War is heading into the Warhammer 40,000 universe! For so many of us on the team, this isn’t just another project. It’s a dream come true. We spent years imagining what Total War could look like in the grim darkness of the far future, and now we’re in the process of making it a reality.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">A lot of us are lifelong Warhammer 40,000 fans, so this is personal. We want to do justice to the scale, the drama and the sheer intensity of this universe while staying true to what makes Total War special. It’s the start of a brand-new chapter for the franchise, and we couldn’t be more excited to go on this galactic journey with you.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">We’ll have more to share, and we can’t wait to hear what you think.”</span></em></p>
<p>So… whaddya think? For more details, the studio will be hosting a round table discussion for broad strokes about this game’s development and direction.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly are going to be busy with developing Total War 40K as well as Total War: Medieval 3 (as was announced last week) and building their game engine to better handle consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Janitor’s Ending is the second escape route in Dig To Escape. Instead of digging forever to escape your cell, you can simply buy the Keycard and escape through the janitor’s room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This method is not only faster but also demands stealth in the second part of the escape, where you must collect Batteries. Players must also save a staggering 200 Toilet Paper to purchase the Illegal Keycard in the first place. You are advised to dig and even out the surface rectangularly instead of digging a hole straight down. This way, you’ll clear the entire layer and scavenge all available items using your basic spoon Shovel. This guide will explain more about the Janitor’s Ending, important tips, and the late-game scenario.</p>

<h3 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-before-going-for-the-janitor-s-ending-in-dig-to-escape">What You Need To Know Before Going For The Janitor’s Ending In Dig To Escape</h3>



<ul>
<li>Your primary objective is to save 200 Toilet Paper, the amount required to purchase the Illegal Keycard.</li>



<li>When digging, clear the ground in a rectangular pattern rather than digging straight down. This method helps you find a lot more items, then sell them to earn a minimum of 20–30 Toilet Paper per day.</li>



<li>Trade only for energy-based items (food), as maintaining your digging stamina is essential for quick progression in Dig To Escape.</li>



<li>With consistent digging, eating, and selling, you should be able to save 200 Toilet Paper within roughly 10 in-game days.</li>



<li>Avoid spending Toilet Paper on Energy Surge upgrades, extra Storage, or new Shovels, these are unnecessary for completing this specific escape route.</li>



<li>Do not trespass at night to trade or sell items. The guard patrols aggressively and may easily catch you. Instead, take advantage of the vent system, slip out during the “Afternoon” hour, and use the vent in the main hallway, which gives you access to four nearby cells.</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Keycard Scanner in Dig To Escape | Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>The vent inside your own cell leads to the prison restroom. From there, you can reach both the Janitor’s Room and the adjacent Security Room.</li>



<li>One of the four NPC prisoners will eventually offer the Illegal Keycard for sale. On Hard difficulty, expect the Keycard to appear only after 15–17 days of trading cycles.</li>



<li>Once you’ve saved the required 200 Toilet Paper, purchase the Illegal Keycard.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-what-to-do-after-getting-the-illegal-keycard-in-dig-to-escape">What To Do After Getting The Illegal Keycard In Dig To Escape</h3>



<ol>
<li>Wait until morning before making your escape via the Janitor’s room. Escaping at night is risky because the Dig To Escape guard patrols the hall, and getting caught ends the run.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Equip the Keycard, walk up to the lock, and scan it using the interact button.</li>



<li>Grab the ladder, equip it, and carry it over to the Janitor’s room.</li>



<li>Place the ladder right under the vent.</li>



<li>Open the vent, climb the ladder, and crawl inside.</li>



<li>Your prisoner will end up in a small room with a small switchboard, while a guard patrols the hall outside with a flashlight.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-how-to-find-the-12-batteries-in-dig-to-escape">How To Find The 12 Batteries In Dig To Escape?</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Batteries location in Dig To Escape | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You need to be careful and precise with your movement. The guard in this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-midnight-chasers-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game has unorthodox pathing and can easily ruin your escape if you’re not alert. You must collect 12 Batteries and place them inside the switchboard to restore power and escape. The Batteries don’t have fixed spots, they spawn in random places throughout the hall and the rooms connected to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the rooms needs the Keycard, so be ready to equip it and scan the door immediately. Don’t waste time on interactions here because the guard is very fast. Preplan your route first, then act. There’s also a cheeky trick where you can insert Batteries through the wall by standing in the room next to the switchboard. This bug saves you from entering the actual switchboard room.</p>







<p>Batteries usually spawn in a few common spots: the second room on the middle table near the monitor, on the circular table at the end of the hall, along the cabin path, and inside the room you open with the Keycard. Just move safely, stay patient, and gather all 12 Batteries to restore power.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-to-do-after-finding-the-batteries-in-dig-to-escape">What To Do After Finding The Batteries In Dig To Escape</h3>



<p>Once you’ve inserted all 12 Batteries into the Switchboard and the power comes back, wait for the guard to move away from the left side of the hall. When the path is clear, make a run towards the bright open elevator to complete Dig To Escape. After you enter, the “JANITOR ENDING” screen will pop up along with your Dig To Escape gameplay time.</p>

It's an Act 3 thing. If you get it, you get it.

Users who own <em>TankHead</em> for PC via Epic Games Store will receive <em>TankRat</em> as a free upgrade.<span id="more-1014638"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Kepler Interactive:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Fact Sheet</strong></p><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In the aftermath of a war that reduced the world’s most fantastic city to ash, the Event Containment Area (ECA) stands as a monument to humanity’s ambition and ruin.</p><p>A wasteland of twisted metal husks, the remnants of mankind’s greed spread like mechanical cancer across the world. Only steel remains, humans having to project their consciousness into mechanical “Shells,” powerful drones that can salvage and control armored tanks of a lost age.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You are Whitaker, a Sleepwalker—a digitized consciousness inhabiting a Needle, a hardened drone built to endure the storms and <a title="Genres > Horror [792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s of the ECA. And your <a title="Genres > Survival [495 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> will be earned, one kill at a time.</p><p>Welcome to the end of the world, it’s time to hunt TankRats.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become What You Break</strong> – Shift seamlessly between the agile Needle and powerful combat Tanks as you explore the ECA’s Dead Zone. You must traverse what remains of a once advanced society to scavenge all the materials you can to upgrade your machine. Dismantle enemies, strip their wreckage for weapons, armor, and tech, and graft their parts onto your own rig. Every trip through the wasteland is a chance to rebuild, respec, and come back stronger.</li><li><strong>Tear Through <a title="Platforms > Meta [165 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l</strong> – Blast through swarms of corrupted drones and mech-monsters in fast-paced, brutal vehicular combat across shifting battlefield conditions. The Dead Zone’s greatest terrors are the TankRats, wandering remnants of lost Sleepwalkers, twisted by the Shroud and time itself. You’ll need to exploit every weakness to bring these metal titans down. The only way out is through, and the only way through, is to destroy everything in your path.</li><li><strong>Rise Above the Ruins</strong> – The fabled city in the sky, Highpoint. A whispered truth buried in the ashes of a lost civilization. You don’t know why, but you know with absolute clarity that the only reason you fight is to uncover the truth behind the Shroud, a radioactive storm that warps time, memory, and reality itself. What are you willing to give to make it to the promised land, and what will you do if you don’t like the truth you find there?</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_1014642"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ FAQ</strong></p><p><strong>What if someone already owns <em>TankHead</em> on Epic Games Store?</strong></p><p>If you already own <em>TankHead</em> on the Epic Games Store, you will receive a free upgrade once <em>TankRat</em> releases, giving access to all the new features and content. The game’s page will be updated to reflect this update and name change later in Spring 2026.</p><p><strong>Why the name change?</strong></p><p>We changed the name because the game has evolved so much, and we wanted to signpost that really clearly. We believe it provides a clearer throughline to the scavenger-driven identity at the heart of the player character, and an ode to the colossal enemies you’ll be fighting to the death against on your journey through the wasteland.</p><p><strong>What can be expected for <em>TankRat</em> compared to <em>TankHead</em>?</strong></p><p>A lot of work went into <a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> <em>TankRat</em> as the ultimate evolution of <em>TankHead</em>. We added more story content, more bosses, more biomes, more customization options, a refined battle system as well as many more surprises that we can’t wait to tell you more about. Stay tuned for more information on our channels!</p><p><strong>Is <em>TankRat</em> single-player or <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [658 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>?</strong></p><p>TankRat is single player.</p><p><strong>What languages will <em>TankRat</em> support?</strong></p><p><em>TankRat</em> will be voiced in English, and feature subtitles in French, German, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Simplified Chinese.</p><p><strong>Who are the main characters in <em>TankRat</em>?</strong></p><p>Whitaker is a Sleepwalker, someone who has the capacity to teleproject his conscience into machines. This is the only way humans can survive in the wastelands of the ECA. Driven by a thirst to reach Highpoint, he will fight to the end to uncover the mechanical mysteries of the world.</p><p>In his journey, Whitaker is guided by Cyril, a mysterious and charming “fixer,” occupying a mechanical body. Cyril probably knows more than he shares, and his lure for profit makes him a difficult character to trust.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p><em>Orbitals</em> captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm. The artists and developers at the studio have lovingly created a brand-new original world inspired by retro anime from the early ’90s and brought the artform to life in a way never before seen. Additionally, the developers have partnered with Studio Massket, the animation house behind hundreds of some of the most beloved and popular Japanese anime, to create hand-crafted cutscenes for the game for that extra layer of authenticity for fans of the anime medium. Combined with both full Japanese and English audio dubs, Shapefarm intends to honor the anime artform with a cooperative playable adventure that fans can fall in love with.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>’s promised free expansion is available to download right now, developers Sandfall Interactive have announced at this evening’s Trial by Keighley, aka the Game Awards. </p>
<p>The update includes new enemies and bosses, a new dungeon, enemies, new language support and costumes. The extra environment appears to be toy-themed and accessible later on in the game. If you’re concerned about spoilers (I myself still haven't finished this), I would skip the below trailer. I would also skip the below trailer if the prospect of death by lollipop strikes you as a bridge too far even for Clair Obscur, a game of many disarming eccentricities.

<p>The update includes a photo mode, all the better to check out the assortment of extra headgear and outfits. Why don't I wear a top hat like that, eh? Because I have neither the money nor the audacity, that's why. Anyway, let me weep in peace. Catch the full feature breakdown below, care of my old friend Monsieur Blockquote.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to 'Verso’s Drafts’ - a whimsical storybook adventure with ties to a young Verso. Players will encounter celebratory Gestrals, surprising new locations and an encounter with a sinister, powerful presence…</li>
<li>New music tracks by Lorien Testard, the award-winning composer behind the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack, which are also now available on digital streaming platforms. You can listen to the playlist on YouTube here.</li>
<li>Challenging boss battles for late-game players to overcome within the Endless Tower. Besting these powerful adversaries will reward players with powerful new Pictos, costumes and gear.</li>
<li>A much-requested official Photo Mode, allowing players to pause the action and commemorate their favorite moments from the game’s story and battles.</li>
<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19. </li>
<li>Added FSR 4 support, including AMD temporal upscaling for sharper visuals and frame generation for smoother gameplay on compatible GPUs.</li>
<li>New Quality of Life improvements, other new features and further improvements to the game’s performance across platforms, including on handheld PC systems. </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>We here at Rock Paper Vinegar Dot Com regard the awards section of the Game Awards as so much flaking greasepaint for a very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-reportedly-charges-over-1-million-for-a-three-minute-trailer-while-just-a-minute-can-run-up-nearly-half-of-that?preview_key=pMAvYLie7_Gilad_GyovTCtVBAFwDlQZ&amp;preview_device=desktop">expensive</a> marketing machine, but I will grudgingly note that Clair Obscur won a lot of gongs tonight, and that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">deserves the praise</a>. Today’s update looks to be a fitting victory lap.

                <p>Each year The Game Awards sees its fair share of viral moments both cringe and heartwarming, but none have persisted through the years quite so much as orchestra member Pedro Eustache--better known as "Flute Guy." Fittingly, Flute Guy once again got his moment in the spotlight this year, showing off his strangest flute variant yet.</p><p>Ever since he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26w76OmzEKI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went viral in 2022</a> for enthusiastically playing the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 medley on a strange-looking tenor flute, Eustache has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528392/" data-ref-id="1100-6528392">been a regular feature of The Game Awards</a>. Each year he seems to get more dedicated airtime during the orchestral section, playing bigger and more unusual flutes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621613" data-ratio="0.56235294117647" data-width="1700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621613"></a><figcaption>Pedro Eustache playing a strange new flute during the Clair Obscur tribute</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg"></figure><p>2025, of course, is no different, with Eustache even getting his own announcement video on The Game Awards' <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1997327335725596961" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media pages</a> in the lead up to the show. His appearance in the orchestral section didn't disappoint, with his flute part highlighted through the Death Stranding 2 arrangement, and his part in the Clair Obscur section played on a strange new flute that appears to be made out of PVC pipe.</p><p>Flute Guy, and the whole orchestral mix, added some needed drama to one of the most obvious Game of the Year announcements The Game Awards has seen. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">most award-winning game</a> in the awards show's history when it picked up nine awards, including Game of the Year. It had previously secured the record for most nominated game, receiving 13 total nominations. Clair Obscur has also been revealed as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2025</a>.</p><p>For all the rest of the winners, losers, and surprises from The Game Awards 2025, check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">all the biggest announcements</a> from the show, as well as our roundup of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">all the 2025 winners</a>.</p>

			<p>Capcom has been on a roll the last few years, but not everyone has been able to join in on the fun. Capcom’s former (still?) mascot Mega Man has been missing in action for nearly a decade, with 2018’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mega-man-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Man 11</a> being the last core entry in the series. <span>Well, Robot Masters, beware, because today at&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards,</a>&nbsp;a new entry in the Mega Man series was revealed.</span></p>



<p>Mega Man: Dual Override looks to deliver exactly what fans of the series are hungry for – good old-fashioned 2D platforming action, done up with crisp, cell-shaded visuals. My palms are already feeling sweaty. The end of the trailer also seems to show the standard Mega Man transforming into a more souped-up version, perhaps hinting at what the “Dual Override” subtitle might mean. Oh, and what was that telltale whistle at the very end of the trailer? Hmmmm! You can get your first peek at Mega Man: Dual Override, below.</p>

<p>Looking for more details? Unfortunately, Capcom is remaining fairly tight-lipped for now. This is all they have to say about the game at the moment…</p>



<p><em>“Mega Man returns in 2027 with a brand-new entry in the classic action platforming series! Override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers!”</em></p>



<p>You can actually have a hand in shaping this next Mega Man, as Capcom is holding a Robot Master contest, where the winner gets to design one of the game's bosses. </p>

To celebrate the reveal, Mega Man 11 will receive a special discount on digital storefronts over the coming days. For a limited time, players can look forward to picking up the acclaimed title on sale for under $5 USD via the PlayStation Store, Nintendo eShop, Xbox Store, and Steam. Mega Man 11 is also expanding its arsenal of language options. Brazilian Portuguese and Latin American Spanish speakers can look forward to new localizations in an update that will go live later tonight.</p>
