            <p>
Former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden has suggested the continuing push toward more powerful - and more costly - console hardware is unsustainable, arguing that "fighting over teraflops [is] no place to be... We need to compete on content".
</p>
<p>
Layden - who served as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and chairman of Worldwide Studios before leaving the company in 2019 - was asked by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-says-console-arms-race-has-plateaued/">VGC</a> if the console industry's current business model was sustainable, given the increasing development costs associated with the ongoing pursuit of incrementally more powerful hardware.
</p>
<p>
"We've done these things this way for 30 years," Layden replied, "every generation those costs went up and we realigned with it. We've reached the precipice now, where the centre can't hold, we cannot continue to do things that we have done before."

<p>
Layden said he believed it was time for a "real hard reset" on the industry's current business model, even a "hard reset on what it is to be a video game. It's not 80 hours, it's not 90 hours, but if it is that's a whole different category."
</p>
<p>
He added the effectiveness of chasing more powerful hardware had "plateaued", and was unlikely to appeal to the majority of players. "We're at the stage of hardware development that I call 'only dogs can hear the difference'," he continued.
</p>
<p>
"If you're playing your game and sunlight is coming through your window onto your TV, you're not seeing any ray tracing. It has to be super optimal... you have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things... We're fighting over teraflops and that's no place to be. We need to compete on content. Jacking up the specs of the box, I think we've reached the ceiling."
</p><p>
Layden's comments come ahead of Sony's new PlayStation 5 Pro console, which launches on 7th November and is primarily being marketed on the promise of improved performance and visual fidelity for supported PS4 and PS5 games. The machine's ¬£700 price tag hasn't been particularly well-received, however, raising the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb7vhF2ELZg">question of who exactly it's for</a>.

With the addition of Gamma 1 and Gamma 2 from DLC 1, the game has revealed four upcoming playable characters through the Season Pass.

The company says the problem ‚Äúimpacted a small number of legitimate player accounts,‚Äù and all accounts affected were restored.</p><p>However, zebleer, who runs the Phantom Overlay store selling cheats, claims the problem is much bigger than Activision‚Äôs post makes it seem. <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1847024778600689706">In a detailed post on X</a>, they write that when Ricochet scanned the memory of a player‚Äôs computer to find known cheat software, one of the signatures it scanned for was a plaintext string reading:</p><div><blockquote><p>54 72 69 67 67 65 72 20 42 6f 74 (Trigger Bot)</p></blockquote></div><p>As a result, zebleer says that ‚Äúfor quite some time,‚Äù it has been possible to get someone permanently banned simply by sending them a friend request with the phrase or posting a message like ‚ÄúNice Trigger Bot dude!‚Äù in the game‚Äôs chat since it would then show up in their memory and get scanned by Ricochet. </p><p>Despite Activision saying a ‚Äúsmall number‚Äù of legit accounts were affected, zebleer claims that ‚Äúseveral thousand random COD players were banned by this exploit‚Äù before anyone started targeting big streamers. </p><p>Zebleer points to <a href="https://x.com/BobbyPoff/status/1841912385977655744">BobbyPoff</a>, a <em>Call of Duty</em> streamer, as one of the people <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1846953059345486159">banned</a> due to the person using the exploit since October 3rd before his account was <a href="https://x.com/Headdband/status/1846708945227804864">suddenly unbanned yesterday</a>. Like other players and <a href="https://x.com/notcloakzy1/status/1841942184259400182">streamers</a> caught up in the bans, there had been intense speculation and discussion over whether or not BobbyPoff was a cheater, even as he maintained his innocence and some people <a href="https://x.com/TheMainDevent/status/1844176079831081110">posted jokey videos</a>.</p><p>The Call of Duty Updates account says that the Ricochet team will share a blog post tomorrow, though the account didn‚Äôt specify if the post will discuss this exploit. </p><p>Activision didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But eventually, it made its way over to Xbox and thanks to Microsoft buying Bethesda, it‚Äôs now a part of Game Pass. And that‚Äôs awesome because while <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo </em>is a gorgeous game set in a highly detailed digital Tokyo that is filled with some cool sidequest and spooky enemies, some players might not enjoy the game‚Äôs focus on combat. This scary first-person adventure feels like a perfect fit for Game Pass, letting you try it out and see if you enjoy its creepy combat. And if not, <em>Ghostwire </em>didn‚Äôt cost $60 to find that out. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-recommend-id="image://faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Telltale Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-recommend-id="image://faa076ff10219348e968f50de64557ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zombies try to get through a boarded up window." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Telltale eventually drove their <em>The Walking Dead</em> formula into the ground, the first couple of seasons of episode adventures did <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-the-walking-dead-should-be-game-of-the-year-5972488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-walking-dead-should-be-game-of-the-year-5972488">a fantastic job of capturing the comic book franchise</a></span>.

<p>Apex Legends has been a hit within the Battle Royale scene since its release back in 2019. Developed by Respawn, the game has quickly grown within the competitive and casual scene. Looking to get involved in competitive Apex Legends? You should probably learn all the Apex Legends ranks first.</p>



<hr>







<p>Just like the majority of other popular competitive games, Apex Legend‚Äôs Ranked system has a specific order that players have to climb up in order to reach the very top.</p>



<p>Like other games, Apex Legends also follows the traditional Bronze through Gold format. </p>







<ul>
<li>Bronze </li>



<li>Silver (120 RP)</li>



<li>Gold (280 RP)</li>



<li>Platinum (480 RP)</li>



<li>Diamond (720 RP)</li>



<li>Apex Predator (1000 RP)</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Each rank requires a specific amount of Ranked Points to reach it and has a IV through I system.</p>



<h6 id="h-ranked-top-esports-tournaments-what-are-the-best-esports-tournaments">Ranked: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-tournaments/">Top Esports Tournaments | What Are the Best Esports Tournaments?</a></h6>



<hr>







<p>Unlike many other games, Apex Legends actually rewards people who climb up its Ranked system. Each ranking provides competitors with different rewards, including weapon cosmetics and more.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>



<li>Dive Trail</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Apex Predator:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Badge</li>



<li>Weapon Cosmetic</li>



<li>Dive Trail</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many other Battle Royale games simply just reward you with a badge each time you rank up in competitive. Apex Legends, though, seems to want to get players more involved with their Ranked system by giving out different prizes.</p>



<p>These rewards change with each new season the game releases.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-the-game">How to Rank Up in the Game</h2>



<p>There are a few ways you can climb the ranks in Apex Legends. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kills (1 RP per kill)</li>



<li>Top 10 (2 RP)</li>



<li>Top 5 (4 RP)</li>



<li>Top 3 (7 RP)</li>



<li>Champion (12 RP)</li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, winning a match will give you the most points to help you rank up, so put your focus on getting first.</p>

            <p>
Almost two years after its was confirmed to be in the works, Amazon's live-action TV adaptation of Sony Santa Monica's God of War series is reportedly getting a "do-over" after the companies involved decided on a "different creative direction".
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-sony-executive-producers-depart-new-writers-joining-1236118075/">according to Deadline</a>, which reports showrunner and executive producer Rafe Judkins (who also serves as showrunner on Amazon's The Wheel of Time adaptation) has now left the God of War project, along with executive producers Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus.
</p>
<p>
Deadline says the trio had already completed "multiple scripts" for God of War's first season - scripts that were reportedly "praised" by Sony and Prime executives - but it seems these will now be scrapped as the companies pursue a "different creative direction". Despite the shift, Deadline's sources say the TV project remains an "important asset" for Prime, with Sony and Amazon now looking to hire a "whole new writers room" for the series.

<p>
When Amazon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-god-of-war-tv-adaptation-is-officially-go">initially announced its God of War adaptation</a> back in December 2022, it explained it would follow Kratos' "dangerous journey with his estranged son" to fulfil his wife's dying wishes and "spread [her] ashes from the highest peak". However, "Kratos soon realises the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new gods and monsters for the fate of the world."
</p><p>
It's unclear what Amazon and Sony's new "creative direction" for the series may be, but given the original pitch was to adapt God of War's now-completed Norse saga, it's possible a decision has been made to instead tie the series into future releases. There have, for instance, been rumours Sony is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-god-of-war-trilogy-is-rumoured-to-be-getting-remastered">looking to revive the original God of War trilogy</a> in some form, so perhaps the TV show might be looking to plant its flag in ancient Greece.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the outcome, reports of a "do-over" suggest it's going to be some time before Amazon's live-action God of War TV series makes it to the screen. Before then, Prime has the (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-series-two-is-ahead-of-schedule-says-amazon-head-of-tv">currently "ahead of schedule"</a>) second season of its acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> adaptation on the way, and it was reportedly also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">eyeing up a Mass Effect series</a> at one time.

<p>It felt like major updates to DayZ come too few and far between, but there‚Äôs still nothing like the survival game.

You won't find it on store shelves at the moment, but you can order it online and pick it up at your local Best Buy in a week or so.</p><p>It's described as a "two-way" device, meaning you can charge your controllers while connected to the stand or while playing. The actual charger is basically the official Joy-Con grip without the handles. You're essentially turning a pair of Joy-Con controllers into a single USB-C wired controller. It's remarkable that Nintendo hasn't released its own Joy-Con charging stand until 2024, a year that has been filled with speculation around the Nintendo Switch's successor. But perhaps Joy-Con controllers and this stand will be compatible with the Switch 2.</p><p>Though this is the first official Joy-Con charging stand, it's not the first Joy-Con charger designed by Nintendo. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charging-Grip-Stand-Nintendo-Switch-Japan/dp/B01N7TGKYE?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now-discontinued Joy-Con Charging Grip</a> was one of the few first-party accessories released alongside the Switch in 2017. A replacement for the standard Joy-Con grip that came with the console, it also charged your controllers while playing. You could refer to that as a one-way Joy-Con charger, though the inclusion of ergonomic handles was a nice bonus. This new two-way option drops the grip and adds the stand.</p><p>If you want the original Joy-Con Charging Grip, you can get a preowned one for $20 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-joy-con-charging-grip%2F142687.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendos-first-official-switch-joy-con-charging-stand-launches-today-cappy-not-included%2F1100-6527242%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.

One of those licensed options is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Nintendo-Switch-Joy-Charging-Dock/dp/B01MR6JD1M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA's Joy-Con Charging Dock</a>, which originally sold for $30 but is now available for only $20 at Amazon.

It'll probably be one of the most common accessories gifted alongside new consoles. If you're looking to buy a Nintendo Switch as a gift this year, Nintendo released two holiday bundles this year.

Super Nintendo World - Universal's Mushroom Kingdom-inspired theme park land - will fling open its pink Peach Castle doors in Orlando, Florida on 22nd May next year.
</p>
<p>
This third iteration of Super Nintendo World, which follows versions opened at Universal Studios Japan in 2021 and at Universal Studios Hollywood last year, arrives as part of Universal's new 110-acre, multi-billion-dollar <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/gb/theme-parks/epic-universe">Epic Universe theme park</a>.
</p>
<p>
Super Nintendo World is one of five themed areas at the new park, which visitors can explore alongside Celestial Park, Dark Universe, How to Train Your Dragon's Isle of Berk, Super Nintendo World, and Harry Potter's Ministry of Magic. And if you've seen Super Nintendo World's previous iterations, you'll know what to expect here.

<p>
Super Nintendo World Orlando features the same <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-full-ride-through-of-super-nintendo-worlds-chaotic-mario-kart-ride">AR-based Mario Kart ride</a> seen in Japan and Hollywood, alongside the more sedate (if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-super-nintendo-world-temporarily-closes-following-yoshis-adventure-ride-fire">occasionally infernal</a>) Yoshi's Adventure dark ride - which didn't make the cut at Universal's smaller California park. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, it includes Super Nintendo World's second, Donkey-Kong-themed area, along with the impressive Mine-Cart Madness rollercoaster - both of which are set to open in Japan later this year following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-delay-hits-nintendo-theme-park">lengthy delay</a>. Visitors can also expect the same wrist-band-based interaction system seen at other parks, and the usual assortment of shops and restaurants.
</p><p>
Super Nintendo World's other destinations have generally been well-received, despite their currently lacklustre ride selection, and Universal reportedly has big plans for the future, with Pok√©mon and Zelda areas having long been rumoured in theme park insider circles. It's been <a href="https://orlandoparkstop.com/news/rumors/possible-zelda-ride-concept-to-replace-lost-continent-in-islands-of-adventure/">claimed</a> a Zelda land will replace the now-defunct Lost Continent area of Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure, for instance - reports that gained traction after Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-of-legend-of-zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-at-universal-studios-pulled-offline">spotted in a quickly yanked official Universal video</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
But first, Super Nintendo World comes to Florida on 22nd May next year, with a Universal Singapore version to follow. And we might even see one in Bedford eventually, if Universal decides to go ahead with plans to built a 476-acre theme park and resort in the UK.

Steve Jackson Games has announced the 40-year-old solo adventuring RPG book series will be getting a new printing thanks to a historic 50-book publishing collaboration.</p>
<h2>The Fighting Fantasy US Reprint Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> co-creators Sir Ian Livingston and Steve Jackson have signed a US publishing agreement for the acclaimed book series with Steve Jackson Games.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fighting-fantasy-steve-jackson-and-sir-ian-livingstone-screenshot.jpg?itok=jT0-iUdy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fighting-fantasy-steve-jackson-and-sir-ian-livingstone-screenshot.jpg?itok=NPJ0f_Gc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the press release, Livingston said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúTo have a new publisher in the USA is a special moment in the history of <em>Fighting Fantasy</em>. We have known Steve Jackson (US) for more than 40 years, having distributed Steve Jackson Games in the 1980s when we owned Games Workshop. Steve also wrote three fantastic Fighting Fantasy books which caused a lot of confusion at the time when people didn‚Äôt realize there were two Steve Jacksons! We look forward to exciting times ahead in the USA for new and existing <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> fans.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Fighting Fantasy</em> was a solo adventuring RPG book series. It debuted in 1982 with the adventure <em>The Warlock of Firetop Mountain</em>. The books were revolutionary at the time thanks to their nonlinear narratives with dice-rolling RPG mechanics. It was a series where the player's decisions and dice rolls would determine the story's outcome.</p>
<p>This mix of solo adventuring and RPG mechanics made these game books stand out from other gamebooks. Its contemporaries include Joe Dever's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/joe-devers-lone-wolf-series-returns-to-print" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Lone Wolf</em></a> series, which was a choose-your-own-adventure book with light journaling and resource management.</p>

A number primed to increase with this new printing stateside. And considering a full series sells for about <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/383576492819?chn=ps&amp;_trkparms=ispr%3D1&amp;amdata=enc%3A1lxHSXENsRgKcuW32hXA1Ew17&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=101&amp;itemid=383576492819&amp;targetid=2319404999269&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9006662&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=21222256297&amp;mkgroupid=167054596991&amp;rlsatarget=pla-2319404999269&amp;abcId=9408285&amp;merchantid=108045050&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw68K4BhAuEiwAylp3kgwdQ6oSkEqk5x1bYf0qZTPevW0H1DxAei3o-Oqz6nW9RHWj5MOSTRoCqvgQAvD_BwE">$120 on eBay</a>, this printing may be more financially viable.</p>
<p>The first five books in the series will arrive sometime in 2025. An additional five volumes will be released sometime later that year.</p>

You aren‚Äôt alone! Horror games can be incredibly intense, even for those who love a good scary movie. But maybe you still want to enjoy some games on Halloween, just without all the jump scares.<br></p><p>To help folks out, I‚Äôve put together a list of games I think will get anyone into the Halloween spirit without making you scream in horror or close your eyes in fear.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ngi2ekkeynwml6ngod9r" data-recommend-id="image://ngi2ekkeynwml6ngod9r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wideload Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ngi2ekkeynwml6ngod9r" data-recommend-id="image://ngi2ekkeynwml6ngod9r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Zombies! Love ‚Äòem or hate ‚Äòem, these undead bastards are a big part of our current pop culture landscape. But most of the time you are running from them, killing them, or being eaten alive by the undead. <em>Stubbs The Zombie </em>flips the script and has you star as a zombie, eating brains and farting on people. It‚Äôs a bit odd, but if you can find a way to play it this Halloween season, I highly recommended it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stubbs-the-zombie-s-bizarro-throwback-soundtrack-perfec-1845111300&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stubbs-the-zombie-s-bizarro-throwback-soundtrack-perfec-1845111300">Or just listen to the soundtrack</a></span>.

But not many games are actually set during Halloween. Sure, some games like <em>Bully </em>include Halloween sections or areas, but few games let you explore a Halloween night as a kid. This is one of the main reasons I had to include <em>Costume Quest </em>and its sequel on this list. In these turn-based RPGs released by Double Fine,  you play as kids in Halloween costumes fighting monsters and trick-or-treating. What‚Äôs more Halloween than that?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb912bd5dadc30e27356c8d0e1ec18fd" data-recommend-id="image://bb912bd5dadc30e27356c8d0e1ec18fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Klei Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb912bd5dadc30e27356c8d0e1ec18fd" data-recommend-id="image://bb912bd5dadc30e27356c8d0e1ec18fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, you might not expect <em>Don‚Äôt Starve</em>, a fantastic 2D survival game featuring crafting and resource management, to be a creepy-but-not-spooky video game experience. But that just means you haven‚Äôt played <em>Don‚Äôt Starve,</em> which can be a very creepy and tense survival game where monsters lurk just outside your flimsy walls.

It makes for a creepy and unsettling atmosphere. But there aren‚Äôt any real jump scares or moments of extreme gore in <em>Control</em>. Instead, the fear comes more from the unknown and the strange things you encounter. And if anything gets too scary, just shoot it a hundred times with your fancy paranormal pistol.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="du1vzjkeug1hyxhfmzk3" data-recommend-id="image://du1vzjkeug1hyxhfmzk3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Terminal Reality</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="du1vzjkeug1hyxhfmzk3" data-recommend-id="image://du1vzjkeug1hyxhfmzk3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That <em>Ghostbusters</em> game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was a perfect <em>Ghostbusters</em> game if you get what I‚Äôm saying. What I mean is, it had all the sound effects, characters, and ghosts you love, it just all came in a mediocre third-person shooter package. The recently released remastered versions of this game don‚Äôt improve them much, but they do look nicer and it is now easier than ever to play this game. And while the action might be...<em>eh</em>, the ghosts are still ghosts and perfect for Halloween.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="g8rah0cgaqftpxerscuk" data-recommend-id="image://g8rah0cgaqftpxerscuk" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="g8rah0cgaqftpxerscuk" data-recommend-id="image://g8rah0cgaqftpxerscuk" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Any of the <em>Luigi‚Äôs Mansion</em> games would be perfect to play around Halloween.

It‚Äôs a sequel to the original film and it‚Äôs like a Disney spin on <em>Devil May Cry</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/cl6bIr2KMQM?t=942&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/cl6bIr2KMQM?t=942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seriously.</a></span> It‚Äôs not great, but it‚Äôs better than you might expect and a perfect game for the creepy Halloween season.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="h64b6pie7oks2mlztnpv" data-recommend-id="image://h64b6pie7oks2mlztnpv" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Namco Bandai</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="h64b6pie7oks2mlztnpv" data-recommend-id="image://h64b6pie7oks2mlztnpv" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Released in 1988, <em>Splatterhouse </em>is a classic beat ‚Äòem up from Namco that plays like other beat ‚Äòem ups from that era. But unlike many of those other games, <em>Splatterhouse </em>was on the gruesome and scary side. Still, its frights are pretty quaint when compared to <em>actual </em>scary games. In <em>Splatterhouse</em>, you play as someone who is totally not Jason Voorhees and work your way through levels punching and killing monsters who are stupid enough to get in your way. It still feels great in 2020 and its retro scares are best experienced in a dark room during a cool October night.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d56cbeae87d1ff04ee70e44b24124da5" data-recommend-id="image://d56cbeae87d1ff04ee70e44b24124da5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d56cbeae87d1ff04ee70e44b24124da5" data-recommend-id="image://d56cbeae87d1ff04ee70e44b24124da5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don‚Äôt let the game‚Äôs cute and gorgeous 2D art fool you, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-lamb-review-ps4-xbox-one-switch-pc-1849423403&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-lamb-review-ps4-xbox-one-switch-pc-1849423403"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a></span> is a creepy little roguelike action game about running a cult and fighting monsters.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Star Citizen‚Äôs turbulent 12-year development isn‚Äôt a secret. A quick search on YouTube or Google will reveal a plethora of issues that the project has suffered since its inception in 2012. From broken promises to cut features, backers have learned to either abandon ship or strap themselves in for the ride with no final destination in sight. Frustrations are at an all-time high, and for many of those working on the game, it‚Äôs a mutual feeling.</p>



<p>On October 1st, Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) developer‚Äôs inboxes were hit by a new mandate from Global Head of Production Erin Roberts; those working on Citizencon deliverables must work every day, including weekends, until October 19th. The mandate forced employees to work 19 straight days for a minimum of 8 hours per day up until Citizencon, with TOIL (time off in lieu) being offered for the Saturday and Sunday hours worked, as well as breakfast goods and lunch being offered. </p>



<p>It‚Äôs a mandate that was quickly altered after staff raised questions about the legalities surrounding it. So, instead, CIG opted to give employees Sunday off if they meet the minimum threshold of 56 hours worked from Monday to Saturday ‚Äì a change that would still be illegal in UK law if CIG‚Äôs employee contracts didn‚Äôt contain an opt-out agreement of the 48-hour weekly limit. In addition to the sudden change, Insider Gaming had also asked for comment on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original report on the mandate</a>, which seemingly prompted an email sent by Erin Roberts to staff to also give employees October 21st off as a free company holiday. Perhaps it was just a weird coincidence, but it‚Äôs a gesture that some employees say likely wouldn‚Äôt have happened if the news of the mandate wasn‚Äôt going to be made public.</p>



<p>Most staff saw it as a bandaid over a bullet wound, saying that the company needs a complete overhaul to survive. Some workers think that CIG has already passed the point of no return, with its future heading in an unavoidable crash course due to its mismanagement and overspending. Over the past couple of weeks, I‚Äôve spoken to over a dozen past and current employees on CIG‚Äôs current situation, which gives a brief insight into the company‚Äôs internal workings and possible future.</p>



<h2 id="h-bleak-financials-amp-spending">Bleak Financials &amp; Spending</h2>



<p>As of 2022, <a href="https://cloudimperiumgames.com/blog/corporate/cloud-imperium-financials-for-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to its financials</a>, the company has spent $637 million on development, with 2020 ‚Äì 2022 averaging over $106 million a year. Assuming that the company continues spending around $100+ million a year, it doesn‚Äôt take a mathematician to realize that the $790 million raised so far at the time of writing is on the verge of, or has likely, run out. It‚Äôs an assumption felt by both current and former employees at the company, who say they have been experiencing the effects of apparent dwindling funds these past 12 months.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cloud Imperium Games‚Äô financials</figcaption></figure>



<p>Earlier this year, CIG quietly laid off an estimated 100-150 staff members at its Austin and LA offices. The company had hoped the move would go under the radar because affected employees were told to sign Non-disclosure agreements, which prevented them from announcing their departure on social media. Former employees said those who refused to sign were told they would not get any form of severance. </p>



<p>Undoubtedly, the information about layoffs hit the internet because of those who refused to sign NDAs or decided to speak to the press. The information on the layoffs eventually forced CIG‚Äôs hand, and the company issued a statement revealing that ‚Äúa small number of positions were eliminated‚Äù and that it had ‚Äúdecided to co-locate as much development as possible.‚Äù </p>



<p>Current staff members also felt the financial burden, with wage increases being frozen and the prospect of career progression seemingly being halted, all as the cost of living continues to rise. Some employees tell me they are now struggling to make ends meet, leading some to contemplate leaving the company and questioning their future in the industry entirely. </p>



<p>‚ÄúBut at least we have baristas serving us coffee here,‚Äù one employee joked, referencing the over-the-top coffee bar that takes up a large portion of the 9th floor of its new Manchester building.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Concept Image of Cloud Imperium Games‚Äô coffee area at its Manchester office.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to sources who believe backers‚Äô money could be spent much more efficiently, the coffee bar is just one example of CIG‚Äôs unnecessary spending habits. Spending tens of thousands of pounds on custom furniture and oversized props isn‚Äôt unusual, sources say, with management justifying its spending habits because it‚Äôs ‚Äúpushing the boundaries of game development.‚Äù Its Manchester office, which is still under construction on one floor, consists of custom wall paneling, doors, and even desks to make employees feel like they are living in the Star Citizen universe. One employee described the office as ‚Äúalmost like a space version of Willy Wonka‚Äôs factory‚Äù that ‚Äúcaters to taste over functionality.‚Äù</p>



<figure><figcaption><strong><em>An image of Cloud Imperium Games‚Äô Manchester Office taken by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoredGamer/comments/143pvjv/cgi_manchester_office/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/u/Dense-Art-1895</a></em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-development-issues">Development Issues</h2>



<p>‚ÄúPushing the boundaries of game development‚Äù is often a phrase used by management, said sources, who use it repeatedly to explain CIG‚Äôs unorthodox game development processes. This includes rationalizing almost all processes of the development pipeline, including creative to its teaching processes on how to work on CIGs Star Engine, a heavily modified version of CryEngine that has been the cause of years of delays and pushbacks. Staff describes the engine as Frankenstein, a mishmash of parts that is difficult to work with at the best of times, never mind when features are added, changed, or removed daily.</p>



<p>Both current and former staff say that one of the fundamental issues at CIG is the creative process, which will see the head honcho of CIG, Chris Roberts, make game-defining changes daily that can cause weeks of issues. Roberts is relatively well-known in and out of the Star Citizen community for being a perfectionist at the best times. Still, developers feel that his constant changes in vision and scope have become one of the most significant burdens to Star Citizen, Squadron 42, and CIG as a development studio. </p>



<p>Staff say that this isn‚Äôt just on the prominent game features either, but down to the minutest of details. They said that decisions that should take a matter of seconds creatively can sometimes take hours, or even days, due to his micromanagement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve genuinely been sat in meetings that got derailed for 30 minutes so that the placement of objects that players are likely never to interact with could be discussed in detail,‚Äù said one former employee, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs just no actual focus on getting the game done,‚Äù they continued. </p>



<p>‚ÄúSometimes the most basic features can be reviewed by him [Roberts] half a dozen times, for it then to be scrapped or changed on the 7th review,‚Äù said another employee. The constant changes in scope are made worse by inappropriate deadlines, many of the employees said, which will see months‚Äô worth of work expected in weeks or even days, which still ultimately runs the risk of being scrapped. </p>



<h2 id="h-cult-like-culture">Cult-Like Culture</h2>



<p>The constant creative changes, micromanagement, poorly optimized engine, and lack of standard development processes have led many experienced developers to leave CIG in recent years, with some of those I spoke to preferring a more traditional form of gaming development. CIG‚Äôs change in experienced staff has undoubtedly had a knock-on effect on its culture, with sources saying that the studio now has one of the strongest cult-like mentalities in the entire industry. </p>



<p>It‚Äôs the result of CIG‚Äôs own doing, which will see experienced staff replaced by younger and cheaper developers, who‚Äôll find it difficult to learn from more experienced staff because there aren‚Äôt any. One source went on to say that they are aware of some people who were hired simply because they were fans of the game.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs created an unhealthy place to work; you can‚Äôt push back on anything,‚Äù said one current developer. ‚ÄúThey are repeating mistakes that other companies made 20 years ago, which contributes to the shortcomings of their ambitious features,‚Äù said a former developer.</p>



<p>Most experienced staff will leave for one reason or another within a year, which has created a studio where a large portion of its staff will have Star Citizen as their first shipped game.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-future">The Future</h2>



<p>It remains to be seen how CIG will continue developing its games as its funds seemingly dwindle, but the studio is actively seeking additional funding and ideas to prolong development. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft was given a brief presentation for Squadron 42, CIG‚Äôs spin-off campaign of Star Citizen that consists of around 20 different chapters (levels) of various lengths. It‚Äôs understood that the plan for Squadron 42 is to get it out of the door as soon as possible, with directors of the company hoping the influx in cash will sustain Star Citizen‚Äôs development and help to push Squadron 42 as a multi-game series, which will see the game‚Äôs story span over several different episodes. As for when Squadron 42 will launch, I wouldn‚Äôt want to guess, but it‚Äôs understood that the game has only just made it to its ‚Äúfeature complete‚Äù stage, despite the claims last year.</p>



<div><p>Other ideas to fund Star Citizen, including more ships at higher prices, will not surprise those familiar with the game‚Äôs development. However, one potential oddball is a third game in development themed around a medieval fantasy. Sources said that the details of the project are slim, but it is a means for CIG to release more than just one style of game, they said. Nevertheless, whether or not the backers of Star Citizen want their money to fund a fantasy game is a question for another time, as is how long the game will take to develop.</p><p>Cloud Imperium Games is set to hold its annual Citizencon on October 19th-20th, 2024, with fans planned to see a demo of Squadron 42‚Äôs Chapter 1, which was internally said to ‚Äúget our community on board with the fact they are getting very close to Squadron‚Äôs full release.‚Äù </p></div>



<p>Of course, fans should also expect to see a lot more of Star Citizen. But as the past 12 years have shown us all, nothing is set in stone.</p>

		<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii may just be the game in the long running series that really, really leans into the craziness that is Goro Majima. We have seen it plenty of times throughout the Yakuza/ Like A Dragon games, and yet making him a pirate fits Majima perfectly. What does a pirate need though? Well, a ship armed with cannons to battle other ships and a crew to board those ships, which is exactly what is shown in the latest trailer for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii | Naval Combat Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4nQLCCQnq8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The naval combat trailer for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, shows ship to ship combat out in the open sea and in a large coliseum, ship boarding with combat, and the ship customisation menu. It also gives us a look at the pirate haven Madlantis, ruled over by Queen Michele. Her and her top team run the Pirate Coliseum which hosts the Tournament of Captains, as well as other events including Quick Skirmish, Madlantis Mania, and Swashbuckler Showdown. The story itself sees Goro Majima washes up on a remote island with no memories at all, not even his name. He embarks on a new adventure with teenage islander Noah to regain those memories and get ahead in this topsy-turvy world.</p>
<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has also confirmed a new release date for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, with the game now set to be released on February 21st, 2025, bringing the release date forward by a week from the original date. It will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Subnautica 2 Early Access Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>The sequel takes players to a new ocean filled with "vibrant biomes, strange creatures, and hidden secrets." The game supports solo and co-op, and also features crafting and base-building as players attempt to stay alive in the spooky ocean depths.</p><p>In terms of multiplayer, up to four people can play together and collaborate to craft tools and build bases. They can also go into battle together against monsters from the deep.</p><p>Unknown Worlds said Subnautica 2 launching in early access will allow the studio to collect feedback to hopefully help the final product be the best it can be. This is a full-on sequel, but Unknown Worlds did release a standalone spin-off game called Subnautica: Below Zero in 2021.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/subnautica-review-a-water-wonderland/1900-6416847/" data-ref-id="1900-6416847">review of the original Subnautica</a> scored the game a 9/10. Review Brett Todd wrote, "There is no better virtual way to experience the beauty, and the terror, of the deep blue sea."</p><p>If you missed the Xbox Partner Preview, check out the gallery below to get up to speed with all the big announcements and reveals.</p>

            <p>
Alan Wake developers Remedy have announced their very first multiplayer game, a three-person co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> set in the world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control">Control</a> and thereby, the Remedy Connected Universe. Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also <em>instantly</em> rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

As detailed by <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/">an Xbox Wire post</a>, Firebreak casts you as a first responder working for the Federal Bureau of Control - that is, a crack paranormal exterminator who must stop extra-dimensional terrors invading the FBC's shape-shifting Brutalist headquarters, the Oldest House. Firebreak members can equip Overwatch-style "ultimates" in the shape of Altered World objects that have "paranatural" properties.</p><p>These are to be used more carefully than the average video game ultimate, according to Remedy comms boss Thomas Puha. "I like to think of them as a jaguar in a box," he told the Wire. "You carry the box, you point it at something, you open the box, and you just kind of hope the jaguar doesn't turn around and eat you or your friends instead."
</p>
<p>Schr√∂dinger's Jaguar, then? Yes, this is commendably Control-esque.</p>
<p>
Firebreak will evolve over time with post-release content, but Puha is reluctant to call it a game-as-a-service, with all the associated baggage. "FBC: Firebreak should be easy to get into and quickly understandable, not feel like a second job or that you have to spend an hour setting up your loadouts etc. before you get into a session," he told the site. "This is not that game. It's a pick-up-and-play experience [about] having fun with your friends when you have the time. That's not to say that FBC: Firebreak doesn't have deep player progression and things to unlock, it does, but this isn't about logging in every day for some loot or fear of missing out on materials."</p>
<p>Firebreak does have some kind of narrative component - it's set after the events of Control, and as such, presumably harkens forward to the events of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>. It'll try for a similar balance of absurdity and horror in its writing and atmosphere. But it's not the same kind of story-driven game. 
</p><p>
"For the people who are keeping up with the single-player journey, we wanted to make sure that FBC: Firebreak was a legitimate and impactful part of that history and lore," game director Mike Kayatta comments in the Xbox Wire piece. "The narrative style you've seen in our previous games just wasn't ever going to work here, for this kind of game. When you think about these differences in FBC: Firebreak's gameplay - world over story, multiplayer over single-player, voice-chatting with your teammates, action over exploration and so on - you can probably see why it was important that we made FBC: Firebreak a stand-alone experience."
</p>
<p>
"That said, you will see more of Control's world," he went on. "More of the Federal Bureau of Control. Meet more of the people who work there. Explore more of the Oldest House. Run into more weird stuff. And importantly, experience this world, old and new, from a completely different perspective."</p>
<p>What do you make of it all? Much as I dread anything halfway live-servicey these days, I've always felt the Oldest House would be a natural setting for such a game - it's a monstrous labyrinth that slops between realities in a way germane to the introduction of new foes, stories and areas. Just, please don't ruin it by turning it into a content factory.
