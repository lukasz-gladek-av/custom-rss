		<p>Microsoft has reportedly decided that, yes, Call of Duty 2024 will launch day and date into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>This is apparently something that Microsoft’s executives have been debating for some time – per <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">The Verge</a> – but The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that they’ve made up their mind and will bring the next Call of Duty game straight into Game Pass when it launches later this year.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-and-a-redacted-direct-confirmed-for-june-9th/">The next Call of Duty is set to be revealed at Xbox Games Showcase on 9th June</a>, and is likely to be the game featured in the [Redacted] deep-dive stream that follows.</p>
<p>The hope is that this will be a major boost to Xbox Game Pass subscriber counts, across both Xbox and PC, and since COD will not be a platform exclusive for a long, long time, should preserve a lot of the overall profitability of the franchise with the majority of gamers still happy to buy the games outright on PlayStation in particular. A large portion of the money that Call of Duty makes also comes from the free-to-play Warzone game mode.</p>
<p>That reason means that some analysts, such as games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad, are all for it. He <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1791470465753518402">wrote</a>, “This is the right move for Microsoft because it’s a multi-platform title that is being sold for $70 outside of the subscription and because it’s a live service title with in game purchases. That model can also work for other Xbox first party games.”</p>

<p>However, this could still be a double-edged sword for Game Pass. It likely will boost subscriber counts, but how sticky will that be to keep people subscribed? Xbox and PC gamers might see this as an opportunity to pay for a trial or single month to get a quick fix of Call of Duty, before unsubscribing a month later, ultimately cutting a big chunk of the profit from all of those gamers, and potentially undermining the Xbox Game Pass project and business model in general. Worse would be if it fails to meaningfully move the needle, with the growth of subscriber counts having levelled off in the last couple years. One possible mitigation would be to have a higher priced tier specially for COD.</p>
<p>Of course, this should all be taken with a grain of salt. We can expect WSJ to have trustworthy sources, but we’re also a few weeks away from the 9th June showcase and Microsoft could very easily change their minds again between now and then.</p>
<p>The pressure is on the Xbox division and Microsoft’s gaming business to grow and be as profitable as possible, thanks to the almost $70 billion that Microsoft paid to acquire Activision Blizzard. Since that purchase was completed, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">Microsoft made major redundancies</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">announced that they were bringing select Xbox exclusives to rival platforms</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">closed two beloved Bethesda studios</a>, and is reportedly planning for more games to arrive on PS5, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/report-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5-as-part-of-the-latitude-project/">nothing held back</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass-is-a-done-deal-according-to-the-wall-street-journal.874107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Is <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty</a> coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>? When Microsoft first began pursuing it’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, many assumed using Call of Duty to bolster Game Pass was one of their goals, but things have changed since then. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-ps-plus-gaming-subscriptions-up-only-1-percent-year-on-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass growth has slowed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-falls-fall-short-of-microsoft-growth-targets-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">badly missing growth targets</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-unlikely-more-than-10-to-15-percent-of-microsoft-gaming-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox boss Phil Spencer has admitted there’s a ceiling to its success</a>. While some Activision Blizzard games like Diablo IV have been added to Game Pass, recent reports suggested that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-still-evaluating-whether-to-put-cod-on-game-pass-and-a-game-pass-price-increase-hellblade-ii-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft was still “evaluating”</a> whether to do the same with the headliner that is Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Well, it seems the big decision may have been made. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal</a>, Microsoft will indeed be bringing 2024’s entry in the Call of Duty franchise to Game Pass. This should be announced next month at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Of course, Microsoft has not confirmed this, so take it with a grain of salt for now, but the Wall Street Journal isn’t in the business of spreading baseless rumors.</p>
<p>Needless to say, putting Call of Duty on Game Pass is a major risk for Microsoft. As we recently heard from former 343 Industries PR head Brad Hilderbrand, releasing titles on Game Pass on Day 1 <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-miss-sales-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causes them to “badly miss” sales targets</a>. Now, to some degree, the damage might be contained if Game Pass was only on Xbox, but this also has the potential to hurt PC sales. It should also be mentioned, that during the lengthy Acti-Blizz acquisition process, Phil Spencer hinted <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-ps-plus-playstation-7-spencer-no-forever-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he’d be up for CoD on PlayStation Plus, too</a>. All that said, if Microsoft is still committed to Game Pass as an idea, maybe it’s time to throw that ultimate Hail Mary. It’s going to be hard to stuff this genie back in the bottle if it doesn’t work out though.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t been keeping up with the series, this year’s Call of Duty is being developed by Treyarch and is expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuation of the Black Ops franchise set during the Gulf War</a>. In other words, this ought to be a pretty big entry in the series, and a heck of a way to potentially launch the “CoD on Game Pass” era.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase where the next Call of Duty will be revealed takes place on June 9. What do you think? Is bringing Call of Duty to Game Pass a good move or is Microsoft strangling the golden goose? If it happens, will you still pay for CoD or go the Game Pass route?</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-your-first-look-at-ea-sports-college-football-25-gameplay.874104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Commki">With the release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a> just two months away, we’ve now got our first glimpse of what the game looks like in action, courtesy of a proper trailer that publisher Electronic Arts released Friday morning.</p>
<p id="1DtOwo">Transitioning from Guns N’ Roses’ original recording of “Welcome to the Jungle” — a quintessential hype-up-the-fans song — into a marching band version is a very nice touch in this trailer. And it plays over footage of storied college football traditions from all over the country: unique team entrances (with, for the first time, real names on the backs of jerseys), mascots getting everyone into a frenzy, and crowds singing fight songs. It’s clear that developer EA Tiburon has gone to great lengths to bring the game-day atmosphere of college football to life in <em>College Football 25</em>.</p>
<p id="hrpALY">EA also revealed the first details about <em>College Football 25</em>’s modes and gameplay, confirming the return of the fan-favorite franchise and career modes — Dynasty and Road to Glory, respectively — as well as a new competitive offering called Road to the College Football Playoff. In that mode, players can choose a school and work toward winning a national championship by progressing through divisions and earning rank. In a way, its existence can be seen as a nod to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074774/ea-sports-college-football-25-teaser-trailer">11-year gap between EA’s college football games</a>: The College Football Playoff wasn’t a thing when EA released <em>NCAA Football 14</em> back in 2013. And, yes, EA’s microtransaction-based fantasy team setup, Ultimate Team, figures to be a major part of the game, especially now that EA can use players’ real names.</p>

<p id="2A4qm4">College football doesn’t look the same on the field as the NFL, and EA Tiburon is touting some new gameplay features this year to differentiate the action not just in general, but on a team-by-team basis, with a gamified version of home-field advantage. If you’re taking Ohio State into the Big House for a showdown with the Wolverines, expect “distractions like screen shaking, missing pre-play icons, and moving play art,” according to EA. The developers are also introducing a wear-and-tear system that will force you to manage fatigue and make the right substitutions at the right times to prevent players from becoming tired (and making mistakes).</p>
<p id="mMrwGc">Off the field, EA is bringing back a bunch of veterans from ESPN’s college football broadcasts for audio commentary in <em>College Football 25</em>. Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit will call “marquee matchups,” said EA, while Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, and David Pollack will handle all other games.</p>
<p id="wZPSh3"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> will be released July 19 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. While EA is also pairing it with <em>Madden NFL 25</em> (which is scheduled for an Aug. 16 debut) in a package called the MVP Bundle, there’s no word yet on whether there will be any cross-game functionality between the two.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/early-look-at-valve%E2%80%99s-new-hero-shooter-deadlock-leaks.874101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158960/valve-deadlock-hero-shooter-leak<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="qSDUJK">A new multiplayer hero shooter reportedly in development at Valve leaked Thursday in the form of gameplay details and early screenshots of the project, known as <em>Deadlock</em>. The new game is described as a blend of Valve’s own <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/15/16151674/dota-2-review"><em>Dota 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23178358/valve-team-fortress-2-update-bots-fan-campaign"><em>Team Fortress 2</em></a>, as well as competing multiplayer games like <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Smite</em>, and <em>Orcs Must Die</em>.</p>
<p id="5Aqqy7">Longtime Valve researcher and dataminer <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285">Tyler McVicker published the in-game screenshots on X</a>, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. McVicker said the images were shared by <em>Deadlock</em> playtesters, and show <em>Dota 2</em>-style heroes battling on “steampunk European city” maps. One of those maps has fast-travel lanes; players can ride quickly across the maps using “floating rails, similar to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/25/4064448/bioshock-infinite-review-above-and-below"><em>BioShock Infinite</em></a>,” McVicker said.</p>
<p id="VyYzLu"><a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557">McVicker said that <em>Deadlock</em> is Valve’s next game</a>, and that it was in development under previous names <em>Neon Prime</em> and <em>Citadel</em>. He describes it as a competitive, third-person, hero-based shooter, with two teams of six heroes — a mix of “magicians, weird creatures, and robots” — battling each other. <em>Deadlock</em> also reportedly features tower defense game mechanics.</p>
<div id="zxtgvt">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="id__nk6rhc27g6">Screenshots of <em>Deadlock</em> hint at MOBA-inspired elements like bases and guardians that heroes would attack, and collectible orbs that may offer power-ups to abilities. All of that is, of course, subject to change, as <em>Deadlock</em> has not been officially announced.</p>
<p id="CKBotb">McVicker reported that <em>Deadlock</em> was initially styled as a sci-fi game “inspired by Half-Life and Portal,” but feedback to the game’s aesthetic pushed Valve to “focus on fantasy.” He also published artwork and a character description of a hero from the game, also apparently named Deadlock. Valve has reportedly been working on <em>Deadlock</em> since 2018.</p>
<p id="at7MuA">Polygon has reached out to Valve to confirm details on <em>Deadlock</em> and will update when the company responds.</p>

<p id="0WUYOT">Valve boss and co-founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210125102049/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/realistic-possibility-48m-e-sports-tournament-could-held-in-nz-says-gaming-tycoon-gabe-newell">Gabe Newell said in 2021</a> that his company has multiple games in development. Last September, Valve shipped one of those games, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23889113/counter-strike-2-release-date-steam-cs2-launch"><em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>, a replacement for its extremely popular first-person shooter, <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, originally released in 2012. Newell also intimated in 2021 that there was “a lot of momentum inside of the company” to develop more single-player games in the wake of shipping <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/23/21188169/half-life-alyx-review-rift-half-life-3-valve-index-vive-virtual-reality"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a> in 2020.</p>
<p id="Y2ZHlb">For now, though, it appears that Valve’s interests lie in multiplayer and blending the gameplay of its most popular team-based games.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24158948/endless-legend-strategy-game-free-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/endless-legend-a-great-2014-strategy-game-is-free-on-steam-for-one-week.874098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158948/endless-legend-strategy-game-free-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="m2dx6N">It’s time to do a bit of casual Friday colonizing (virtually). <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/8/27/4664212/endless-space-dev-expanding-with-fantasy-sequel-and-roguelike-side">Amplitude Studios</a>, the Parisian game studio known for strategy games, is giving away its acclaimed game <em>Endless Legend </em>for free on Steam. Starting on Thursday and running until May 23, interested players can download the entire game for free on Steam. </p>
<p id="fpiTuZ">The deal is an absolute steal. Usually, the game costs  $29.99 at full price. Now all you have to do is go to the Steam page to get it for free. Just proceed as if you were buying any other game on the platform. The Steam version is available to play on Windows PC and Mac OS. </p>
<p id="CPvCnm"><em>Endless Legend</em> is a top-down 4X game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) in which players defeat opponents by harvesting resources and building military units and additional support buildings. The game is complicated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/22/5924649/endless-legend-steam-preview">and a bit imbalanced</a> — and intentionally so. The developers created the game so that each play-through would have variation. Each race’s basic unit has several stats and special powers that makes them unique, so that players wouldn’t face units with identical stats to their own. </p>
<p id="G9uFO8">Amplitude Studios originally published the game to Steam in 2014. At the time, <em>Endless Legend</em> helped bring a new layer of complexity to the turn-based strategy genre. So if you want to have a try at long-beloved strategy game, now is your chance.</p>

<p>Back at the end of the run of EA Sports NCAA Football, one of the fan favorite features was Team Builder. It was a website that allowed players to create their own schools for use in the game’s Dynasty mode. With EA Sports College Football 25, Team Builder is officially back.</p>



<p>Announced as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-features-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s full reveal on Friday,</a> Team Builder will be a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/welcome-to-college-football-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of this year’s game</a>. Player’s will be able to create their own schools via the Team Builder website that will launch with the game.</p>



<p>“Design uniforms, helmets, fields, and upload your own logo,” EA Sports said. “You can then upload your program to use in Play Now and Dynasty.”</p>



<p>Players will also be able to download schools from other people for use in their game. One thing to note is that Team Builder teams will only be available in “private Dynasty” modes. There is no confirmation as off publishing if that means Online Dynasty can have them as long as they are private to join.</p>

<p>Where were you when Grand Theft Auto V hit store shelves? The initial launch in 2013 was one of the most hype video game releases of the time. It brought out the masses at GameStop for a midnight release, which was still a thing then. Here we are, waiting for the next title, but more than a decade later. So, how long has GTA 6 been in development?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-did-gta-6-development-begin">When Did GTA 6 Development Begin?</h2>



<p>A few years ago, it was revealed that <strong>GTA 6 development started in 2014, just one year after the launch of GTA V and GTA Online</strong>. Unlike past titles, however, Rockstar Games intends to tread carefully with its upcoming Grand Theft Auto storyline. It wants to avoid trampling on marginalized groups through the series’ long-standing trend of occasionally harsh jokes.</p>



<p>We’ll likely see some significant overhaul to Grand Theft Auto Online with Grand Theft Auto VI, though nothing has yet been confirmed about the multiplayer component. Every GTA since Grand Theft Auto IV has featured some form of multiplayer, from small lobbies in Liberty City to the massive scale of GTA Online over the past decade. Hey, maybe they’ll go full MMO?!</p>







<h2 id="h-who-are-the-main-characters-in-gta-6">Who Are the Main Characters in GTA 6?</h2>



<p>We know the game features two main characters: <strong>Lucia </strong>and <strong>Jason</strong>. We’ve seen more of Lucia, a Latina criminal who will take the leading role in the upcoming Grand Theft Auto game. Jason, on the other hand, appears less often in marketing materials. He’ll likely provide the old-school GTA experience that so many players are accustomed to.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there’s no indication that we’ll see Michael de Santa, Franklin, or Trevor in Grand Theft Auto 6, unfortunately. None of the three previous protagonists were shown off in the trailer, though it’s not out of the realm of possibility. I can see Michael or Franklin appearing in Leonida to lay low from the heat in San Andreas.</p>



<hr>



<p>We have a long way to go until the GTA 6 release date, so why not join Insider Gaming as we cover the hottest new and upcoming releases:</p>

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 is set to release on July 19 for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, and EA Sports took Friday to announce all of the game’s features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-and-cover-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after revealing its cover</a> on Thursday.</p>



<p>As previously known, the game will include modes you expect like Dynasty, Road to Glory, Ultimate Team, and a Road to the College Football Playoff. But now we have more details on what each mode will offer players when they load up the first college football game in 11 years.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="College Football 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1QDaXkufCo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Dynasty Mode will see you “create a coach and build a powerhouse college football program from the ground up. Establish your coaching staff, recruit the best talent, utilize the transfer portal, and watch your program ascend to the sport’s pantheon.”</p>



<p>Moving on to Road to Glory, players will “live the life of a student-athlete”. With a created players, you’ll have to manage your schedule, GPA, and overall image as you work to become a Heisman Trophy winner. You’ll work to built coach trust to get extra playing time or even transfer if you aren’t getting the time you feel you deserve.</p>



<p>Ultimate Team is exactly what you’d expect from an EA Sports title. Collect players to build the best team you can and play with it either online or offline, completing challenges to earn rewards. </p>



<p>Lastly, the Road to the College Football Playoff lets you “experience a new way to play competitively and represent your favorite team in the Road to the College Football Playoff.”  You’ll take your team against tougher opponents in order to move up the poll and make it to the playoff.</p>







<p>As part of College Football 25, EA Sports is bringing in “iconic atmospheres” that fans have seen for years across the sport. </p>



<p>“With traditional team run-outs, rivalry rituals, synchronized crowd-chants, loudness meters as well as real game-day audio, fight songs and, of course, mascots, it’ll feel like home everywhere you look,” EA Sports says.</p>



<p>Presentation wise, Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit call the action of the biggest games. Rece Davis, David Pollack, and Jesse Palmer will be the team for other games.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-campusiq-gameplay">The CampusIQ Gameplay</h2>



<p>In the game EA Sports introduces its CampusIQ gameplay system. This system, the company says, will offer “true college gameplay” no matter the teams on the field.</p>



<p>“Powered by a wide range of player ratings that fluctuate throughout a game, team tiers, and new in-game passing mechanics, EA SPORTS™ College Football 25 delivers strategic, fast-paced gameplay reflecting the true depth of college football,” they said.</p>



<p>The game also features a “wear &amp; tear system” that has you managing a player’s health and doing what you can to limit potential injuries and fatigue. There’s also a homefield advantage system that will have players facing “various levels of distractions like screen shaking, missing pre-play icons, and moving play art.”</p>



<p>College Football 25 is <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/buy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available to pre-order</a> today.</p>

Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by the publication.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>The report tallies with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exec-suggests-call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-straight-into-game-pass">recent comments from Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, who indicated all Microsoft’s games, including those developed by the recently acquired Activision, will launch straight into Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft has faced tough questions around the potential cannibalization effect of Game Pass, particularly on games that launch on the service day-one. While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass">an interview with IGN</a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed. "Well, there's a different person making the decisions," Spencer laughed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Well, there's a different person making the decisions.</p></div><p>New Call of Duty games sell for $70 and usually shift around 25 million copies per year, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. By releasing this year’s Call of Duty straight into Game Pass, Microsoft potentially risks cannibalizing those sales.</p><p>Of course, Activision will also launch Call of Duty across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC as a game that can be bought outright. But with Game Pass subscriber numbers failing to grow meaningfully Microsoft is under pressure to attract new customers, and adding a mainline Call of Duty game at launch will no doubt help with that.</p><p>This year’s Call of Duty <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pretty-much-confirmed-after-treyarch-acknowledges-sally-pistols-discovery-in-warzone">is expected to be called Black Ops 6</a>, after teasers discovered in Warzone were acknowledged by developer Treyarch. Microsoft is also rumored to be ready to release the Call of Duty back catalog of video games into Game Pass ahead of Black Ops 6's release later this year.</p><p>Microsoft is in the process of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">cutting 1,900 staff from its gaming business</a>. Earlier this month, the company shocked the video game world by announcing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the closure of Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-asian-protagonist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ubisoft has finally announced its long-awaited <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Assassin’s Creed game set in feudal Japan</a>. Subtitled Shadows, it follows dual protagonists – a ninja named Naoe and a samurai based on the historical <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">Black samurai Yasuke</a>.</p><p>While it’s a known issue that Asian representation in Western games is severely lacking, I find it hypocritical and laughable that we’re only talking about the need for an Asian protagonist now that it’s been revealed Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will star a Black samurai</a>. This misses the forest for the trees. While I am always advocating for more Asian men in AAA games, I’ll be the first to say that better representation <em>isn’t</em> going to be found in yet another samurai hero.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-40-details-1715771281424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You can't pretend to want Asian representation by asking for another samurai. Credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Enough With the Samurais</strong></h2><p>Ubisoft deciding to focus on Yasuke — <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a known historical figure</a> — is a smart move. An Assassin’s Creed game set in Japan that otherwise would have been, frankly, hard to distinguish from some other recent open-world samurai games. And if I wanted to see an Asian samurai protagonist I don’t have to look very hard.</p><p>Asian samurai protagonists are a path already well-trodden. There’s Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Katana Zero, Like A Dragon: Ishin!, Samurai Warriors, Rise of the Ronin, Onimusha, Way of the Samurai, Way of the Samurai 2, Ghost of Tsushima… There’s also my personal favorite, Muramasa: The Demon Blade. I can go on and on. So it’s difficult to come to any other conclusion than that the limited imagination of AAA game development can only envision Asian heroes when they wield katanas or ninja stars.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I wanted to see an Asian samurai protagonist I don’t have to look very hard.</p></div><p>Worse still, the complex characters that were so wonderfully brought to life in shows like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shogun-review-fx-hulu">Shogun</a> are often distilled into their simplest forms in games, especially those created by Western studios. While Japanese developer-led titles like Sekiro and Like a Dragon: Ishin utilize their samurai protagonists to tell nuanced stories about overcoming fantastical challenges, or provide a glimpse of street-level heroics in Edo Japan, the Western-developed games fail to hit a similar level of complexity, often falling back on tired tropes of honor and stoicism. </p><p>And that’s only accounting for games that try to tell a story using their samurai protagonist. More often than not the samurai archetype is a vehicle for combat first, eschewing any kind of narrative flavor for a cool sword and top-knot. Consider hero games like Overwatch that feature two kinds of samurai, and a ninja, for their Japanese cast. And all flowers to Ghost of Tsushima for its beautifully rendered open world and combat, but Jin Sakai has about as much charisma as a wet piece of cloth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/06/ghostthumb-1709741324538.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Second verse. Same as the first. Credit: Sucker Punch.</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Wow, Cool Sword</strong></h2><p>The main grievance I have as an Asian American in games in regards to representation isn’t the lack of it — as evidenced by the Wikipedia page full of Asian fighters and ninjas and samurais — but rather is the lack of <em>diversity</em> therein. I’ve reported previously in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asian-american-game-developers-experience-minari">story about Asian American game devs</a> and representation, we are not a monolith and I, a Korean-American, don’t gain a sense of representation by seeing a Japanese samurai, or a Japanese ninja, or a kung-fu master or ancient gray-haired mystic for that matter.</p><p>Of course, all of this comes with the caveat that it is the nature of AAA game development to focus on “cool” characters with wide appeal. Samurais and ninjas <em>are </em>cool, and their tools and weapons lend themselves to big action blockbusters, so is it surprising that such characters become the default? Maybe not, but after so many games it’s still disappointing to see how little chances these stories take with these characters. </p><p>Given the Assassin’s Creed franchise’s history-jumping concept, we could have our cake and eat it too with a little effort. Why settle for another samurai hero when the franchise could easily go to the Mongol Empire, or post-revolution China? Or even the Pacific Theater in World War II, which was a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/39408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hotbed of counter-imperial espionage led by Asians?</a></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t want to see us have the roles we’re expected to have. I want the roles we’ve not had before.</p></div><p>This problem of only defaulting to a katana-wielding Asian protagonist isn’t exclusive to Western studios as both Capcom and Square Enix often choose to rely on Asian heroes only when they need a samurai or ninja. But even then, Japan and other Asian studios are still more forward thinking than their Western counterparts on who can be the face of their games. </p><p>It’s ironic, but Tango Gameworks is responsible for what I think has been the best Asian protagonist in games in the often overlooked Ghostwire: Tokyo. It’s a game set in modern-day Tokyo with a 21st century Asian protagonist whose responsibilities lay with his dying sister. There isn’t a feudal lord and, honestly, it’s everything I could’ve asked for from a AAA game project with an Asian lead. Not to mention the work Sega and Atlus have done with games like Yakuza, Persona, and Shin Megami Tensei who portray modern characters in unique settings.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ghostwire-tokyo-header-scaled-1715919770631.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>More of this. Credit: Tango Gameworks, Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>We Mustn’t Be Afraid to Dream a Little Bigger</strong></h2><p>I find comments saying that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a missed opportunity to represent even more Asian protagonists embarrassing. As an Asian man, I don’t want to see us have the roles we’re expected to have. I want the roles we’ve not had before. I would love for the next Alan Wake-style horror game to have an Asian protagonist, or for Star Wars to follow in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-acolyte-showrunner-on-how-squid-game-solved-one-of-her-key-casting-challenges">The Acolyte and have an Asian lead</a>.</p><p>When I push for greater diversity in games it’s not so that the next AAA samurai game will star an Asian protagonist, it’s so that the next Naughty Dog game, or the next Hideo Kojima game, or hell, even a Final Fantasy game, could imagine an Asian hero. </p><p><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

            <p><em>This Week in Business is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/topics/this-week-in-business">our weekly recap column</a>, a collection of stats and quotes from recent stories presented with a dash of opinion (sometimes more than a dash) and intended to shed light on various trends. Check every Friday for a new entry.</em></p>
<p>
This week, we reported on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-government-responds-to-stop-killing-games-campaign">the UK government's response to a petition</a> from <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a>, a grassroots campaign organized by YouTuber Ross Scott that's trying to get publishers to, well, stop killing games.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the campaign wants to make sure that games like The Crew, which Ubisoft effectively snuffed from existence when it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-pulls-over-the-crew">shut down the online servers in March</a>, are preserved not just for the customers who paid money for them but for future generations as well.
</p>
<p>
And while nobody's asking companies to continue supporting online games forever at their own expense, Stop Killing Games would like to see publishers required to do more than they are currently. Or at the very least, force them to clearly commit to supporting a game through a specific date when they sell it, and include that expiration date on the packaging and other marketing materials. (This was the same course of action we advocated for when we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-gives-gran-turismo-sport-the-boot-this-week-in-business">addressed the topic in this space in January</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The UK petition – which is <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/659071/">still available to be signed</a> – is focused less on the expiration date and more on publishers basically not being jerks about it when they drop support for a game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Require publishers to leave videogames (and related game assets / features) they have sold to customers in a reasonably working state when support ends, so that no further intervention whatsoever is necessary for the game to function, as a statutory consumer right." – What the Stop Killing Games petition asks for.
</p>
<p>
The government has already responded, and its response is not terribly encouraging. It starts off by saying there's no law saying companies have to support older versions of software, and adds that running servers for old games with declining user bases can be expensive. It then notes that publishers still need to follow existing consumer rights laws.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The [2008 Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations] require information to consumers to be clear and correct, and prohibit commercial practices which through false information or misleading omissions cause the average consumer to make a different choice, for example, to purchase goods or services they would not otherwise have purchased." – The UK government explains what publishers need to be mindful of when it comes to server shutdowns.
</p>
<p>
That reads to me like the government believes current industry practices are fine, and as long as a game has a note about an "internet connection required" or something on the package – as The Crew did – that's probably good enough.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind I'm not a lawyer and don't live in the UK. And while I have worked with a number of UK citizens over the years, when I send them several thousand words about innovations in grocery store refrigerators for proofreading and they reply back that it was "interesting," I still take it as a compliment. I should probably not be trusted to understand the English language when it's being used by the actual English.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>I like in scary movies when early on they disturb your sense of normalcy with a blurry and fleeting glimpse of the horrors to come.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Even so, there's another bit in the government response to reinforce my interpretation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "If consumers are led to believe that a game will remain playable indefinitely for certain systems, despite the end of physical support, the CPRs may require that the game remains technically feasible (for example, available offline) to play under those circumstances."
</p>
<blockquote>Publishers benefit tremendously from the erosion of ownership and ongoing support we've seen in the industry for decades now.</blockquote>
<p>
So long as publishers don't foster an expectation that the game will be playable forever before pulling the plug, there's no problem. That's a pretty low bar for them to clear, and it means the publishers benefit tremendously from the erosion of ownership and ongoing support we've seen in the industry for decades now. 
</p>
<p>
If someone sold an Atari 2600 game in the early 1980s and every cartridge sold was designed to become unplayable six months after purchase, you can bet consumer rights laws would have applied there because players would have assumed they would have permanent access because that was basically the only way people understood games existing at the time. The customer would have been led to believe in the game's continued playability the same way they were led to believe in object permanence as a baby.
</p>
<p>
But games have routinely seen servers for multiplayer modes go dark for years now, and they've been joined by plenty of free-to-play mobile games and MMOs being shut down entirety.
</p>
<p>
Publishers like Ubisoft have taken advantage of that by producing games that should belong in the former category – a game that loses its multiplayer functionality when the servers get shut down – and move them to the latter category – a game that does not exist without servers. </p>
<p>After all, the limited resource publishers are fighting over in a games-as-a-service world is players' time, so it's not in a company's interest to let customers spend their time playing an older game that does not provide a continuous stream of money, especially when it would rather those old players pony up again for newer games built around current best practices for maximized monetization.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The Crew Motorfest continues to outperform The Crew 2 on acquisition, activity, monetization and net bookings metrics on a comparable basis since launch thanks to its quality seasonal, monthly and weekly activities. The franchise quadrupled its net bookings year-on-year, leading to record net bookings." – In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023">its earnings report this week</a>, Ubisoft this week touted the tremendous performance of the recently released The Crew Motorfest during the same quarter it shut down the servers for The Crew.
</p>
<p>
I will concede that The Crew sunsetting is pretty far down on the list of reasons Motorfest is doing well. But it doesn't really matter where on that list it is, because as we established the last time we talked about this, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-gives-gran-turismo-sport-the-boot-this-week-in-business#:~:text=QUOTE%20%7C%20%22My%20first,than%20a%20requirement.">the game runs locally off the disc just fine</a>. Ubisoft placed an unnecessary limitation on a product that consumers bought. It is financially incentivized to place this kind of limitations on all of its games going forward, and is doing so with Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows, two single-player games whose <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-physical-version-of-assassins-creed-shadows-requires-an-online-connection-to-install/">physical copies will require online connections in order to install them</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>If publishers were pursuing a future driven by planned obsolescence, would their behavior right now be any different?</blockquote>
<p>
Let's assume the worst for now and say that evil, greedy publishers are trying to push the gaming business into one of purely planned obsolescence, where customers have to constantly fork over more money to them or be denied the ability to enjoy their purchases. If that were the end goal, would their behavior right now be any different?
</p>
<p>
They have pushed and prodded the industry in this direction for years, ocassionally overstepping and drawing backlash as with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/always-online-simcity-burns-to-the-ground-10-years-ago-this-month">the always-online SimCity</a> or <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dont-like-always-online-consoles-dealwithit-10-years-ago-this-month">the Xbox One's original restrictions on used games</a>, but never waiting too long before resuming the push for ever-greater control over the gaming experience, control that coincidentally happens to restrain what players can do with games they purchase.
</p>
<p>
If the law as it stands currently allows for such a plan to effectively undermine consumer rights, maybe the law needs to be changed.
</p>
<p>
As of this writing, <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/659071/">the Stop Killing Games petition has more than 23,000 signatures</a>. If it can make it to 100,000 signatures by October 16, it will be considered for debate in Parliament. 
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games has also initiated similar petitions in <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN6080">Australia</a> (where the deadline to sign is this coming Monday) and <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/petitions/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-4965">Canada</a> (where signatures can be collected until the morning of September 5).

<h2>Letting Cooler-heads prevail</h2>
<p>
Bear with me for a minute while I talk about Cooler Screens.
</p>
<p>
If you've never seen these before, they're basically the coolers from a grocery store refrigerated or frozen food section, but with the glass door replaced by a TV monitor showing pictures of the products inside.
</p>
<p>
Why would a customer want a TV monitor instead of a glass door on its coolers? Let's ask Cooler Screens.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The <strong>consumer</strong> is our inspiration. We create an experience that <strong>engages hearts and minds</strong>. We connect with people <strong>emotionally</strong> and inform them <strong>intellectually</strong>, sparking <strong>curiosity</strong> and rewarding them in the moment." <em>[All emphasis in original]</em> – The <a href="https://www.coolerscreens.com/consumer-experience/">official Cooler Screens website</a>, getting a bit grandiose in its mission to show people what's in the cooler section, but in a slightly different way than glass doors did.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/coolerscreen4.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Pictured: A woman whose heart and mind have been engaged by a fridge door. She has connected with the fridge door emotionally <em>and</em> intellectually. She has fallen in love with the fridge door, and it loves her back. She is never leaving this Walgreens.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But surely there's more? Ah yes, here's <a href="https://www.coolerscreens.com/faqs/">the Cooler Screens FAQ</a>, which as promised contains what must be the single most frequently asked question about Cooler Screens.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "How is the Cooler Screens experience a better shopping experience for me or for others?"
</p>
<p>
Great, exactly what we're looking for. Now to read just a little bit further to find the answer…
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "Cooler Screens is a better shopping experience."
</p>
<p>
Oh, well OK then. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Cooler Screens is a better shopping experience"<cite>Cooler Screens</cite></blockquote>
<p>
In all fairness, it also says Cooler Screens "bring shopping ease, relevance, and transparency," but it's not like glass made shopping difficult or showed you irrelevant things. As for that last one, how are you going to compete on transparency with glass? It's <em>glass</em>, for cryin' out loud!
</p>
<p>
I fail to see how Cooler Screens are an improvement in any way, but that might just be a "me" problem. After all, Cooler Screens says it paid for studies that showed that 90% of consumers did not prefer the traditional glass cooler doors, from which it jumps to the conclusion of people "confirming a strong preference" instead of confirming that people don't give a flying Beef Merlot Café Steamer about what tech the door uses; they just want to see what their options are.
</p>
<p>
I'm not ruling out the idea that some people prefer Cooler Screens. We're more used to seeing screens when we eat TV dinners than when we buy them, so perhaps it just feels like a fancier shopping experience, like that one grocery store I went to as a kid that had a talking soda vending machine. For an eight-year-old kid, that thing was certifiably neato, and I was definitely asking my parents to let get me a Coke whenever we went there just to hear the computerized voice tell me how much money I had put in with each coin.
</p>
<p>
But there are very few stores that would think it's worth investing in such an expensive thing just for the neato factor and a few extra purchases from kids nagging their parents, so of course there's a different pitch for the retailers that install these. For them, Cooler Screens notes that there are cameras and sensors on the coolers, and it promises "AI-driven merchandising" and "interactive experiences" that are "guided by real-time connected data and signals from consumer interactions."
</p>
<p>
Yup, it's ads. Just ads.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@donwitmadness/video/7278465290172910894">a truly absurd amount of ads</a>. And when those ads are playing, customers of course <em>can't see what's actually inside the cooler</em>.
</p>
<p>
Once again, a start-up company has been inspired to move the world a few steps closer to a sci-fi film dystopia (Idiocracy or Minority Report, take your pick) in the name of finding yet another crevice of our lives to cram full to bursting with advertising.
</p>

<figcaption>This picture makes me want a remake of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, but instead of Narnia this dude is journeying to the fantasy land where tech start-up promises come true</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The whole thing is awful and gross, but why are we talking about it on a video game site? Well as I see it, Cooler Screens have a lot in common with the games industry of late.
</p>
<p>
Much like the generally underwhelming features publishers use to justify superfluous always-online requirements, Cooler Screens are something technologically novel that might intrigue consumers, but offer them very modest benefits in reality. However, the benefits to the companies shoehorning such requirements into games are considerably greater.</p>
<p>They gain control over the play experience that they formerly had to give up back when customers could actually own things. They gain additional insight into how people play their games, which can absolutely be used to improve the player experience, but in a games-as-a-service world that insight is more likely to applied to optimize for monetization and engagement instead of actual player enjoyment. And of course, they get to serve constantly updated ads, either for outside products or for their own add-ons and pricing promotions.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes companies don't even bother to make an argument as to how adding burdens to the player experience is ultimately beneficial, such as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-psn-log-in-requirement">Sony's ill-advised attempts to mandate PlayStation Network accounts for the PC versions of Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/oculus-devices-to-require-facebook-accounts-to-log-in">Facebook disabling Oculus headsets unless their owners created a Facebook account</a> (and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/deleting-facebook-wipes-out-oculus-purchases">deleting your Oculus purchases</a> if you ever decided to delete your Facebook account), or <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/nintendo-updates-take-wii-u-hostage-until-you-agree-new-legal-terms">Nintendo bricking their customers' Wii U systems until they agreed to a new end-user licensing agreement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Throw in the aforementioned connectivity requirements for both software and hardware and it's not hard to see how publishers have consistently pushed over the years in search of an ever-increasing amount of control over the user experience and more palatable forms of DRM. (Depending on your assessment of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/according-to-experts-on-kernel-level-anticheat-two-things-are-abundantly-clear-1-its-not-perfect-and-2-its-not-going-anywhere/">kernal-level anti-cheat systems</a>, perhaps they can be included here as another example of publisher over-reach.)
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/cooler-screen-denim.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Our friend has returned from the hidden world behind the Cooler Screen, but he has changed. He no longer smiles. His curiosity is no longer sparked. He now has but one desire, one command constantly reverberating through his mind: MORE DENIM</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Almost all of these moves offer some nominal benefit to the end user, but considerably greater benefit (and control) to the game publisher. It's much the same with blockchain, augmented reality, and other such hyped new tech that comes with flashy promises and possibly a neat tech demo, but offers few explanations for why their way of doing things is fundamentally better than what can be achieved with existing tech. A lot of the current wave of AI hype belongs in here too. These innovations can all be eye-catching, at least until the novelty wears off, but they often fall woefully short when it comes to articulating concrete, practical and compelling benefits for the end user.
</p>
<p>
And it's not just that they don't have compelling benefits; in many cases, they have significant drawbacks that companies simply don't bother accounting for.
</p>

</p>
<p>
That basic idea is the concept of graceful degradation, designing things in such a way that when various bits stop working, users can still use it for other purposes that weren't entirely reliant on those bits. In some ways, video games are pretty good at this. Most of those aforementioned dead multiplayer modes will give users a "server could not be reached" message after a certain amount of time and let them go back to enjoying the rest of the game. And entire fields like QA and speedrunning are predicated on things in software not going as the designers intended while the remaining parts truck on regardless.
</p>
<p>
In other ways, video games are terrible at this. And not just garden variety terrible, but Cooler Screens terrible.
</p>
<h2>
So what happens when a Cooler Screen breaks?
</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/coolerscreenbroke.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>One situation where Cooler Screens really will spark curiosity, albeit mostly curiosity along the lines of "What were they thinking?"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The picture above was posted a few months ago by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1am2i6j/cooler_screens_broke_so_they_hung_shitty_pictures/">Reddit user Chriscuits</a>, who explained that employees in the store printed out pictures of the coolers' contents and taped them to the broken monitors. Thankfully, you can still see enough of that PlayStation ad to know this terrible customer experience was brought to you in part by Sony. Much appreciated, Sony! 
</p>
<p>
And it should be noted that situations like the one above giving your store a real Keystone Cops vibe are among the less drastic ways these things can break.
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUOTE</strong> | "The doors' digital screens regularly froze or went dark, preventing customers from seeing what was available inside, and some even sparked and caught fire, according to the court documents." – The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/walgreens-test-of-ad-enabled-cooler-doors-ends-up-in-court-c79fecd6">Wall Street Journal</a> recaps Walgreens' complaints about Cooler Screens in an ongoing legal battle with the company over a botched rollout of the TV doors in the pharmacy chain's grocery sections.
</p>
<p>
Sure, adding monitors to cooler doors lets you show ads in novel ways, but it also adds a whole bunch of new (and potentially quite harmful ways) things can break and go wrong, and at much greater cost than the glass doors they were replacing. So when they do break – and given the technology involved, it's going to happen a heck of a lot more than with glass doors – they have a considerably worse impact on the user experience.
</p>
<blockquote>Cooler Screens are the opposite of graceful degradation, and a philosophical match to a lot of the game industry's push towards online functionality</blockquote>
<p>
I'm not even talking about setting-people-on-fire bad (although lest it go unsaid, that qualifies as <em>a very bad user experience</em>). If the measures Cooler Screens want to be judged on are shopping ease, relevance, and transparency, then a screen on the fritz makes the shopping experience harder because it's showing less relevant information (or none at all), and that borked monitor is not at all transparent.
</p>
<p>
That's the opposite of graceful degradation, and it's a philosophical match to a lot of the game industry's push towards online functionality as a means of erasing player ownership. 
</p>
<p>
The games industry is designing fragility into its products at a fundamental level, largely because it shares the same idea of transparency as Cooler Screens: Transparency isn't about letting people see what's really there, it's about showing them the version of what's really there that you're willing to let them see.

<h2>The rest of the week in review</h2>
<p>
<strong>STAT</strong> | 370% - After closing last week's trading at $17.46, GameStop shares were trading at almost four times that price this week because <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamestop-shares-spike-on-return-of-meme-stock-poster">one of the posters who sparked the 2021 meme stock rally started posting memes again after a multi-year break</a>.

<p>
This week also saw layoffs reported at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mighty-kingdom-lays-off-28-of-staff">Mighty Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singularity-6-laying-off-36-staff">Singularity 6</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/phoenix-labs-hit-by-another-round-of-layoffs">Phoenix Labs</a> (which was also acquired by a blockchain company at some point in the past year?!), and event organizer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/player1-reportedly-lays-off-staff-closes-down-insomnia-gaming-festival">Player1</a>, which has seemingly put the long-running Insomnia Gaming Festival to bed.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, the layoffs are grim, but we're starting to see more stories of new studios launching, including – frustratingly – from companies that just got done laying people off. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-cuts-1900-staffers-from-its-games-division">laid off 1,900 people in January</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">shut down a few Bethesda studios earlier this month</a>, but this week its Activision division <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-opens-new-polish-studio-elsewhere-entertainment">announced the creation of Elsewhere Entertainment</a>, a Polish studio creating new IP. You know, like Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks used to do.
</p>
<p>
And then there's Sony, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-lay-off-900-playstation-workers">laid off 900 PlayStation employees in February</a>.

            <p>Video game retail GameStop has reported its preliminary financial results for Q1, which ended May 4.</p>
<p>The firm expects net sales from $872 million to $892 million.</p>
<p>This would place GameStop's sales at a decrease of 28% to 30% year-over-year for the quarter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the retailer's net loss is expected to range from $27 million to $37 million, compared to a loss of $40.5 million in Q1 of last year.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/20501/html">GameStop is preparing to sell up to 45 million shares</a> of company stock in an effort to raise money.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamestop-shares-spike-on-return-of-meme-stock-poste">GameStop shares were trading up</a> after meme stock personality Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1789807772542067105">made his first social media post after three years</a>.</p>

Today, the game’s first full trailer provides the look at it in action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="241" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Nothing makes sense anymore. Buying a car to drive to work and driving to work to pay for your car made sense. Now you do that, and you still slide into debt covering the gas and insurance. At least eggs are still cheap, even with inflation.</p> <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">When I was in college and didn’t have any money, a pack of dry spaghetti was 99 cents. I’d pair it with powdered parmesan cheese. Did you know powdered parmesan cheese usually contains a high amount of cellulose? That’s an anticaking agent made from wood pulp. Sawdust. So, that probably makes it a vegetable, right? Don’t look at me like that. I was a picky eater. I didn’t eat anything close to a balanced diet until I was 25. It was then that I discovered eggs.</p>
 <p data-characters="106" data-current-count="106" data-injectable="false"><em>Arctic Eggs </em>gets me. It knows that, in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mullet-madjack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this dystopia</a>, all you need is eggs. Then everything makes sense.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="159" data-injectable="false"><strong><strong><strong>Arctic Eggs (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/">PC</a> [Reviewed])<br>Developer: The Water Museum, cockydoody, abmarnie, Cameron Ginex<br>Publisher: The Water Museum<br>Released: May 16, 2024<br>MSRP: </strong>$9.99</strong></strong></p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><em>Arctic Eggs</em> takes place on what looks like the top portion of a pair of Syberian skyscrapers. You attempted to escape this hellish elevated neighborhood, but it didn’t go well. You’ve been stripped of everything, leaving you an empty shell clutching a frying pan. Your new job is to prepare eggs for the citizens.</p>
 <p data-characters="54" data-current-count="54" data-injectable="false">It could be worse. Just wait until you see the prison.</p> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">You’re told that the <em>proper</em> way to leave your frozen vertical tomb is to simply ask the Saint of Six Stomachs for permission. However, this deity-like entity won’t even see you until you have satiated enough growling bellies.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true">You’re left to wander the sky-high walkways of the area, talking to everyone and finding out who wants a meal. Everyone speaks in cryptic ways, so you might not even realize until your T-Fal frying pan rises to view and food or “food” waits to drop into it. Weird to see the T-Fal branding in this game. Weird that I recognize it, though they are cheap pans.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Arctic Egg Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOHTS88qHUo?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">I like my eggs sunny-side-up. Runny yolk. I gained a taste for them this way during a trip to Japan. That’s not an option in <em>Arctic Eggs</em>. You need to cook them on both sides, which means you’ll need to flip it part way through.</p>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">You have no fish slice, however. You might call them spatulas, but that’s kind of a modern twisting of the word. Spatulas are just big flat spoons. A fish slice (also called a turner or flipper) is what you use to turn something over in a frying pan. Without one, you’re left to flip the egg the old-fashioned way: with force.</p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">It’s all mouse movements. You need to move and flick the mouse to push it into the air. Your position is stationary, so you can’t move the pan to catch whatever you just sent into the sky. You need to perfect the movement of allowing the food to move to the side of the pan so you can give it a flick and hopefully roll it.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Cooking a single egg is difficult to handle at first, but the scary thing is that you’re going to soon be juggling more than that. Cigarettes, fish, live cockroaches; the people of this strange, frost-covered slum have some bizarre tastes to go with their unusual way of talking.<br></p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_ArcticEggs03cropped.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">You might wonder how much gameplay you could really stretch out of a single <em>Mario Party</em> mini-game, but it turns out it’s a lot. Two-and-a-half hours, maybe? I don’t know. I left it to idle in the background and now time has no meaning. As soon as you figure out how to get bacon onto its backside, it’s time to move on to something else. It doesn’t always get more challenging, but it definitely gets different.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The nightclub section provides some of the most interesting hurdles. Folks will place beer bottles in your pan. You can let it fall over and spill its innards all over the unborn, but don’t let that liquid escape the boundaries of your cookware. A drop spilled and you start over.</p> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">Yet another challenge has an empty glass fall onto the pan followed by three ice cubes. Your job is to prevent the ice from touching the pan and melting (I guess glass doesn’t transfer heat in this universe). Scratch that. Your job is to cook the food in your pan (both sides) before the ice melts. Pro tip: it takes longer for the ice to melt than it does for one side of an egg to cook. If you successfully flip the egg back onto the surface of the pan, it doesn’t matter if the glass tips out its contents; the egg will finish first.</p>
 <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">One of my favorites was a single, pan-filling stingray. Another was a cube of grotesque meat. I’m a simple person.</p> <figure data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">To see the Saint of Six Stomachs, you have to appease 27 of <em>Arctic Eggs’ </em>34 people. This means that, if there’s a challenge you can’t handle, you can pass on it and still finish the game. I fed everyone. I cook a mean egg.</p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">But that isn’t easy. There are some challenges that felt like too much. Usually, just when I was about to quit, my sheer determination would pull through, and I’d clear the challenge.</p>
 <p data-characters="517" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">What made it even more difficult is that <em>Arctic Eggs</em> isn’t perfect from a technical standpoint. No game is. Ever. However, early on I discovered the quick movements would sometimes result in food clipping through the bottom of the pan. More intrusively, however, if my computer stuttered for any reason, the hand would completely wig out and immediately snap to an impossible angle. Food would fly up to the rafters where the egg’s sticky yolk would no doubt glue it to the ceiling where it would stay, forgotten.</p>
 <p data-characters="100" data-current-count="100" data-injectable="false">It wasn’t so bad. There’s no penalty for throwing your food skyward. You just try again.</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">I think this would happen specifically whenever my secondary hard drive would wake from stand-by. It’s a traditional platter drive, and I would hear it rev up around those moments. I really need to replace it. The thing is over 10 years old.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Can you fry an egg on Mount Everest? Who cares? I can’t think about that right now. I can only think about what’s directly in front of me: eggs. The only future I dream about is one where I am afforded the luxury to once again dream.</p> <p data-characters="77" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">I know you can’t boil a potato on Mount Everest. Sucks for all those Yetis.</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="true">For me, I have video games. They’re a way for someone to communicate their perspective to me. There’s probably a word for that, but I’m not a thesaurus. I just cook eggs. The best eggs. <em>Arctic Eggs</em> understands the importance of eggs in this bleak, vapid world of ours. They’re nutritious, they’re cheap, and they’re mostly produced through mass torture. So, when we put all that together, this is the best game.</p>

		<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is officially targeting a late 2025 release, as Rockstar’s parent company Take-Two Interactive narrowed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> launch window in their <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e357ad06-0762-4e80-b80c-e3869252fdfe">Q4 2024 earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>“Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games’ previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>,” Take-Two Chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick wrote in the report. “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.”</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/05/gta-6-watch-first-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2025-release-date/">GTA 6 was unveiled</a> with a fantastic looking announcement trailer at the end of last year, with Rockstar at that time pinning the game’s release for 2025. The rumour mill got spinning at that point, with reports suggesting that Rockstar was aiming for an early 2025 release. We don’t know if that was the actual target and things have slipped, or if late 2025 was always the internal goal, but either way, we now know to expect the long-awaited sequel toward the end of next year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The trailer introduces us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, as well an as-yet-unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>

<p>It’s clearly a modern day setting in the fictionalised state of Leonida, with a handful of things like social media shown in the trailer, but that won’t stop there being plenty of iconic classic cars and inspirations from the breadth of American culture in the South East of the country and Florida in particular. From packed beaches to going across the swamps on hover craft, and partying at the tops of skyscrapers, there’s also jokes thrown into the trailer about battling crocodiles in back garden swimming pools, “Floridaman” antics – Leonidaman in the game – and plenty more.</p>
<p>All of this should be reassuring to Take-Two’s investors, especially after the company announced and enacted a sweeping layoffs and cost reduction programme. Investors <em>love</em> when companies cut jobs, but what they’re really waiting for is GTA 6 and the next iteration of GTA Online, and it’s a nice fillip when there’s been a slight 3% decline in Net Bookings.</p>
<p>GTA 5, by the way, has now sold a simply astonishing 200 million copies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-head-denies-closing-olliolli-world-kerbal-2-devs.874041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has denied shutting down two studios under the company's umbrella earlier this month, despite strong evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>Back in early May, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">evidence began to emerge</a> that&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>developer Intercept Games had been shut down, including Intercept employees posting on LinkedIn about being laid off, as well as <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/about-employees/WARN" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a filing</a> announcing the closure of a Take-Two subsidiary with around 70 employees.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Bloomberg then reported that&nbsp;<em>OlliOlli World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rollerdrome&nbsp;</em>developer Roll7 was to be shut down, citing "documentation reviewed" by the publication.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent call with IGN's Rebekah Valentine</a>, however, Zelnick said that Take-Two "didn't shutter those studios" and that the company "[hasn't] shuttered anything".</p>

<p>Valentine says she then attempted to press Zelnick on whether he was denying the reports of Roll7 and Intercept's shutdown, whereupon a Take-Two PR representative said the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">cost reduction plan</a> constituted a "5% reduction in headcount", but that no "label-by-label breakdown" had been given.</p>

<p>Following this exchange, Valentine asked Zelnick whether Private Division, the Take-Two-owned parent company of both Roll7 and Intercept, was in trouble, but Zelnick said he "[doesn't] think so".</p>

<p>Zelnick goes on to say that Take-Two tends to leave announcements to each individual label, and that he's not "trying to be cute or difficult", but that higher-ups "don't tend to bring those discussions into these meetings".</p>

<p>Schreier says that in 2013,&nbsp;<em>BioShock 2&nbsp;</em>developer 2K Marin was shut down, but that neither Take-Two nor Strauss Zelnick would acknowledge the shutdown publicly and would act "in press releases as if the studio still existed, when in fact it did not".</p>

<p>Since no official announcement has technically been made regarding the shutdown of Roll7 or Intercept, it's possible that Zelnick is being absolutely accurate and that neither studio has been shut down, but given the evidence to the contrary, that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Take-Two news, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently revealed</a> that&nbsp;the hotly-anticipated&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-premiere-date">officially revealed last year</a>, will be launching in fall 2025. Watch this space for a mad scramble on other developers' part to avoid this window at any cost.</p>

  <p id="inxy9D"><em>Disney Lorcana</em>’s newest set, <em>Ursula’s Return</em>, drops Friday at local game stores and Disney parks before its mass market retail release on May 31. While fans that are already heavily invested in the trading card game will be reaching for those pricey booster boxes, new players and collectors will be more interested in the set’s two new starter decks that can get them up and playing right away. We’ve had them both on the table for a few weeks now, and each one is fairly competitive right out of the box. But they could easily benefit from some simple upgrades. These are your best bets.</p>

<p id="k6Ocw1"><em>Lorcana</em>’s new <strong>Amber and Amethyst</strong> starter deck, titled <em><strong>Madrigal Magic</strong></em>, is the most in need of tinkering. The Madrigal family’s various abilities are highly synergistic, and having more of them on the table at any one time will give you an advantage — especially late in the game. Therefore, the most important addition to the deck is <strong>Alma Madrigal, Family Matriarch</strong>. </p>
<p id="OpHsN8">The un-inkable card costs a modest three ink to play, and it’s a lightweight in a fight with just one attack and three defense. The ability to grab two lore upon questing is certainly handy, but the card’s real value comes in its special ability. Called <strong>To The Table</strong>, it allows players to shuffle their deck — not their discard pile — for a Madrigal character card before placing it on top of the deck to be drawn next. Having a few of these in your deck could be just the thing to pull off some much-needed late-game combos.</p>

<p id="ShsJiB"><em>Lorcana</em>’s <strong>Sapphire and Steel</strong> deck for <em>Ursula’s Return</em>, titled <em><strong>Stand Together</strong></em>, is pretty pugnacious. To get the most out of it, you’ll need to be challenging your opponents on the regular, leaning on your Support abilities to maximize damage and your Resist abilities to take a punch. But the songs included in this deck — Seldom All They Seem, One Last Hope, and Dig A Little Deeper — add more flavor than flash. So why not fold in some damage-dealing songs instead?</p>
<p id="gdDub0"><strong>And Then Along Came Zeus</strong> would be an excellent, and thematically appropriate, choice. It deals five damage when sung, but you’ll need at least a four-ink glimmer to sing it. Another good choice would be <strong>Let The Storm Rage On</strong> (sing cost three, two damage) or <strong>Strength of a Raging Fire</strong>, which deals damage equal to the number of characters you’ve got in play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158540/arctic-eggs-egg-frying-game-steam-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9899F9">We are currently in the middle of a bountiful month for indie games, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151036/best-indie-games-2024">our collective cup runneth over</a> with inventive, stunning, and incredible titles. So I apologize that I have to stop and beg you, upon bended knee, to please <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/">play this game</a> about flipping eggs in the Arctic.</p>
<p id="SNfQ6s">That’s not me simplifying the plot as a joke; that’s just the game. It’s stylized like games of the PlayStation era, and the game starts with the camera pointed straight at a chicken. I stumble forward past rows and rows of chickens, until I see a guard. His mask is intimidating, but he’s pretty polite to me. It seems like I tried to escape from ... whatever this place is, and as a result, I have been forcibly downgraded. I can walk, and I can cook. That’s it.</p>
<p id="rEkZuB">Walking is pretty simple, but cooking is not. All those chickens lay a lot of eggs, and I cook ’em up for people. One of my hands grasps the pan, and I can control the intensity or sensitivity of my grip with the scroll wheel. Then, I move the mouse to slide the egg inside the pan. </p>

<p id="Kl1uaM">This isn’t incredibly difficult per se, and some people will grasp it easier than others. I can’t think of another game that had physics-based instrument controls attached to the mouse, so I had to learn how to do that from scratch. As a result, I’m a pretty terrible chef.</p>
<p id="bKyhCM">Once one side of the egg is cooked, I have to do the Dark Souls of egg-cooking and flip it delicately onto its other side. I can see why this place needs so many chickens; I’ve tossed dozens of eggs out of the pan. Some people want me to throw stuff like bacon in with their egg, which makes for a greater challenge because if anything falls out of the pan, I have to start over from scratch. The more ingredients, the higher the risk that something goes flying. Sometimes, god forbid, they want more eggs.</p>
<p id="plI82Q">No one seems to mind my frequent stumbles; after spending fifteen minutes juggling one lady’s egg and her cigarette — an unusual garnish, but not my breakfast — and flipping eggs and cigarette butts everywhere, she was still impressed. I move from hungry person to hungry person, sinking further and further into this surreal world with striking visuals. There’s a very compelling game built around this simple gimmick, and I’m glad I stumbled across it during a month crammed full of great little gems. </p>

The last game that he cleared on stream in a similar manner was Sucker Punch’s samurai action title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-the-kotaku-review-1844368841&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-the-kotaku-review-1844368841"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a></span>, which is a markedly different experience than FromSoft’s immensely difficult epic.</p><p>Since he began <em>Elden Ring</em>, social media has been awash with reactions to Cenat’s thoroughly enjoyable playthrough. Given his inexperience with these particularly difficult games, as well as his penchant for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://clips.twitch.tv/SpunkyTenuousGaurM4xHeh-wj7eCGoxOX4xc0UZ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/SpunkyTenuousGaurM4xHeh-wj7eCGoxOX4xc0UZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dramatic overreactions</a></span>, viewers have especially enjoyed poking fun at his hardship. For example, Cenat got incessantly trolled for getting stuck on the Tree Sentinel, an optional mini boss that players often encounter at the beginning of the game, for six hours.</p><p>Other highlights include the typical hallmarks of a soulslike playthrough, including nonstop shouting, occasionally violent outbursts towards inanimate objects, and a flying controller. Every now and then, friends of Cenat’s have even appeared on stream in full armor to advise him on what to do, or to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Kaimafiaupdates/status/1789470418577031267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Kaimafiaupdates/status/1789470418577031267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fight each other with fake swords</a></span>. At one point, Cenat was even delivered an NBA Finals trophy, because why the fuck not? It’s been a great time and it shows: At its peak, the stream has drawn about 230,000 concurrent viewers.</p><p>Cenat’s <em>Elden Ring </em>streams have become such an event that countless Twitter accounts, including one that goes by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/TheClipBot&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/TheClipBot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheClipBot</a></span>, have been steadily updating users on Cenat’s progress, including which bosses he’s defeated, his death count, and how long the streamer has been at it, as well as general events that happen onstream.</p><p>When he hasn’t been playing <em>Elden Ring</em>, Cenat has been taking small social media breaks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/officialcvaults/status/1790098757230407795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/officialcvaults/status/1790098757230407795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovering that he might have a testicular torsion</a></span> with the help of his chat, and sleeping on stream. Despite the lack of activity during the latter parts of the stream, Cenat’s viewership has remained in the tens of thousands as his chat tries to goad him into waking up and reflects on the most recent events of the stream. It’s like the world’s most wholesome incarnation of <em>The Truman Show</em>. Y’know, minus all the viscera and otherwise disgusting imagery to be found in <em>Elden Ring.</em></p><p>I’d been catching stray highlights from social media all week, but I <em>had </em>to tune in to see Cenat take on Malenia. She’s widely considered the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-youtube-lionheart-malenia-buff-bleed-reddit-1850387548&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-youtube-lionheart-malenia-buff-bleed-reddit-1850387548">hardest boss in the whole game</a></span>, one of the hardest fights in any FromSoft game, and she stalled the guy for more than 24 hours before he beat her late last night. I’m so glad I started watching when I did because seeing Cenat take on Malenia was nothing short of <em>incredible</em>. After 120 hours of playing <em>Elden Ring</em> and an unknown amount of attempts against Malenia specifically, he beat her first phase only to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1790866249712357838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1790866249712357838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stunned</a></span> to discover she had a second one. When I tuned into the stream yesterday afternoon, Cenat was hyping himself up as he fought her, likening the fight to a heist he’d already committed before, and continually deployed phrases like “get ya money” or “refill the tank” as he attacked her and refilled his health. I think my favorite callout might’ve been when he just shouted “Cops!” as Malenia jumped into the air and released ghostly images of herself in her second phase.</p><p>The chat meanwhile was, and remains, completely engaged. While there were naysayers throughout chastising Cenat, an overwhelming number of his hundreds of thousands of viewers have been cheering him on. Repeated chants of “Lock in” were scattered throughout and without fail, someone commented something along the lines of “I WAS HERE” whenever Cenat reached Malenia’s second phase, as if trying to preempt the eventual victory they saw coming. Others were less helpful, like the hilarious stray commenter who simply typed “FART IN HER EYES.” Throughout the stream, and the Malenia fight in particular, folks have obviously been trying to advise Cenat, and whenever he’s been able to read the chat (which is moving a mile a minute at any given moment) he’s engaged with them and adapted his strategies and builds accordingly.</p><p>It feels worth mentioning that Cenat also took on this insanely difficult fight with no armor or help. His loadout consisted of the Rivers of Blood katana—which he’s been taking advantage of to make her bleed—when I first tuned in, though he eventually adopted a second sword and a dual-blade approach before finishing her off. Cenat refused to summon any players who would’ve gladly assisted him, nor did he use any of the popular spirit ashes in <em>Elden Ring</em>, like the mimic tear or Black Knife Tiche. With Cenat beating this fight in nothing but underwear, I think I’m going to have to concede that he is, in fact, the greatest <em>Elden Ring </em>player ever. Either him or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-malenia-boss-goldfish-twitch-stream-1850610071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-malenia-boss-goldfish-twitch-stream-1850610071">the goldfish</a></span> that also beat her a while ago.</p><p>The thing that finally did the trick? Cenat used a rune arc to activate the Great Runes you collect from fighting the major bosses. With the aid of these greatly amplifying passive abilities, he defeated her on his literal next try after 1610 total deaths in the game. Upon beating her, all of Cenat’s nearby friends flocked to his side as he triumphantly jumped up and down, sat on the Iron Throne replica that’s been sitting in the room behind him since the beginning of the stream, and blared a Malenia remix that he’d queued up at some point in the last day. It was, without a doubt, the feel-good gaming moment of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following its acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, it should surprise no one that Microsoft intends to go full bore with the Call of Duty franchise. They’re casting a wide net, launching their titles on Xbox systems, PC, and now PlayStation. But is Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass, too?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-ops-6-launch-on-game-pass">Will Black Ops 6 Launch on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent reports</a>, Black Ops 6 will indeed launch on Game Pass. Whether or not it launches on day one remains to be seen, but knowing Microsoft and its usual launch plans, it’s absolutely likely. Just take a look at Starfield. The open-world RPG was their most anticipated title, and they launched day one on Game Pass.</p>



<p>We had an inkling that the next Call of Duty would come to Game Pass. Previously, Sarah Bond at Microsoft revealed the team intends to launch every first-party title on Game Pass, including Call of Duty. We just saw Diablo IV hit Game Pass, so why not the biggest first-person shooter franchise, too?</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-black-ops-6-come-to-game-pass">When Will Black Ops 6 Come to Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, it’s unclear whether the upcoming first-person shooter intends to launch on day one, though it’s becoming increasingly more likely. That said, Black Ops 6 will likely launch on the subscription service on release day, which is currently October 25!</p>



<p>Considering Call of Duty remains one of the most popular competitive first-person shooter franchises in the world, earning countless hundreds of millions of dollars annually, it’s surprising to see Microsoft forego retail sales in favor of their monthly subscription service.</p>



<p>Will you play it on Game Pass or buy a copy outright? I’m curious to see how this affects sales, though Activision pushes microtransactions in multiplayer hard!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Summer Game Fest is promising the unveiling of the "next iteration" in a big 2K Games franchise next month, coming shortly after Take-Two Interactive mentioned as such in an earnings briefing.

Go ahead and count out Grand Theft Auto VI, for a few reasons. First, it's under Take-Two's Rockstar Games label instead of 2K. Additionally, the game has already been revealed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-now-set-for-fall-2025/1100-6523520/" data-ref-id="1100-6523520">Take-Two has set a Fall 2025 release window</a> for the anticipated game.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-borderlands-4-reveal/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Borderlands 4 from Gearbox seems like the safest bet to show up at Summer Game Fest. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-and-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-may-have-leaked/1100-6519321/" data-ref-id="1100-6519321">Borderlands 4 and Tiny Tina's Wonderland 2 leaked</a> late last year on a game developer's LinkedIn profile.

"... [Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford] is a hit maker," Zelnick said. "And it's very hard to make a new hit, and Tiny Tina was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family." Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-buys-gearbox-entertainment-from-embracer-for-460m/1100-6522221/" data-ref-id="1100-6522221">Take-Two acquired Gearbox for $460 million</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">Another possibility is a new entry in the BioShock series.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/17/hades-iis-first-patch-changes-how-sprint-and-resource-collecting-works<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hades II has taken the gaming world by storm, and I'm not just saying that because it's the subject of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/magazine">our current cover story</a>. But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it's still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><p>Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.</p><p>
🌒Full Patch Notes: <a href="https://t.co/HDQRCANrv1">https://t.co/HDQRCANrv1</a> <a href="https://t.co/RJO0ayFb8c">pic.twitter.com/RJO0ayFb8c</a></p></div>
— Supergiant Games (@SupergiantGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SupergiantGames/status/1791148077283410206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The first change comes to the sprint mechanic, a feature the original Hades did not have. By holding the dash button, Melinoë will begin to run, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks or cross larger lengths of the map. Several boons also only activate while sprinting, so it's a crucial mechanic for Supergiant to get right. After this first patch, sprinting is faster and it's easier to turn, and related boons have been re-balanced accordingly. Additionally, The Swift Runner upgrade at the Altar of Ashes (which increases sprint speed by 20%) now makes your dash immediately start, so you can escape danger more reliably.</p>

<p>The patch also does a minor overhaul of the resource collection system. As you progress, you'll unlock different tools, like the pickaxe and the shovel, to harvest different types of materials, like minerals and seeds. Before the patch, choosing a tool before a run meant you could only harvest those specific resources until you returned to the crossroads. If you picked up a shovel and encountered a fishing spot, you were out of luck. Now, players can harvest any resource they encounter in a run, but selecting a certain tool just makes its corresponding resource much more likely to appear. Now, a shovel-wielding Melinoë can attempt to catch any fish she comes across, but it's much less likely she encounters one in the first place.</p>

<p>The patch also includes a number of other smaller fixes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350?emclan=103582791472836561&amp;emgid=4175477072263852699">which you can read in their entirety here</a>. Just be wary before unveiling those spoiler tags if you haven't made it through the bulk of the game, as they reveal the existence of certain characters or locations you likely haven't encountered yet.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You thought you were done with <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/">Animal Well</a></em>? It’s not done with you. There’s a whole ‘nother game after your game. After you’ve dipped your toes, you’re given a flute with a pretty helpful postgame power: The power to fast travel. Here’s how to use it.</p> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">You can first reach the flute after you gather eight of the eggs. Once you do, return to the Egg Room where all the eggs are displayed. The bottom left door will nudge its way open. Down a corridor, you’ll come to a room with a chest, and inside it is the flute. The flute’s use isn’t immediately clear, but you play notes by holding the tool button and pressing a direction, whether that is through keys or a joystick. You use these directions to input codes which do a variety of different things.</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">There’s a notation given within <em>Animal Well</em> that you see when you pick up the flute. It labels the eight directions, appropriately 1-8.</p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">1 is set to the right direction, and then it continues clockwise. Down-right is therefore 2, down is 3, down-right is 4, and so on until you get to 8 (up-right). I’m going to use this notation, because it’s both easier to write and also how its displayed in <em>Animal Well’s</em> game-speak.</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Some (maybe all) codes are hidden in the environment, but others are completely unknown. Players are still figuring these out, but I’ve put together a list to the best of my abilities. Most of these were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/animalWell/comments/1cqw42v/comment/l3wyp8l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered by the community</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-fast-travel-codes" data-injectable="false">Fast Travel Codes</h2> <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">One of the most useful functions of the flute in <em>Animal Well</em> is to allow you to fast travel around the map.</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="false"> <li>Lower warp room: 1-7-5-3-5-3-5-3</li> <li>Upper warp room: 1-1-5-5-3-3-7-7</li> <li>Top of the well: 2-6-2-6-2-6-2-6</li> <li>Left jungle room: 1-8-1-3-1-4-4-1</li> <li>Secret jungle room: 6-7-2-3-4-3-5-3</li> <li>Firecracker room: 1-3-5-7-1-3-6-8-1-3-5-7-2-4-6-8</li> <li>Central Flame Room: 1-7-8-7-3-5-4-3</li> <li>Giant bunny room: 2-4-3-5-6-5-7-6</li> </ul>

            <p>Creative Assembly, the studio best known for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> Total War series, are rumoured to be working on a licensed Star Wars title. ‘Rumoured’ is the key word here, mind. <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/">Dualshockers </a>credit “a reliable source” with the information that “three new Total War games are currently in development,” and that “one of the three new projects is expected to be a Star Wars-themed Total War game.” There’s currently no further information beyond that, I’m afraid, although I’ve reached out to Creative Assembly for comment.</p>

<p>Let’s break this down a little, assuming we take the “three new Total War games” as fact. By this point, anyone would tell you that one of those titles is the heavily rumoured Total War: Warhammer 40,000. Creative Assembly have a long-standing relationship with Warhammer owners Games Workshop, one that’s proved exceptionally profitable for both sides. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> series of games was even credited, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a>, for being responsible for GW bringing back an entire tabletop setting in The Old World. Twarhammer is a significant moneymaker for CA, and the setting isn’t a fraction as popular as 40k. Also, come on. They’ve already got all those orc models.</p>
<p>That’s two games left. Again, even assuming there’s three in development, which seems like a lot for a studio that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cancelled-shooter-hyenas-was-reportedly-segas-most-expensive-game-ever">undergone</a> as much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-cancel-hyenas-and-several-unannounced-games-due-to-covid-era-losses">tumult</a> as Creative Assembly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">recently</a>. Out of those two, it feels very unlikely to me that the studio won’t have at least one historical title in the works. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-three-kingdoms">Total War: Three Kingdoms</a> was the fastest selling one they’ve done, and fans are still clamouring for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/medieval-ii-total-war">Medieval</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rome-total-war">Rome 3</a>. This is a studio that built their name on, and has consistently released a steady stream of, historical games. I can’t see them stopping any time soon.</p>

<p>So, that’s one left, going by the rumours. What might support it being a Star Wars title? For one, the series has only dabbled in primarily ranged warfare before, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-empire">Empire</a>. It would make sense for them to want to build a new engine for 40K, and you could imagine they’d want  to double-dip on that engine and some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a> assets. The only other convincing argument I can point to is ‘<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-star-wars-games-on-pc">Star Wars games</a> popular’. They are though.</p>
<p>That said, I just can’t see the setting working well. I understand there’s lots of deep lore, but look, I played the X-Wing minis game, and there’s 3 factions in that. Rebels, Empire, and ‘Scum and Villainy’ - basically just the bounty hunters and that. Not enough for a Total War game, I don’t reckon. All this aside, I certainly wouldn’t say no for a chance to send a formation of wompas careening into rebel lines, and I can see it being a decent success for the studio if it does turn out to be in development. I’ll let you know if I hear anything else.</p>

Microsoft teased an extended Direct for an unknown game directly after its June showcase, which fans quickly pieced together to be this year’s <em>Call of Duty </em>reveal. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span>, Microsoft had until recently been debating whether to keep <em>Call of Duty</em> off Game Pass, or add it and increase the price of the service. It’s unclear if the new reporting by <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>means Game Pass will get another price hike in 2024, or if <em>Call of Duty</em> will be exclusive to certain tiers. </p><p>Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>Call of Duty </em>costs hundreds of millions to make each year, and each year it sells tens of millions of copies. The cycle was so lucrative for publisher Activision that it slowly forced every studio it owned to contribute to making the hit series. When Microsoft finished its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year, whether <em>Call of Duty</em> would join <em>Diablo 4</em> and other games on Game Pass was one of the big questions. </p><p>While Microsoft made a big push behind Game Pass heading into the Xbox Series X/S console generation, subscription growth has seemingly slowed and plateaued in recent years. It’s not clear if adding<em> Call of Duty </em>to the service would bring in enough new monthly members to replace all of those who would decide not to buy it at full retail price of $70 as a result. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick famously testified last year that he had decided not to put <em>Call of Duty</em> on subscription services precisely because the math didn’t work out financially.</p><p>Microsoft had roughly 34 million Game Pass subscribers as of February of this year.

The tech giant footing the exorbitant bill to grow Game Pass might have seemed likely as recently as February when Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game File</em></a></span>, “Our intent is the full portfolio of games from ZeniMax, Activision Blizzard and XGS—Xbox Game Studios—will be on Game Pass, day one.” </p><p>This month, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-studios-arkane-tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-1851470253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-studios-arkane-tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-1851470253">Microsoft closed a handful of studios</a></span>, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-studio-closings-arkane-too-many-games-1851464885&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-studio-closings-arkane-too-many-games-1851464885">with <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> reporting that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard had put more scrutiny on Xbox, and pressure to generate higher profits, from the larger company.

<p>It feels like we’ve seen very little about Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 since its initial announcement. The marketing behind the game feels flat. Still, receiving a sequel to one of the most unique story-driven adventures is exciting. The mental health aspects still impress today, and so the second is definitely on our radar. But is Hellbade 2 coming to Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hellblade-2-launch-on-game-pass">Will Hellblade 2 Launch on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As a first-party launch, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 will absolutely launch on Game Pass on day one. You can play Hellbade 2 via Game Pass on May 21, so long as you have an active subscription. </p>



<p>If you have the Ultimate Plan for PC and Xbox, then you can play Hellblade 2 on either system without paying the retail price. An Ultimate Plan goes for $16.99/month, which is an absolute steal considering the number of quality titles available to download and play.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-does-senua-s-saga-hellblade-2-play">How Does Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 Play?</h2>



<p>If you’ve never played the first Hellblade, you’re in for a bit of surprise with the sequel. It’s an action-adventure with a third-person perspective in which you take on the role of Senua. She’s a Viking facing horrors both externally and internally.</p>



<p>One of the most significant selling points of the Hellblade franchise is its portrayal of mental health. You see, Senua suffers from psychosis, which she believes is a curse on her people. During regular gameplay, you’ll hear voices and see things in the environment, but they’re not genuinely present. It’s an engaging gameplay mechanic that alters how you interact with the world and characters.</p>

This follows reports in previous weeks indicating <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/xbox-reportedly-debating-putting-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-alongside-price-hike">Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration</a> in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/13/microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year</a>, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/08/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-more-than-22-million-copies-in-less-than-a-year#:~:text=Hogwarts%20Legacy%20Has%20Sold%20More,Than%20A%20Year%20%2D%20Game%20Informer">where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown</a> – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, this new report from&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</em>seemingly clears the air around that topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte," the story reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/08/the-2024-summer-gaming-showcase-schedule">gaming showcase summer</a> that includes <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/16/summer-game-fest-to-have-more-than-55-studios-and-publishers-including-playstation">Summer Game Fest</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/03/ubisoft-forward-confirmed-for-june-same-week-as-summer-game-fest">Ubisoft Forward</a>, and an <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-followed-by-a-secret-direct-for-a-beloved">Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct</a> that is probably focused on Call of Duty.</p>

Microsoft plans to launch this year's Call of Duty via Xbox Game Pass for the first time, in a first for the franchise. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c">The Wall St Journal</a>, which today reported that Microsoft had now made the decision ahead of the game's formal unveiling next month.
</p>
<p>
While Xbox has always brought new first-party games to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and Activision Blizzard is now a Microsoft first-party publisher following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">completion of its $68.7bn takeover</a>, there had still been a question mark over whether Call of Duty would be included.

<p>
Alongside FIFA, now EA Sports FC, Call of Duty remains one of the most reliable franchises to still sell millions each year - and every year. Including it in Microsoft's subscription service will make a dent in that sales revenue - but it will also undoubtedly help drive sign-ups to the subscription service.
</p>
<p>
Key questions now are whether Xbox Game Pass remains at its current price point, or whether Call of Duty might only be included in a pricier tier.
</p>
<p>"This is the right move for Microsoft because it's a multi-platform title that is being sold for $70 outside of the subscription and because it's a live service title with in game purchases," games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1791470465753518402">wrote</a>. "That model can also work for other Xbox first party games."</p>
<p>
This year's Call of Duty remains unannounced, though is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-a-black-ops-title-set-in-the-gulf-war-new-report-claims">widely expected to be a fresh Black Ops entry set in the early 1990s during the Gulf War</a>. Microsoft will detail more about the game next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">dedicating an entire hour to it following its main Xbox Showcase event on 9th June</a>. 
</p>
<p>
That event, timed during the old E3 week, will also see Microsoft show off some of its other 2024 titles, including Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Avowed, as well as further off projects. It will also be an oppurtunity for Microsoft to turn the page on a particularly bruising period marked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-shipped-five-times-more-ps5-consoles-last-quarter-than-microsoft-did-with-xbox">lacklustre console sales</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Bethesda studio closures</a>, and the decision to begin launching Xbox exclusives on PlayStation and Switch - something which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">not been universally popular within the company</a>.
