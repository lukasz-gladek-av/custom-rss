			<p>It’s December 2025 in Los Angeles. Players are furiously posting on ResetERA or Reddit about what bonkers predictions will show up at The Game Awards: will Phantom Blade 0 get a release date, will Geoff bring up a Muppet or Kojima onto the stage first, and what the hell is that monolith in the Mojave Desert all about? Before any of that took place, Wccftech was invited out along with a core group of fellow Soulslike-experienced journalists and content creators to visit Bandai Namco for an all-day preview event, going hands-on with Code Vein II for the very first time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Character-Creation.png"></a></figure>



<p>Despite the obvious sequel numbering in its moniker, Bandai Namco Studios and Shift reiterated multiple times that this is intended to be its own standalone story from the first game, and no prior experience from the original game is required. Of course, with Code Vein II set to launch at the end of January, that’s plenty of time to dive into the original game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC.</p>



<p>In the first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/678960/CODE_VEIN">Code Vein</a>, players assumed the role of a Revenant, an artificially-made vampire who requires some form of blood to sustain and maintain any sort of bloodthirst and cravings (Blood Beads being the most common way to satisfy those cravings without needing to seek out a human donor. Those same Revenants are being transformed into Horrors in the numbered sequel, necessitating the player in this new title to become a Revenant Hunter instead.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Visit-the-Past.png"></a></figure>



<p>The core theme to Code Vein II is a future that’s not set in stone. While the first game was about continuing on a linear path and the occasional dive into the player’s memories to view events in the past, Code Vein II is largely about changing the past to affect the present. The story opens with a cutscene telling the tale of a great Upheaval and four heroes that sacrificed themselves to seal away calamity through something called the Luna Rapacis. In order to enact great change in a world that’s already on the brink of further extinction, the hands-on session focused on venturing into the past to destroy one of these seals.</p>



<p>Despite the role reversal between the hunter and the hunted, many core themes that gave Code Vein a unique sense of combat are present here in <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">Code Vein II</a>. Players still don’t have to venture into the dungeons of the world alone and are instead accompanied by an NPC to complement a player’s chosen gameplay style. Of course, there is the ability to absorb that NPC into yourself for several statistical buffs, but even against the bosses of Code Vein II, I found having that extra body helped, especially when it comes to keeping the enemy distracted while I charged up a hefty hammer swing.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Slash.png"></a></figure>



<p>Defensive tech works a bit differently in Code Vein II than what players might expect. It all comes down to the defensive forma that players equip and set to the L1 button. One allows for blocking, another allows for timed parries. They’re each situational, but with enemy attacks being well telegraphed, the parry forma should be the perfect fit for Soulslike veterans.</p>



<p>On the other hand, combat skills and weapon forma are much like their counterparts from the first game. Players can set a palette of four different weapon skills between active attacks and passive temporary boosts, each with their own resource cost. Attacking and using a special drain attack both recharge this resource, allowing players to pull off vicious combos if they’ve accumulated enough stocked resources.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Levelup.png"></a></figure>



<p>Leveling up has been simplified for the player's view in Code Vein II. Each level-up gives players a modest boost of HP, Stamina, and Attack, with the majority of other stats coming by way of the equipped Blood Code and boosters. This is where the real versatility in character builds comes into pla,y and tracking down a specific Blood Code will be necessary to optimize the player’s build depending on their chosen weapon type and form of engagement. It’s these Blood Codes that give players six different stats (Strength, Dexterity, Mind, Willpower, Vitality, and Fortitude), with equipped gear requiring enough of a particular stat to be wielded effectively without placing a Burden upon the player if they go over one of these thresholds. Take Strength for example; if your gear is too heavy or you picked a massive hammer to go with a more nimble Blood Code, the burden placed on the character is twofold: your attacks will deal more damage, but you’ll also consume more stamina for these attacks if you swing and miss the target completely.</p>



<p>Heft is something that I found the original Code Vein was lacking, as with Shift Inc.’s earlier works with the God Eater franchise. In those games, it didn’t matter how massive a metal tool your character was wielding: the visual impact and weight to strikes felt next to nothing, and the enemy reactions never quite matched up with what one would expect from being struck by a forty-kilogram chunk of solid iron. In this numbered sequel, I felt proud to be picking up a hammer and knocking the ever-living daylights of whatever stood in my way. Charged attacks both feel and deal the amount of damage one would expect, compared to a much lighter and more nimble single-handed weapon.</p>

<p>While Code Vein II does away with the traditional multiplayer (meaning no summoning players to join in if you’re stuck on a particular encounter), the Partner system from the first game has been brought back, giving players a better fighting chance. Much like the first game, these fellow Hunters will complement the player’s given style, providing unique active/passive boons depending on who you pick to accompany you. There is also a system to “absorb” the Partner, forcing the player to venture off solo but with an additional set of unique boons. Partners also serve as a sort of second life for the player. Take enough damage and go down, and your Partner will automatically get you back on your feet, albeit at the cost of some of their own life and a recharge timer. Die a second time before your Partner has a chance to recover, and you’re dead for good, dropping your collected Haze on the ground and respawning at the last checkpoint.</p>



<p>I can’t speak definitively to the level design in Code Vein II quite yet, but I was a fan of the first game’s looping paths and recursive design, where shortcuts found often cut down on large chunks of time spent navigating through decrepit or horrific dungeons. There was the occasional branching path and secret stash of loot, so the exploration spirit in me will be eager to see just what secrets lie in the past to uncover.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Code-Vein-II-Demo-Announcement.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Code Vein II launches on January 30th, 2026, but players eager to step into the shoes of a Revenant Hunter or invest hours in the character creator will have their chance to rewrite history with a public demo launching on January 23rd.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>[Editor’s Note: Code Vein II was previewed on the PlayStation 5 Pro. Travel and accommodations was provided by Bandai Namco for this preview event.]</em></p>

His departure actually came at the end of 2025.</p><p>Itahana goes on to say that while he feels "deeply grateful" towards those who celebrated <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> for the JRPG's 25th anniversary last year, completing the "illustration work and supervision" for the occasion led him to "draw a line under this chapter and take on new challenges".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In conclusion to his post, Itahana says he's hoping to "continue creating a wide variety of new artwork" as a freelancer and expresses his "heartfelt gratitude" to former colleagues both at Square Enix and elsewhere.</p><p>As well as <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, Itahana has worked on a number of other Square Enix projects, including the likes of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s <em>Dawntrail </em>expansion, where he provided character concept art (but nothing beyond that, so I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d75083ba-0c32-43b2-b2b6-430355d89eb0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">won't blame <em>Dawntrail </em>on him</a>).</p><p>He's also worked on the <em>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles </em>games, as well as projects like <em>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/chocobo-gp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="979e8964-98c5-46aa-9190-d7479f9d3832" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2022 racer <em>Chocobo GP</em></a>. Hopefully, we'll get to see his art in many more games to come.</p><p>As for <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, the RPG's anniversary has come and gone with nary a mention of the long-rumored remake. It is, of course, still possible that the project is on the way, but the 25th anniversary would have been the perfect time to reveal it if so. I wouldn't hold my breath, personally.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what lies in Itahana's future, but whatever it is, it'll probably be outside of Square Enix's purview. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1397329</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know, to some degree, I gotta feel for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>creators</span></a><span>. Matt and Ross Duffer just wrapped up a decade-long streaming phenomenon that has certainly received a fair bit of praise from critics and fans over the years but, with its finale, has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>absolutely flopped in the eyes of some very loud viewers</span></a><span> who weren’t pleased with how the show wrapped up. And now those creators have to do a press tour in which everything they say is picked apart by people ready to tear them to shreds for a final season they feel didn’t land. So I guess it’s not too surprising that Matt Duffer maybe regrets doing postmortem interviews at all, though I’m surprised he said that out loud and on the record.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoyIdbhGg-E"><span>Josh Horowitz</span></a><span>, both Duffers talked for about an hour about the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>finale, and at roughly the 25-minute mark, while the two are talking about soliciting input from actors about how they saw their characters ending up, , Matt asks, “Did Maya (Hawke) want to die, Ross, or am I making that up?” to which Ross responds that he might be making that up. Horowitz asks why he would have fabricated such a thing, and then Matt admits that he’s not been happy with how these interviews have been going, saying his brain is “fried.”</span></p>

  <p><span>“I really shouldn’t have done any of these postmortem interviews,” he said. “I’m not in a good place. Like, why the hell we did any of them yesterday is beyond me. I’m like, fried. I’m getting over the flu, you know. So anyone mad at any answers we gave yesterday, just give me a break. cut me some slack.”</span></p>

 <p><span>I get it. As someone who has interviewed many creatives who are dealing with an onslaught of questions from several journalists in rapid succession, I know it can be exhausting work. At a certain point it’s entirely possible that the mental spend becomes enough of a burden, you start being less practiced with your responses. And given the nature of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>and the fandom around it, the interviews the Duffers have been doing have spent a lot of time on fan theories and unanswered questions, with the Duffer brothers readily handing out answers.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unsatisfied fans are hanging onto these interviews as if they’re going to possibly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>redeem </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> or at least give them closure on some threads the show seemed incapable or unwilling to make good on. Several of the interviews the two have given since the show ended have only stirred the pot further, and some fans are hopping on Matt Duffer’s comments and interpreting them as just the latest evidence that they are justified in feeling that the bros didn’t approach the finale with the proper care and forethought.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New year, fresh start. You’ve tired of breathing potentially unclean air at home? You don’t have to resign yourself to a life of allergens and pollen and dust, not on our watch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/">Amazon has reduced the price of the BLUEAIR Air Purifiers to $159.99, from its original price of $229.99.</a> This is a $70 discount, or approximately a 30% savings.</p>
<p>BLUEAIR Air Purifiers can help you remove pollen, pet dander, smoke and many other airborne particles through its HEPA filtration system. It’s the perfect home option for getting rid of all those pesky allergens in your house that make you wake up sniffling, affect your asthma, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An air purifier that takes cleaning your air seriously</h2>
<p>This particular unit goes way beyond the ones you’d find at stores like Target or Walmart, with a markedly improved filtration system that can get down to the nitty gritty and rid small to large areas of those little nasties you’re breathing in every day.</p>
<p>Plus, replacing the filter is super simple. When it is time to replace the filter, the unit alerts you so you can easily replace it. Replacing the filter regularly keeps the unit performing optimally by allowing the air purifier to continue to draw in particles efficiently.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was always going to be tough for Highguard to succeed after the anticlimactic reveal it experienced during December’s The Game Awards ceremony. Many millions of viewers sat through hours of trailers and speeches to see what the ‘final reveal’ would be, and then Highguard graced screens worldwide, falling somewhat flat and leaving gamers disappointed.</p>



<p>Highguard is a new PvP shooter from former Apex Legends and Titanfall developers, and it’s set to drop in just <strong>three weeks</strong>. Aside from the prestigious trailer spot at The Game Awards, almost nothing has been shown, revealed, or discussed regarding the game that many have dubbed ‘Concord 2’.</p>



<p>Is Highguard going to be dead on arrival? The consensus isn’t looking good.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-has-already-drawn-negative-impressions">Highguard Has Already Drawn Negative Impressions</h2>



<p>Highguard took up the most anticipated trailer spot at The Game Awards, but it might have blown back on Wildlight, the game’s developer. It has already been labelled DOA by many owing to an almost complete lack of marketing, a slew of negative first impressions, and a mishandled reveal that didn’t inspire much confidence.</p>



<p>It was unexpected, but ultimately it’s just another live-service hero shooter that was too quickly compared to titles like VALORANT, Overwatch, and yes, Concord, the ill-fated PlayStation shooter that was so bad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it killed an entire studio</a>.</p>



<p>Many were left bewildered by the cacophonic trailer that didn’t explain much. It was a visual showcase, revealing players scooting across maps on the backs of horses and bears while wielding swords, magic, and assault rifles, all in a bid to resolve classic first-person shooter arena modes set in destructible maps.</p>



<p>There’s so much going on there, it’s unreal.</p>



<p>That’s one of the first failures of Highguard – it’s trying to be so unique while taking inspiration from many other games, that it has spawned with a twisted, hard-to-place identity that gets lost in the complexity of it all.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9v_z7SmcUUE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-track-record">Track Record</h2>



<p>The hero shooter and live-service FPS space is overcrowded and bursting at the seams with recent failures. Players are arguably fatigued by now, and Highguard’s reveal just failed to convince them that it brings anything <strong>new </strong>to the table, despite Geoff Keighley’s attempt to hype the game up at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, the most glaring red flag is the radio silence and lack of marketing for Highguard. It’s coming out in just <strong>three weeks </strong>and has no major marketing beats, no influencer previews or campaigns lined up, and absolutely no social media momentum.</p>



<p>On Steam, the game boasts <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">just <strong>7,460 followers</strong></a><strong> </strong>at the time of writing, which is a pinprick in the userbase compared to other, similar titles. It echoes Concord, which only had a few thousand before it launched in August 2024.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance at Highguard on search engine trend platforms reveals nobody is curious about the title.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The official channel uploaded the game’s inaugural trailer on December 12, and it has garnered just 90,000 views at the time of writing. It has an overwhelmingly negative like-to-dislike ratio (89% disliked). IGN managed to get 400,000 views on the same trailer, but that came with a 92% count of dislikes and an alarming number of negative comments:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘ChatGPT, generate a hero shooter with fantasy elements.’</li>



<li>‘This was outdated when the developer first imagined it.’</li>



<li>‘Oh God, I thought people were joking. It actually does look like Concord.’</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1q27yex/what_are_you_playign_with_23_days_to_go_for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> fan-created subreddit</a> has just 113 members, and on there, most of the posts concern questions about the lack of updates from the developers. One user wrote, ‘Either the devs are stupid, or this game is getting delayed.’</p>



<p>It might boil down to the backlash being more emotional than anything else, as many have written the game off without a) seeing raw gameplay, and b) without trying it out for a single second. Perception is reality in gaming, but the community is firmly unconvinced, and that might drive prospective users away without giving this free-to-play shooter even a first glance.</p>



<p>Unless Wildlight Entertainment pulls off a rapid and aggressive marketing campaign to compel users to invest, the narrative of Highguard being dead on arrival might be a prophetic one.</p>



<p>Let’s just hope they didn’t spend too much on The Game Awards ad spot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Hytale on PlayStation 5 & Xbox Series X|S? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>

<p>The long wait for Hytale is rapidly approaching a conclusion, but not every player around the world will be able to dive in immediately due to platform restrictions.</p>



<p>Hytale’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release is set for January 13</a>, which marks the start of a long development journey before the full release of the game, and there are plenty of hurdles to overcome.</p>



<p>If you want to know what platforms Hytale can be played on, this Insider Gaming guide has all the details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-playstation-5">Is Hytale on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Long wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hytale is not available for PlayStation 5 and launches as a PC early access exclusive. However, there are plans to expand to other platforms in the future.</strong></p>



<p>While no specific consoles were mentioned, executive director Patrick ‘Lyall’ Derbic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-skipping-steam-initially-to-avoid-negative-reviews-console-launch-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed plans for a console release</a> in future, but that it would likely come after the early access period has concluded.</p>



<p>There is no indication of how long the early access period for Hytale will last, and it likely depends on the development process and will be subject to change, so expect a pretty long wait before you can play the title on PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Hytale on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, as Hytale launches as a PC early access exclusive, the game is not available on Xbox Series X|S. However, Hypixel Studios plans to bring the game to other platforms in the future.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmation of plans for a console release came ahead of the start of early access, though it was stated it would not arrive during that period. Instead, Xbox players will have to wait until the full release of Hytale, at the earliest, before the game can be played on the Microsoft consoles.</p>



<p>Given there’s no indication of how long early access will last, the game could skip Xbox Series X|S entirely and instead launch on the next generation of consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-on-nintendo-switch-2">Is Hytale on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Hytale is not available on Nintendo Switch 2, as it is a PC early access exclusive, and while there are plans to expand to additional platforms, it’s not clear yet whether that includes Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>While plans for a release on other platforms are confirmed, Nintendo Switch 2 is slightly different due to the system requirements, although Nintendo did make huge strides to lessen the gap between the console and its rivals with the Switch 2, as shown by the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 releasing on the platform.</p>



<p>There’s no guarantee Hytale will arrive on the console, however, and a priority would likely be to bring the game to Xbox and PlayStation first, especially if a release on Nintendo Switch 2 requires detailed attention.</p>

                <p>Arc Raiders was a breakout hit in 2025, and it's still growing. New data from <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2008134792043458724" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> states that the game enjoyed its biggest day ever on Sunday, January 4, when it came to daily active users.</p><p>It was reported to have had 3.2 million daily active users on January 4 across platforms. Additionally, the research group said Arc Raiders passed 12 million copies sold over the weekend.</p><p>The number of Arc Raiders copies sold daily began to "stabilize" in early December, but the recent 20%- off sale--which brought the price down to $32--along with a boost related to people being off from school and work for the holidays, helped pump up daily sales figures, the report said.</p><p>Alinea also reported that the $40 Arc Raiders has now reached more than $350 million in estimated revenue across all platforms. On Steam, the game is faring particularly well, accounting for 53.5% of total sales in January so far. Additionally, the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">24-hour peak concurrent figure of 466,372</a> is just about 3% off the game's all-time peak of 481,966 players on Steam.</p><p>Arc Raiders is a big success, but it also has its critics who took issue with the game's use of artificial intelligence systems for its voice lines.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Anthem Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">After that announcement, former BioWare producer Mark Darrah <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bioware-producer-details-what-went-wrong-with-anthem/1100-6533735/">discussed what went wrong with Anthem</a>--at least from his point of view. For instance, Darrah noted that Mass Effect director Casey Hudson pitched Anthem to EA as a whole new direction for BioWare, but then Hudson left the studio and couldn't lead that proposed transformation. Hudson is now overseeing the team that's working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-probably-many-years-away-from-release/1100-6536942/">the recently revealed Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, Darrah admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-anthem-approaches-its-shutdown-ex-bioware-boss-reflects-on-what-could-have-been/1100-6534123/">Anthem was going to become unplayable at some point</a>, regardless of whether it was successful or not. That's just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/">the nature of the beast with live-service games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/anthem-2-0-reboot-canceled-but-current-servers-will-remain-live/1100-6488005/">Anthem was planned to be rebooted with a major update</a>, but that was scrapped in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The next project from BioWare is expected to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/">Mass Effect 5</a>, but the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-reportedly-has-fewer-than-100-staff-members-left/1100-6529194/">reportedly has fewer than 100 employees left</a>.</p>

                <p>Over two years after its release, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is enjoying an all-time peak on Steam, likely in large part due to the game's new DLC that ties in directly to the film franchise's latest installment.</p><p>Data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2840770/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> showed that the Ubisoft-published open-world game hit a record number of 15,283 players this week--a gain from its previous peak of 12,496 players last month when Avatar: Fire and Ash hit cinemas on December 19.</p>

The DLC costs $25, though a From the Ashes edition of the game that includes the base game retails for $40.</p><p>It's little surprise that the new story content, along with the related film being a box-office hit that has <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/box-office/avatar-fire-and-ash-1-billion-benchmark-james-cameron-1236618729/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">just crossed $1 billion</a>, gave Frontiers of Pandora a hefty boost in player interest and engagement.</p><p>The latest updates for Frontiers of Pandora gave players several excuses for returning to the game, most notably a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-getting-third-person-update-just-ahead-of-avatar-3/1100-6533311/" data-ref-id="1100-6533311">third-person mode and New Game Plus support</a>. Those additions were patched in on December 5, a couple of weeks before From the Ashes released.</p><p>From the Ashes puts players in the role of So'lek, a Na'vi seeking revenge against the RDA and the warmongering Ash clan featured in Fire and Ash. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-dlc-hands-on-how-the-new-movie-sets-frontiers-of-pandoras-world-aflame/1100-6536707/" data-ref-id="1100-6536707">hands-on preview of From the Ashes</a> said the expansion does "just enough to make the experience feel fresh all over again."</p>

                <p>Fans have had over 20 years of the Saw franchise, and John Wick is already celebrating over 10 years, with a fifth installment possibly on the way. Saw has become a contemporary iconic horror series that has spun off into a slew of merchandise, had its own Halloween Horror Nights house, and even a video game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/saw-review/1900-6232574/" data-ref-id="1900-6232574">back in 2009</a> and its sequel. While Wick doesn't have the level of crossover appeal--though both Wick and Jigsaw's puppet have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-arrives-in-fortnite-skin-ltm-challenges-/1100-6466952/" data-ref-id="1100-6466952">appeared in Fortnite</a>--Lionsgate is looking to take both Jigsaw and Wick into video games for a new generation. </p><p>On a recent earnings call, Lionsgate chairman Adam Fogelson mentioned that there is "increased interest and increased opportunity" to make new AAA games based on Lionsgate IPs. Fogelson specifically mentioned Wick and Saw. </p><p>"Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule," he said (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839872-lionsgate-studios-corp-lion-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Seeking Alpha</a>). "So I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years."</p><p>Back in 2023, Lionsgate admitted that it was looking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-5-confirmed-john-wick-video-game-proposals-moving-ahead/1100-6514599/" data-ref-id="1100-6514599">into a video game adaptation for Wick</a>. Lionsgate president Joe Drake said Lionsgate is "continuing to have those conversations" about moving the Keanu Reeves-led franchise to games, adding that there was a ton of energy" around the prospect of making a John Wick video game. Nothing came out of those proposals; instead, the world expanded with the spin-off film Ballerina and the prequel series The Continental. </p><p>With Saw, both games weren't well-received, and so maybe the third time's the charm for Jigsaw and his macabre puzzles and deathtraps. Lionsgate had previously adapted the Blair Witch franchise into a game as well, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blair-witch-game-review-prying-eyes/1900-6417290/" data-ref-id="1900-6417290">equal tepid fanfare</a>. </p>

<p><em><strong>Game Informer's Wesley LeBlanc:</strong></em><strong> How would you describe Neowiz’s 2025? Were there any particular standout moments or surprises for Neowiz, or did it feel like a year of consistency?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em><strong>Neowiz co-CEO Sean Kim: </strong></em>Late last year, we did have some concerns; however, the year ultimately delivered results that exceeded our expectations. As a co-CEO of a public company, there is a clear responsibility to achieve a certain level of financial performance each year. We knew that we had developed something new and extraordinary with Lies of P, but forecasting its financial performance was something of a challenge. We bet heavily on the remarkable skill and passion of our development and publishing teams, and it paid off. Lies of P sales and sentiment numbers were very strong.</p><p>Overture also had a material impact on the base game numbers, bringing in a wave of new players and expanding the community in untold ways. In that sense, the release was particularly significant, as it solidified the foundation of an emerging pillar franchise for us moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Winning the Golden Joystick and the Lenovo 3D Juego awards in a stacked field of competitors this year was an added bonus. Having the game acclaimed by players and critics alike made the experience as personally gratifying as it was financially fruitful.</p><p><strong>I think, because of the success of Lies of P, Neowiz is most closely associated with that series now. But what else is Neowiz up to beyond Lies of P?</strong></p><p>Our goal is to consistently introduce successful IP that fans will continue to support and look forward to over the long haul, even five or ten years down the line.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, we are internally developing more than five new PC and console titles, while also focusing on discovering global IP through collaborations with Western studios such as Zakazane and Wolfeye. We plan to continue investing in strong partners worldwide as we move forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Our lineup of third-party indie titles, many of them developed by talented local Korean teams, is also worth highlighting. In particular, Shape of Dreams and SANABI recently achieved both critical and commercial success.</p><p><strong>Neowiz recently shared word of five unannounced games in development, ranging from Lies of P’s sequel to a narrative-based RPG to life simulation and more – how does Neowiz chart its path forward, and does genre play a role?&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p>Our core strategy is to expand the size of our fanbase and deepen engagement among players who enjoy our games. We like to define IP as "content + fans." No matter how much effort goes into making great content, we believe it is difficult to call a game “great” if it fails to satisfy its fans.&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t set out to pursue a wide range of genres as a matter of strategic direction; rather, we’re circumspect about what we currently have and opportunistic about what we could execute well. Of course, the Lies of P franchise will need to be continued. That’s a given. But in general, our development cycle does not begin with a particular genre. Instead, it starts with the creative vision of our directors. We tend not to begin development by fixating on a play style or game concept first.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, we evaluate proposals from our directors based on a few key criteria.&nbsp;First, is the genre attractive, considering the current market size and competitive landscape? Next, are we able to assemble a solid team that can deliver the project at a high level of quality? Finally, is there a long-term strategy for growing the game's fanbase and engagement?&nbsp;</p><p>We regularly revisit our ongoing projects using these same criteria to make sure that they stay aligned with our strategy, which is centered on both content and fans.</p></div><p><strong>Can you tell me anything about the Lies of P sequel?</strong></p><div><p>At this point, there is nothing specific we can share in detail. I can tell you that the team at Round8 Studio is excited about their work and fully focused on development.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Lies of P DLC receiving further recognition through its various award wins and director Choi Ji-Won expressing strong confidence in the studio’s next project, we hope fans will continue to look forward to what’s ahead as much as we are.</p></div><p><strong>How do Neowiz and Round8 feel about Overture’s release earlier this year?&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p>We are grateful to see that players around the world have responded so positively to our vision and work product. It was a watershed moment, adding clear insight into the importance and potential of Neowiz’s franchise-driven IP strategy, while also practicing what it takes operationally to deliver solid results in the global market.&nbsp;</p><p>For Round8 Studio, the success of Overture was especially validating, as it clearly demonstrated the competitiveness of the Lies of P IP on the worldwide stage, while recognizing the creativity, dedication, and ambition shown by the entire development team.</p></div><p><strong>Neowiz is publishing two third-party games – one for Wolfeye and one for Zakazane. What does Neowiz look for in third-party partners, and what stood out about these studios and what they’re working on?</strong></p><div><p>We first look at a game’s vision and potential, as well as the team’s experience and capabilities. It’s about making sure we’re the publisher that can truly elevate them. For us, partnering isn’t solely about discovering strong projects.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, we try to understand whether a prospective team has a long-term plan to grow their game’s fanbase and build an IP at scale. If a game shows promise but falls outside of areas where we can add value, we’d rather guide the developers toward someone who can do the best job with them. Ultimately, our priority is seeing creators succeed, because the games themselves are what matter most.</p><p>In the case of Wolfeye, we saw the potential for the rich and compelling worlds they are building to grow into a franchise IP with us. Similarly, our publishing partnership with Zakazane was driven by our confidence that their strong narrative foundation would allow them to expand the current project into sequels with our support.</p></div><p><strong>When you, as a publishing lead, look at 2025, what do you think defines gaming this year? Any surprises? Any disappointments?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For 2025, our focus was to continue to create high-quality projects and solidify Neowiz’s position in the global PC and console market. As we’ve reached the end of the year, it’s felt like the start of a new era of gaming. Smaller teams are achieving strong results, including our publishing relationship with Lizard Smoothie. The release of their debut title, Shape of Dreams, sold 500,000 copies in its first month, and the team is still dedicated to delivering the best experience for their community. We look to take these successes and expand our publishing efforts in narrative-driven game development with developers from around the world.</p><p><strong>Generative AI is a hot topic this year, with some studios/publishers getting behind it and others staying away from it. Does generative AI have a place within Neowiz’s publishing house, and how does it work with developers?</strong></p><p>Korea is reportedly one of the countries where ChatGPT is used most actively. It’s hard to find a game company here today that isn’t using AI in some way. At the very least, companies are using either ChatGPT or Gemini.&nbsp;</p><p>For us, like any forward-thinking technology company, we are actively exploring how advanced learning tools can enhance our internal publishing productivity. Our primary focus is on research and development to automate routine operational tasks, such as test case processing and analyzing large volumes of operational data.&nbsp;</p><p>AI utilization can also enable our expert teams to work faster and focus their energy on refining core strategies with our partners to maximize player engagement. By processing data faster, our teams will arrive at better, more informed strategic decisions on how best to support our developers and engage with our community.</p><p><strong>South Korea, in particular, is becoming more and more of a major player in game development/publishing. Mobile is a big part of the market there, but I’ve spoken to enough devs there to learn that there seems to be a push to consoles/PCs and triple-A projects – do you agree, and if so, why do you think this is?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>That does seem to be the case. Given the current landscape, it’s understandable that leadership teams would see PC and console as important areas for future growth. Competition in the mobile market has become increasingly intense, and a number of traditionally mobile-focused companies are clearly looking to pivot toward PC and console development. We’re already seeing studios in that space begin to show results.</p><p><strong>How are Neowiz’s mobile offerings doing in relation to its console/PC releases?</strong></p><p>We are actively operating live-service mobile games that are well-received by players worldwide. We still view our mobile business as an important pillar of our company. We found that our cozy games resonate with Western consumers, with titles like Cats &amp; Soup. In particular, Cats &amp; Soup celebrated its fourth anniversary in August and recorded over 60 million downloads of the game last year. We also expanded the IP with the launch of Cats &amp; Soup: Magic Recipe this April, which was developed by the original team.</p><p><strong>Anything else I missed or didn’t ask about you’d like to discuss?</strong></p><p>Not only does Neowiz have a Korean team with direct experience in the global success of Lies of P, but it also has a strong global publishing team across North America and Europe. With this foundation, we look forward to meeting great teams around the world and building long-term partnerships.</p><hr><p><em>This email Q&amp;A took place in December of 2025.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2026/01/05/ceo-of-lies-of-p-publisher-neowiz-talks-2025-overture-expansion]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Alicia Vikander's turn as Lara Croft in 2018's Tomb Raider adaptation is having a bit of a renaissance it seems. The film, which is largely based on the rebooted Survivor timeline, recently popped up on the Netflix top 10 films list, seven years (give or take) since its initial release.</p>
<p>Most recent Netflix data reveals Tomb Raider is sitting at number nine for global film releases, ahead of the more seasonal Jingle Bell Heist, making it one of the most watched films worldwide between 22nd and 28th December.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10">According to Netflix</a>, Tomb Raider has so far enjoyed two weeks on the streaming service's top 10 for films, with over 4m views. That equates to 8.2m hours watched.</p>
<p>The rest of the top 10 is made up of seasonal favourites such as Dr. Seuss' The Grinch or more recent releases like Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. K Pop Demon Hunters is, of course, still in there as well.</p><p>So, why the sudden interest in Tomb Raider? Well, there are a number of factors that have likely had an impact on its renewed popularity. Netflix could have seen an uptick in Tomb Raider viewers as this year marks the series' 30th anniversary. Yep, the first Tomb Raider came out in 1996, which is wild because I am still only 21, so not sure how that works…</p>
<p>Another reason could be the announcement last month that two new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> are in the pipeline. The first, known as Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">from the ground up remake of the original Tomb Raider</a>, with Flying Wild Hog handling development with Crystal Dynamics. This chap is due to be released some time this year, though we don't have an exact date yet.</p>
<p>The second game, meanwhile, is coming from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon, and is known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst. This will be an all-new series entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">which takes place after Tomb Raider: Underworld</a> (that's the game where Lara pops along to Helheim whilst wielding Thor's hammer, Mjolnir). Catalyst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">will see the globe-trotting Lara Croft heading to Northern India</a>, and is due to be released in 2027.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikanders-tomb-raider-sequel-in-limbo-following-amazon-buyout">a sequel to Vikander's Tomb Raider film was being planned</a>. However, in 2022, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikander-no-longer-lara-croft-as-tomb-raider-movie-series-sits-in-limbo">MGM had lost the rights to the Tomb Raider films</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Amazon is working on a live action Tomb Raider TV series, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Filming is expected to kick off later this month. Other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">cast members include Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs</a>.</p>
<p>Weaver will play a character called Wallace on the show's release, and has stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>1397266</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the years, the Styx series has become the series for those looking for involving stealth gameplay. Cyanide's hardcore approach to stealth mechanics prevented the series from being popular among audiences that weren't the stealth games fanatics, but it's undeniable that this approach, combined with a dark fantasy setting and a chatty, irreverent main character, made the series what it is.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/"><strong>After having had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed</strong></a>, the next entry in the series, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-delayed-out-of-2025-now-set-to-arrive-in-february-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">now set to launch this February on PC and consoles</strong></a>, I couldn't help but notice how Cyanide wasn't going to compromise on its hardcore approach to widen the series' appeal. The contrary, actually. </p>



<p>While Styx continues to be the likeable goblin rogue he has always been, everything else has been expanded considerably, with an open-world setting with sandbox features that provides new challenges, but also new tools to dispose of surprisingly attentive enemies that leave no stone unturned if they believe to have spotted something suspicious. This early build was unsurprisingly a little rough around the edges, but the experience's potential was evident.</p>



<p>Last month, I was given a second chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed before its release. While in terms of content this new build wasn't different from the one I tried during Gamescom 2025, except for a new intro sequence teaching the game's basics while setting up the story, the prior experience (and the more relaxed testing environment) made me appreciate even more the focus on verticality, and the sandbox design of the Slums, where the build's main mission takes place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-January-Hands-On-Gameplay.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As part of this build's main mission, Styx is supposed to talk with a drunken dwarf who is staying at a nearby tavern to recover the Zeppelin. With little knowledge of the game mechanics, in my Gamescom 202 test, I went through the tavern's main door, using every opportunity to distract enemies to make it to the dwarf's room, with some difficulty, as the enemies have solid AI that makes them smarter than your usual enemy in non-stealth-focused games. However, now knowing where the room is, I took a completely different approach. </p>



<p>Taking advantage of the map's verticality, I climbed the tavern from the outside, making sure to crouch under windows to avoid enemies spotting me. This approach provided not only a different experience but also highlighted how the sandbox design of Styx: Blades of Greed will allow players to complete missions in any way they like.</p>



<p>The second part of the mission, which involved taking down all enemies in a somewhat closed-off location with an intricate design with multiple passages between rooms, likewise showed how many options are at Styx's disposal to take enemies out, even without using any of the special abilities that can be learned via the different skill trees or new tools like the grappling hook and the glider. One option I didn't see back in the Gamescom 2025 build is the ability to poison food, which highlights once more how varied the player's approach can be to clear missions.</p>



<p>Besides being able to appreciate better what Styx: Blades of Greed tries to do, the new build also showcased a higher degree of polish over the Gamescom 2025 demo, with little to no visual and gameplay glitches. Unfortunately, I can't really evaluate the game's performance, as the preview was conducted via cloud streaming; however, things felt smooth enough, even with multiple characters on screen.</p>



<p>While I don't expect Styx: Blades of Greed to set the market on fire, as its hardcore stealth approach is still going to leave anyone who isn't a stealth game fanatic frustrated, the new entry in the series by Cyanide seems to evolve the series' formula considerably, providing a sandbox stealth experience that works incredibly well with its wealth of options. </p>



<p>As such, I am looking forward to seeing what the game will offer beyond what I have already experienced twice, and whether the map and encounter design will hold up as well as they do in these missions when it launches on February 19 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Tomba!</em>, it's a rather curious game from the halcyon days of the original PlayStation, having launched in Japan in 1997, followed by a release in America and Europe the following year.</p><p>The game is essentially a Metroidvania platformer that follows the titular Tomba, a feral child who must defeat a battalion of pigs in order to recover a sacred bracelet belonging to his grandfather.</p><p>To do so, he'll have to explore a large non-linear map filled with areas to explore in both the foreground and background, as well as quests to complete in the course of exploration.</p><p>Since release, <em>Tomba!</em>, which was released as <em>Tombi! </em>in Europe, has attracted a cult following, leading to the launch of a sequel, <em>Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return</em>, in 1999. The sequel netted itself a release for modern systems, including the Switch 2, in December last year.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Tomba! Special Edition </em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-special-edition-switch-2/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right now on Switch 2</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the CES show floor officially opening on Tuesday, January 6th, many companies have already announced new tech, gadgets, concepts, and AI-powered upgrades that will be released over this year.</p><p>Yesterday’s CES Unveiled event delivered even more announcements and reveals. If you’re already struggling to keep on top of all the news coming out of the show, we’ve rounded up some of the best hardware and upgrades that have debuted so far. But there’s still more to come, so you can check back here every day, or catch up on all of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/836627/ces-2026-news-gadgets-announcements"><em>The Verge</em>’s CES 2026 coverage here</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/835525/samsung-z-trifold-announcement-us-availability">announced last month</a>, <em>The Verge</em>’s Allison Johnson finally got some hands-on time with the Galaxy Z TriFold that uses a pair of inward-folding hinges to expand from a chunky phone to a large tablet. For now it’s only available in Korea, but the Z TriFold is expected to be available in the US sometime in Q1 2026 for what will most likely be a hefty chunk of change. Its biggest selling point, according to Johnson, is the potential to carry around a laptop replacement in your pocket. “The thing that makes the TriFold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the TriFold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.”</p><p>If you always seem to remember what groceries you need <em>after</em> you get home from the store, GE Appliances’ new package-scanning fridge can help you create a comprehensive shopping list. Launching in April 2026 for $4,899, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/851934/ge-appliances-smart-fridge-barcode-scanner-tablet">GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant</a> has a scanner on the front you can use to scan empty packages, and you can manually add items to a shopping list using an 8-inch tablet on the door. There’s even a camera inside the fridge you can remotely access through an app to check if you’ve run out of something while you’re shopping.</p><p>Clicks is best known for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617479/clicks-blackberry-keyboard-case-android-motorola-google-pixel-samsung-galaxy-availability">smartphone cases that add a physical BlackBerry-style</a> compact keyboard. Its latest creation has that same keyboard, but also a 4.03-inch OLED screen, front and rear cameras, a headphone jack, and a 5G data connection, and it runs Android 16. The Clicks Communicator is designed to be an alternative to your daily driver smartphone that you can limit to essential apps to minimize distractions. At $499 it’s priced similarly to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/phone-review/646135/google-pixel-9a-review-a-midrange-phone-done-right">Pixel 9A</a>, but <a href="https://clicksphone.com/communicator">you can reserve one now</a> for a limited time to get a discount.</p><p>As TCL and Hisense have done, LG is looking to usurp the dominance of Samsung’s The Frame in the art TV category. Its new LG Gallery TV leverages the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.lg.com/global/newsroom/lg-story/beyond-news/how-true-wireless-and-lg-gallery-transform-the-tv-into-a-digital-art-masterpiece/" rel="sponsored">company’s Gallery+ service</a> that launched earlier this year to display everything from art to gaming scenes. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with what is likely a matte coating, but LG describes it as having a “specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience.” It comes with a white frame, and while you can purchase additional wood-colored frames, pricing for the LG Gallery TV hasn’t been announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854082/lg-cloid-home-robot-fold-laundry-ces">LG’s CLOiD</a> is a home robot that can potentially do more than just clean your floors. The robot features a pair of articulated arms with seven degrees of motion mounted to a mobile base with a torso that can tilt and bend. LG says CLOiD can perform household tasks like folding and stacking laundry, putting food in the oven, or fetching something from your fridge. Can it do that faster or more reliably than you can? That remains to be seen, but CLOiD could be even more useful as a mobile smart home hub you can converse with as it follows you around the house.</p><p>Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridges aren’t new, but the company will soon be introducing a new feature for added convenience: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853758/shut-the-fridge-door">voice-activated door opening and closing</a>. When your hands are full of groceries, or are dirty while you’re whipping up a meal, you’ll be able to ask Bixby to “Shut the fridge door,” or “Open the door,” and it will open over 90 degrees giving you full access. If your mouth is full of food and you can’t properly articulate what you want, the door can also be opened or closed using a tap of your palm or the back of your hand.</p><p>If you pulled a <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em> on the Las Vegas Sphere, you’d end up with something like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853234/switchbot-obboto-ai-globe-desk-light-ces-2026">SwitchBot’s new dome-shaped Obboto RGB desk lamp</a>. It’s wrapped in over 2,900 color-changing LEDs and can display preset animations, animated GIFs, AI-powered “mood animations,” music visualizers, or just the local weather and time if you want to be practical. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced yet.</p><p>Petkit’s new automatic pet feeder that can dole out up to seven days of wet food isn’t just about alleviating guilt about leaving your furry friend behind while you travel. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/850992/petkit-ai-camera-yumshare-daily-feast-automatic-wet-food-feeder-eversweet-ultra-fountain">Yumshare Daily Feast</a> uses an NFC tracking system to remove meals that haven’t been eaten in 48 hours and UVC lighting to sanitize the system for delivering fresh ones. What’s potentially even more useful is an AI-powered 1080p night vision camera that tracks when and how much your pet eats to provide insights on their diet and possible health issues. It’s expected to launch in April 2026 and will be sold through pet food companies.</p><p>Six years after its first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14155650/lg-oled-4k-tv-w-ces-2017-specs-release-date">Wallpaper TV debuted in 2017</a>, LG has revived the line with its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853886/lgs-wallpaper-oled-tv-returns-to-ces-and-its-wafer-thin">LG OLED evo W6</a>. The TV is 9mm thick thanks to its redesigned internal architecture and features a new mount so it can sit completely flush against a wall. Further improving installation is the W6’s use of LG’s Zero Connect Box which wireless sends a video signal from up to 33 feet away. The only physical cable you need to route to the W6 is for power. It will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.</p><p>GameSir may have already clinched the title for weirdest controller at CES 2026. The company shared more details about its upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/851259/gamesir-switch-turbo-drive-controller-steering-wheel-wireless-force-feedback">Swift Drive gamepad</a> that features a small steering wheel in the middle of the controller. The wheel’s connected to a high-precision Hall effect encoder and an equally small direct drive motor that provides force feedback effects while playing racing games and sims. There are additional haptic motors located in the gamepad’s Hall effect triggers to simulate effects like ABS braking, and it’s got RGB lighting effects that can be synced to your game. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed yet.</p><p>It’s not quite as adorable as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24325152/yukai-engineering-mirumi-robot-ces">furry Mirumi robot</a> that debuted at last year’s CES, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/849367/yukai-engineering-baby-fufu-robot-fan-kids-cooling-ces-2026">Yukai Engineering’s new Baby FuFu</a> is potentially more practical. It looks like a cuddly cat that’s huffing and puffing and features an internal fan that will keep young kids cool while preventing tiny fingers from reaching any dangerous moving parts. It’s expected to arrive in mid-2026 for $50 to $60.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854159/ces-2026-best-tech-gadgets-smartphones-appliances-robots-tvs-ai-smart-home]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-tuf-27-gaming-monitor-drops-to-all-time-low-to-compete-with-samsung-odyssey-2000656520</link>
            <guid>1397254</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Want to add a new monitor to your technology arsenal? Whether you are a serious gamer or someone looking into serious gaming, a good gaming monitor is a key part of your arsenal. We’ve found one that you can both save a significant amount of money on and also experience some fantastically deep immersion with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">Thanks to Amazon, you can pick up the ASUS TUF Gaming 27” 1440P HDR Monitor for only $179 which is a $70 discount (28% off) compared to the monitors’ normal price of $249.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hardy monitor that’s great for any home office or gaming setup</h2>
<p>The ASUS TUF Gaming 27” 1440P HDR Monitor combines a 27” QHD (2560 x 1440) Fast IPS panel with a super-fast 180Hz refresh rate into a monitor designed to bring a high level of smoothness and clarity to your gaming action. A 1ms gray-to-gray response time along with support for HDR visuals help to ensure your games remain clear even as the action increases. Adaptive sync technology can help eliminate stuttering or tearing while maintaining a smooth frame pace so you don’t have to worry about a sluggish picture.</p>
<p>This monitor also has FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatibility to allow your graphics card to match frame output to the panel’s refresh rate. ASUS’ Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync is a feature that combines with variable refresh rate technology by utilizing backlight strobe to eliminate ghosting while maintaining smooth motion. The result is a clearer picture of fast moving objects, detailed game worlds, and detailed HUD elements when you are panning or tracking around in-game.</p>



<p>The Fast IPS panel used in the monitor can cover 130% of the sRGB color space and support HDR10 content. That means you’ll get brighter highlights, darker shadows, and more vivid colors than a standard SDR monitor. The 2560 x 1440 native resolution also gives more real estate than 1080p.</p>
<p>ASUS also includes GamePlus and GameVisual preset modes, which let you switch between different visual profiles and on-screen overlays optimized for the type of content you are viewing. Using DisplayWidget Center allows you to access and control monitor settings from your computer rather than having to go back and forth switching between on-screen menu options and physically adjusting monitor controls.</p>
<p>When taken together, these specifications combine to make a 27-inch gaming monitor that offers a balance of high-quality QHD resolution, ultra-high refresh rates and helpful customization capabilities at a price that won’t break the bank. So if you’re truly looking for quality that you don’t have to compromise on, this might very well be the monitor you add to your setup. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">At the very least, grab it while it’s discounted because someone in your brood may want it other than you.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> may have surpassed 12m sales at the start of 2026, according to video game industry analysts.</p>
<p>According to Rhys Elliot from Alinea Analytics, the game passed the milestone through PC, Xbox, and PS5 sales combined. Alinea also claims that the 4th January was the game's biggest day in terms of daily active users: roughly 3.2 million players across all platforms.</p>
<p>According to Elliot, the cause of this new peak of daily active users stems from a well-timed sale that coincided with the Christmas holidays, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w">writing on Bluesky</a>: "Daily copies sold started to stabilise by early Dec, but a well-timed 20 percent discount across all platforms - and the holiday boost - reversed that."</p>

<p>Alinea Analytics obviously are not privy to internal data from Embark Studios, but it has made accurate estimates on game sales before. These include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-may-have-already-sold-25m-copies-according-to-industry-analyst">accurately deducing when Arc Raiders passed 2.5m sales</a>, as well as noting when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> passed 7m sales only five days after it launched. So while a grain of salt should be taken with such estimates, there's a history of accuracy here.</p><p>Elliot also highlighted other interesting figures from Alinea Analytics estimates of Arc Raiders, including the fact that over 50 percent of players can be found on Steam. Alinea also claims that by passing 12m sales, the game will have made at least over $350m in revenue.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders indeed appears to be maintaining its strong momentum ever since launching last year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">It was confirmed to be the best-selling game over the holiday period</a>, all while new information keeps creeping out about how the popular extraction shooter works, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">such as its aggressive matchmaking system</a>.</p>

            <p>If you can't resist taking cheeky potshots at your fellow players in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, the shooter's matchmaking can now neatly shuffle you into a session where you're more likely to get a taste of your own medicine. Developers Embark have confirmed that some "aggression-based matchmaking" has been sprinkled into the game's systems as of late, making PvP-prone players a bit more likely to be funnelled towards each other.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Said confirmation comes directly from the mouth of Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund during a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w">Games Beat</a>. "Obviously first it's skill based, of course," the exec said of how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> handles shifting folks where they need to go to start a game. "Then you have solos, duos, and trios. Also since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on...how prone you are to PvP or PvE.</p>
<p>"So, if your preference is to do PvE and have less conflict with players, you'll get matched up [in line] with that [more often]. Obviously, it's not a full science," Söderlund added, before agreeing that it'd be accurate to dub this aggression-based matchmaking.</p>
<p>While the exec was clear this new element is just part of the equation the game turns to when deciding where to shuffle which players, it'll be intriguing to see how folks' willingness to turn their guns on each other being taken into account shapes things going forwards. Söderlund didn't shed any light on how exactly the game measures your PvPness and the exact weight it's given in where you get funnelled - possibly because he was busy playing Arc Raiders as he gave this interview.</p><p>From what he did say, though, it sounds like something simply designed to gently nudge different players towards an experience which mirrors how they play. Whether that's as desirable as filtering by skill level or to shift away folks who show annoying habits like griefing or regularly dropping out of matches at awkward times - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> springs to mind in terms of the latter - is the question.</p>
<p>In the short-term, running into less folks gunning for your head might be ideal if you're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-a-good-shooter-but-its-also-where-i-go-for-a-walk-and-relax">keen to keep things a bit more chill</a>. However, in the long run, maybe it'll dull down some of the unpredictability which helps keep any online game - but especially <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> - feeling fresh. We'll see how things play out.</p>

              <p>Would Microsoft secretly be happier if people stopped buying the Xbox entirely? Would you risk breaking a $2,000 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold to chase a high score? And why was <em>League of Legends</em> unplayable for so many people over the weekend? You’ve stumbled onto another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Welcome to the first full week of 2026, where I am obsessed with the idea that the first act in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might have been even longer. Creative director Igor Sarzyński <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27">explains why that would have been a terrible idea</a>. “It’s like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.” RIP Jackie.</p>

 <h2>Not selling Xboxes must be intentional at this point</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales of Xbox consoles were down 39% in the UK during 2025, making it comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox consoles. With the return of favourite Xbox franchises in 2026, might things improve this year?</p> <p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/2007156688923836635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>The Game Business</em>‘ Chris Dring reports that 2025 was “comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox” console sales in the UK. They were down nearly 40 percent from the year prior, which was already far from stellar. I’m not sure how to square Microsoft’s seemingly complete abdication of hardware sales less than five years into the current generation with its promise to continue making consoles in the future.</p>

 <h2><em>League of Legends</em> was completely unplayable yesterday and the reason is very stupid</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1q4ao9r/per_vandiril_apparently_the_login_issues_were/">According to YouTuber Vandiril</a>, Riot Games forgot to renew the client security certificate for the hit MOBA game. There was a workaround, however. All players had to do to get back into the game was reset their system clock. Maybe it was just the Nexus’ way of telling fans it was time to take a break.</p>

 <h2>Finally, a <em>Flappy Bird</em> made just for folding phones</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone companies: We've tested our hinge mechanism for 200,000 folds, so that should cover 5 years of use</p> <p>Users: <a href="https://t.co/jRzjFWB2Hk">https://t.co/jRzjFWB2Hk</a></p> <p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/2007546884794249262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Foldy Bird</em> requires you to physically fold your super-expensive phone over and over again to keep the bird flying through the familiar <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-style environment. How neat! I still don’t want one.</p>

 <h2>Sega co-founder David Rosen has passed away</h2>   <p>Rosen was integral to the company’s amusement game operation, including the push into coin-operated arcade games like <em>Periscope</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Monaco GP</em>, <a href="https://www.replaymag.com/segas-dave-rosen-passes-on-christmas-day-in-l-a/"><em>RePlay Magazine</em> reports</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> originally began with a cut chapter starring Ashley</h2> <p>That’s according to modder Michael “Thekempy” Kemp who combed the game’s files and restored the lost content. “It would have started with Ashley in the woods at night,” Thekempy explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXI-MrzgZXU?autoplay=1">in a recent video</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-cut-an-entire-opening-chapter-that-starred-ashley"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>). “She stumbles upon Los Illuminados in the middle of performing a ritual sacrifice.”</p>

 <h2>Brandon Sanderson’s <em>Mistborn</em> books could become a video game</h2> <p>The prolific fantasy author said multiple AAA game companies have expressed interest in his latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOe7VV5T-hw">State of Sanderson</a>” video (via <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/mistborn/brandon-sanderson-mistborn-game">PCGamesN</a></em>). “I’m trying to do things differently this time, in order to retain control of my videogame rights,” he told fans. “I already have interest from some major players in the videogame industry, who I like a lot. So, if you are a decision-maker at a triple-A studio or a major independent, and you’ve always wanted to make a <em>Mistborn</em> or <em>Stormlight</em> game, you would want to contact my reps now.” If someone bites, maybe we’ll see the actual game by 2032.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">The 10-year journey to falling back in love with <em>Minecraft</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473">Microsoft wants you to move beyond calling it AI slop</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-racer-revenge-ps4-ps5-port-hacker-limited-run-2000656482">An obscure<em> Star Wars</em> game is more expensive than ever thanks to a rumored PS5 hack</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Buying a new smartphone can be pricey, especially if you’re going with one that’s still relatively new. But with the deal we’ve sourced, you can get one that’s still well worth using without taking out a second mortgage. You’re likely familiar with it if you’re an Android user: the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/">If you’re interested in changing up what you use for your daily driver phone, you can buy the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra on Amazon right now for $1,049</a>. That’s $250 (or 19%) lower than the retail price of $1,299.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A newer smartphone that’s still well worth using</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in a Titanium Silverblue housing that has a massive 6.9″ display, a 5000mAh battery and a built-in S Pen. It also comes with a US 1-year warranty and runs with unlocked Android 15 and One UI 7 out of the box.</p>
<p>Inside, the phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB of RAM to make sure you have enough power to run your apps/games/multitask between them. The 256 GB of internal storage means you have enough room for all of your pictures/videos/downloads without having to constantly clear everything out.</p>
<p>For connectivity, you have Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi and USB, so you can pair your accessories, pay for purchases using contactless payment methods and tether with other devices. Samsung’s One UI 7 sits atop Android 15 and utilizes the hardware specs along with AI tools and Samsung’s services.</p>
<p>The built-in S Pen lets you draw, write, and annotate screenshots and navigate their screen with accuracy, while the Always On Display provides access to important information at a glance at any time. Additionally, the high-resolution 2960 x 1440 resolution provides for clear text and images displayed on-screen and provides a lot of space for working in a multi-tasking mode or viewing high-definition video. The dimensions of the phone are 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches, providing a fairly small frame around the large display.</p>



<p>In terms of the camera capabilities of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung pushes hard on AI features, specifically on low-light and video recording. Samsung developed an AI Night Mode Camera to brighten dark areas and hold onto detail, so when taking a picture at night or indoors, the image does not immediately become blurry/noisy. Audio Eraser is a tool that can reduce background noise in your recorded videos, and there are a suite of other options you can use as well.</p>
<p>The Now Brief feature is intended to provide you with useful information prior to the time you would normally receive notifications for these same items (e.g. reminders/tasks), to help you keep up with everything going on in your life. Additionally, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is capable of rapid charging (and wireless charging), and the device is water-resistant, adding to its durability for everyday use.</p>
<p>If it’s been long past time to pick up a new smartphone,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/"> the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a fantastic choice that you won’t want to miss out on, especially since you can save some serious cash here</a>. Grab it and migrate over.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim states that Fortnite has already begun work on its next anime collaboration, and it’s none other than Chainsaw Man. </p>



<p>Fortnite is known for collaborating with franchises and properties across all media of entertainment. Some of their most popular collaborations have been anime-related, with the game bringing in characters from Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-next-big-anime-collaboration-for-chapter-7-season-1-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bleach</a>, Jujutsu Kaisen, and more to the island across the years. It seems they will build on this foundation with another highly popular anime, Chainsaw Man. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-chainsaw-man-in-the-works">Fortnite x Chainsaw Man in the Works</h2>



<p>The Fortnite x Chainsaw Man collaboration’s claim comes from SamLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/2008156723803254943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter); the leaker had previously accurately revealed the Bleach collaboration. However, no other details were revealed, such as the release window, the included characters, or the mythics. But the players have already started making their character wishlists, with Denji, Makima, Reze, and Power as the top contenders. Some are also praying for Pochita to arrive as a Sidekick in the game. </p>



<p>Epic Games has already gone the OG anime route by bringing in names like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and Bleach, with One Piece being the only one remaining from the big 3. However, they have been targetting more recent anime as well, with Jujutsu Kaisen, Kaiju No. 8 and My Hero Academia along with Chainsaw Man expected to join the lineup soon. </p>







<p>In other news, Chainsaw Man’s director was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chainsaw-man-director-is-working-on-a-new-horror-game-for-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new horror game for Roblox</a> earlier in 2025. Additionally, Shroud has predicted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-arc-raiders-fortnite-hot-take/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders will be ‘bigger</a> than Fortnite’.

Here, players discovered that the various spiderwebs lead to one central web that contained a cryptic direction in its web design: "N" and a symbol for another telegraph pole. Heading north (as directed by "N") leads to another wooden pole which, once found, can be shot at to reveal yet another direction under its bark.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Red Dead Redemption 2 Screenshots Show Off Rockstar's Epic Open-World</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that brings us pretty much up to date, and up to a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T4J8LYqUi0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> published just yesterday which details where the mystery is at now. Currently, players are following one final cryptic telegraph pole message that depicts a final direction, and the symbol for a guitar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where is this all leading? Players are not sure, but the sense is that there's definitely more to this mystery to solve. Players are now hurriedly searching the Fort Wallace location — which holds the nearest guitars to the mystery's most recent clue — and are mapping every other guitar found in the game, in case it sparks some new revelation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this secret having existed for so long, there's little chance that Rockstar itself is teasing anything big or new at the end. (Though, what a way to reveal single-player DLC this would be!) For Red Dead Redemption 2 fans, though, this is an exciting moment — something new to ponder at last in their beloved game, as the wait for news of a re-release or new content stretches on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p dir="ltr">The souls-like genre has exploded in popularity since the dawn of From Software's Souls franchise, with multiple companies taking a stab at the format--and some companies taking multiple stabs. Bandai Namco, who publishes FromSoft's Souls games as well as Elden Ring, dropped an anime-style version of the genre in 2019's Code Vein, and now it's back for more in Code Vein II.</p><p dir="ltr">We spent a few hours with the next Code Vein adventure during The Game Awards week, and we came away impressed with its improved combat system and a new and interesting take on the genre's "summon" mechanic, but what surprised us most was an original story that carries some emotional weight. The original Code Vein was a solid first effort, but Code Vein II shows that the franchise may have, pardon the pun, cracked the code.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629230"></a><figcaption>Code Vein II</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629230-pylon_exploration1.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">A new code</h2><p dir="ltr">Code Vein II takes place in a world on the edge of ruin, and where humans and Revenants, a human-like species of beings with vampiric abilities, live amongst one another. Our demo picks up in the present, as the effects of the Resurgence--a cataclysmic event that slowly morphs Revenants into mindless beasts--are wreaking havoc on the world.</p><p dir="ltr">A century prior, a group of Revenant warriors tried to seal the Resurgence and save the planet, only to fail and bring on another phenomenon that insteads speeds up the process. Those fallen would-be heroes are trapped around the world, and our hero, with the help of a friend with time-traveling powers, must go back into the past, work with those warriors to figure out how to unlock that which traps them in the present, then come back and defeat them once and for all.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a lot to take in, and if you haven't played the original Code Vein before, you might rightfully assume you've missed something. Mercifully, Code Vein II is taking the Final Fantasy storytelling approach, as this is a standalone tale. Those new to Code Vein can jump in without needing background knowledge, which makes taking in all of the information presented easier.</p><p dir="ltr">Jumping into the game starts with creating a character, and the creator in Code Vein II offers a robust slate of choices for us to dig through. Dozens of skin colors, eye colors, hair styles, hair colors, accessories, and more are available right from the start, creating an experience that those with a creative imagination can sink hours into before even starting the game. Characters also have six attributes--strength, dexterity, mind, willpower, vitality, and fortitude--which can be enhanced by finding special perks called Blood Codes throughout the game.</p><p dir="ltr">After character creation, a small tutorial section offers a few brief moments of exploration, including our character meeting up with the time-traveling friend, and a cutscene establishing the story. We then travel via a sweet motorcycle to the time-travel access point, where we travel back in time to the Sunken Pylon dungeon, link with the fallen hero Josee Anjou, and the meat of the demo begins in earnest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629229-formae_fallingsun.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629229" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629229-formae_fallingsun.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629229"></a><figcaption>Falling Sun Formae</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629229-formae_fallingsun.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Form(ae)s of combat</h2><p dir="ltr">Once we're dropped into the dungeon, we are immediately presented with a wealth of combat options. Seven main weapons are provided for us to tinker with while in the dungeon, each with their own abilities and attributes. One-handed Swords served as a sort of baseline, as they acted like a standard sword would in any souls-like. Twin Blades allowed for faster strikes, while Greatswords and Hammers dealt massive damage--sometimes even one-shotting foes--with slower, more deliberate attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">The Bayonet was particularly interesting as the long-range weapon of the group, thanks to its allowing me to craft ammo on the fly whenever an opening presented itself, so long as I had the right materials. The floating Rune Blades looked really cool slashing through the air while I punched foes at the same time, though it quickly became clear that they would take more time to learn than the demo allowed--enemies kept getting between the blades and the character, leaving us open to big attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Each weapon couples with two key components, Formae and Jails, in order to round out your abilities. Formae are weapon-specific abilities, like enhanced attacks, status effects, and more, that can be activated during battle. The Rune Blades, for example, included a Whirling Shredder Formae where the two blades spun like a buzzsaw in front of the character, hitting enemies caught in the circle multiple times.</p><p dir="ltr">Jails, meanwhile, function similarly to Blood Veils in the original Code Vein. Jail attacks are equipped separately from the standard weapons, and are used to drain Ichor from enemies. Ichor is the resource needed to use Formae, so routinely using Jail attacks will keep Formae attacks available for us when needed. Hound was our favorite Jail in the demo, as using it would produce two massive hound heads from either shoulder that would sink their teeth into a nearby enemy, but the massive hand called Ogre and the scythe called Reaper were also fun options.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629232-jos%C3%A9eanjou2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629232" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629232-jos%C3%A9eanjou2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629232"></a><figcaption>Josee Anjou in the past.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629232-jos%C3%A9eanjou2.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Partner up</h2><p dir="ltr">As our character has joined with Rosee Anjou in the past, she becomes the poster child for Code Vein II's new Partner mechanic. As the hero meets with more fallen champions of the past, he can build relationships with them by bringing them into battle. The more frequently a hero is selected, the stronger that bond becomes.</p><p dir="ltr">The strength of the bond is most apparent in Link Points (LP), which are visible just below the playable character's health bar. Link Points serve as additional health, and it depletes before the main health bar is affected, which means that the stronger our bond is with Rosee, the more health we will have as we fight. This is a cool way to reward building relationships with characters, and one that's especially welcome in a genre known for its difficulty like the souls-like.</p><p dir="ltr">You can build your relationship with Rosee in one of two ways: Summon and Assimilation. Summoning Rosee adds her to the battlefield, where she can fight enemies on her own and serve as a distraction when we need to heal up or regain stamina. Assimilation adds Rosee's power to your own, leaving us alone on the battlefield, but greatly enhancing our abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Offering these options is an ingenious way to cater to two different types of souls-like players, those who like summoning help and those who prefer to go it alone, while allowing both the benefits of relationship building. We stuck to Summoning, as we appreciated the distraction Rosee provided during boss fights, but Assimilation is just as valid, as the power boost is certainly worth considering. The Partner system stands out as one of the best new additions to Code Vein II, if only because the development team found a way to include both sides of that "to summon or not to summon" argument.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629233-vsjos%C3%A9e1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629233" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629233-vsjos%C3%A9e1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629233"></a><figcaption>Josee Anjou in the present.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4629233-vsjos%C3%A9e1.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Fixing the future</h2><p dir="ltr">The demo culminated in two massive boss fights, one in the past and one in the present. The boss in the past was called the Metagen Remnant, a spider-like creature with a human face. This was a tough fight, but one made more bearable thanks to having Rosee on the field as a summoned partner. Rosee drawing the Remnant away so we could get a few extra strikes in was a major part of our victory, even with the disgusting toxic green goop the Remnant would shoot onto the floor when we got in close. Just when we think we're avoiding the Remnant's swipes, green goop hits us with a poison effect; that's a souls-like for you.</p><p dir="ltr">After putting the Remnant down, our character says goodbye to Rosee and returns to the present, where the bindings of the now-monstrous Rosee are unlocked and must be vanquished. This fight is <em>much</em> tougher than the Remnant, and not just because of attack patterns or damage; halfway through the battle, Rosee remembers who we are, and begs us to mercifully end her life as her second phase begins.</p><p dir="ltr">Here is where Code Vein II's emotional weight comes into focus. Each time we go back in time to aid a warrior in their battle with the Resurgence, we will have to return to the present and battle against that very same hero--albeit in a more monstrous form. How will they react? What will they say? In Rosee's case, she shows immense grief for what she has become, and thanks our character for sending her into the afterlife as she fades away. The scene leaves us wondering if every hero will be so understanding, as the demo comes to a close.</p><p dir="ltr">With a separate story, a versatile partner system, and a variety of battle options, Code Vein II is shaping up to be a worthy entry in the crowded souls-like arena. The Formae and Jail system allow players to keep their most powerful attacks handy, while multiple weapon options will let them fight through the Resurgence-ruined world how they see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">Code Vein II is set to launch January 30 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

		<p>The end of the world is nigh in Code Vein II, as the calamitous Luna Rapacis progresses and corrupts the Revenants who had, until this point, been able to live in harmony with mankind. But there’s still time to fix this. With a story that’s somewhere between Quantum Leap and X-Men: Days of Future Past, you need to jump back in time to visit and team up with Revenant heroes of a century ago, looking for a way to reawaken them in the present and stop what’s coming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Code Vein 2 Preview –&nbsp;Anime Soulike of Future Past" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FxZSqlaieMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back in 2019, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/code-vein-review/">the original Code Vein</a> brought a whole host of interesting ideas to the Soulslike form, from the ability to jump between character build Blood Codes, to the Partner NPC characters that would fight alongside you throughout. And yes, it came with anime-style graphics too. The Soulslike subgenre already felt pretty full and saturated back in 2019, but now in 2026, it’s bursting at the seams with competition. Bandai Namco’s answer is to take the core of what worked well before, and then bring so, so much more player customisation to the table.</p>


<p>Code Vein II Producer Keita Iizuka explained, “Code Vein belongs to the soulslike genre, but even within the action RPG there are many more genres, for example, exploratory open world games. But there aren’t as clear-cut boundaries as before, I would say. So yes, probably you are right, it’s becoming even more competitive, however because of that, it’s very important for us to really be mindful of our strength. It’s because of their competition that we are more stimulated to create something even better. So that’s something that we have hopefully realised and achieved in this version.”</p>


<p>Take the Partner system in general. It’s still great to have another AI partner there to draw aggro from enemies, dish out some damage of their own, and be ready to revive you with a chunk of their own health should you fall –&nbsp;this Restorative Offering now puts them into a cooldown for a time – but now all of that is optional. This is now branded as Summoning, but you also have the choice to use Assimilation, to absorb you Partner and add their strengths to enhance your powers, stats and abilities. If you found the Partners a touch frustrating to in their behaviours before, then you can sideline them through the whole game now.</p>
<p>Iizuka-san explained, “The reason why we allowed Assimilation is because by just having two characters all the time for every fight, the fighting style became fairly set, so the Partner just takes on a certain role and the player would take a certain role. We wanted to remove that kind of boundary, so that’s why we have created the assimilation mode, to be able to really see the fights from a different angle.</p>
<p>“The emotional arc is an important one. So the characters, you will be able to really spend one-on-one time with them to learn more about their backstories, their emotions, really have very heartfelt conversations. So that’s something that we have really valued.”</p>

<p>You’ll spend time with these characters regardless of how you play. This new world and story sees your protagonist journeying back in time to team up with the Revenant heroes of legend, the Fallen Heroes of the Resurgence, and our hands-on saw us partnering with Josée Anjou back in the day. Battling alongside her through the Sunken City to find a source for the pollution within the Sunken Pylon dungeon that we played. Along the way, there’s various narrative interludes that explore Josée’s character, the relationship she had with her sister and what befell them.</p>
<p>“The preview that you have played focused on Josée’s as her main narrative of her arc,” Iizuka-san said, “but there are other arcs involving other characters, and the scenes that you would be able to experience. With the time travel axis as well, you would be able to go back in time and then meet the characters at different points in their lives, to change the outcome, but also to experience the weight of history as well. So I hope that the players get to enjoy that.”</p>
<p>Putting the narrative focus on a range of characters that aren’t your own is an interesting way to frame the story, especially with the potential to bounce back and forth between time periods, and it also makes sense with just how goofy you can make your custom character. There’s a huge range of visual customisation that lets you fully indulge your more absurdist impulses. Want to wear a top hat with a snowman sticking out the top of it? Well, I certainly did when fiddling with the character creator, and that’s just scratching the surface of what’s possible here.</p>
<div id="attachment_467552"><p id="caption-attachment-467552">Is that a snowman in your hat?</p></div>
<p>“It’s not something that we actively specifically ordered to the developing team […] but the customisation team really took on an active role in coming up with this even further evolved version of the customisation build system,” Iizuka-san told us.&nbsp;“ But something that, as a team, we were very conscious of, is that we wanted to deliver a system that is easy to build, customisable, and that the outcome is always great-looking anime-like characters. So there are many numbers of parts, but always the end result to something that is great. That is something that we want to aspire to create.”</p>
<p>The visual customisation is echoed within the combat builds, again taking the core of the ideas from the original Code Vein and expanding them greatly. The Blood Codes that you apply determine the attributes of your character through six categories, with the equipment and weapons that you then equip putting a burden on these figures, which can lead you to being overburdened and suffer penalties to your play, in turn pushing you to align your choice of weaponry and play style.</p>
<p>Talking about the new possibilities here, Iizuka-san said, “So we have added two new categories into the weapons, as well as two different drain attacks as well, and when it comes to Formae, there are many different varieties that we have added. So by combining them all, there are a lot more that the players could enjoy, so I hope they do.”</p>
<p>You’ll really want to make the most of your Formae abilities (formerly Gifts), the skills that you can use for offence or defence, building up to the Bequeathed Formae as your most powerful ability, summoning a special weapon to your hands to unleash hefty damage. That will require you to have enough Ichor, drawn from enemies by performing Jails (the rebranded Blood Veil) to drain their blood. There’s additional Boosters sprinkled on top for what is a particularly broad and complex system of stats, abilities and synergies for players to find.</p>

<p>It’s this depth of customisation that could end up being Code Vein II’s biggest strength. The Sunken Pylon dungeon felt a little by-the-numbers with its Soulslike structure and fairly samey abandoned, ruined industrial look. There is a more open overworld that can be navigated on a motorcycle, which I didn’t get to play, and I’d be curious to see just how the story handles bouncing between time periods and the character growth. There’s not too long to wait, though, with Code Vein II out later this month.</p>
<p>The opening of 2026 is a busy one for Soulslike fans, and Code Vein II is first in line with a refreshed take on the original’s anime visuals, more extensive character customisation, and a characterful time-travelling tale.</p>

<p>As for why the record has been smashed, Valve almost certainly owes that to the ongoing Steam Winter Sale, which ends today at 10am Pacific and which features huge discounts on a number of popular games (as well as smaller discounts on newer or more evergreen titles).</p><p>Since many of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2025's best-selling games</a> on Steam are live-service titles as well, it's not unreasonable to assume that players are flocking to those games over the holiday period, which is probably why the concurrent in-game player count record has been broken too.</p><p>This news comes after what has been a rather checkered year for Steam, with Valve facing challenges from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Horses </em>developer Santa Ragione</a>, No More Robots' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-more-robots-review-flag-rejection-valve" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b8f68ae-5137-4e39-9011-498f4b4b7c21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Mike Rose</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Cara Cadaver</a> over what appear to be contradictory censorship policies that seem to ignore important context.</p><p>With that said, legendary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rance-series-coming-to-steam" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7bdd01fa-043a-41f0-af9b-a0305684ffa0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">eroge series <em>Rance</em></a><em> </em>is about to make its Steam debut, albeit in what will probably end up being a heavily censored form subsidized with a patch downloadable from its publisher's website.
