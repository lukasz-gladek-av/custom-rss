<p>This literally can't fit on a cartridge</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ac15c7c16a707"><a title="Aerith" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac15c7c16a707/aerith.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has just posted an update on the expected file size for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As we had perhaps expected, it's big, folks. Like, real big. Store listings on the eShop already have some pretty lofty numbers attached to them, but according to Square Enix, these actually aren't accurate.</p>
<p>As stated on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1991431395873530291">X</a>, the file size for the <strong>Standard Edition will be 90GB to 95GB</strong>. Meanwhile, the <strong>Limited Early Purchase Edition and Limited Early Purchase Digital Deluxe Editions will be 93.8GB to 99GB</strong>.</p>

<p>Woof! This means, of course, that the game simply won't fit on a 64GB cartridge for its physical release, and so Square Enix has, like many others, opted for a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>It makes us wonder just how large <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</a> will be alongside the untitled third entry. Is it possible that these three games combined simply won't fit on the Switch 2 without an additional microSD Express Card..?</p>
<p>Needless to say, if you've yet to invest in some extra storage space, now might be the time to do so. We suspect 2026 is going to be packed with some pretty sizeable ports, so you're going to want to have all the spare GBs you can get.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

            <p>The messy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">legal dispute</a> between publishers Krafton and three former lead developers on the game rumbles on. The lawyerly wranglings about Krafton's decision to delay Sub 2's early access, leaving a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">$250 million bonus to developers Unknown Worlds</a> up in the air, then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">fire Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill</a>, are still wrangling.</p>
<p>A pre-trial briefing released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publisher-krafton-allegedly-looked-to-chatgpt-to-figure-out-how-to-not-pay-that-250-million-bonus">earlier this week</a> saw the three leads claim Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han consulted ChatGPT about ways the company could get around paying the much-discussed $250 million bonus, which the leads claim they would have shared with the rest of Unknown Worlds. Krafton subsequently said in a statement to Kotaku that this allegation from the ex-leads was "simply a distraction from their own efforts to destroy evidence". Now, testimony from Chang-han has emerged, in which the exec concedes he did consult ChatGPT about aspects of the Subnautica 2 situation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon learning that Cleveland and McGuire weren't directly involved in Subnautica 2's development, Chang-han said "I started discussing this matter with various teams within the company to find - to figure out what we could do," in testimony spotted by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/after-krafton-denied-its-ceo-consulted-with-chatgpt-on-the-subnautica-2-mess-krafton-ceo-says-he-consulted-with-chatgpt-on-the-subnautica-2-mess/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>The CEO said he chatted to various teams within the company about this, then "searched on ChatGPT to get faster answers to figure out what kind of rights we have", adding that he used it "just like Google search". Lawyers for the former Unknown Worlds leads subsequently brought up a message Chang-han sent to Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park in June, in which he wrote: "Now, ChatGPT [is] start[ing] to answer that it is difficult to cancel the earn-out. If so, this is a contract under which we can only be dragged around."</p><p>Asked why that and another conversation the CEO had with ChatGPT about the situation were subsequently deleted, Chang-han cited concerns about what OpenAI might do with their contents, saying "what I learned is that - from OpenAI, is that if you use certain important information concerning your company, then that type of information can be used by OpenAI for learning purposes."</p>
<p>Basically, the exec's stance is that he was simply using ChatGPT in this scenario in the same way he now uses it "dozens" of times a day when dealing with Krafton's usual business, as he would a regular search engine. Krafton haven't been shy about sharing how much they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-and-inzoi-publishers-announce-voluntary-layoff-program-amid-the-era-of-ai-transformation">generally embracing the use of AI</a> as a business. The question is whether it's really appropriate for a CEO to be turning to an AI chatbot for help with a situation of this gravity.</p>
<p>As we've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">depressingly often</a>, when company heads like Chang-han make bad decisions, lots of people suffer, making it rather terrifying to think that a technology still <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ai-factual-errors-chatgpt-gemini-copilot-b2867620.html">very prone</a> to churning out errors or  inaccuracies could now be relied on as part of that decision making. Meanwhile, the deletions obviously risk adding to the impression that Krafton aren't being transparent about their motivations. If Chang-han <em>is</em> being honest about the reasons for the deletion, it's also interesting to hear the CEO of a company this committed to generative AI as a tool expressing anxiety about what these tools do with our data.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Krafton for comment. In their latest statement on the case in general, the company said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are grateful to the court for its thorough commitment to understanding the facts, and we are confident we have demonstrated our commitment to delivering the best game possible to our fans. We made clear to the court that we were forced to make a change when the former leaders showed little interest in the development of Subnautica 2, which has always been our top priority.</p>
<p>Now, this trial comes down to plaintiffs asking to be restored to jobs they were not doing, said they had no interest in doing, and had previously declined requests that they come back and do those jobs. We look forward to receiving a decision. We have made incredible progress in the past few months, and we are excited to share with all the Subnautica fans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You can almost certainly expect plenty more news to follow as this saga continues to get deeper and deeper into the legal waters.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-get-fooled-by-apple%E2%80%99s-official-charger-anker-20w-charger-costs-6x-less-and-works-just-as-well.1359040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple charges <strong>$19 for its official 20W USB-C charger with no cable included</strong> which makes this 2-pack look absolutely insane in comparison. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">Black Friday bundle on Amazon drops to an all-time low of $11 from the usual $18</a> and includes <strong>two 20W Anker chargers (and two ports on each) plus two 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables</strong>. You’re getting everything you need to fast charge two devices for less than what Apple charges for a single bare charger.</p>
<p>Anker earned its reputation by making products for charging that match or exceed official manufacturer specifications while costing a good deal less. The fact that Apple sells Anker products in their own retail stores tells you everything about the quality and reliability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20W Fast Charging That Matches Apple’s Specs</h2>
<p>The<strong> 20W output provides the fastest charging speed available for the iPhone 15/16/17 series phones</strong> over USB-C Power Delivery. Your phone charges from zero to 50% in about 30 minutes which also happens to be exactly what you get from an Apple-issued charger. The charging speed behaves the same across all supported devices including iPads and even Samsung Galaxy phones, or whatever device utilizes USB-C PD charging. Anker uses the same charging protocols that Apple has put in place, so your device cannot tell any difference between this charger and an official Apple unit.</p>



<p>Each of <strong>these chargers includes both a USB-C and a USB-A port</strong> which work simultaneously for charging up to two devices from a single wall outlet. The dual-port design lets you fast-charge your iPhone via USB-C while topping up your AirPods or Apple Watch via the USB-A port. Both ports remain active at the same time without reducing charging speed on either device, eliminating the frustration of choosing which device charges first.</p>



<p>This compact form factor measures in smaller than Apple’s official charger while it outputs the same amount of power. Anker managed to shrink the size by using more efficient component layout and modern charging circuitry. When stored in bags or pockets, the folding prongs keep the profile slim, flipping out with ease when you need to plug in. It features a black finish that looks professional and fits well with most devices and surroundings.</p>
<p>The Anker <em>MultiProtect</em> safety system offers <strong>overvoltage protection, temperature control, current regulation, and short-circuit prevention</strong>. The safety features continuously monitor charging and automatically shut down in the event of an anomaly. Temperature control prevents overheating in case of long use, thus protecting both the charger and your devices. The overvoltage protection means that your devices never get more power than they can safely handle to avoid voltage spikes that result in battery damage.</p>
<p>The<strong> 18-month warranty is a back-up assurance for Anker’s confidence</strong>, and their customer service responds promptly to issues without requiring proof of receipts for purchases or complicated return processes.</p>
<p>For $11, this Black Friday bundle is less expensive than an individual official Apple charger without any cable. You get certified charging gear from a brand in good enough standing for Apple to sell the products in their own stores, including the same degree of safety and build quality as the official option.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-a-ps5-or-gaming-pc-logitech-g29-racing-wheel-and-pedals-is-now-selling-for-pennies-2000645663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-a-ps5-or-gaming-pc-logitech-g29-racing-wheel-and-pedals-is-now-selling-for-pennies.1359037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Racing games with a controller are like driving with oven mitts on and the <strong>Logitech G29</strong> just<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/"> dropped to its lowest price ever at $229 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from the usual $329</a>. This bundle<strong> includes the wheel and floor pedals</strong> which turns Gran Turismo, Forza, or F1 games from arcade button-mashing into something that feels like piloting a car.</p>
<p>The G29 has been the entry point into sim racing for years because it delivers<strong> force feedback and build quality</strong> that punches way above its price point. You get real resistance through the wheel, actual brake pressure sensitivity and paddle shifters that click with satisfying precision. Playing racing games without a wheel setup is like playing guitar on a keyboard, technically possible but completely missing the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Force Feedback That Means Something</h2>
<p>The G29 uses<strong> dual-motor force feedback to simulate road conditions</strong>, tire grip, and understeer through the wheel itself. You feel the wheels lose traction before you see it on screen, which gives you that split-second warning to correct your line. The helical gearing inside keeps operation smooth and relatively quiet compared to older gear-driven wheels that sounded like angry washing machines. When you clip a curb in Assetto Corsa or hit gravel in Dirt Rally, the wheel kicks back in your hands exactly like it would in a real car.</p>



<p>The <strong>900-degree rotation means you can turn the wheel two and a half times</strong> from lock to lock, just like an actual F1 car. Most racing titles automatically adjust for this range, meaning you get accurate steering ratios that are in line with what professional drivers actually experience. You can catch slides by feeding in opposite lock, make smooth wide turns with hand-over-hand steering, and feel the difference between car types based on their specific steering characteristics. Games with proper wheel support, like iRacing, ACC, or Gran Turismo 7, truly come alive with this level of input fidelity.</p>



<p>The<strong> pedal set includes a clutch pedal for manual transmission fans</strong>, though you can ignore it if you prefer sequential or automatic gearboxes. The brake pedal uses a progressive spring system that requires actual pressure to fully depress and mimicks the resistance you’d feel through a real brake system. This pressure sensitivity means you can trail-brake into corners and modulate braking force with precision instead of treating it like an on-off switch. The gas pedal has lighter resistance for smooth throttle control, which matters enormously when you’re trying to manage traction out of slow corners.</p>
<p>Logitech’s G HUB software provides granular control over force feedback strength, wheel sensitivity and button mapping on PC. You can create different profiles for different games, since each title responds to wheel settings differently. Some games need stronger force feedback to communicate properly, while others work better with subtler forces. The <strong>wheel connects via USB and draws power from your console or PC</strong>, so there’s no separate power brick to manage.</p>
<p>The <strong>G29 works natively with PS5, PS4, PC, and Mac</strong>, though game support varies by platform and title. Most major racing sims and simcades recognize the wheel immediately, without the need for driver installations or complicated configuration. The wheel includes a full complement of PlayStation buttons integrated into the face, so you can navigate menus and access game functions without reaching for a controller.</p>
<p>At $229, this Black Friday price makes the Logitech G29 more accessible than ever for people who’ve been curious about sim racing but couldn’t justify spending $400-plus on a pricey alternative. This hundred-dollar discount brings the entry cost down to where impulse purchases start making sense, especially if you’ve already got a racing game library waiting for proper hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another year in Fortnite is drawing to a close, and a new chapter is on the horizon. Insider Gaming has all the details about when Chapter 7, Season 1 kicks off in the game.</p>



<p>The past year in Fortnite has been full of huge collabs, including the likes of The Simpsons, Star Wars, Godzilla, and Power Rangers, and Chapter 7 is likely to follow in a similar trend with other huge crossovers.</p>



<p>For all the details about the launch of Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1, take a look at the guide below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date">What is The Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big updates. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Chapter 7, Season 1 in Fortnite is due to kick off on Sunday, November 30, as confirmed by Epic Games themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games has begun to tease the new chapter, including a big collab with Quentin Tarantino’s <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1991280378355806501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kill Bill</a>, which is set to be one of the first major collabs of Chapter 7 in Fortnite.</p>



<p>The tease confirmed the release date for Fortnite Chapter 7, which comes the day after the big <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour live event</a>, bringing an end to Chapter 6, which is expected to be followed by downtime soon in the early hours of the morning on November 30 ahead of the season launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-start-time">Do We Know The Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>No official start time for Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 has been announced by Epic Games, nor is it expected that a precise time will be shared due to the maintenance length, but history provides an idea of how long downtime will be.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite’s Zero Hour live event takes place at 2 PM ET on November 29, and server downtime is expected to follow soon after. While it’s unlikely to be immediate, downtime should take place at the usual start time of around 2 AM ET on November 30, and they will be out of action for a while.</p>







<p>In 2024, downtime before the launch of Chapter 6 was seven hours, but a year earlier, the Big Bang event was followed by 11 hours of downtime—with the longer spell likely due to the variety of new modes that were launched, including LEGO Fortnite and Fortnite Festival.</p>



<p>In 2022, end-of-chapter downtime was 9 hours, while 2021 downtime was a staggering 18 hours. However, nothing compares to The End event in October 2019, which was followed by 36 hours of downtime.</p>



<p>Based on this, don’t expect Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 to be live until 9 AM ET at the very earliest, and the wait could be many hours longer. As usual, social media is the best place to keep track.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos guards its pricing religiously throughout the year and refuses to discount even when competitors slash their prices for random sales events. Black Friday on Amazon is<strong> the only time Sonos loosens its grip on retail prices</strong>, and the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">Beam (second gen) soundbar just dropped to a new record low of $349, down from its usual $499</a>. Only 16 units remain in stock for the black color at the time of writing, which tells you how quickly people are grabbing this deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos in a Compact Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>Beam soundbar packs Dolby Atmos processing into a soundbar that measures just 25.6 inches wide</strong>, which means it fits under most TVs without dominating your entertainment center. Atmos creates a three-dimensional sound effect that places audio above, around, and beside you instead of just firing sound from the front. The soundbar uses psychoacoustic processing to bounce sound off your ceiling and walls and creates the impression of height channels without installing speakers overhead. Explosions in action movies feel like they’re happening above you, rain sounds fall from the ceiling, and helicopters pass convincingly overhead.</p>



<p>Sonos engineered the Beam soundbar with <strong>dedicated drivers for different frequency ranges</strong> including a center tweeter that’s specifically responsible for crystal-clear dialogue reproduction. The clarity of the dialogue is enormously important in modern content, where mumbling actors and aggressive sound mixing often bury conversations under music and effects. The bass response is full of lively low-end that doesn’t require a separate subwoofer, although Sonos does let you add their Sub if you want room-shaking bass when watching movies or listening to music.</p>



<p><strong>Setup, from unboxing to content with better audio, takes about five minutes</strong>. You connect one HDMI cable from the soundbar to your TV’s eARC or ARC port, plug in the power cable, and the Sonos app will walk you through the rest. Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to analyze your room’s acoustics and then auto-adjusts the soundbar’s output to compensate for room size, furniture placement, and wall materials.</p>
<p>The Beam soundbar streams music, podcasts, radio, and audiobooks from just about every major service when your TV is off. You can use it as a dedicated music speaker throughout the day, then seamlessly switch to TV audio in the evening. AirPlay 2 support allows for direct streaming from an Apple device, while the Sonos app provides access to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, and dozens of other services. For voice control, you can use Alexa or Google Assistant built directly into the soundbar, adjusting volume, changing inputs, or controlling playback with ease and without the touch of a remote.</p>
<p>Because of HDMI-CEC, <strong>your TV remote controls the Beam soundbars’s volume automatically</strong> and saves you from having to juggle multiple remotes or programming universal controllers. The soundbar responds immediately to the volume buttons on your existing remote after you set it up, which makes the whole system feel integrated rather than cobbled together.</p>
<p>At $349, the latest Beam soundbar is $150 off its usual price and undercuts a number of competing soundbars that offer similar features but notably worse sound quality. Sonos rarely discounts its products because they’re worth their full value based on performance alone, but this Black Friday deal is a real doozy.</p>

              <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s partnership with Disney has brought it some extraordinary crossover events, not least <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142">the current chapter’s enormous&nbsp;<em>Simpsons</em> tie-in</a>. But you haven’t seen anything yet: After Chapter 6 reaches its big finale at the end of this month, Chapter 7 is going to introduce the most unlikely property yet: Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Kill Bill</em>. In fact, it seems like it might be going far further than that, filling in a gap in the legendary movie’s lore by recreating a lost scripted chapter, Yuki’s Revenge, that was never shot for the film. This is all right in time to promote the cinematic re-release of both movies in one, the four hour and 41 minute <a href="https://kotaku.com/kill-bill-whole-bloody-affair-return-theaters-december-4-hour-tarantino-2000631123"><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em></a>.</p> <p>Yuki’s Revenge was a chapter written in the original script for <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em>, but was never shot for the movie. It was originally going to be Chapter 5 (I know, it’s confusing, both&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Kill Bill </em>use chapters), and <a href="https://kill-bill.livejournal.com/357796.html">you can read the original script here</a>. The scene would have starred Gogo Yubari’s sister, Yuki, who went entirely unmentioned in the released movie, and was originally going to hunt down The Bride to avenge her sister’s death. Well, now, as improbable as this feels to type, it seems the events could finally play out in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>?</p>

 <p>Chapter 7’s first promotional poster (above) has a picture of <em>Kill Bill</em> characters Gogo Yubari and The Bride, accompanied by a shades-wearing Fishstick, along with the words “The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge” before “Fortnite After Dark.” An <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRQXUuwgZjX/">official Instagram post</a> says the same, but this time has Yubari and Peely, because we officially live in the weirdest timeline.</p>   <p>Tarantino and The Bride actor Uma Thurman showed up to an event last night which <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15308673/Uma-Thurman-Kill-Bill-T-shirt-reunites-Quentin-Tarantino.html"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> confusingly describes as “the premiere” of <em>The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge</em>, and the pair were photographed in front of a huge <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>banner promoting the Chapter 7, alongside a model of the movie’s Pussy Wagon. Although exactly what this event really was is peculiarly unclear, with outlets like <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> and&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em> not even having articles about it. Have they filmed the scene? Will it be part of the new seven minute animated sequence that’s being added to the theatrical release of the movie double-bill? It’s all bewildering.

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quentin Tarantino poses by the "P*ssy Wagon" at the "Fortnite Chapter 7" event in LA. <a href="https://t.co/reOwxBjUqH">pic.twitter.com/reOwxBjUqH</a></p> <p>— Variety (@Variety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1991302219904479362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Whether this recreation of the missing chapter will be a storyline event within the game, or some sort of live event taking place on the in-game big screens, is also unknown at this point. What seems fairly certain is that Chapter 7 will feature <em>Kill Bill</em> skins and characters, and we can only assume lots of long swords.</p> <p>However, it also seems The Bride will be showing up sooner than that, as part of Chapter 6’s big finale live event. A new trailer shows her arriving on her motorbike admidst the ludicrous confusion of King Kong, Godzilla, <em>Star Wars</em> X-Wings, and a mostly naked Homer Simpson throwing a giant donut. <em>Fortnite</em>, everyone! That’s all taking place November 29, 2 p.m. ET.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is currently enjoying a The Simpsons' themed season, with Homer, Marge and co all creating havoc on the streets of Springfield. Even the holier-than-thou Ned Flanders has been seen getting in on the action.</p>
<p>And now, a leak for the latest season has shown off a reported new skin for Homer Jay, and it looks like the Simpson patriarch will be getting his nips out. Should this be the case, it will be the first time nipples have appeared in Epic's shooter.</p>

<p>For a bit of context, the lack of Fortnite nipples on its shirtless characters famously began after a Travis Scott concert was held in-game, with the <a href="https://x.com/Fresh/status/1252792137143312384">singer sporting some very smooth pecs</a>. "We watched Travis Scott's Fortnite concert again and my son was like 'what the... where are his nipples?!?!' Lmaooo. I took a look and apparently Travis ain't got any nips," <a href="https://x.com/saturnsmercy6/status/1253698878265753600">reads one of many posts from that time</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Homer, who to be fair is a cartoon so perhaps this makes the inclusion of nipples easier. The images and video (see below) of the leak show Homer in his underwear. According to leaker <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette">@DrCacahuette</a>, the set "will have skin, lego style, back bling, pickaxe". All I can say is, you go Homer! #freethenipple</p>
<p>So, are you looking forward to running about Fortnite as a topless Homer should these leaks be accurate?</p>

<p>As Connor reported earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">Fortnite saw a surge of players with the new Simpsons' themed season</a>. According to Epic Games, this surge hadn't been seen since the last holiday season.</p>

            <p>Today's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> patch has brought a lot of bug fixes, balance adjustments, and an overwhelming wave of displayable ducks for collectors out there. It's also taken down a titan, a weapon so strong in close-quarters it was dominating firefights.</p>
<p>What am I quacking on about? Well, after one collector of rubber ducks made a plea for the developers to allow them to show off their horde of little yellow guys in-game, it seems like Embark has taken the request to heart. Now, in your Raider Den, a massive number of rubber ducks will be displayed around the room.</p>
<p><a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/duck-update-patch-notes-1-3-0">In the official patch notes</a>, this is simply explained with: "Your Raider Den has been ducked out." The limits of how far this goes, and the requirements to achieve this unique look to your personal room, remains unclear as of writing. It is, however, quite funny.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for the massive nerf this patch, the Venator has been knocked down a peg or two, hopefully removing it from its peak as a close range monster. The patch blog includes the following explanation: "The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We're re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter."</p><p>As for some of those smaller - but still important - balance adjustments there's been a lot of love given to the new map Stella Montis. Two spawn locations have been removed as they were too close to Arc enemies, and various collision issues have been fixed. The new Arc Shredder has been fixed so lure grenades work on them, and their navigation abilities have been improved, so good luck with that.</p>
<p>There are additional changes made which can be read in the full patch notes, but all in all it's a hefty and healthy patch that further improves the game. A game that,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"> aside from foundational issues you may have</a>, continues to truck along in a solid state. One wonders what surprises lie in store for Arc Raiders players as we near December.</p>

<p>Speaking via social media, the team stated that the delay would "help us polish the game further and bring it closer to the vision we want to deliver". Though a specific date has not been specified, we can currently expect to see it launch in March 2026.</p>

<p>After revisiting our timeline, we can now confirm that OPUS: Prism Peak is planned for release in March 2026. Thank you so much for your continued support.</p>
<p>We’re truly sorry for the delay. We know this isn’t the news you were hoping for.</p>
<p>But we believe this extra time will help us polish the game further and bring it closer to the vision we want to deliver.</p>
<p>Everyone at SIGONO is giving their best, and we’re committed to bringing OPUS: Prism Peak to you in its strongest form when it arrives in March 2026.</p>

<p>We covered OPUS: Prism Peak with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/opus-prism-peak-will-capture-your-heart-with-new-teaser">teaser trailer</a> all the way back in 2023, so it's safe to say that this game has been in the public eye for quite some time. Here's hoping it will satisfy fans of the series when it eventually launches in 2026.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new GeForce Hotfix display driver, version 581.94. This is based on the latest GeForce Game Ready driver, version 581.80, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched around two weeks ago</a> with day-one optimizations for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Europa Universalis V, and Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<p>Following that Game Ready driver, users reported lower performance in some PC games after updating to Windows 11 October 2025 KB5066835 [5561605]. This GeForce hotfix driver resolves the issue, so if you've experienced that, you should download it right away. Otherwise, the fix will be rolled into the next Game Ready driver, anyway.</p>

Now, a year on, Windows on Arm is a lot more ready for gaming, thanks to emulator improvements, driver updates, a new Snapdragon Control Panel, and Qualcomm’s work on anti-cheat compatibility.</p><p>Qualcomm is releasing its <a href="https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/catalog/item/SnapdragonControlPanel">Snapdragon Control Panel</a> this week, which automatically detects games you’ve installed on a Snapdragon X Elite laptop and then optimizes them. It’s very similar to the apps that AMD and Nvidia use for their own GPUs, with settings for frame rate caps, anti-aliasing, texture filtering, and much more.</p><p>The Snapdragon Control Panel also allows you to install the latest Adreno GPU drivers, which are optimized for the latest games to improve stability and performance. Qualcomm says it has made fixes and improvements for more than 100 games since launch last year, with continued bug fixes for stability and performance.</p><p>Alongside the Snapdragon Control Panel release, both Microsoft and Qualcomm have also made some significant changes to help PC gaming on Windows on Arm. Microsoft’s Prism emulator now supports x86 Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX), which are required by many games and creative apps. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon X2 Elite chips also support AVX2 emulation, and existing Snapdragon X series devices “will also receive the update in coming weeks.”</p><p>Microsoft has also updated its Xbox app on Windows on Arm recently to add the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/758828/microsoft-windows-on-arm-xbox-app-download-feature">ability to download ARM64 compatible games</a>. When Copilot Plus PCs launched last year, the Xbox app was simply a portal to Xbox Cloud Gaming. It didn’t have library or store options, so you couldn’t use it to install games from PC Game Pass. That’s all changed now.</p><p>Qualcomm has also been working with Epic Games to get <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite"><em>Fortnite </em>running on Windows on Arm</a>, with full kernel-level anti-cheat support. You’ll need the latest Adreno GPU driver to get <em>Fortnite </em>running, and <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/11/windows-on-snapdragon-performance-boosts">Qualcomm says</a> it’s also working with other anti-cheat providers like Tencent’s Anti-Cheat Expert, Roblox’s Hyperion, Denuvo, InProtect GameGuard, Uncheater, and BattleEye to enable more multiplayer games on Windows on Arm.</p><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s arrival on Windows on Arm comes just as the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821177/fortnite-xbox-on-pc-app-store-epic-games-play-anywhere-crew-game-pass">debuts on the Xbox PC store</a>. It’s the first time Epic Games has released <em>Fortnite </em>on another PC store or launcher, and it’s part of a deal to bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">Fortnite Crew to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a>.</p></div><p>All of these improvements are a much better start for gaming on Windows on Arm than the launch last year, but performance and compatibility is still far from perfect. You can check to see if your favorite game runs natively, via emulation, or not at all <a href="https://www.worksonwoa.com/en/games/">right here</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/824783/windows-on-arm-snapdragon-control-panel-gaming-driver-compatibility-improvements]]></content:encoded>

Although he puts his all into communicating his work – which is perhaps evident in the lengthy Direct presentations for the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> – he nevertheless refrains from "trying to promote myself":</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adojvxpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I think I've always wanted to live an unassuming life. I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. Becoming a laughing stock on the internet would be problematic. That's why I frequently turn down requests for interviews. I think it's best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems reasonable to us! In addition to his games, Sakurai is also well-known for his work on YouTube. With the 'Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games' channel, he offloads a heap of information about the process of game development for would-be creators. His work proved such a success that he was even listed as a recipient of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/masahiro-sakurai-receives-award-from-japanese-government">Cultural Affairs' annual Art Encouragement Prize for New Artists</a> over in Japan.</p>
<p>Kirby Air Riders, meanwhile, is out now for the Switch 2. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">8/10 review</a>, we said that it's a "chaotic and frenzied racer", but one that's also "got depth for those who wish to learn".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-strikes-back-at-unknown-worlds-founder-sharing-files-with-racist-views-on-korea.1358971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The fight between Krafton, the Korean company behind games like TERA, PUBG, and inZOI, and the founders of Unknown Worlds Entertainment (developers of Subnautica) continues even outside of court.</p>



<p>This morning, Krafton shared two files with the press. One of them is the sworn testimony of Unknown Worlds founder Chris Cleveland in the Delaware court, and the other is a document written by Cleveland as 'litigation help' while he prepared for the legal battle. Cleveland himself submitted the document into evidence, and now Krafton has underlined that several of his comments demonstrated racist views toward Korea and its people, as well as the unwavering conviction that the Korean developer would ultimately be seen as the 'villain' of this story. Here are a few excerpts:</p>



<p><em>Korea - they are the Joe Pesci of countries. Charming until they're incredible nasty. It goes to 11 quickly. No filter.</em></p>



<p><em>It can be emotionally draining dealing with this, especially as male westerners. [<span>Korean, seems to be implied</span>] Males might be more problem-solvers and bring less emotion - they're biological reasons for this. Making games is about problem solving.</em></p>



<p><em>Korea has been surrounded by enemies who want to kill them. They are fighters. It's small and nasty. Every year some big film star commits suicide because of sex, drugs, or something, hounded by press.</em></p>



<p><em>Delaware will say this is a bunch of sadistic Korean assholes (like Samsung - John Pleasance). They've cast as out as villains and it's done.</em></p>



<p><em>Delaware? Oh, they're fucked. You don't even need a Korean lawyer. History will remember that Krafton was bad. Even the Reddit crowd hates them because of Dark and Darker.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re playing the house’s money and we’re the home team. We don’t need to worry about these guys or our reputation. History will remember that Krafton was bad.</em></p>



<p>In the testimony, Cleveland admitted to saying last year that Unknown Worlds was no longer a place he really wanted to work at, and also that he was 'semi-retired' and only working on the Subnautica movie in some capacity. For their part, Krafton noted that he is now instead looking at being reinstated, and Cleveland replied that he is 'fired up now'.</p>



<p>It all started on July 2, when Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the original Unknown Worlds studio leadership</a> (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire). The fired founders <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed the company purposely delayed Subnautica 2 to avoid paying them a $250 million bonus</a>, but the South Korean developer eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that it was them who wanted to rush an unfinished version of the game out to get the payment, after neglecting their duties.</p>



<p>Since then, accusations have flown left and right. Just two days ago, it came to light that Krafton CEO Changham Kim <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had asked ChatGPT</a> if there was some way to avoid paying the three their big bonus. This came just days after the South Korean developer announced its shift toward being an 'AI-first company'.</p>



<p>Today's is likely to be one of many chapters in this controversial story. Stay tuned as we continue to cover it. For the record, Krafton did share a tidbit today about Subnautica 2's ongoing development:</p>



<p><em>We have made incredible progress in the past few months, and we are excited to share with all the Subnautica fans.</em></p>

            <p>The latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> patch has come with a handful of fixes for the sci-fi FPS, including substantial adjustments to various camo challenges proving troublesome for the cosmetically-minded player base. This includes a few weapon camos in Zombies, which were three-times-harder to unlock than intended.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes">As explained on the official patch notes</a>, these troublemakers were some<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-zombies-camo-challenges"> Zombie camos</a>, though the specific weapons / camos aren't listed. There were other cosmetics made easier to collect across different modes. Zombies mutilate challenges were bugged too, which has now been fixed.</p>
<p>The XR-3 ION had its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges">multiplayer camo</a> requirements shifted to headshots rather than one-shot-kills, as the burst fire was making things a little hard. So all in all, if you're in the midst of the intense camo grind in Black Ops 7, some of its rougher edges have been smoothed out.</p>

<p>Crashing issues across all game modes have been addressed, which should hopefully improve overall stability. Especially given the amount of losable progress during endgame campaign runs, crashes have proven exceptionally frustrating to a slice of the playerbase in recent days.</p><p>In fact, one bug that would force boot some players from Endgame campaign matches if certain extraction conditions were met has also been fixed, another much-needed addition to the patch which will improve what is currently one of Black Ops 7's most daunting grinds.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has proven to be a lot of fun among those engulfed in its fast-paced action, but how popular it is remains a bit of a mystery. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">It seems to have underperformed compared to prior games, but accurate stats are hard to find</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-wake-of-battlefield-6-and-arc-radiers-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffered-a-much-smaller-launch-than-previous-cod-games">Activision has stated its pleasure at the game's reception in a public statement, hoping to reassure fans</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Black Ops 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's review</a> covers the whole package. In it, reviewer Jeremy Peel remarks: "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>

            <p>The brilliant Dispatch has reached another well deserved milestone.</p>
<p>The episodic superhero workplace comedy has now managed to move 2m copies. While developer AdHoc has <em>technically</em> celebrated the number of "players", the game is not available on any subscription service, so I would say this number also equates to sales.</p>

<p>Sharing the figure on social media, the studio wrote: "We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the two million players that have joined us so far.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't be here without you."</p>
<p>The team accompanied the post with an image of Robert's chonky dog, Beef, which you can see below. He is such a good boy (I have many Beef screenshots saved on my PlayStation). </p>
<p>Needless to say, I <em>loved </em>my time with Dispatch, so I am thrilled to see the game having such success. I am going to replay the last couple of chapters, though, because there is one bit of my ending I am not too happy about… but I won't spoil anything here (Bertie and Connor have been getting an earful, though).</p>

			<p>If we rated things based solely on looks, the Gioteck WX5+ would immediately score top marks. This wireless controller for Switch, Switch 2 and PC boasts Hall Effect sticks and triggers and a pair of pro back buttons, but it’s the visual design that immediately grabs you. The delightful ‘Crayons’ livery is tied to RGB lighting, making this one of the most visually appealing controllers we’ve seen in a very long time.</p>
<p>At £24.99, Gioteck has also made one of the cheapest wireless controllers out there, especially considering all the features that Gioteck have crammed in. In terms of value, you’re simply not getting Hall Effect, programmable back buttons, RGB, a 3.5mm headphone socket, gyro and vibration anywhere else at this price point.</p>
<p>That budget pricing isn’t even immediately obvious when you pick it up. It is quite light in the hand, but the plastic that’s been used feels solid, and the textured grips help to keep it set in place.</p>



<p>While the Crayons livery is my personal favourite – who doesn’t want their controller to look like melted cake? – the other options are equally eye-catching, especially the 60s-flavoured Spiral and the multi-coloured mess of Doodle. If you’re a more serious type – or a teenage boy – there’s Dark Camo which is much more understated. There’s probably more chance of losing it, though.</p>

<p>Each of the analogue sticks houses colourful RGB rings as well, but it’s the performance of these Hall Effect sticks that’s most impactful. They’re pleasingly taut, returning to centre with a reassuring certainty, and they feel excellent in use. The Hall Effect tech should also mean that they are exceedingly long-lasting, outperforming standard potentiometer-equipped controllers that are more likely to suffer from stick drift.</p>

<p>The triggers are also Hall Effect, meaning that they’re a touch more accurate, while also benefiting from the frictionless tech. You can also switch them between analogue and digital performance, potentially cutting out a few more milliseconds of reaction time when playing shooters and other competitive titles, even without physical lockouts, which are ultimately the only thing the WX5+ is really missing. If you’re playing on Switch or Switch 2, the whole analogue trigger thing will be lost on you, but in a multi-platform house it’s a nice thing to have.</p>
<p>The only component that I’m not entirely sold on here is the cross-shaped D-pad. It feels too large under your thumb, and the left and right response feels slightly different. It didn’t cause any problems while playing, but there’s something about it that doesn’t feel as well-made as the rest of the WX5+. The other face buttons, and the shoulder buttons too, are reliable and responsive, and it’s just a bit odd that the D-pad feels as different as it does.</p>

<p>Around the back of the controller, there’s two programmable ‘pro’ buttons. These sit well under your middle fingers when you’re naturally gripping the controller, but with enough resistance to ensure you don’t accidentally activate them when you’re getting increasingly frustrated with purple shells ruining your peerless driving in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>The Gioteck WX5+ is practically a no-brainer in a household that’s looking for a great-value second controller, and it even makes a compelling cost-effective argument against the official Switch 2 Pro Controller as a daily driver. In the hand, there is an obvious difference in terms of quality, particularly in the plastics used, but when you’re in the midst of the action, the WX5+ is a deeply reliable performer.</p>

            <p>Ok, yep, it's one of RPS' biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>/Fallout heads, here to tell you about some New Vegas mods that've recently dropped. Why? You might ask that. You're quite right to. It's because there's a general Fallout modathon going on over on Nexus Mods right now, and I've spotted a few works released as part of it so far which I reckon are worth informing you of. Especially since next month's gearing up to be pretty damn New Vegasy, thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">a certain TV series</a>.</p>

<p>The first of these mods which have caught my eye is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94650?tab=description">Cargobots</a>, from modder Outlander3k. As you can see above, it sticks brilliantly to the established New Vegas theme of items being delivered by entities which sometimes run into peril by adding in a quest to unlock a "regional cargobot system". You're working with a Follower of the Apocalypse who seems like they'll be sending you off to scour the wastes for downed New Vegas cousins of the delivery drones which play various roles in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of new weapons to grab, and the reward for completing the quest is a remote which summons a cargobot to fly in a portable box you can store stuff in. It's far from the first time Fallout modders have gotten into providing extra means to conveniently store junk, but it's a nicely fleshed out addition to the base game's Mojave Express drop-offs.</p><p>Also linked to the courier picking up stuff as they roam the wastes is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94643">The Long Road Ahead</a> by QwibQwibMods. It adds in a set of clothing you can upgrade at different stages in your journey to reflect your character's growth and the path they've chosen in the main story. You start off by picking up your old courier clothes at Doc Mitchell's and a "Bullet Scarred Hat" from next to your grave, then find the likes of an old vest and jacket to add to this getup as you make your way to Vegas. There's a set of prototype riot armor and helmet to add to the mix once you get there, and faction trinkets around the Mojave you can use to put a visual spin on the ensemble, with all these upgrades being installed at a workbench. It's like being given the likes of the courier duster as a reward for completing the DLCs, but with a bit more personal choice and uniqueness.</p>
<p>Starting to round out this little rundown are a couple of mods which add in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/92752">extra animations</a>, with one being <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94055">Taunting</a> from Intotherough, which satisfies your craving for emotes by letting you wave at or give a thumbs down to Caesar. Basically, you gesture at any NPC, and they'll react with a quick response or by getting hostile.</p>
<p>In terms of quest mods, this one about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94399?tab=description">Enclave spies</a> looks like it could be fun and there's one about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94431?tab=description">zombie cows</a> that looks plenty zany, though the latter appears to potentially include some some AI-generated voices. Whether that's a dealbreaker if it is the case is your call, but personally I still much prefer mods that are clear they've used either fresh human voice acting, remixed vanilla lines, or just plain text at the moment.</p>
<p>Those are just a few of the works that've gone up so far in this lengthy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon">Fallout modathon</a>, which Nexus Mods are running with different weekly themes all the way up until the end of December. So, worth keeping an eye on for a month and a bit yet to see what else goes up if you're in the modding mood.</p>

<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is set for release on December 1 across pretty much every possible platform, including last-gen consoles and the original Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>The beat ’em up title featuring a host of Marvel characters, including Captain America, Nova, Venom, Spider-Man, and the Silver Surfer, battling against the threat of Annihilus.</p>



<p>15 playable heroes will be available, with the Cosmic Swap tag-team system allowing players to switch between two selected heroes quickly to combine for creative team-ups and devastating moves, all brought to life with retro, full-color pixel art designs.</p>







<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-marvel-cosmic-invasion-start-time">Do We Know The Marvel Cosmic Invasion Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is expected to release across all platforms simultaneously at 8 AM PT on December 1, with no opportunity for players elsewhere in the world to jump in early.</strong></p>



<p>Rather than a staggered global release at midnight local time, the doors open for Marvel Cosmic Invasion simultaneously across the globe, which means a wait until later in the day for some regions of the world, while others can jump in first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Ranked Battle Season 3 will kick off on <strong>27th November</strong> at <strong>6am UTC</strong>, and will be sticking around until <strong>18th December</strong>. Those who reach Rank S or higher in this season can nab themselves a Chesnaughtite which, as you might expect, can be used to evolve Chesnaught into Mega Chesnaught.</p>
<p>What's more, the previous season's Mega Stones will also be up for grabs again this season, with Greninjite being awarded to all those who reach Rank Y and Delphoxite to anyone who hits Rank V. None of these stones are available through normal gameplay, so it's well worth taking part if you're a fan of the Gen VI starters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7ulqjpi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-%E2%80%9Cfree-ride%E2%80%9D-update-launches-today.1358932/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><span><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/2k-games">2K Games</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/hangar-13">Hangar 13</a> are rolling out their major “Free Ride” update for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. Available across all platforms, this free addition to the crime sim prequel is chock full of new features, including a new, more open-ended way to experience one of 2025’s most overlooked video games.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - Free Ride Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHnpuVKyCAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>The titular “Free Ride” mode, will allow players to immerse themselves in the criminal underworld of Sicily’s Valle Dorata as they complete a series of combat, stealth, and racing challenges away from the linear narrative campaign of Mafia: The Old Country. Completing these challenges will earn you Dinari which can then be used to purchase new outfits, weapons, vehicles, and charms that can be used in both Free Ride and the main campaign.</span></p>
<p><span>But that’s not all, other key features from today’s update include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>First-person driving</b><span> for petrolheads who admire the game’s garage of vintage vehicles and dry-by vistas.</span></li>
<li><span>A dedicated </span><b>photo mode </b><span>feature for snapping cinematic in-game moments, character portraits, and gorgeous period environments.</span></li>
<li><b>Classic difficulty </b><span>for made men seeking the ultimate challenge.</span></li>
<li><span>The all-new </span><b>Cinema Siciliano</b><span> mode that transforms Mafia’s visuals into a classic black and white movie, complete with an authentic-sounding audio filter.</span></li>
</ul>


<p><span>Overall, the Free Ride update for Mafia: The Old Country introduces a clever remix of gameplay elements that will certainly help add some longevity to what is the shortest Mafia game in the franchise. And while it doesn’t transform the prequel into a full open-world experience, the new Free Ride game mode will meet some of those Mafia purists half way.</span></p>
<p><span>According to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/take-two-interactive">Take Two Interactive</a>, Mafia: The Old Country has exceeded the company’s expectations and, despite being snubbed by The Game Awards, it has received a generally positive reception from fans and critics. Hopefully, the game’s success will signal the viability of smaller, lower budget AAA games within the market that don’t all have to chase the same open-world or live service formulas.</span></p>

            <p>Ho there, embarrassing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> fans! Not had enough D&amp;D in your life lately? Pining for the Owlbears, is it? Feeling a bit shrivelled for lack of magic missiles? Baby want some Helldusk Armor? Perhaps you will be consoled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a>. It's a Forgotten Realms-themed adaptation of Resolution's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>, a co-op tactical RPG co-created by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> developer Mike Booth, which is itself a homage to tabletop. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>We were keen on Demeo, with Alice Bee and Edders (RPS in peace) hivemindedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/demeos-pc-version-is-a-cool-trpg-hangout-that-probably-wont-get-as-many-players-as-it-deserves">deeming it</a> "a cool TRPG hangout that probably won't get as many players as it deserves". It began life as a homely ole VR game, but has since made the leap to cutting-edge flatworld display technology. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether Alice and Ed's dire predictions were born out, but I imagine the Demeo format will be automatically more interesting to a lot of you for being transplanted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icewind-dale">Icewind Dale</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a> Wood and Cragmaw Castle - these being among the places you'll visit in Battlemarked's two launch campaigns, with more to follow as DLC. 
</p>
<p>The game sees up to four players joining turn-based raids on craggy, grid-based maps full of traps, treasures and pugnacious figurines. Character classes include paladin, sorcerer, ranger and rogue, while enemies range from dire wolves and kobolds to giants. Going by trailers, I'm not sure it'll support the mad knock-on effects you get in the Larian game, but then again, Larian are to spell and ability combos what vultures are to the steaming corpses of recently slain paladins. There's something to be said for a party-gatherer that keeps things relatively clean.
</p><p>I enjoy the game's grabbable vinyl aesthetics, and I like how your thrown D20s physically bounce around the corridors of the map at hand. The question I have is naturally whether it'll stack up well as a solo game: you can command your whole party in skirmish mode if you're short on buds.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Game is amazing. I just like to be different."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Omelet You Cook, a roguelike cooking game on Steam, has been having a great early access it seems. It recently passed 500 player reviews, and every last one of them was positive, making it one of a rare few games on Steam to have 100% positive reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As pointed out to us by developer Dan Schumacher of SchuBox Games, the game received its first negative review today. And sure, negative reviews are just part of the deal when releasing a game on Steam. But what really bothered Schumacher is that according to the text of the review, the reviewer didn't actually dislike the game. They played for 0.8 hours total, 0.2 hours when they posted the review, and wrote the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Game is amazing. I just like to be different."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to the reviewer for further comment ahead of this piece but didn't hear back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The community appears to have sprung to Omelet You Cook's defense, as the game has received almost 40 new positive reviews in the 14 hours since the negative review was posted, and a number of people have commented scolding the negative reviewer for ruining the positive streak just for kicks, though some of those comments are unfortunately far harsher than the negative review itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Seeing this review was very draining for us," said Schumacher to IGN. "We knew 100% wouldn't last forever but it hurt to have the streak ended by someone who in their own words thinks the game is amazing. Emotionally I think I'd feel better if it was someone complaining about bugs, or design choices, or just feeling the game isn't for them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A single negative review is hardly the end of the world for SchuBox Games, but it does make a difference. There are very, very, <em>very</em> few games on Steam with perfectly positive reviews, or at least in meaningful amounts like this. The more you get, the more likely it is someone will have something bad to say. There's a game called Shooters, Ready! on Steam that's only available in Japanese and similarly has over 500 positive reviews and 0 negative ones. But at least using the built in search by user reviews, there don't seem to be any others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Schumacher, having no negative reviews actually did afford him some benefits, too:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having 100% positive reviews was a huge benefit for us because it's extremely abnormal for a game with hundreds of reviews," he told IGN. "People see 100% and become curious enough to read through some of the reviews to understand why it's so beloved or to check out the demo for themselves. We've had multiple people join our Discord or leave their own review and mention that they gave the game a chance because they couldn't believe it was maintaining 100% for so long.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Omelet You Cook Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"...The biggest impact this will have on Omelet You Cook is losing that mystique of a perfect 100%. That led to some opportunities for Omelet You Cook to be mentioned because it was atypical. But honestly for players coming across the Steam page, I don't think 99% vs 100% makes any difference at all. Some users like to filter by negative reviews to understand where the pain points are and I have to appreciate that this negative review frames Omelet You Cook in a very positive light."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's long been known that engagement with games on Steam in the form of Wishlists and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-developers-think-of-steam-reviews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews</a> can be a massive boon, especially for small developers. There are simply too many games, and getting attention on such a crowded storefront is impossible if you don't already have a built-up audience or a lot of advertising money. Having lots of positive reviews and few negative ones gets games like Omelet You Cook visibility when searching under certain filters or ranking systems, <a href="https://steam250.com/hidden_gems" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including third-party ones</a>. That's certainly been the case for Omelet You Cook</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're very fortunate and grateful to have reached 507 positive reviews before our first negative," Schumacher said. "We worked incredibly hard to achieve that with 15 content updates over 5 months. But we also got incredibly lucky and it's nowhere near a flawless game. There's plenty of valid reasons somebody might have a negative experience with the game and we're grateful to all 507 chefs who took the time to write a positive review. Each one helps Omelet You Cook reach a wider audience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <p>Just Cause developer Avalanche has closed its Liverpool studio, following the cancellation of Xbox exclusive Contraband earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-avalanche-studios-closing-uk-studio-in-workforce-restructure-following-cancellation-of-xbox-exclusive-contraband">Avalanche announced it had initiated "a collective consultation process"</a> back in September. It has now moved forward and closed its Liverpool studio, laying off 31 members of staff in the process.</p>

<p>The developer shared an update on its <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">website</a> last night. "The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project," reads the message from Avalanche.</p>
<p>"We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avelanchers through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities."</p>
<p>Contraband - a 1970s co-op open world caper set in the fictional Southeast Asian world of Bayan- <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-avalanche-announces-contraband">was first revealed in June 2021</a>, during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase. "With Contraband, we're taking everything we've learned from 18 years of being in the forefront of open world games as well as bringing the knowledge from running successful live game services focusing on our player communities," Avalanche said at the time.</p>

<p>Contraband was subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-exclusive-contraband-reportedly-cancelled-as-avalanche-states-its-active-development-has-now-stopped">cancelled by Microsoft back in August</a> of this year, with the studio writing in a statement: "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future." The game's cancellation followed on from a string of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">other game and staff cuts across Microsoft's collection of worldwide studios in June</a>. </p>
<p>After these cuts, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft's CEO stated that "Microsoft is thriving"</a> as the company emphasised its focus on AI.</p>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country receives its biggest update since launch today. The 'Free Ride' update introduces many new features and content, including Classic difficulty (which requires careful management of both health and ammunition), new horse and car races, new replayable combat challenges, an optional first-person driving perspective, and a Photo Mode. </p>



<p>Those who'd like to enhance the cinematic flair of their experience in Mafia: The Old Country can now activate Cinema Siciliano, which transforms the game's look into a black-and-white masterpiece inspired by vintage Italian films. Lastly, the Free Ride update also introduces new vehicles, guns, knives, outfits, and charms for players to acquire.</p>

<iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - Free Ride Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHnpuVKyCAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country launched in early August to solid reviews from critics. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review</a>, I rated it 8 out of 10 and called it a fine Sicilian Mafia story:</p>



<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</em></p>



<p>Publisher 2K later boasted of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-sold-over-800k-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's sales</a>, revealing that it has been outperforming expectations. A couple of months ago, one of the main actresses from the game, Carina Conti, let slip that she heard the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-greenlit-mafia-the-old-country-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may have already greenlighted a new game</a>. This remains unconfirmed for the time being, but the parent company has hinted that the new approach of a shorter, more linear cinematic game has been successful, thus suggesting that developer Hangar 13 will continue down this path in the future. </p>



<p>Of course, we'll keep you updated should there be any new leaks or rumors of a sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Peak Evolution monthly redeem codes for November 2025&nbsp;to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Boosts, Potions and more.</p>



<p>Peak Evolution is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dueling-grounds-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> clicker action game with a medieval theme, where players have to defeat various enemies to purchase new characters and upgrade their weapons and abilities. Boasting enemy characters like Pirates and Knights, Peak Evolution is all about gaining coins and EXP points, which can then be used to get better gear, Pets, Evolutions and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<p>There are many worlds that players can explore using their character, and each of these worlds has hordes of enemies to defeat. The main objective of the game is to achieve the strongest warrior form, and this can be done by progressing through the game and by going through multiple rebirths. With daily objectives and seasonal events for players to complete, Peak Evolution can be a fun experience for enthusiasts of the action genre, and with the addition of some free rewards using redeem codes, it’s definitely worth checking out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-peak-evolution-codes">Active Peak Evolution Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>30000likes</strong> – Redeem code for Freebies (NEW)</li>



<li><strong>10000likes</strong> – Redeem code for x1,000 Gems and Boosts</li>



<li><strong>5000likes</strong> – Redeem code for x300 Gems and x3 Double EXP Potions</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-peak-evolution-codes">Expired Peak Evolution Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Roblox Peak Evolution. With the game having only been released recently, none of the codes dropped by the developers have expired yet. When one of the active codes expires, it will promptly be moved to this section of the page. Considering that there are three active codes already, the likelihood of one of them expiring soon is quite high, so players are urged to redeem them as soon as possible, as you don’t want to miss out on free rewards and fall behind the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-peak-evolution-codes">How To Redeem Peak Evolution Codes</h2>



<p>Redeeming Codes in Roblox Peak Evolution is a simple process that doesn’t require too much time or effort from the players. It’s just a matter of inputting one of the active codes listed above into to the correct text box. For newer players of the game who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a step-by-step guide to navigating through the menus and redeeming Peak Evolution codes:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Peak Evolution Codes redemption page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Peak Evolution.</li>



<li>Click the Settings button at the top of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the Codes text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on the Claim button to receive your reward.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-peak-evolution-codes">How To Get More Peak Evolution Codes</h2>



<p>Peak Evolution codes, like most Roblox games, are often released through the game’s official Roblox page or Discord server. However, tracking both of these regularly can be a hassle, which is why we recommend that all players keep this page bookmarked for future reference. We update this page with new and expired codes as soon as they drop, making it the most efficient way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes.&nbsp;</p>
