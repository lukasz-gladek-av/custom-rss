            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deep in an abandoned mine shaft, the still, musty air is filled with the moans of ghosts, clacking of skeletons, and glop-glopping of slime creatures. They’ve been shambling around, unseen, for who knows how long. And quite frankly, it gets boring down there! Do you have what it takes to help them turn eternity into something a little more exciting? That’s the question at the heart of <em>Ghosts Galore</em>, a new board game by Michael Luu! Asmodee USA sent along a copy for me to check out, so ride along for my <em>Ghosts Galore</em> review!</p><h2><strong>What Is </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-game-components.jpg?itok=9YqUjyMR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-game-components.jpg?itok=ob9xnx83 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p><em>Ghosts Galore </em>is a tile-laying board game for two to five players, with an estimated run-time of about twenty minutes. In our play testing, some games (between two players) went even faster than that!</p><p>In <em>Ghosts Galore</em>, you’re here to help those ghosts have a less-boring afterlife, by laying down mine cart track tiles filled with gems and various ghosts. Each type of ghost scores differently, and you’ll want to make clever connections on your tracks to rack up points.</p><p>Comprised of two-sided player boards, a stack of track tiles, a score pad, and mine cart tokens, it’s a quick little game that doesn’t take up much shelf space at all.</p><h2><strong>How Do You Play </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>After creating piles of track tiles, you’ll begin each round by drawing a token and either claiming it for your board or sending it to the general supply. Once there’s only one player left who hasn’t claimed a tile, all of the tiles in the stack are revealed and that player has their choice of the leftovers.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-claiming-tiles.jpg?itok=QQsvNRCj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-claiming-tiles.jpg?itok=H_gECk7S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>Points are awarded for completing tracks (the entire edge of the board is filled with mine shaft doors), with two special doors granting extra points for connecting them.</p><p>But the real point-scoring shindig happens with all the different ghosts on your board. The term “ghost” is a little fluid here, as you’ll find tiles with floating ghosts, werewolves, dragons, bats, and more. Maybe it should have been called Monsters Galore, but points for the <em>Ghosts Galore</em> alliteration.</p><p>These scoring mechanisms all interact with each other in interesting ways, and scores are tallied at the end of the game on a handy score sheet. The skeletons score based on the number of diamonds on your board, each bat scores 5 points if its tile is adjacent to at least one tile with another bat, and dragons score based on the number of dragons on your board (but you get -5 points if you don’t have any dragons).</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-tracks.jpg?itok=GEgh97yk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-tracks.jpg?itok=qwZa2bBq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>This creates an in-depth, interlocking scoring mechanism that encourages thoughtful tile placement and leads to the game feeling deeper than it should for its short run-time.</p><h2><strong>How Does The Gameplay Feel In </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>One of the things I think is most intriguing about the game is that tile selection mechanic I’ve mentioned above in the How to Play section. You can either snatch up that one key piece you need, or hold out to see if something better comes along. This creates a nice little tension you don’t normally see in a game like this.</p><p>One note I have, however, is that - at least in our initial plays, keeping track of how all of the different ghosts scored was a little overwhelming. It ended up being more of a case of us saying “Ehhh… let’s just try to connect tracks, and then see how we score our ghosts afterwards.”</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-ghost-scoring-sheet.jpg?itok=2N627-NP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-ghost-scoring-sheet.jpg?itok=cMYHPj74 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>This is in no way an overly complicated game, mind you, but for those first few plays discerning the scoring of nine different monsters was daunting - just because of how much referencing back to the rules was needed. I’m happy to report, however, that after two or three plays, we had a good sense of what most ghosts did, and gameplay flowed even quicker.</p><h2><em><strong>Ghosts Galore - </strong></em><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Ghosts Galore</em> is a fun, think-y little tile laying game that plays fast once you know what you’re looking for on your tile track. As mentioned above, the complexity of placing the perfect ghosts on your board for the kind of scoring you’re going for could leave players with a bit of analysis paralysis, but I’ve found in our playing of the game that it’s more fun to go with the flow.</p><p>Art-wise, the style in <em>Ghosts Galore</em> may not be everyone’s cup of tea, as it leans into a cutesy, almost chibi-like character design for the ghosts. For players looking for something a little more down to earth (even though we <em>are</em> talking about fantastical creatures here), this design might not quite hit what they’re looking for.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-character-design.jpg?itok=2j8WqX38 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>All in all, if you’re looking for a fun, fast game that encourages thoughtful tile-placement without being too in-the-weeds (especially once you understand how all the ghosts score), <em>Ghosts Galore</em> is definitely worth checking out.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Ghosts Galore<em> used in the creation of this review was provided by Asmodee USA.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>As another teaser, the Blizzard staff featured in the presentation teased a major announcement coming for BlizzCon this September.</p>







<p>Along with the update, the game is now available on Xbox Game Pass and PC on Steam. The announcement of the new class on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2536520/view/490465019074445508?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam </a>came with a note from the development team that they are aware of issues impacting players:</p>



<p>“We are aware of an issue impacting Diablo II: Resurrected Infernal Edition bonus incentives for Diablo IV and World of Warcraft, where some players who purchase on Steam may not see these items unlock immediately. Our team is actively working on a fix, and eligible rewards will automatically unlock once resolved,” the statement reads.</p>

      <p>Multiple developers from Wildlight, maker of the online shooter <em>Highguard</em>, have posted on Linkedin today that they've been laid off, just two weeks after the game's release.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427501095955914752/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sound designers</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427496511334277121/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>gameplay engineers</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427497173774225409/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tech artists</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427500304054693890/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>UI designers</u></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427480816940892161/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>level designers</u></a> are among those affected. While some have only shared their own personal status, two have said in posts that the layoffs impact "most of the team".</p><p>A statement issued by Wildlight says that "a number of our team members" have been let go, while a "core group of developers" works to keep "innovating on and supporting the game". </p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together.

</figure><p>If indeed "most" of the team has been laid off, so soon after release, that doesn't bode well for the future of a game that, despite some weird and very 2026 challenges, by all accounts seemed totally fine.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-release-steam-pc-concord-youtube-shadow-drop/"><div><p>Highguard Is Yet Another Symptom – And Victim – Of A Rapidly Decaying Internet</p><p>In an online ecosystem ruled by cynics, clip farmers, and ragebaiters (and built by those who seek to profit off them), Highguard never stood a chance of having a normal launch</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure><p>This news hits the same week as<a href="https://aftermath.site/2xko-riot-release-console-layoffs/"> <u>news another game (Riot's <em>2XKO</em>) laid off developers just days after release</u></a>, seemingly because of unrealistic expectations from studio leadership. The situation with Wildlight is different, though; the company had self-published <em>Highguard</em>, meaning whatever led to these layoffs, it wasn’t some publisher or giant company demanding numbers go up.&nbsp;</p><p>A free-to-play PVP shooter, <em>Highguard </em>had a strong launch--around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/?ref=aftermath.site#max"><u>100,000</u></a> people were playing on Steam on its first day--but couldn't sustain those numbers, in ways that...look, you know what, why am I even talking about those figures, writers always do that when talking about layoffs like this, is there even much point trying to dissect the numbers of a game that took <em>years </em>to make, but where ‘most’ of the team gets laid off just two weeks after it came out? Loads of people are now reportedly out of a job, and whatever reasons people can offer or accept for it, none of it seems sane or sustainable.&nbsp;</p>

Initially, at least, it resulted in a wave of positive comments from fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">🛠️Attention, Raiders!<br>We've just deployed a new hotfix to address additional reported issues:<br>• Fixed an inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch<br>• Fixed an infinite ammo weapon glitch<br>• Fixed an issue where some quests were missing from the Headwinds update<br>• Fixed an… <a href="https://t.co/xv0k1dIQ1t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xv0k1dIQ1t</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2021602130323227105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Say what you want about embark,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r1zvfy/comment/o4t6g0y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>, “but this was QUICK!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Dude I was literally in firing range, tried it (successfully), went back to Speranza to grab a bobcat and give it a 100 round mag in practice range, and it just stopped working,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r1zvfy/comment/o4t953g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Insane work Embark, I didn't even restart my client.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders has suffered from those looking to take advantage of dupe exploits since its launch in October, and Embark has played whac-a-mole with cheaters and exploiters since. This was the case earlier this week, when the Stockholm-based studio launched <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-pve-focused-event-and-new-rewards-as-embark-squashes-duplication-bug-in-new-update"><u>an update</u></a> fixing the latest dupe glitch only to find reports of a new one cropping up shortly after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an annoyance for players, who are often forced to confront Raiders who have earned their items and in-game currency through illegitimate means, and it’s apparently keeping Embark up at night, too. As players – and even popular streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theburntpeanut/clip/KnottyFineSwallowSaltBae-7izWpIHRKvqiEVO6?filter=clips&amp;range=24hr&amp;sort=time" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheBurntPeanut</u></a> – began showcasing examples of the latest glitches, the developer launched the new hotfix, bringing adjustments just one day after its last patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to fixing the inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch and infinite ammo weapon glitch, the update tackles two bugs related to quests. Embark says it is “dedicated to investigating and squashing exploits” in Arc Raiders and will “keep you in the loop” regarding future issues. The problem is, these issues are already here, with what appears to be hundreds of players already taking to various Arc Raiders social media accounts to share that they’ve been impacted by a new problem.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨BREAKING 🚨 Since today's hotfix to fix the infinite ammo glitch, there are many reports of Raiders losing their loot when they extract.

It’s unclear if this is an ongoing issue or if the lost loot bug is only affecting those who were mid-raid while the hotfix was published. The confusion has been enough to see fans directly ask Embark for their loot to be returned, while others worry a new topside run could result in them losing their gear, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Embark,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r20hlf/since_the_infinite_ammo_hotfix_players_are_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player said</u></a>, “come on guys.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Damn, they fix one thing and break something else entirely,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r20hlf/comment/o4tekrs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>. “Good lookin out!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how the Embark team plans to handle the latest Arc Raiders glitch. For now, at least, it seems some of its community managers are working with fans to determine the cause.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders team can’t catch a break, at least when it comes to cheaters and exploits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment tied a bow on its Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight after showing off how the Warlock class will take over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-ii-resurrected">Diablo 2: Resurrected</a> in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 40-minute presentation came to a close after giving fans a sneak peek at a dungeon’s worth of updates across its three Diablo pillars. Highlights include the reveal that the Warlock is coming to Diablo 4 and Immortal in April and June, respectively, and it’s out for Diablo 2: Resurrected with The Reign of the Warlock DLC right now. While new content definitely stole the show, the Blizzard team still made sure to offer deep dives into some of the quality-of-life updates players have been expecting, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you’re looking to learn more about the Lord of Hatred expansion or revisit a beloved early 2000s action RPG, we’ve gathered all of the highlights from today’s show. You can see everything announced at the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The Warlock Class Is Coming to Diablo 4, Diablo Immortal, and Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players expected the Warlock to come to Diablo 4, but they didn't expect this. In addition to Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred, the Warlock is coming to Diablo Immortal and, yes, even Diablo 2: Resurrected. It's an unexpected update that brings the class to all three of today's games, with the full spotlight detailing how each offers different playstyles for different kinds of action RPG fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Is Summoning the Reign of the Warlock for Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021721334435205162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s 2021 reimagining might be a mostly faithful remake of a classic game, but that doesn’t mean it can’t add to it. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise, Diablo 2: Resurrected is getting a new expansion called Reign of the Warlock – and it’s out today for PC (including Steam), PlayStation, and Xbox for $24.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The content adds the demon-summoning Warlock as an all-new class not present in the original experience. It allows players to summon, bind, and devour demons, shaking up the Diablo 2 formula for the first time in 25 years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Talks Terror Zones in Diablo 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Reign of the Warlock comes a few tweaks to Terror Zones. Specifically, players can now be stalked by hunters called Heralds of Terror when playing on Hell difficulty. Terrorized bosses beaten on the same difficulty mode also now unveil statues, with players encouraged to combine five of them to access new endgame bosses called the Colossal Ancients.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Quality-of-Life Adjustments Add Loot Filers, Advanced Stash Tabs, and More to Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The new quality of life changes in Reign of the Warlock give you sharper tools for even the darkest of journeys. <a href="https://t.co/yOWzcZ9my6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/yOWzcZ9my6</a></p>— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021717067406487856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, time for what most fans expected when they heard Diablo 2: Resurrected would be featured at the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight: quality-of-life changes. Blizzard now allows players to create, share, and check out community loot filters, all without the use of mods. The update also comes with the ability to stack stash items alongside the addition of dedicated tabs for materials, gems, and runes. Finally, The Chronicle is an item tracker for players who like their Diablo experience to be nice and organized.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A First Look at the Warlock in Diablo Immortal</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/diablo-immortal-warlock-1770852504435.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo Immortal Warlock Class. Image courtesy of Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This June, Blizzard is bringing the Warlock to Diablo Immortal. This version of the summoning class utilizes demon skull, a sacrificial blade, and a beast known as the Soulgorger. The Warlock will get her own origin quest explaining her backstory at an unspecified point in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lut Gholein Joins the Warlock in Diablo Immortal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That previously teased location coming to Diablo Immortal is none other than Lut Gholein. Players will find the iconic location has been split between its Common Ward and High Ward districts, with Blizzard explaining that it pulled inspiration from real-world Moroccan cities when bringing it back to life.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Return of the Demon Queen Andariel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo Immortal's next "big bad" is the Maidan of Anguish, Andariel. She's sporting a new look, too, with associate art director Emil Salim describing her as "domineering, equal parts regal, and sadistic," adding that "she's driven by nothing less than a desire for dark godhood."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Diablo Immortal Roadmap Sets Fire to 2026</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/diablo-immortal-roadmap-1770852022171.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo Immortal Roadmap 2026. Image courtesy of Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo Immortal team has big plans for 2026. A roadmap shared during the 30th Anniversary Spotlight showed off just a few of the updates players can expect in the coming months, with some examples including a new battleground event and updates to classic zones. Expect a new subzone, along with new monsters and bounties, every quarter, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yes, the Second Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred Class is the Warlock</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the leaks and rumors weren’t enough to give it away, the Warlock is officially confirmed to join the Paladin when Lord of Hatred launches for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox April 28. Blizzard plans to share more about the new Diablo 4 class during a developer update that’s set to take place March 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lord of Hatred Is More Than Just a Class Expansion</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight gave fans a first look at how Lord of Hatred expands on Diablo 4 with Skovos and its many mountains and temples. Today’s presentation focuses on Temis, the location’s capital city and an area that holds more information about the Askari, the Prime Evils, and the origins of Santuary.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Skill Trees and the Talisman System</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Forge a brand new path through Sanctuary with the all-new skill tree system coming to Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred 🌳 <a href="https://t.co/UBMf4gX5wl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UBMf4gX5wl</a></p>— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021718519596097808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Major changes are coming to Diablo 4, regardless of whether you choose to pick up Lord of Hatred. Referring to a running joke that has seen players calling the game’s skill trees “skill twigs,” associate game director Zaven Haroutunian unveiled a closer look at the skill tree rework launching with the expansion this April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blizzard team says it’s about giving players “meaningful choices and options” from the get-go, calling it a “major disruption to the current class system.” One example shown during the presentation highlights the Sorcerer’s Hydra skill, which players can fine-tune to increase attack speed, launch explosions, and even use frost projectiles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Talisman, meanwhile, is a new itemization system with Lord of Hatred that brings back charms and sets. Footage of the foundational update teases more ways for players to customize their builds to their playstyle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">“They’re going to freak out…”</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Game director Brent Gibson closed out the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight with a tease of what’s to come. In a tongue-in-cheek moment just before the event reached its conclusion, Gibson says, “Oh, my god. They’re going to freak out at BlizzCon when we announce—.” There’s no telling what exactly Diablo fans have to look forward to, but it at least sounds like Blizzard has plans to pull back the curtain when BlizzCon takes place September 12 - 13.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

<p>Unfortunate news coming out of Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>Alex Graner, Senior level designer for Highguard, revealed in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?datePosted=%22past-24h%22&amp;keywords=Wildlight&amp;sid=~Hb">LinkedIn </a>that he, “along with most of the team at Wildlight,” was laid off on February 11.</p>



<p>Notably, he says there was a lot of unreleased content that he and the team had designed for the game, which he was looking forward to sharing with the public.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-bumpy-road-for-highguard">The Bumpy Road for Highguard</h2>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26 and received mostly negative reviews on Steam from the outset. They continued to push forward with updates, including new modes and events, but less than a month later, news broke of massive layoffs.</p>



<p>The game was launched with big hype as the final announcement from the 2025 Game Awards ceremony. However, there was virtual radio silence following that event until the game’s launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-layoffs-becoming-more-common-in-the-gaming-space">Layoffs Becoming More Common in the Gaming Space</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, mass layoffs are becoming a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft recently underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the cancellation of multiple projects, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.</a></p>



<p>Wildgate also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wildgate-developer-moonshot-confirms-layoffs/" id="171549">recently announced</a> layoffs. As did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">Riot Games.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Wildlight for comment. We will update the story as new information becomes available.</p>

The studio also states that a "core group" of team members will continue to support Highguard, though it has not stated how the rollout of its content roadmap will be affected.</p><p>Wildlight's statement reads as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together.

Now, just a few weeks after the game's launch, most of the team has reportedly been laid off. That's according to former Highguard level designer Alex Graner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">who posted on LinkedIn today</a>, stating, "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today."&nbsp;</p><p>In Graner's post, he says this layoff "really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard." If we take his words literally, it sounds like that content might never be released, which would be shocking but not unprecedented in this industry, which has been under constant disruption due to layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Highguard has been climbing a steep hill since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/new-fantasy-shooter-highguard-announced-from-former-titanfall-devs">its reveal as the final "world premiere" at The Game Awards 2025</a> back in December. Its reveal didn't go over well with audiences, likely due to its placement as the closing spot during the awards ceremony and its difficult-to-parse style of FPS. Nonetheless, Wildlight released the game for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller called it a promising contender in his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/highguard/promising-contender">Highguard review</a>.

              <p>Wildlight Entertainment, the studio behind the new not-hero shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a>, has reportedly laid off “most” of its team just weeks after the game launched on January 26.</p> <p>Level designer Alex Graner posted about the news on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427480816940892161/?originTrackingId=%2FqMD4ALWpJvcsmxWmoXMGw%3D%3D">LinkedIn account</a>, saying he’s looking for whatever’s next after he and an unknown number of his fellow employees have been let go. <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>has reached out to Wildlight for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p> <blockquote><p>Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today.</p> <p>This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>However, I’m excited for my next adventure. If your team or anyone you know needs an experienced Level Designer, hit me up!</p></blockquote> <p><em>Highguard&nbsp;</em>was announced in December during the 2025 Game Awards, and it <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">didn’t go over very well with some sides of the internet</a>. Then the team at Wildlight went <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-breaks-radio-silence-and-the-internet-reacts-2000662650">radio silent for weeks</a> until the game finally launched at the end of January and press and content creators <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">got hands-on time</a> with the game. The response to the final game was a bit lukewarm, though Wildlight was quick to respond to feedback about the game’s small 3v3 team compositions by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-surprise-5v5-mode-is-sticking-around-but-its-not-enough-2000665423">adding a 5v5 mode</a> within the first week.</p>

 <p>Though the game seemed to struggle in terms of concurrent players, director and studio head Chad Grenier said in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-wildlight-interactive-interview/"><em>Polygon</em></a> that the team was less concerned with player counts than it was with making something its player base enjoyed. “Whether it gets a thousand people or a hundred million people, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “What matters most is that the game is loved by the people who played it.”</p> <p><strong>Update 2/11/2026, 7:39 p.m. ET</strong>: More and more developers are speaking publicly about the layoffs, reiterating that most of the studio seems to have been impacted.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I was laid off from Wildlight along with most of the staff.

              <p><span>Blizzard is bringing a new class to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><i><span>Diablo II: Resurrected</span></i></a><span> for the first time ever, giving players a new way to make their way through the nearly 26-year-old RPG for the first time in decades with the </span><i><span>Reign of the Warlock </span></i><span>add-on launching today, February 11. It’s a big swing for the remaster, as it toes the line between preserving the original experience and creating something entirely new. The team is aware that some might view it as sacrilegious, so it isn’t making this change lightly.</span></p> <p><span>In a group interview on the Blizzard Irvine campus last month that</span><i><span> Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, game producer Matthew Cederquist and game designer Tim Vasconcellos talked about adding to the legacy of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-dev-folks-deciding-if-theyll-buy-1847702995"><i><span>Diablo II</span></i></a><span> and whether or not the Warlock is the last addition fans can expect. It sounds like the Warlock was one of a handful of classes in discussion, but it wasn’t the only one.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We started with maybe, I don’t know, three or four [classes] that were top of mind,” Cederquist said. “But then we kind of shopped that around to the team, and the team was most excited about two specifically out of those, but then we thought, ‘All right, we’re gonna rock out the Warlock just because the team was so excited about it.’ They’re like, ‘oh yeah, we can make this amazing.’”</span></p> <p><span>While they wouldn’t say what the runner-up class was, Vasconcellos says the Warlock’s summon-based blend of melee and ranged functionality lets it take up some unfilled space in </span><i><span>Diablo II</span></i><span>’s line-up. But still, the team worries about “painting over the Mona Lisa,” so to speak. They wanted to find ways to make the Warlock feel like a natural fit, as if it had always been in the game, and the devil is in the details.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We looked at the warlock and said, ‘Okay, so what would make this feel as if we were coming out of </span><i><span>Diablo I</span></i><span> and this is a class that would have launched with </span><i><span>Diablo 2?’</span></i><span>” Vasconcellos said.&nbsp; So you’ll find references […] Did you notice the </span><i><span>Diablo I</span></i><span> icons in the skill tree? Subtle hints like that try to make it feel familiar, as well as something that’s new still in the game. How it’s expressed and what space do you actually have to develop in that are all things that we’ve tried to consider, and we’re eager to hear from the community of whether or not we actually accomplished our design goal.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Blizzard reiterated during the interviews that the people working on </span><i><span>Diablo II: Resurrected </span></i><span>are longtime players who still play the game to this day and want anything new they bring to the package to be additive, but whether or not the studio keeps doing this will depend on whether or not players take to it. Although the team said they would like for this to not just be a one-off marking the series’ 30th anniversary, they had nothing further to announce at this time.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During today’s Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight event, Blizzard announced the series’ newest class is the Warlock, and it’s coming to Diablo II: Resurrected, Diablo Immortal, and Diablo IV — each game featuring a unique interpretation of the demon-wielding archetype. While the Diablo team is holding back details of the Warlock’s class identity in Diablo IV’s Lord of Hatred expansion and Diablo Immortal, it is bringing the new character to Diablo II: Resurrected today via the new Reign of the Warlock DLC.&nbsp;</p><p>Diablo II’s rendition of the Warlock can summon three demons: the Tainted, the Defiler, and the Goatman. The class can also bind (read: tame) themself to almost any demon in the game, benefiting from its unique abilities. Additionally, the Warlock may choose to devour the bound demon, granting themself temporary buffs based on the consumed demon.&nbsp;</p><h2>Diablo Devs Explain New Warlock Class:</h2><p url="https://youtu.be/83jfLwGcZ8o" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83jfLwGcZ8o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“From the very get-go, it feels like such a natural extension of Diablo to have a character like the Warlock,” associate game director Zaven Haroutunian tells me. “From a narrative perspective, Necromancers [...] are all about maintaining a balance. They’re almost neutral in tone and in how they think. [...] Warlocks, however, are more ostentatious [...] they’re very loud with all the things they do.”</p><p>“Mechanically, they’re actually very different from Necromancers, which are all about building up an army,” Haroutunian continues. “The Warlock doesn’t do that. [...] All the stuff he’s bringing in is disposable. He doesn’t actually care about them. They are just his tools, right?”</p>

<p>When asked how the disparate teams are differentiating the class’s abilities across three games (while still maintaining a unified theme), Haroutunian tells me that each team did whatever it needed to to make the Warlock fit their game. The associate game director likens the process to the creation of Diablo IV’s recent Paladin class and how his team distinguished it from Diablo II’s standard.</p><p>Diablo II: Reign of the Warlock is available now on&nbsp;<a href="http://battle.net/">Battle.net</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/news/2026/02/11/diablos-new-class-is-the-warlock-and-its-coming-to-diablo-ii-resurrected-today]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The dataminers were right, there is a warlock class coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, as part of the The Lord of Hatred expansion that arrives in April. I played it at Blizzard a couple of weeks ago, and although I can't tell you in detail about it yet, I can say it's the dark complement to the light-bringing paladin class that's also in Lord of Hatred - the yin to its yang, if you like.</p>
<p>But there are more reasons to be excited about the warlock. One, it's a brand new class for the Diablo series, meaning the warlock has never appeared in any previous games. But two, and this is the show-stopping bit, it's coming to two other Diablo games as well: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a> Resurrected. To emphasise the show-stopping bit there: this is the first new character class Diablo 2 has had in 25 years, and it's being released today in a paid Reign of the Warlock expansion for the game. It costs $25.</p>
<p>The warlock's arrival in Diablo 2: Resurrected begins a new era for the game whereby it will progress beyond its classic state with additional ongoing development. There will effectively be two instances of the game, one known as Diablo 2: Resurrected, the time-locked classical version of the game, and a second modern version called Reign of the Warlock, which will push the game on. Is that a dangerous road to walk? Yes, but as Blizzard told a group of press I was in, "We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa." I will write more about this in a subsequent article. </p>

<p>Blizzard announced the warlock triple-drop in a Diablo Spotlight video today. The other notable major Diablo 4 announcements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fishing mechanic,</li>
<li>A skill-tree overhaul, which significantly expands what's there by adding new skills and potential for customisation</li>
<li>A new endgame pursuit called War Plans, whereby you can make bespoke lists of activities you want to do, modify them, and earn rewards for carrying them out. To me it seems like an evolution of Adventure Mode - a new pursuit to keep you busy once the game's campaigns are done</li>
<li>A "hyper-rare" event called Echoing Hatred, which throws infinite waves of enemies at you and gives you loot depending on how long you survived</li>
<li>The Horadric Cube, which lets you combine materials and items</li>
<li>Loot filters</li>
<li>And the return of Charms and Sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred launches 28th April on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The other notable Diablo 2 announcements are: Enhanced Terror Zones for the game, and new quality of life features including much-desired loot filters, advanced stash tabs, and a loot-tracking database called the Chronicle, which notes everything you've found and where you found it, thank god.

</p><p>Each of the three games' warlock interpretations are different, by the way, tailored to their various gameplay styles. Diablo 2's is perhaps the most fiddly - I have played it too - particularly in the demon taming skill tree, which lets you dominate demons you face and either use them like pets or consume them for power. It's another layer of micro-management.</p>

              <p>Some of the best-known names in game development are in Las Vegas this week for the annual DICE Summit and one of the first orders of business is <a href="https://kotaku.com/vince-zampella-death-car-crash-tributes-reactions-2000655379">paying tribute to the late Vince Zampella</a>. “His legacy isn’t just in the franchises or awards,” EA Entertainment president Laura Miele said, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/vince-zampella-dice-tribute">an on-the-ground report by <em>Game File</em></a>. “It lives in every studio that chooses trust over fear, craft over shortcuts, people over ego.”</p> <p>Bethesda’s Todd Howard, <em>Metal Gear</em> creator Hideo Kojima, and others appeared via pre-recorded video segments to share memories of and tributes to the man who helped shape and shepherd some of the biggest studios and franchises in gaming. “Vince was the real deal,” Howard said.&nbsp;“I would always seek his advice with every game that I did, or how to maneuver on all that is going on in the industry.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">At DICE, Hideo Kojima revealed that he had many discussions with Vince Zampella about creating a first person Metal Gear Solid game together after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4. <a href="https://t.co/hhjbCqG7T2">pic.twitter.com/hhjbCqG7T2</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021671381382181056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Zampella died tragically and unexpectedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-vince-zampella-battlefield-boss-and-call-of-duty-co-creator-killed-in-car-crash-2000655216">in a car crash last December</a> that also claimed the life of his passenger. He worked on <em>Medal of Honor</em> in the early 2000s before cofounding Infinity Ward to lead<em> Call of Duty</em>. He later cofounded a new studio, Respawn Entertainment, amid an acrimonious split with Activision over studio bonuses. At the time of his death he had become an executive president at EA overseeing <em>Battlefield</em> and other franchises.</p> <h2>The first-person <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> that wasn’t</h2> <p>Kojima, who had his own messy split with publisher Konami back in the 2010s, said Zampella took him on a tour of Respawn while he was in the process of getting <em>Death Stranding</em> maker Kojima Productions off the ground. “He gave me a lot of support and advice,” Kojima said, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/vince-zampella-dice-tribute">according to <em>Game File</em></a>. “He showed me his studio, and I incorporated some of the good aspects into our own studio.”</p>

 <p>Kojima <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021671381382181056">even revealed</a> that the two had at one pointed talked about possibly collaborating on a first-person <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> shooter sometime after <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> was released in 2008. Howard added that he’d previously nominated Zampella for a lifetime achievement award, but he’d refused to accept the honor.</p>

(@bentoDRAWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/bentoDRAWS/status/2021347046469533930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Emre is definitely cut from the Soldier: 76 cloth in that his kit is one of the more straightforward shooter movesets in the game. He’s got a three-round burst rifle on which he can aim down sights without losing any of his movement speed, a side arm that fires explosive rounds and makes him run fast, and an ultimate that lets him fly and rain fire down on his enemies. But he also has frag grenades that bounce around just like Master Chief’s do in </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, and both those and his rifle seem to be immediately activating long-dormant muscle memory for those who haven’t played as Microsoft’s mascot for a bit.</span></p>

   <p><span>If you upgrade his perks accordingly, Emre’s grenade can also stick to enemies, much like the plasma grenades from </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, so the comparisons just keep coming. If you were considering getting into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>after its soft reboot</span></a><span> this week and don’t know who to pick first, Emre might be an easy place to start. There are 50 heroes now with varying degrees of complexity, and starting with more simple heroes is a good way to acclimate yourself to all the chaos. Just don’t panic when you see </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-tether-bob-dva-ultimate-flight-2000666163"><span>a flying cat</span></a><span> carrying a giant German man with a hammer over the battlefield.</span></p>

For starters, you can save up to $139 off across Secretlab's lineup of Titan Evo gaming chairs and Magnus gaming desks, including themed editions from One Piece, Jujutsu Kaisen, Star Wars, Demon Slayer, and more. Secretlab's highest-end gaming chair, the Titan Evo Nanogen, has also ben discounted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these instant discounts, you can get extra tiered savings by hitting a certain order amount for each category. These should be stackable with the instant discounts, although some themes are excluded.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Extra $40 off Chair orders of $850+ with code "<strong>SLEV-MINCPRES26</strong>"</li><li>Extra $50 off Desk orders of $1,489+ with code: "<strong>SLEV-MINDPRES26</strong>"</li><li>$100 off all orders of $1,999+ with code: "<strong>SLEV-MINSWPRES26</strong>"</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Secretlab's Genshin Impact themed gaming chairs gets some love of its own.

Over 70 different styles are currently on sale, with prices ranging from $529 to $634 after a $50 off instant discount across the entire lineup. It's available in small, medium, and large sizes, which is great for smaller people because most gaming chairs sold here in the United States are huge. Discounted upholstery optioins include Neo Hybrid leatherette and SoftWeave Plus fabric.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Signature features include a solid steel frame with aluminum wheelbase, firm and supportive cold-cure foam upholstery, adjustable four-way lumbar system, full length backrest with 165 degrees of recline, full metal 4D armrests with magnetically attached PU cushions, and a memory foam headrest pillow.

In celebration of the event, Secretlab has discounted two Genshin themed chairs inspired by Liyue characters: Xiao, an anemo adeptus, and Ningguang, the geo-wielding Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing (she's basically a royal). This is the first time a Genshin chair has gone on sale, so if you're a Hoyoverse superfan, don't miss it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Secretlab's flagship Titan Evo Nanogen is also on sale</h2></div><div id="210628"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="210628" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGqGP?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Titan Evo Nanogen Edition</a> is Secretlab's highest end chair and is rarely discounted. It normally sells for $799 at Secretlab direct, but both the white and black colors have been discounted by $50 during the Presidents Day Sale.

In our recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretlab-titan-evo-nanogen-edition-review">Titan Evo Nanogen Edition review</a>, Chris Coke wrote that "the Secretlab Titan Evo Nanogen Edition deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise I’ve given...

Even so, these chairs are so cool that they're worth a mention. These chairs showcase one of three iconic Pokémon - Gengar, Pikachu, and Eevee - with ostentatious use of color, patterns, and figures. My personal favorite is the Eevee edition, with its detailed embossing of Eevee's myriad evolutions; it also seems to be the top seller, since it's already on its third wave of preorders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unusual for a collab, Secretlab opted to go with its Softweave Plus fabric instead of leatherette, and I for one am happy with that decision. Fabric ages more gracefully, feels softer, and doesn't stick to your sweaty skin on hot days.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save $30 off the Titan Evo recliner add-on (it's worth it)</h2></div><div id="210629"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="210629" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Secretlab Titan Recliner Add-On</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on sale for the first time, Secretlab's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVkVV?object_uuid=ba24a8d5-2b80-4ea6-b5a4-ff6451792eaf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new recliner add-on</a> is $30 off for Christmas.

The Magnus is a traditional fixed-frame gaming desk while the Magnus Pro ups the ante with practical electric sit-stand functionality. Both desks feature a metal desktop surface, solid steel frame, and clever cable management, but the Magnus Pro has some unique features including a power cable that runs internally inside one of the telescoping legs and an in-line control panel.

Three of the eight chairs in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-gaming-chairs">best gaming chair</a> roundup are Secretlab models. Of all the gaming chairs we covered in our "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-best-gaming-chairs-early-2023-budget-to-best">Budget to Best</a>" roundup video earlier this year, my colleague Akeem Lawanson considered the Secretlab Titan Evo to be the most comfortable. No good chair comes cheap and Secretlab chairs definitely cost a premium, but we think the craftsmanship, materials, and customizability are worth it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
